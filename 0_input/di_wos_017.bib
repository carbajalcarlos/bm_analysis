Abstract = {{KM3NeT is a future deep-sea research infrastructure in the Mediterranean
   Sea that will hold a multi-cubic-kilometre neutrino telescope. Located
   in the northern hemisphere, KM3NeT will be able to observe point-like
   sources of cosmic neutrinos in a region of the sky that includes the
   Galactic Centre. The KM3NeT neutrino telescope will employ a number of
   innovative technologies that are the main subject of this article. It is
   planned to install optical modules of 17 inch diameter that will contain
   31 photomultiplier tubes each. Triggered data will be digitised
   off-shore. The optical modules will be installed on horizontal bar
   structures of about 6m length. Twenty of these structures will be
   stacked to form a vertical tower, interconnected by ropes at 40m
   distances. Fundamental to achieving the required pointing position for
   neutrino astronomy is the knowledge of the relative positions of the
   photomultiplier within 20 cm. Accordingly, a time synchronisation on the
   nanosecond level is required to reconstruct the Cherenkov cones of
   charged particles produced in neutrino interactions. To calibrate the
   complete timing in situ, LED beacons, integrated into the optical
   modules, and laser beacons installed on the sea floor will be used. To
   calibrate the positions of the optical modules on the towers, a system
   of acoustic transceivers at fixed positions on the sea floor and
   receivers along the towers will be used. Data transmission is done over
   a fibre optic network employing multiplexing of up to 80 wavelength over
   individual fibres. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. Selection and/or

Abstract = {{Security breaches are increasing day by day as the technology is
   innovating and opening new doors. There are various counter measures to
   keep a check on them and one such method is the watermarking. Region
   based watermarking is the approach where an important area of the
   original image is selected to hide the secret information. This is done
   to make the watermarking more robust to the various attacks and retain
   the commercial value of the image as any damage to this region would
   result in deterioration of the value of the image. One such quad tree
   based approach to select the region of interest (ROI) and then to
   utilize the properties of the singular value decomposition (SVD)
   transform to hide the watermark is being proposed here. The robustness
   of the methodology against the various attacks is validated by the
   experimental results.}},

   pedagogical knowledge and lifelong learning. In general, the result
   shows there is significant differences among factors stated above which
   will upgrade the potential of school teachers' and academics life-long
   learning process and upgrading teaching skills and be competitive with
   their peers from other sectors. The usage of digital technology in the
   teacher training institutes, school and university ICT laboratory by
   enhancing the Regional teachers' and academics education learning

Abstract = {{The claim is often made that games, especially serious games, support
   learning processes but evidence to support this assertion is frequently
   weak. Learning theories are seldom explicitly utilized in the design of
   digital games and thus tension arises when a multidisciplinary team
   works together towards designing a successful serious game. Game
   designers, technology developers and educational scientists may share a
   common aim to create a successful digital game, but often their thoughts
   on how this might be achieved differ significantly.
   For the last seven years we have been designing, developing, testing and
   analyzing digital games for learning which have dealt with a variety of
   topics including history, biodiversity and innovation. Our research has
   been supported by long running investigations into the areas of game
   research and educational sciences and has led us to conclude that a
   subtle, yet very relevant fact, has not been carefully analyzed in
   digital games for learning namely whether a game targets a global
   audience or a particular context. Our explorations focus on the design
   of games that are intentionally anchored in the player's context and
   thus tied to a specific location. The evidence gathered indicates that
   it is viable to bridge the gap between formal and informal learning
   experiences of players and designers when the game is anchored in a
   specific context. Unfortunately, the term context is often misused and
   this makes it difficult to understand what we mean by it, or what
   elements we should consider when designing games in and for a context.
   In this workshop our aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the term
   context.
   The game workshop is built upon two assumptions: (i) everybody has
   played games and (ii) potentially everybody has the ability to design
   games. We attempt to achieve the workshop's aim by promoting active
   discussions and sharing material relevant to the topic. Participants are
   also encouraged to design games anchored in a specific context utilizing
   the tools available. Our expectation is that after the workshop the
   participants would have gained a deeper insight into the importance of
   considering the role of context in their designs. We also aim to
   summarize our discussions and learning experiences from the workshop in
   an article. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. Selection

Abstract = {{This article reports on a survey of more than 2,300 students and 250
   staff members conducted at the University of Tasmania as part of a wider
   review of e-learning practice, demand and capacity which aims to improve
   planning, decision-making and the quality of the online experience of
   students and staff. Data was collected on access to technology,
   technology usage patterns, and experiences with technology at
   university. Respondents were also asked for comments on their
   experiences. Results from the quantitative component are in line with
   findings from similar recent surveys: high penetration of laptops, wide
   access to broadband Internet at home, and usage patterns concentrated
   strongly around common web activities. Differences in usage profiles of
   some applications can be explained by the difference in lifestyles of
   students and staff. The two cohorts also exhibit different attitudes
   towards technology as a result of their different relationship with it
   in the context of their use of it at university. Many indicated pathways
   and solutions to imbalances in demand and supply are straightforward and
   pragmatic. Support of teaching staff is considered crucially important
   to advancing broader and more effective use of technology at the
   university.}},

   heterogeneous structures consisted of several zones with different
   mechanical properties. During the loading, these zones are showing
   non-uniform mechanical behavior. In the heat affected zones is
   particularly complicated to monitor mechanical properties due to small
   dimensions, therefore HAZ mechanical properties were most often
   estimated through hardness testing, microstructure etc. The aim of the
   experiment is to assess the possibility of using Digital Image
   Correlation method in determining local tensile properties of HAZ.
   Testing was performed using 3D optical measuring system. Plates made of
   S235 were butt welded using MAG welding process for specimen
   preparation. Tensile testing of specimen characterized heterogeneous
   strain field and variable strain values in the monitored HAZ, indicating
   that DIC method is promising tool for precise local strain analysis of

   Serbia): Experimental and Numerical Analysis of Local Mechanical
   Properties of Globe Valve Housing One of the most widely used industrial
   valves is globe valve. Due to wide industrial application, the valve is
   subjected to various types of loads - static, dynamic, thermal etc.
   which causes valve housing failures. Based on previous experiences and
   research, valve housing failure is expected in the areas of high stress
   concentration, such as high geometrical discontinuity. This paper is
   focused to investigate the possibility to analyze local strain fields of
   geometrically complex globe valve housing subjected to internal pressure
   using non-contact 3D optical deformation analysis in order to verify
   numerical model. Experimental system consists of cameras for 3D
   displacement and strain analysis and software Aramis. Using the Finite
   Element Method (FEM), numerical model subjected to different loads was
   analyzed. It is found that the predictions from the model agree well
   with experimental results as the result differences between two methods
   in the area of the highest strain values vary 30 \% and in the spherical
   and cylindrical parts result variation is 14.8 \%. Experimental and
   numerical results demonstrate that the experimental method is adequate
   for solving geometrically complex problems and determining local

Abstract = {{Internet provides new perspectives within the social, financial and
   cultural mountainous development. In Greece, winter tourism is a fast
   growing sector and there are 23 organised skiing centres in mountainous
   forest areas. Most of them have a website in the Internet in various
   levels of innovative technologies adoption. This paper assesses skiing
   centres websites in Greece regarding the adoption of innovative network
   and Internet technologies and e-marketing services and classifies them
   in groups. Initially, websites are analysed qualitatively and
   quantitatively according to criteria described, such as innovative
   network technology incorporation, e-marketing functions, interactivity
   and various e-services provision. Then, the websites are classified in 3
   groups according to the criteria they accomplish. The `optimum group 1',
   represents 30\% and provides enhanced e-marketing services through
   advanced online multimedia digital services that allow conducting online
   transactions, such as online booking system for accommodations,
   e-ticketing, newsletters, social media, etc. The `lagging group 3'
   represents 48\%, being information platforms without online
   functionalities only seeking in a web presence. It is imperative that
   websites in group 2 and group 3 should further evolve in network
   services and e-marketing features and take advantage of innovative
   technologies, as to become more compatible.}},

Abstract = {{The increased digitisation of cultural collections, and their
   availability on the World Wide Web, has made access to these valuable
   documents much easier than ever before. However, despite the increased
   availability of access to cultural archives, curators still struggle to
   instigate and enhance engagement with these resources. The CULTURA
   project is actively addressing this issue through the development of a
   metadata-driven personalisation environment for navigating cultural
   collections and instigating collaborations. The corpus agnostic CULTURA
   environment also supports a full spectrum of users: ranging from
   professional researchers seeking patterns in the data and trying to
   answer complex queries; to interested members of the public who need
   help navigating a vast collection of resources. This paper discusses the
   state of the art in this area and the various innovative approaches used
   in the CULTURA project, with a special focus on how the underlying
   metadata helps facilitate its semantically rich environment.}},

Abstract = {{The continued growth of multimedia traffic pushes access network
   operators to further boost performance over their copper infrastructure
   network. As a result, digital subscriber line technology has evolved
   substantially. Field and lab trials have proven the recent innovations,
   such as cross talk cancellation and phantom mode transmission, can push
   data rates of VDSL2 higher than 100 Mb/s on a single twisted pair and
   300 Mb/s on two pairs. In ITU-T Q4, a new access technology to provide
   aggregate data rates in the range of 500 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s per copper loop
   of up to a few hundred meters is being defined under the G.fast project.
   G.fast enable the continued cost-effective deployment of fiber in the
   access network. In this paper, we give an overview if some key
   challenges this new access technology needs to overcome. By taking into
   account the expected access network topology, we give guidelines for the

Abstract = {{Purpose - In the past, regions competed for the attraction of large
   physical infrastructures, which in their point of view would make them
   competitive in face of others. Today, the success of individuals,
   organizations and territories depends on the mobilization of intangible
   assets. As they enter themselves in the knowledge era, territories are
   not doing more than answering to the digital economy settled on the
   planet and that is reinforced by strategic options being made by states.
   Knowledge is an indispensable resource for innovation, supporting
   competitive advantage at a time when innovation cycles are becoming
   increasingly shorter. Therefore, knowledge is strategic to the survival
   of society in general and to territories in particular and its
   management becomes mandatory also at this level. This work aims at
   bringing the territory to the central stage of knowledge research, by
   discussing current theories dealing with micro, meso and macro levels
   and proposing a first approach to an integrative model of knowledge
   management.
   Design/methodology/approach The study methodology encompasses four
   steps. First, we review concepts in the area of Operations Management
   relevant to Knowledge Management research. Then we analyze models of
   intellectual capital and learning interactions and explore the
   mechanisms of knowledge creation at the individual and organizational
   level. Using an operations management approach we then investigate
   whether knowledge management at the territorial level incorporates
   existing mechanisms at both individual and organizational level. Finally
   we propose an integrative model of knowledge management linking the
   micro, meso and macro levels.
   Originality/value - Our work shows that territories can be modelled as
   value networks, consisting of several knowledge value chains where
   knowledge comes not only as a support to the processes, but as an
   integral part of the same, and exposes intra and inter-levels value
   creation processes. People are the essence of the network because it is
   in them that knowledge resides and it is through them that it is spread,
   becoming embedded in the different groups, local or not, they belong to.
   Organizations benefit from the knowledge of individuals, redirecting it
   within their goals and incorporating it into the processes and the
   networks to which they belong, generating new knowledge for themselves,
   for individuals and for the territory in general. The territory consists
   of an intricate mesh of individuals and organizations that receive their
   knowledge and that seeks to maximize it, in order to start new cycles in
   which new knowledge is made available to various actors: individuals,
   organizations and territory.
   Practical implications - Territories face challenges of assertion and
   integration into economic and social networks, locally and globally.
   They should be able to state as entities with their own dynamics,
   mobilizing local resources and agents, combining actors and developing
   economic and social models and pathways, ensuring the sustainability of
   its development. The key to economic grow and sustainability is the
   balanced interaction of economic, social, technological and cultural
   dimensions of society. Economy and territories are increasingly
   characterized by flows of information and knowledge that is dispersed in
   organizations and society being simultaneously raw material and output.
   Therefore, it is fundamental to understand how to manage the processes
   of knowledge creation, transfer and activation at the micro, meso and

Abstract = {{The Linked Open Data project provides a new publishing paradigm for
   creating machine readable and structured data on the Web. Currently, the
   significant presence of data sets describing scholarly publications in
   the Linked Data cloud underpins the importance of Linked Data for the
   scientific community and for the open access movement. However, these
   semantically rich datasets need to be exploited and linked with real
   time applications. In the project we report on this. We have exploited
   numerous scholarly datasets and have created semantic links to papers in
   an online journal, particularly Journal of Universal Computer Science
   (J.UCS). The J.UCS plays an important part in the computer science
   publishing community and provides a number of innovative features and
   datasets to its web users. However, the legacy HTML format in which
   these features are made available makes it difficult for machines to
   understand and query. Keeping in mind the impressive benefits of the
   Linked Open Data project, this paper presents an approach to convert
   J.UCS legacy HTML data from its current form to machine understandable
   format (RDF). It also interlinks this data with other important Linked
   Data resources. The approach developed has successfully disambiguated
   and interlinked J.UCS authors and publications datasets with DBpedia,
   DBLP, CiteULike and faceted DBLP. Additionally, triplified and
   interlinked datasets are made available to the scientific and semantic
   web community for downloading and posing SPARQL queries. This
   semantically linked dataset can further be used by researchers and
   semantic agents to identify semantic associations, to build inferencing
   systems, and to extract useful knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of information and communication technology (ICT) trend
   for worldwide individuals, social life becomes digital and portable
   consumer electronic devices (PCED) powered by conventional power supply
   from batteries have been evolving through miniaturization and various
   function integration. Thermoelectric generators (TEG) were hypothesized
   for its potential role of battery charger to serve the shining PCED
   market. Hence, this paper, mainly focusing at the metropolitan market in
   Thailand, aimed to conduct architectural innovation foresight and to
   develop scenarios on potential exploitation approach of PCED battery
   power supply with TEG charger converting power from ambient heat source
   adjacent to individual's daily life. After technical review and
   assessment for TEG potential and battery aspect, the business research
   was conducted to analyze PCED consumer behavior for their PCED
   utilization pattern, power supply lack problems, and encountering heat
   sources/sinks in 3 modes: daily life, work, and leisure hobbies. Based
   on the secondary data analysis from literature and National Statistical
   Office of Thailand, quantitative analysis was applied using the cluster
   probability sampling methodology, statistically, with the sample size of
   400 at 0.05 level of significance. In addition, the qualitative analysis
   was conducted to emphasize the rationale of consumer's behavior using
   in-depth qualitative interview. Scenario planning technique was also
   used to generate technological and market trend foresight. Innovation
   field and potential scenario for matching technology with market was
   proposed in this paper. The ingredient for successful commercialization
   of battery power supply with TEG charger for PCED market consists of 5
   factors as follows: (1) PCED characteristic, (2) potential ambient heat
   sources/sinks, (3) battery module, (4) power management module, and the
   final jigsaw (5) characteristic and adequate arrangement of TEG modules.
   The foresight outcome for the potential innovations represents a case
   study in the pilot commercialization of TEG technology for some
   interesting niche markets in metropolitan area of Thailand, and, thus,
   can be the clue for product development related to TEG for market-driven
   application in other similar requirement conditions and contexts as
   well.}},

Abstract = {{The high level of accumulated expertise by ULIS and CEA/LETI on uncooled
   microbolometers made from amorphous silicon enables ULIS to develop VGA
   IRFPA formats with 17 mu m pixel-pitch to enable the development of
   small power, small weight (SWAP) and high performance IR systems. ROIC
   architecture will be described where innovations are widely on-chip
   implemented to enable an easier operation by the user. The detector
   configuration (integration time, windowing, gain, scanning direction
   ...), is driven by a standard (IC)-C-2 link. Like most of the visible
   arrays, the detector adopts the HSYNC/VSYNC free-run mode of operation
   driven with only one master clock (MC) supplied to the ROIC which feeds
   back pixel, line and frame synchronizations. On-chip PROM memory for
   customer operational condition storage is available for detector
   characteristics.
   Low power consumption has been taken into account and less than 60 mW is
   possible in analog mode at 60 Hz and < 175 mW in digital mode (14 bits).
   A wide electrical dynamic range (2.4V) is maintained despite the use of
   advanced CMOS node. The specific appeal of this unit lies in the high
   uniformity and easy operation it provides. The reduction of the
   pixel-pitch turns this TEC-less 1/4 VGA array into a product well
   adapted for high resolution and compact systems.
   NETD of 35 mK and thermal time constant of 10 ms have been measured
   leading to 350 mK. ms figure of merit. We insist on NETD trade-off with
   wide thermal dynamic range, as well as the high characteristics
   uniformity and pixel operability, achieved thanks to the mastering of
   the amorphous silicon technology coupled with the ROIC design. This
   technology node associated with advanced packaging technique, paves the
   way to compact low power system.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The current study seeks to describe and analyze academic
   library websites in the years 2000 and 2010, as they appear both in the
   Internet Archive and in current library websites.
   Design/methodology/approach - A content analysis of 31 academic
   libraries homepages which were selected from the ACRL accredited LIS
   schools was conducted.
   Findings - Findings reveal that the content of academic library websites
   in the years 2000 and 2010 has much changed over the ten years,
   presenting an increasing use of e-journals and Web 2.0 applications, as
   well as a focus on library users, and a great use of graphics in
   websites.
   Practical implications - The comparison documented in the paper should
   prove very interesting and important to librarians, information
   scientists, US scholars and students, presenting trends, changes and
   innovations that have occurred within the scope of academic libraries
   over the last ten years.
   Originality/value - This study presents a yet unexplored dimension: the
   comparison, focusing especially on content, of academic library websites
   over a decade as they appear in the Internet Archive in 2000 and in the
   present library website in 2010.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{777-795}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to review the literature dealing with e-books
   to identify trends.
   Design/methodology/approach - The review is based on the literature
   published during January to December 2010. For this purpose, literature
   on e-books was searched and retrieved from LISA, LISTA, Emerald, Science
   Direct and J-store. E-books, electronic books, digital books, e-book
   reader, were the keywords used for searching the literature in these
   databases. The literature is analyzed and reviewed under various broad
   categories. Most of the literature reviewed is in English. Non-English
   literature reported in the LISA is also considered.
   Findings - In spite of the unconcluded debate of print versus
   electronic, popularity of e-books is increasing and thereby the e-book
   market is growing at a very fast pace. User friendliness, cost,
   portability are some of the reasons for the increased use of e-books.
   Varieties of e-book readers are produced with different features.
   Copyright and DRM are the challenging issues. New e-book pricing models
   are evolving with their own merits and demerits. Libraries are carrying
   out e-book usage studies and are adopting innovative practices to
   promote e-books.
   Practical implications - The paper is useful for LIS researchers,
   practitioners, e-book publishers and aggregators for understanding
   current trends and for framing prospective policies.
   Originality/value - The paper identifies trends based on published
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper seeks to make people aware of the condition of
   Chinese cultural information resources sharing through the case of the
   National Cultural Information Resources Sharing Project (NCIRSP). The
   paper seeks to provide an overview of NCIRSP, and summarize its
   achievements.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper first indicates that cultural
   information resources sharing is a kind of special resources sharing,
   and NCIRSP in China is a good example of the realization of this kind of
   resources sharing. The author introduces NCIRSP in general, and analyzes
   the operation and its achievements. The author considers that there are
   some problems which exist in the practice of NCIRSP which will hinder
   its development and proposes measures to solve those problems.
   Findings - NCIRSP is a project which is advanced by the Chinese
   government as well as governments at other levels, which means the
   project has a strong organization and powerful support. The operation of
   NCIRSP is made up by four aspects: the network, the construction of
   digital resources, the implementation of technology, and the websites of
   services. These four aspects determine the effective operation of NCIRSP
   and promote the project to make great achievements. Meanwhile, there are
   problems which hinder NCIRSP from developing further, including the
   unbalanced collection of cultural information resources in various
   areas, the scattered storage of resources, and the absence of a
   sophisticated training mechanism for professionals engaged in the
   project. Measures to solve the problems are suggested.
   Originality/value - NCIRSP is an innovative project supported by the
   Government of China, even though it is rarely known about by people
   outside China. This paper introduces NCIRSP in detail, and makes people
   aware of the situation of cultural information resources sharing in
   China.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to the recent technological advances, a large variety of image
   data is at our disposal with variable geometric, radiometric and
   temporal resolution. In many applications the processing of such images
   needs high performance computing techniques in order to deliver timely
   responses e. g. for rapid decisions or real-time actions. Thus, parallel
   or distributed computing methods, Digital Signal Processor (DSP)
   architectures, Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) programming and
   Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices have become essential tools
   for the challenging issue of processing large amount of geo-data. The
   article focuses on the processing and registration of large datasets of
   terrestrial and aerial images for 3D reconstruction, diagnostic purposes
   and monitoring of the environment. For the image alignment procedure,
   sets of corresponding feature points need to be automatically extracted
   in order to successively compute the geometric transformation that
   aligns the data. The feature extraction and matching are ones of the
   most computationally demanding operations in the processing chain thus,
   a great degree of automation and speed is mandatory. The details of the
   implemented operations (named LARES) exploiting parallel architectures
   and GPU are thus presented. The innovative aspects of the implementation
   are (i) the effectiveness on a large variety of unorganized and complex
   datasets, (ii) capability to work with high-resolution images and (iii)
   the speed of the computations. Examples and comparisons with standard
   CPU processing are also reported and commented.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to present an integrated two-stage
   concept for level of service estimation at traffic signals in an urban
   road network based on innovative traffic data services and collection
   techniques. The paper starts with a brief summary of the background of
   performance measures and levels of service for traffic signals and of
   innovative data collection techniques (Automatic Number Plate
   Recognition, Bluetooth-and GPS-tracking) and traffic data providers.
   The first stage of the concept employs the data provided by most traffic
   data service providers, i.e. the average travel speed on all Traffic
   Message Channel locations or links of the network. Firstly, every speed
   is assigned to its associated level of service. Secondly, a digital map
   is augmented with this information which allows for a quick and
   demonstrative visual analysis. Traffic Message Channel locations or
   links with low level of service are selected for further investigations
   in the next stage.
   The second stage employs Automatic Number Plate Recognition and
   GPS-tracking for detailed LOS estimation. The former yields empiric
   average travel speeds, which are used to validate the average travel
   speeds obtained from the traffic data service provider. The latter
   yields approach delays, which, again, can be assigned to their
   associated level of service. The developed concept was applied
   successfully in a real-world case study on the urban road network of
   Hannover, Germany. It can be stated that all data sources lead to
   notably similar results, especially in the second stage, where both data
   sources (traffic data service provider and GPS-tracking) lead to
   identical level of service at six out of seven approaches. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Recently, widespread use of digital speech communication has spawned a
   multitude of Voice over IP (VoIP) applications. These applications
   require the ability to identify speakers in real time. One of the
   challenges in accurate speaker recognition is the inability to detect
   anomalies in network traffic generated by attacks on VoIP applications.
   This paper presents L2E, an innovative approach to detect anomalies in
   network traffic for accurate speaker recognition. The L2E method is
   capable of online speaker recognition from live packet streams of voice
   packets by performing fast classification over a defined subset of the
   features available in each voice packet. The experimental results show
   that L2E is highly scalable and accurate in detecting a wide range of
   anomalies in network traffic.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative low-cost and higher than conventional angular resolution
   digital beamforming (DBF) array radar system is proposed and introduced
   in this paper. The proposed DBF radar system uses only one set of
   transceiver plus an additional microwave switch. Compared with
   conventional configurations with N sets of expensive microwave digital
   transceivers, the proposed concept can drastically reduce the system
   cost. Besides, we also propose an innovative DBF scheme that has
   narrower beamwidth the the conventional one-way or two-way beamforming
   configurations. The total system cost reduction factor is up to 2 times
   the number of array elements.}},

Abstract = {{Higher fault current levels due to additional interconnections to the
   power system have created an urgent need to limit fault current to
   manageable and safe values. Fault current limiters offer a unique
   solution to judiciously mitigate fault current, while maintaining the
   system's robustness, reliability, and stability. These circumstances
   prompted Southern California Edison (SCE) to provide a test bed to
   validate an innovative saturable core fault current limiter and obtain
   operating and maintenance experience. This demonstration project became
   the first high temperature superconducting fault current limiter
   installation in commercial service in the United States. This paper
   describes the analysis performed to assess fault current reduction by
   this unit during the evolution of a multiple fault event. SCE performed
   simulations using dynamic models for the fault current limiter and the
   power network. The results are compared against high resolution data
   recorded during the multiple fault and against the expected design
   values.}},

Abstract = {{We look back on two years of experience with the laboratory MCAO testbed
   for the GREGOR solar telescope. GREGOR's MCAO features four adaptive
   mirrors, i.e. one tip-tilt mirror, and three DMs to compensate for
   turbulence around 0 km, 5 km, and 15.5 km above ground. Two different
   Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor units are used for wavefront tomography.
   A sensor with a narrow field of view and smaller subapertures is
   dedicated to high-order aberrations on the optical axis. This sensor
   directly follows the pupil plane DM and does not see the high-altitude
   DMs. The second sensor features larger subapertures and 19 guide regions
   spread over a wide field of view for off-axis wavefront sensing. We show
   that high-altitude DMs cause rapidly changing pupil distortions and thus
   misregistration, which renders the interaction of a pupil-plane DM and a
   subsequent wavefront sensor non-linear.
   We rewrote the control software for cleaner and more flexible code, and
   we switched to modal wavefront reconstruction from direct
   reconstruction. The original digital interfacing of the DMs high-voltage
   electronics didn't prove to be reliable. Thus, we developed a new
   interface board that is based on CameraLink/ChannelLink technology to
   transmit the DM commands from the control computer.
   In this paper we present the innovations and some of the first
   experimental performance measurements with two DMs. One DM failed before
   scientific grade data was recorded with three DMs. This DM will be
   replaced soon. We conclude that GREGOR's MCAO system is now ready for
   first on-sky tests at the telescope.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel image annotation framework for domains with
   large numbers of images. Automatic image annotation is such a domain, by
   which a computer system automatically assigns metadata in the form of
   captioning or keywords to a digital image. This application of computer
   vision method is used in image retrieval system to organize and locate
   images of interest from a database. Many techniques have been proposed
   for image annotation in the last decade that has given realistic
   performance on standard datasets. In this work, we introduce an
   innovative hybrid model for image annotation that treats annotation as a
   retrieval problem. The proposed technique utilizes low level image
   features and a simple combination of basic distances using JEC to find
   the nearest neighbors of a given image; the keywords are then assigned
   using SVM approach which aims to explore the combination of three
   different methods. First, the initial annotation of the data using flat
   wise and axis wise methods, and that takes the hierarchy into
   consideration by classifying consecutively its instances through
   position wise method. Finally, we make use of pair wise majority voting
   between methods by simply summing strings in order to make a final
   annotation. The result of the proposed technique shows that this
   technique outperforms the current state of art methods on the normal
   datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave holography is a well-established technique for mapping surface
   errors of large reflector antennas, particularly those designed to
   operate at high frequencies.
   We present here a holography system based on the interferometric method
   for mapping the primary reflector surface of the Sardinia Radio
   Telescope (SRT). SRT is a new 64-m-diameter antenna located in Sardinia,
   Italy, equipped with an active surface and designed to operate up to 115
   GHz.
   The system consists mainly of two radio frequency low-noise coherent
   channels, designed to receive Ku-band digital TV signals from
   geostationary satellites. Two commercial prime focus low-noise block
   converters are installed on the radio telescope under test and on a
   small reference antenna, respectively. Then the signals are amplified,
   filtered and down-converted to baseband. An innovative digital back-end
   based on FPGA technology has been implemented to digitize two 5 MHz-band
   signals and calculate their cross-correlation in real-time. This is
   carried out by using a 16-bit resolution ADCs and a FPGA reaching very
   large amplitude dynamic range and reducing post-processing time. The
   final holography data analysis is performed by CLIC data reduction
   software developed within the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique
   (IRAM, Grenoble, France).
   The system was successfully tested during several holography measurement
   campaigns, recently performed at the Medicina 32-m radio telescope. Two
   65-by-65 maps, using an on-the-fly raster scan with on-source phase
   calibration, were performed pointing the radio telescope at 38 degrees
   elevation towards EUTELSAT 7A satellite. The high SNR (greater than 60
   dB) and the good phase stability led to get an accuracy on the surface
   error maps better than 150 mu m RMS.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to examine how the internet both precipitated
   and facilitated significant shifts for academic libraries in the kinds
   of services they provide, and the ways in which they provide access to
   content. It aims to view this evolution from the perspective of one
   academic library in an institution that has been at the center of
   intemet and technology development worldwide for over 30 years, the
   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
   Design/methodology/approach - The first 30 years of the internet in
   libraries are explored in decade time segments. Each of the three
   decades is characterized by significant and unique internet
   developments. Key intemet-based innovations in libraries are explored,
   in the areas of service, digital libraries, search and discovery. The
   reasons for the relative impact of these innovations are explored and
   discussed.
   Findings - The intemet is both foundation and incubator for myriad new
   social, technical, organizational and legal constructs, including policy
   and best practices, governance, intellectual property, whole new
   categories of services, industries, and areas of research. Since diverse
   stakeholders can participate with little or no investment, the pace of
   growth and innovation is unpredictable. This pace is sustained over
   time, occurring on multiple levels. For this reason, the intemet does
   not ``grow{''} simply in one direction,. such as exponential user
   growth, or the systematic installation of infrastructure. In the
   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the intemet has
   fundamentally altered, and continues to enable significant shifts in the
   direction of the library's programs, services and resources.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to a group of invited papers
   that addresses the first 30 years of the intemet in libraries.}},

Abstract = {{The article focuses on innovations in city museums in recent years. By
   focusing on the user as opposed to the collection - the changes in city
   museums have an influence on the statute of the museum, considerably
   altering its mission. Going so far as to build up databases and digital
   displays, the museum increasingly intersects its functions with those of
   an archive which (with particular regard to architectural materials) now
   proposes exhibitive forms of fruition. The most extreme consequences of
   this phenomenon is the online museum, with numerous peculiar aspects: it
   is flexible (its collection can grow without problems, and be presented
   in different forms), democratic, interactive and inexpensive, and it
   allows flows of information in several directions. The comparison with
   the contemporary city remains the fundamental, hinging element, as
   several intuitions have already shown in the past.}},

Abstract = {{Today isothermal precision molding of imaging glass optics has become a
   widely applied and integrated production technology in the optical
   industry. Especially in consumer electronics (e. g. digital cameras,
   mobile phones, Blu-ray) a lot of optical systems contain rotationally
   symmetrical aspherical lenses produced by precision glass molding. But
   due to higher demands on complexity and miniaturization of optical
   elements the established process chain for precision glass molding is
   not sufficient enough. Wafer based molding processes for glass optics
   manufacturing become more and more interesting for mobile phone
   applications. Also cylindrical lens arrays can be used in high power
   laser systems. The usage of unsymmetrical free-form optics allows an
   increase of efficiency in optical laser systems.
   Aixtooling is working on different aspects in the fields of mold
   manufacturing technologies and molding processes for extremely high
   complex optical components. In terms of array molding technologies,
   Aixtooling has developed a manufacturing technology for the
   ultra-precision machining of carbide molds together with European
   partners. The development covers the machining of multi lens arrays as
   well as cylindrical lens arrays. The biggest challenge is the molding of
   complex free-form optics having no symmetrical axis. A comprehensive
   CAD/CAM data management along the entire process chain is essential to
   reach high accuracies on the molded lenses. Within a national funded
   project Aixtooling is working on a consistent data handling procedure in
   the process chain for precision molding of free-form optics.}},

Abstract = {{It is a truism that in the architecture of the old transmission system
   fault tolerance is achieved by redundancy which is only matched by a
   less fault tolerant distribution side. Frequent outages are becoming
   every where more of a rule rather than an exception. The Ultimate Smart
   Grid in this context becomes a vision for the future. As per EPRI
   estimate there is a preponderating 4 to 1 benefit from a changeover to
   smart grids {[}1]. Whereas the 21st century world is in dire need, of
   digital quality power supply, with Flexible AC Transmission systems
   {[}FACTS] and/or superconducting synchronous condensers capable of
   providing instantaneous voltage support to reduce the sags, and super
   conducting fault current limiters to correct the depressions created by
   transmission-system-faults, in combination with synchronous switching to
   take care of transient over-voltages, at the transmission level, high
   speed transfer switches capable of removing disturbed sources and
   replacing them with clean back up supplies and an array of innovations
   like dynamic voltage restorers, DER{[}Distributed Energy Resource] and
   micro grids to provide voltage support buffering are needed at the
   distribution side of electric power infrastructure, it is a fact that
   the current obsolescent electrical infrastructure remains deplorably
   bogged down by an antiquated mid-20th century technology.
   One of the most fundamental of electric functions is getting electricity
   from the point of generation to the point of use and today's need is to
   make the transition from the distribution system of today to the grid of
   the future, Smart energy is the application of digital information
   technology to optimize electrical power system and SG is the product of
   smart energy technology to electrical power delivery and generation.
   Smart energy technologies are going to transform the power network into
   a SG capable of meeting 21st century economic, energy security,
   reliability and integrating these two prime requirements with renewable
   energy sources. To that end, the conventional grids which are by today's
   standards almost obsolete, have to be reshaped and re-engineered to
   include digital enhancements appropriate for the vision of a Smart Grid.
   The realization of smart grid will involve integration of new
   technologies at all levels of grid operation and control. Such a concept
   of Smart grid transformation would improve overall energy efficiency by
   implementing intelligent and advanced control functions that would
   enable greater interaction between grid and the consumer. This paper
   outlines in a nutshell the concept \& characteristics of smart grid with
   emphasis on various key aspects involved in the modernization of the
   present day electric grid with respect to generation, transmission and
   distribution in addition to the new challenges, and requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are innovative circuit
   primitives whose digital output strictly depend on the manufacture
   random physical variations introduced during the fabrication process of
   integrated circuits. In this paper we discuss the statistical
   characterization of a simple PUF module based on ring oscillators to
   implement challenge-response FPGA authentication. Differently from other
   approaches, in our proposed solution the challenge bits play a role in
   changing the time dynamics involved in the chip response measurement.
   The experimental results show that considering proper values for the
   challenge bits the repeatability error rate is smaller than 5\% at given
   chip temperature and supply voltage, obtaining a PUF module working with
   4 challenge bits whereas exhibiting an high sensitivity to the
   manufacture random physical variations. The obtained results are
   comparable to that ones presented for other solutions, with a limited
   consumption of hardware resources.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays Infrared Thermography (IRT) is a fundamental tool for
   inspection of buildings and identification of anomalies. However, there
   is a lack of commercial software packages able to perform the analysis
   of differential temperature gradients. This paper presents an innovative
   GIS-based methodology aimed at speeding up recognition of thermal
   anomalies revealing finishing damages like detachments. In particular,
   the developed procedure can be applied to different raster products like
   thermographic mosaics, orthophotos, rectified images, etc. The major
   advantage is the possibility of doing thermal analysis on `hermographic
   orthophotos', overlaying the metric content of traditional orthophotos
   but preserving the temperature registered during the IRT survey. To
   obtain `hermographic orthophotos' a photogrammetric methodology aimed at
   mapping IR thermal images onto 3D models created with terrestrial laser
   scanning technology was developed. Once the IRT images are mapped, the
   textured digital model of the facade is used to generate an orthophoto
   and processed in a GIS environment to support new thermal analysis. The
   image processing pipeline will be illustrated starting from data
   generation up to visualization and management. Moreover, real case
   studies for on-going restoration projects will be illustrated and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, with rapidly innovated technology, a mobile device used only
   as an information management tool and a communication gear could not
   meet users' basic requirement. It must be able to play as entertainment
   equipment as well. Android is a Linux based software development
   platform mainly used for the mobile devices and provides a media
   framework to integrate all the software modules and device drivers,
   including information, communication, and entertainment technologies,
   and to congregate and simplify the variety of developing procedures for
   multimedia applications. Although this media framework is very suitable
   for the video and audio decoding, it is not sufficient for the digital
   video broadcast for Terrestrial (DVB-T) application due to lack of the
   protocol support of digital television from the Android. This paper
   offers a mechanism to realize the DVB-T technology on the Android
   platform with a heterogeneous multi-core system. To consider the
   computing capability of each core and limited memory space in mobile
   devices, further task assignments between cores to maximize its
   efficiency and analyses for video buffer size are also presented. In
   this paper, the performance achieves DVB-T real-time decoding and A/V
   synchronization with one ARM core (204 MHz) and dual PACDSPs (204 MHz).}},

Abstract = {{Digital watermarking is an innovative technique for intellectual

Title = {{Improved Techniques for Mammographic Image Compression using Balanced
   Multiwavelet Block Tree Coding}},
Journal = {{IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{The recent innovation in digital medical imaging techniques requires the
   development of high-performance storage and image transmission systems.
   The biggest problem in digital technology is voluminous amount of data
   generated. For example, a digital mammographic image of size 1024x1024
   pixels with 8 bits per pixel requires 8.3 Mb for storing it in original
   form. Researchers in several studies have demonstrated the need for high
   rate compression algorithms for medical imaging applications. But the
   recently reported image compression results indicate that Peak
   Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is outperformed by scalar wavelets.
   However, it often fails to capture high-frequency information
   accurately. Interestingly, multiwavelet preserves high-frequency
   information in mammographic image and provides good energy compaction.
   The challenge still remains as to how one can better represent the
   signal for achieving the best compression. This paper proposes a
   solution to the above open problems using balanced multiwavelet-based
   image compression. The proposed scheme presents combination of two novel
   ideas: A coefficient reorganization suitable to balanced multiwavelet
   decomposition is used to regain the parent-child relationship. A block
   tree coding is used for compression and reconstruction of multiwavelet
   transformed image and thus the proposed scheme is called as Multiwavelet
   Block Tree Coding (MBTC). This approach yields the advantages of high
   energy compaction, PSNR, and a less number of bits for encoding.
   Balanced multiwavelet-based compression, with MBTC applied to a set of
   four mammographic images, achieves an average PSNR of 43.245 dB against
   the existing Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) algorithm
   which on an average achieves only 34.181 dB for 0.5 bpp bit rate and
   MBTC requires encoding bits of 45.565 less than SPIHT encoding.}},

   insights about this powerful synergy in the field of digitized pathology
   as a brand new topic in which, like currently for satellite imaging, the
   amount of raw data and high-level concepts to handle give no other
   choice but to innovate about the low-level image image processing
   machine and the knowledge modeling framework integration. Above all, the
   end-user who is most of the time naive about signal, image and
   algorithmic issues can thence play the key role in the design of such
   enhanced vision system.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{566-589}},
Abstract = {{The nature of born global firms which from inception, seek to derive
   significant competitive advantage from the use of resources and the
   sales of outputs in multiple countries remains poorly understood. Given
   the lack of resources which born globals tend to have compared with
   larger international competitors the importance of social capital and
   network ties in addressing their liabilities of newness and smallness
   have received some attention. However, how these network ties actually
   operate and the nuances inside of these networks are as yet not fully
   understood. This paper seeks to address this knowledge gap by attempting
   to unpack the black box of the social networks and connectors which born
   globals draw upon in their internationalisation efforts. Based on a
   study of the indigenous Irish digital, film and TV production industry,
   our research points to a suite of both weak and strong connectors which
   facilitate the internationalisation of the firms in our sample.}},

   greatest part in determining the degrees to which there will be change
   in the future. In considerations of cost, technical improvements
   affecting the overall capability, the influence of demand, and aspects
   affecting timing, this forward-looking chapter delimits what is still
   undefinable. The potential for change is charted in terms of the way
   that these parameters are expected to interact. A case is made for
   investigating wider-ranging innovation paradigms, based on external, not
   just internal, influences. An example to cite is that any operational
   personnel with an influence on safety will, in the future, find that
   they are far from alone; science having brought to them a capability
   that, in current terms, is unthinkable, but already recognised as
   desirable.}},

Abstract = {{Issues of accuracy, uncertainty, and spatial data quality have been on
   the top of most GIScience research agendas around the world from the
   late 1980s. Ever since then, growing research efforts have been directed
   toward uncertainty characterization in spatial information, analysis,
   and applications, aiming for better understanding of spatial uncertainty
   and thus improved methods and techniques for assessing and managing data
   quality. Impressive progress has been made in various issues concerning
   data quality. In addition, growing research on extensions to the
   conventional norms of data quality, such as the quality aspects of
   geospatial information services, has been observed. Chinese researchers
   have contributed to this great cause by keeping abreast with the
   developments abroad and striving for their own innovative work. This
   paper reviews the past research on data quality-related issues and
   provides a perspective on future developments. These will be seen not
   only in continued research on theoretical and technical issues
   concerning data quality, but also in developments of tools for quality
   assessment and decision-making under uncertainty through geospatial
   information processing and applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new method of reducing the energy dissipation.
   Adiabatic logic style is proving to be an attractive solution for low
   power digital design. Many researchers have introduced different
   adiabatic logic styles in last few years and proved that these are
   better than CMOS. Adiabatic switching technique based on energy recovery
   principle is one of the innovative solutions at circuit and logic level
   to achieve reduction in power dissipation This paper mainly consist of
   implementation of Adiabatic amplifier and Basic Adiabatic inverters
   (ECRL,CAL,CPAL). Its comparative power analysis with conventional CMOS
   inverter is carried out. In this paper, we show that the power
   dissipation in adiabatic inverters is less as compared to CMOS inverter.
   All circuits are implemented using Chartered 0.35 mu m CMOS technology
   Tanner EDA 13.0 tool.}},

Abstract = {{The personal health implications behind rare diseases are seldom
   considered in widespread medical care. The low incidence rate and
   complex treatment process makes rare disease research an underrated
   field in the life sciences. However, it is in these particular
   conditions that the strongest relations between genotypes and phenotypes
   are identified. The rare disease patient manager, detailed in this
   manuscript, presents an innovative perspective for a patient-centric
   portal integrating genetic and medical data. With this strategy,
   patient's digital records are transparently integrated and connected to
   wet-lab genetics research in a seamless working environment. The
   resulting knowledge base offers multiple data views, geared towards
   medical staff, with patient treatment and monitoring data; genetics
   researchers, through a custom locus-specific database; and patients, who
   for once play an active role in their treatment and rare diseases
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Accompanying with the popularity of on-line business, e-business
   development in China has to break the bottleneck of traditional off-line
   mode. Therefore, seeking for a more economic, effective and efficient
   manner with security in contract making seems to be inevitable. The
   paper explains the status of current business negotiation, analyzes the
   difficulties in the popularizing of applying the electronic signature
   into commercial activities, and then raises the pioneer Network Platform
   for Electronic Contract Making as well as its applications. The study
   concentrates on the following highlights of the platform: firstly, the
   innovative application of electronic signature on contract making by
   integrating the digital signature technology into online negotiation and
   chatting system: secondly, realizing conservation of electronic
   contracts in an independent third party for future contract disputes:
   lastly, developing and forming a set of standard electronic contract
   templates in tree structures for the first time.}},

Abstract = {{The Stereo Camera (STC) of the SIMBIO-SYS imaging suite of the
   BepiColombo ESA mission to Mercury is based on an innovative and compact
   design in which the light independently collected by two optical
   channels at 20 separation with respect to nadir falls on a common
   bidimensional detector. STC adopts a novel stereo acquisition mode,
   based on the push-frame concept, never used before on a space mission.
   To characterize this camera for obtaining the most accurate data of the
   Mercury surface, standard calibration measurements have been performed.
   In addition, we also wanted to demonstrate and characterize the
   capability of the instrument to reconstruct a 3D surface with the
   desired accuracy by means of the stereo push-frame concept. To this end,
   a lab setup has been realized with an evaluation model of STC, in which
   the problem of working at an essentially infinite object distance over
   hundred km baselines has been overcome by means of a simple collimator
   and two precision rotators. The intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of
   the camera have been obtained with standard stereo procedures, adapted
   to the specific case. The stereo validation has been performed by
   comparing the shape of the target object accurately measured by laser
   scanning, with the shape reconstructed by applying the adopted stereo
   algorithm to the acquired image pairs. The obtained results show the
   goodness of this innovative validation technique, that will be applied
   also for validating the stereo capabilities of STC flight model.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, many soil erosion studies at local, regional, national or
   continental scale use models based on the USLE-family approaches.
   Applications of these models pay little attention to seasonal changes,
   despite evidence in the literature which suggests that erosion risk may
   change rapidly according to intra-annual rainfall figures and vegetation
   phenology. This paper emphasises the aspect of seasonality in soil
   erosion mapping by using month-step rainfall erosivity data and
   biophysical time series data derived from remote-sensing. The latter,
   together with other existing pan-European geo-databases sets the basis
   for a functional pan-European service for soil erosion monitoring at a
   scale of 1:500,000. This potential service has led to the establishment
   of a new modelling approach (called the G2 model) based on the
   inheritance of USLE-family models. The G2 model proposes innovative
   techniques for the estimation of vegetation and protection factors. The
   model has been applied in a 14,500 km(2) study area in SE Europe
   covering a major part of the basin of the cross-border river, Strymonas.
   Model results were verified with erosion and sedimentation figures from
   previous research. The study confirmed that monthly erosion mapping
   would identify the critical months and would allow erosion figures to be
   linked to specific land uses.}},

Abstract = {{The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a mathematical procedure at the
   core of processing inside a Digital Signal Processor. Speed and low
   complexity are crucial in the FFT process; they can be achieved by
   avoiding trivial multiplications through a proper handling of the
   input/output data and the twiddle factors. Accordingly, this paper
   presents an innovative approach for handling the input/output data
   efficiently by avoiding trivial multiplications. This approach consists
   of a simple mapping of the three indices (FFT stage, butterfly and
   element) to the addresses of the input/output data with their
   corresponding coefficient multiplier. A self-sorting algorithm that
   reduces the amount of memory accesses to the coefficient multipliers'
   memory can also reduce the computational load by avoiding all trivial
   multiplications. Compared with the most-recent work {[}5], performance
   evaluation in terms of the number of cycles on the general-purpose
   TMS320C6416 DSP shows a reduction of 29\% (FFT of size 4096) and a 50\%
   memory reduction to stock twiddle factors. The algorithm has also shown
   a speed gain of 24\% on the FFTW platform for a FFT of size 4096.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving high energy efficiency harvesting platforms requires tracking
   variations of the energy levels. Leveraging energy storage components
   whose voltage level varies with the state of charge, it becomes
   efficient to perform voltage monitoring. In this paper, we propose two
   types of analog-to-digital voltage monitoring interfaces. In both cases,
   their outputs directly fit asynchronous 4-phases protocol and Quasi
   Delay Insensitive (QDI) logic. On the one hand, in a passive voltage
   monitoring scheme, the platform waits for energy-events. Reacting to
   voltage threshold crossings, data-events are generated and sent to the
   asynchronous controller. On the other hand, in an active scheme, the
   platform waits for an asynchronous data-event before evaluating the
   voltage level. The analog structure is thus included into the
   asynchronous protocol and provides a controlled voltage monitoring.
   These innovative structures allow the voltage monitoring power
   consumption to be under 300 nA at 0.8 V and to be functional in a wide
   supply voltage range up to 1.8V.}},

Abstract = {{Information Technology innovations have strongly affected today's
   businesses and the way we work. This effect involves different
   industries, and the healthcare industry is one of them. Various
   healthcare information systems have been introduced to manage and share
   patient records and information. However, based on the reviewed
   literatures, the healthcare knowledge management system does not have
   the same focus and attention. It is found that there is no system that
   is able to manage the tacit healthcare knowledge and innovation. As a
   result, this paper aims to introduce a theoretical framework that
   enables healthcare tacit knowledge management and global sharing.
   Digital Ecosystem is found to be the most suitable technology to achieve
   this aim; specifically with the wild environment as it is most suitable
   for the healthcare industry requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Galaxy redshift surveys are a major tool to address the most challenging
   cosmological problems facing cosmology, like the nature of dark energy
   and properties dark matter. The same observations are useful for a much
   larger variety of scientific applications, from the study of small
   bodies in the solar system, to properties of tidal streams in the Milky
   Way halo, to galaxy formation and evolution. Here I briefly discuss what
   is a redshift survey and how it can be used to attack astrophysical and
   cosmological problems. I finish with a brief description of a new
   survey, the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe
   Astrophysical Survey (JPAS), which will use an innovative system of 56
   filters to map similar to 8000 square degrees on the sky. JPAS
   photometric system, besides providing accurate photometric redshifts
   useful for cosmological parameter estimation, will deliver a
   low-resolution spectrum at each pixel on the sky, allowing for the first
   time an almost all-sky IFU science.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The main purpose of this study is to craft and test a
   framework for the link between knowledge management (KM) and performance
   in organizations, with a view of providing a deeper understanding of the
   different KM output levels or stages that this link goes through, as
   well as highlighting the organizational context of each level in that
   link.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey method was used to elicit
   opinions from 167 mid- and top-level managers from the top 81 Bahraini
   businesses.
   Findings - The study results produced a fishbone model. Its spine
   positioned knowledge management activities as the first output level,
   leading to innovation as the second, which in turn impacts the
   organization's level of agility and Finally links to performance as the
   head of that skeletal model.
   Research limitations/implications - The results highlight the different
   organizational enablers for these stages, which have been diagrammed as
   the ribs of the fish skeleton-like model.
   Originality/value - The framework may become a standard model, i.e. may
   work as a reference for academics and practitioners to help evaluate
   which KM level needs to be emphasized, at what time, and then what
   critical factors managers should work on, in order to maximize the
   organization's outcome from each stage of the model.}},

Pages = {{501-516}},
Abstract = {{Much of the discussion about the incorporation of technologies and
   mediatised components into performance has focused on the concept of
   liveness. This often leads to competing claims about the relative power
   of live versus mediatised performance and is not necessarily helpful for
   understanding the scope of opportunities now available for drama and
   applied theatre practitioners. Consideration of other relevant concepts
   such as mediation and immediacy may help move the discussion forward and
   place the use of new and emerging technological tools alongside more
   humble analogue tools within a spectrum of innovative possibilities and
   practices. Drawing on sociocultural conceptions of mediation allows for
   aspects of the experience of liveness to be identified across a range of
   contexts, and includes the use of digital technologies and tools as well
   as those featuring co-present human bodies in the same physical space.
   The concept of immediacy highlights the importance of the emotional
   response and connections that may be achieved through different tool
   use. In this article examples from drama and theatre projects are drawn
   upon to explore these concepts. With a reconceptualisation of liveness
   and mediation as involving the full range of tools - human,
   technological and digital - the focus then shifts. Oppositional
   critiques are replaced by an exploration of purpose, the innovative uses
   of different tools and technologies available and possibilities for
   connecting to participants and audiences.}},

Abstract = {{The success of automatic building detection techniques lies in the
   effective separation of buildings from trees. This paper presents an
   improved automatic building detection technique that achieves more
   effective separation of buildings from trees. Firstly, it uses cues such
   as height to remove objects of low height such as bushes, and width to
   exclude trees with small horizontal coverage. The height threshold is
   also used to generate a ground mask where buildings are found to be more
   separable than in a so-called normalized DSM (digital surface model).
   Secondly, image entropy and colour information are jointly applied to
   remove easily distinguishable trees. Finally, an innovative rule-based
   procedure is employed using the edge orientation histogram from the
   imagery to eliminate false positive candidates. While tested on a number
   of scenes from four different test areas, the improved algorithm
   performed well even in complex scenes which are hilly and densely
   vegetated.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this paper are to reflect on policy evolution observed in
   the EURODITE study regions, to identify the most innovative policy
   trajectories for delivering growth opportunities to regional firms and
   to explain this in terms of key theoretical findings about the virtuous
   policy cycles that arise from geographical proximity, co-evolution, path
   interdependence, relatedness and transversality. Accordingly, the paper
   involves, first, assessing the role of varieties of ``proximity{''} in
   the formation of spatial distinctiveness. Second it investigates the
   appropriateness or otherwise of notions of ``path dependence{''} to
   understanding spatial co-evolution. This leads to insights about
   ``relatedness{''} in the interaction of path dependences, or more
   accurately path inter-dependence in evolving spatial processes, notably
   interactions between regional innovation paradigms and regimes in
   explaining regional variety. This allows eventual conjecture regarding
   the evidence for ``regional regime variety{''} based on appropriately
   selected EURODITE regions (Bavaria, Midi-Pyrenees, Skane, Styria) both
   as an advanced ``platform{''} model of regional evolution and as a
   fundamental process that blocks regional homogenization. This would
   explain how regional culture influences policy to maintain regional
   specificities under forces like globalization and ``digital culture{''}
   that are purported to be erosive of regional distinctiveness. Strong
   empirical evidence is adduced for co-evolutionary and multi-level
   spatial distinctiveness in paradigms and regimes that condition
   contemporary innovation knowledge flows.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the factors that affect the schools decision to
   offer educational services by an e-learning platform. We based on
   institutional framework to explain the choice of e-learning adoption by
   schools operating in rural contexts. These schools face greater
   difficulties to achieve education requirements and, thus, they are
   forced to ensure their services adopting an alternative educational
   model compared with traditional face-to-face learning. Based on the
   qualitative approach, we investigated the case of the ``Digital school
   project{''} in Italy. The study highlighted that coercive and mimetic
   institutional isomorphism affect rural schools decision to use the
   distance education.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade the incumbent companies in the recorded music
   industry had severe difficulties in adequately reacting to technological
   improvements and changes in consumers' needs. Which business models are
   best suited to the new circumstances is not yet clear. Thus, experiments
   with alternative business models are essential. The omnipresence of
   music in the digital era means that, the product ``recorded music{''} is
   loosing it's value and is instead reinforcing the service aspect of
   music. Many product-based companies are seeking to improve their
   competitiveness by moving toward service-based business models. However,
   incumbent firms face severe barriers to conducting business model
   experiments with such service-based offers. This is why entrepreneurial
   startup companies are the leading force in steering business models
   toward a service-dominant perspective. In this article we will analyze
   and categorize the service-based business models of recently founded
   music companies to identify some of the generic characteristics of
   innovative business models in the recorded music industry.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier studies of broadband adoption have focused on Internet use in
   the home. This article suggests that Internet use outside the home can
   provide a context in which meaningful measures of broadband adoption can
   be developed. Findings are presented from a study of the Free Library of
   Philadelphia Hot Spots, which used an innovative community engagement
   strategy to bring broadband technology and library services to
   underserved neighborhoods. The study shows that the sense of comfort
   (i.e., support, trust, safety, and respect) at the Hot Spots was
   important to residents as a precursor to technology access and use, and
   it suggests that these factors be considered in broadband policies to
   support sustainable broadband adoption in low-income communities.}},

   innovative feature extractor for images that considers their two
   dimensional topology to identify their relevant features. Numerical
   experiment applied to 70000 pictures representing handwritten digits,
   698 images illustrating the face of a person under different poses and
   lighting directions, or 355 color holidays photos demonstrate the
   accuracy of our approach to drastically reduce the dimension while
   conserving the intelligible relations between data objects, reaching a
   classification of better quality from the reduced version of images than
   from their original full-size realizations.}},

Abstract = {{As the previous chapter indicates, there has been a significant shift in
   advanced economies from manufacturing to information and knowledge
   services. Knowledge itself is growing ever more specialized and
   expanding exponentially. Information and communication technology is
   transforming the nature of how work is conducted and the meaning of
   social relationships. Decentralized decision making, information
   sharing, teamwork, and innovation are key in today's enterprises. No
   longer can students look forward to middle class success in the conduct
   of manual labor or use of routine skills - work that can be accomplished
   by machines. Rather, whether a technician or a professional person,
   success lies in being able to communicate, share, and use information to
   solve complex problems, in being able to adapt and innovate in response
   to new demands and changing circumstances, in being able to marshal and
   expand the power of technology to create new knowledge, and in expanding
   human capacity and productivity.
   Research during the last decade has shown how new social practices
   evolve clue to increased use of new digital technologies, especially
   among young people (Buckingham and Willett 2006). Such practices create
   reconceptions of key competencies and skills, not defined from a systems
   level but from the everyday lives of people in our societies. One
   example is research done on computer games and online communities (Gee
   2007), where problem solving is defined as a key component of such
   practices. Such experiences of problem solving among young people need
   to inform us in the way we design assessment tasks and define key
   competencies. Hence, new standards for what students should be able to
   do must replace the basic skills and knowledge expectations of the past.
   To meet this challenge, schools must be transformed in ways that will
   enable students to acquire the sophisticated thinking, flexible problem
   solving, and collaboration and communication skills they will need to be
   successful in work and life. New conceptions of educational standards
   and assessment, the subject of this chapter, are a key strategy for
   accomplishing the necessary transformation. Such standards and
   assessment can both focus attention on necessary capacities and provide
   data to leverage and evaluate system change. Technology too serves as
   both a driver and lever for the transformation.
   In the sections that follow, we
   synthesize research on the role of standards and assessment in promoting
   learning,
   describe the nature of assessment systems that can support changes in
   practice and use these to develop guiding principles for the design of
   next generation assessments,
   illustrate the use of technology to transform assessment systems and
   learning, and
   propose a MODEL for assessing twenty-first century skills.
   Our intent is to learn from the past as we prepare for new futures in
   educational standards and assessment. While we provide a list of
   twenty-first century skills based on our analysis of twelve relevant
   frameworks drawn from a number of countries, these serve as an example
   of how to think about assessing twenty-first century skills. We expect
   that educators, as they consider our model, may need to make adaptations
   that fit their own contexts as they design assessments appropriate for
   their schools and students.
   We have organized the ten skills we have identified into four groupings:
   Ways of Thinking
   1. Creativity and innovation
   2. Critical thinking, problem solving, decision making
   3. Learning to learn, Metacognition
   Ways of Working
   4. Communication
   5. Collaboration (teamwork)
   Tools for Working
   6. Information literacy
   7. ICT literacy
   Living in the World
   8. Citizenship - local and global
   9. Life and career
   10. Personal and social responsibility - including cultural awareness
   and competence}},

Abstract = {{Service innovation has received less attention in science over the last
   years compared to product innovation, although the importance of service
   innovation is steadily growing. In fact, for the printing industry
   service innovation and the service design approach have received almost
   no attention at all. Because of the current crisis in the printing
   industry that is due to digitalising, there is considerable pressure to
   find new business opportunities. Service innovation and design can
   perhaps help to overcome the crisis, so that companies can remain
   competitive in a dynamic business climate. Therefore, this chapter
   analyses cross-industry benchmarks in the field of service innovation
   and service design. The use of the Circle of Service Design is shown in
   order to highlight possible opportunities for the printing industry to
   develop better and optimised services in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative systematic approach to factory
   automation. Northwestern Polytechnical University developed an
   Enterprise-level Digital fActory and its Simulation Platform, NPU-EDASP
   that adopted service-oriented architecture methodology to design and
   develop this software. In particular, it specifies the simulation
   technology within the NPU-EDASP platform to bridge the gape exits among
   products and production manufacturing process. In an advanced stage,
   simulation technology can be applied in the NPU-EDASP to enhance the
   operative production planning and control. Further, the combination of
   simulation and optimization techniques will improve and optimize
   material flow, resource utilization and logistics in production
   engineering processes. A case study of a model demonstrates that he
   NPU-EDASP digital factory offers an integrated approach to promote the
   ability of production engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, authors present a highly flexible tooling system based on
   reconfigurable multi-point thermoforming (MPTF) methodology, which has
   been developed within an EU-granted FP7 project. The MPTF technology
   employs an actuated-punch matrix to dynamically configure a controllable
   tool working surface through digitally adjusting relative displacement
   of each punch in the matrix. Novel MPTF methods have been proposed
   through re-changing configurations of actuated-punch tooling system
   according to rapid thermoforming principles and relevant cladding
   applications. The tooling system includes an industrial-scale prototype
   of an MPTF tooling integrated with functional CAD/CAE/CAT software
   interfaces. The numerical simulation with an explicit FEM predicts the
   unexpected deformation defects of dimples and wrinkles regarding to
   discrete contact boundaries between punches and the sheet blank.
   Innovative techniques of variable blank-holder and deformable cushion
   have been implemented to suppress wrinkling and eliminate dimpling
   effectively. The tooling system has been successfully applied to
   manufacture complex double-curved panels, which are described as
   application examples. Compared with conventional fixed moulds, the
   flexible tooling offers robust, rapid and re-changeable means to make
   mould-less manufacturing large freeform panels.}},

Abstract = {{We design and implement a key building block of a scalable neuromorphic
   architecture capable of running spiking neural networks in compact and
   low-power hardware. Our innovation is a configurable neurosynaptic core
   that combines 256 integrate-and-fire neurons, 1024 input axons, and
   1024x256 synapses in 4.2mm(2) of silicon using a 45nm SOI process. We
   are able to achieve ultra-low energy consumption 1) at the circuit-level
   by using an asynchronous design where circuits only switch while
   performing neural updates; 2) at the core-level by implementing a 256
   neural fanout in a single operation using a crossbar memory; and 3) at
   the architecture-level by restricting core-to-core communication to
   spike events, which occur relatively sparsely in time. Our
   implementation is purely digital, resulting in reliable and
   deterministic operation that achieves for the first time one-to-one
   correspondence with a software simulator. At 45pJ per spike, our core is
   readily scalable and provides a platform for implementing a wide array
   of real-time computations. As an example, we demonstrate a sound
   localization system using coincidence-detecting neurons.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an innovative approach to Information and
   communication technology (ICT) skill training and employment generation
   for out-of-school and disadvantaged youths in Africa. With technical and
   policy assistance from the World Bank, ICTs can be used to revitalize
   technical and vocational training to meet skill and employment needs of
   disadvantaged youths in the region. The deplorable conditions of
   out-of-school youth and the state of secondary education in Africa
   underscore the urgency to engage disadvantaged youth in productive
   economic activities. An ICT-enhanced technical and vocational training
   program in Africa provides both private and social gains: it provides
   economic prospects for disadvantaged youth and; it adds to the
   development of the knowledge economy in Africa. The NairoBits Digital
   Design School in Kenya is presented as a model of a vocational and
   training school that uses ICTs to improve skill formation among
   disadvantaged youths in informal settlements in urban Africa. Meeting
   the objectives of an ICT-based training and employment generation
   program for underprivileged youth in Africa require strong regulatory
   frameworks and contributions from the World Bank. The involvement of the
   bank, particularly through private sector grants for ICT skill train in
   Africa will help to revitalize technical and vocational education and
   training in the region. Above all, the collaboration of government
   agencies, private businesses, other international development agencies
   and civil society groups in ICT skill training will help to meaningfully
   engage African youths in the development of their communities in the
   emerging knowledge economy.}},

Abstract = {{The application of knowledge is a primary source of growth in the
   knowledge economy. The World Bank Group has developed a rigorous
   assessment methodology for assessing a country's ability to access and
   use knowledge to become more competitive in the knowledge economy of the
   21st century. This assessment methodology annually produces the
   Knowledge Economy Index. The World Bank's Knowledge Economy Index is
   grounded on a four pillar model. The four pillars include: (1) Economic
   Incentives and Institutional Regime; (2) Education and Skills; (3)
   Information and Communication Infrastructure; and (4) Innovation
   Systems. While the indicators are robust and the data collection
   methodology is rigorous, an argument can be made that the model lacks
   coverage of some key factors that pertain to intellectual capital and to
   the production and consumption of knowledge. Some might argue that heavy
   focus on economic incentives and open institutional regimes comes at a
   societal cost. While the goal of investments in information and
   communication infrastructure may be greater access to economic
   opportunities, they may be used to exploit natural capital or to
   increase disparities in the digital divide. This paper considers
   investigates what happens when a Knowledge Economy Index exercise is
   placed in a more holistic and balanced view of the Knowledge Society.
   Adopting the perspective of Triple Bottom Line shifts the purpose and
   design of a knowledge economy index. The shift is from one of
   aggregation and reporting, to action and involvement. There are
   acknowledged challenges involved in applying the Triple Bottom Line as
   an accounting method. The World Bank's scorecard and indexing
   methodology is adaptable to this new perspective and a new set of
   indicators.}},

Title = {{Library automation in sub Saharan Africa: case study of the University
   of Botswana}},
Journal = {{PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{292-307}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This article aims to present experiences and the lessons
   learned from the University of Botswana (UB) library automation project.
   The implications of the project for similar libraries planning
   automation in sub Saharan Africa and beyond are adduced.
   Design/methodology/approach - The article is a case study of library
   automation at the University of Botswana.
   Findings - The successful implementation of the library automation
   project was attributed to a number of factors, among them ensuring
   strategic management buy-in, extensive consultations with key
   stakeholders, alignment of library automation with goals of the
   university, capacity building of librarians and assuring librarians that
   their jobs were safe. The impact of the automation project included
   increased access to diversity of electronic resources, enhanced image of
   librarians, introduction of new services, freeing of library physical
   space, transformation of the library into a social learning environment,
   access to local content made possible through digitisation, new skills
   acquisitions, access to library electronic resources from remote sites,
   and increased roles and responsibilities for librarians. Challenges
   faced included staff. anxiety about the prospect of losing jobs,
   learning of new skills, added responsibilities for librarians, raised
   expectations of users, high costs of subscription to full text journals,
   and bandwidth bottlenecks among others.
   Research limitations and implications - This article is based on a case
   study of library automation at the University of Botswana. The results
   may not therefore be widely replicated. Besides, the article did not
   delve deep into technology acceptance and diffusion of innovation issues
   that could illuminate further the case study.
   Practical implications - Most university libraries in sub Saharan Africa
   are yet to successfully and fully automate their information services.
   Consequently the lessons learned from the University of Botswana case
   could help inform the planning and implementation of automations
   projects in similar libraries.
   Social implications - The automation of the University of Botswana
   library resulted in enhanced quality of information services,
   re-skilling of librarians, enhanced image of librarians, user
   satisfaction and transformation of the university into a learning and
   research hub.
   Originality/value - This article is based on practical experiences of
   library automation at the University of Botswana and its impact on
   services, and human and physical resources. Previous studies on this
   subject at the university only covered migration from one system to
   another and the technical perspectives of the process of library
   automation. This study is broad in scope covering both technical and
   managerial processes of managing change in the context of library
   automation at the University of Botswana.}},

Abstract = {{The paper analyses problems existing in integration models of product
   design and manufacturing in enterprises. Under the theory of product
   life cycle management (PLM) and via the platform of J2EE, it builds a
   framework for establishment of integration architecture in product
   design and manufacturing based on knowledge engineering. The paper gives
   a detailed introduction to the structure, function characteristics and
   realization forms of the architecture. On the basis of this, the paper
   then studies integration methods of the information system based on XML
   and explores key technologies in the knowledge base plus network safety
   of the architecture. Finally, the paper emphatically analyzes types of
   flow of traditional knowledge and digital knowledge in enterprise
   knowledge management. The proposed architecture has realized close
   integration of various sectors so that knowledge runs through the whole
   process of product life cycle. As a result, the architecture can satisfy
   modern enterprises' demand for collaborative manufacturing, resource
   sharing and network integration while supporting knowledge management
   and technological innovation.}},

Abstract = {{The e-cohesion concept is a new concept introduced within the European
   Union's policy documents issued in October 2011 for the new financial
   period of 2013 - 2020 regarding the use of Structural Funds. The concept
   itself is not yet defined in the proposals for legislative documents and
   there are not neither any clear measures suggested to the Member States,
   nor targets for its implementation. The concept is undoubtedly related
   with the simplification of the management procedures, targeting the
   submission electronically of all documents requested to the applicants.
   The main solutions suggested are the digitization of the management
   authorities, but also the extension of the electronic signature system
   and the increase of the on-line security for these operations. These
   developments will engage hopefully a cut of red-tape, the avoidance of
   duplication and environment friendly procedures. This article intends to
   contribute to the academic debate related to this new concept and to
   research how the implementation of the e-cohesion concept might
   challenge the present systems. A short inventory of some good practices
   that have already been implemented in several Member States will present
   an insight on steps already made in this field.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of eGovernment solutions in Romania is a challenge
   not only for local administrations but for the national government. It
   is acknowledged that competitiveness in Romania will increase with the
   development of eGovernment services, especially at the local level.
   National strategic priorities in the eGovernment field are related to
   the setting up of the e-Romania project including its eGovernment
   strategic component, modernization of public administration, the large
   scale adoption of information technology in relation to the business
   environment, citizens and public administration, the improvement in the
   competitiveness of information and communication technology (ICT),
   research and development and innovation sectors and the implementation
   of the EU directives related to public electronic services. Despite the
   fact that there is a national strategy and different large-scale
   initiatives in the field (most of them in an on-going process of
   implementation), central public administration has unsuccessfully
   coordinated the national program for the digitization of local public
   administration in Romania so far. Nevertheless, through a bottom-up
   approach, local public administrations have implemented diverse
   eGovernment solutions in order to improve the lives of their citizens.
   Such services range from the on-line offering of information,
   downloading of applications for different public services, on-line
   registration of complaints and more sophisticated solutions such as
   on-line payment of local taxes and e-public procurement. Based on an
   analysis of the projects already implemented, our research will identify
   limits and opportunities in the application of eGovernment solutions at
   local level in Romania, building up a set of good practices. Although
   over recent years Romania has made significant improvements in the
   development and extension of broadband networks, according to the
   European statistics (European Commission, 2011; Colclough et al., 2010),
   Romania still occupies unwanted last place in the level of Internet use
   by population (up to 35\%) and eGovernment use (less than 10\%). Romania
   finds itself below the EU level in relation to the supply of on-line
   services for citizens (50\%) and for companies (75\%). Online
   sophistication of public services reaches 73\% of which sophistication
   for business services stands at 89\%, compared to 94\% for the
   EUinverted left perpendicular27 plus Croatia, Iceland, Norway,
   Switzerland and Turkey (EU27+). Sophistication for citizen services is
   at 63\% (compared to 87\% for the EU27+). Despite the low level of
   progress, there are prospects for extending and improvement of
   eGovernment services in Romania, mainly to the use of structural funds
   which might ensure part of the financing of projects. The negative
   effects of the economic crisis can be overcome by the increase in the
   level of computerization in the public administration sector, while
   decreasing costs involving a human factor following recent cuts in
   personnel. Having regard to the actual level of development of
   eGovernment in Romania, the main difficulty would be to integrate local
   initiatives already implemented with on-going national strategies in the
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Several projects have been developed in Europe addressing the
   `Smartness' of Cities. This concept is normally associated with
   sustainable economic development and high quality of life, being made
   possible by the use of advanced information and communication
   technologies (ICT) and Future Internet infrastructures. This paper takes
   on the perspective of digitalisation of public administration, to focus
   on the creation of a new eGovernment stage, where citizen's experience
   of public service - being considered as an intrinsic quality of the
   latter - is enhanced by the contribution of ICT and Future Internet
   technologies. This in turn drives proactive mass behavioural
   transformation ('Smart Citizenship') and helps define innovative forms
   and channels of shared value production between governments ('empowered'
   policy makers or public sector employees), citizens ('intelligent'
   customers or service users/beneficiaries), and market players
   (technology vendors or developers). According to this perspective, the
   four key questions become: How does user experience manifest itself with
   a superior value across co-produced (rather than simply delivered)
   services? What would be a viable pricing model for these co-produced
   services? Who are the `right' business partners to public administration
   and what kind of partnership arrangements would be more appropriate?
   And, finally Who should own and/or operate the underlying ICT (Future
   Internet) infrastructure? The paper offers some preliminary answers to
   the above questions, based on a market analysis that was recently
   performed in the context of a EU-funded project (PERIPHERIA) belonging
   to the CIP Smart Cities and IoT (Internet of Things) clusters. Drawn
   implications possibly affect well-known (and sometimes abused) terms
   such as sustainability, quality and impact of public service in the
   Future Internet era, calling for additional research on the relationship
   between personal/collective experience of a Smart Service and the
   proactive transformation of individual and group behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{ICT is changing the way people live and do business globally, and is
   creating new social and economic development opportunities for
   lower-income populations and vulnerable groups, by enlarging markets and
   facilitating greater access to information, public services and economic
   activity. ICT is an effective tool that, when supplemented by
   investments in innovation, education, social inclusion and flexible
   government policies, increases competitiveness and contributes to
   economic growth, social development and poverty reduction, contributing
   to the creation of a knowledge economy. Yet, these opportunities cannot
   be effectively and fully realized if left to market forces alone, and
   require the active participation of the public, private and civil
   society sectors under an integrated effort towards the development of a
   socially inclusive knowledge society. This paper, that is descriptive in
   nature, provides references and examples of eGovernment pilot and
   investment initiatives in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Region
   pursuing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), showing the ICT
   pivotal role in the social and economic development of the developing
   countries. The examples considered in the paper show how favorable
   development can be achieved through the effective deployment of ICT
   tools and solutions, especially those based on mobile and wireless
   technologies, in the priority sectors of education, health, government,
   finance and social inclusion of vulnerable groups, including ageing
   people and people with disabilities. These examples also form the basis
   for a proposed action-oriented strategy that, under a multi-sector
   approach, aims at the creation of the necessary conditions to facilitate
   investments in technological infrastructure and connectivity, facilitate
   access, foster digital education and training, promote the development
   of local content, and delineate the participation of various
   stakeholders in the implementation of ICT-based development programs. In
   the paper four development scenarios benefitting the LAC Region are
   suggested that can be achieved through the coordinated efforts of the
   governments, the private sector and civil societies under the described
   strategy. Although these scenarios are specifically conceived for the
   LAC region they can be easily transferred to other developing regions.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, educators are wrestling with ways to reform an education
   system built for an industrial age now almost obsolete in a Knowledge
   Age. It is recognized significant reform is needed and there is adequate
   research to inform a way forward, but a question lingers - Knowing what
   we know, how do we change the entrenched and conservative bureaucracy
   directing most education systems and embrace the potential and promise
   of 21st century teaching and learning? Experience suggests technology
   has a significant role to play by providing multimedia, digital content
   to support a variety of learning styles and modalities. The model
   presented in this paper is a response to a design problem of how best to
   inform professional development and support course redesign. Just as
   cellphone technology enabled developing countries to leapfrog
   innovations in telephony, this model is a partial answer to how post
   secondary institutions, specifically those situated in challenging
   contexts, might leapfrog teaching and learning through the use of
   appropriate technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the process of digitalising schools as an
   innovative education strategy. We are focusing on teachers' roles in
   digitalisation, and how school leaders can engage teachers in
   educational innovation that involves digital media. The paper draws on
   experiences from an ongoing project in the Municipality of Vejle,
   Denmark, where 34 elementary and 4 special schools highlight the use of
   ICT, culture and diversity in the knowledge society
   (www.vejledigitaleskoler.net). The paper presents approaches to the
   development of teachers' competences in using ICT for educational
   purposes, drawn primarily from the experience learned from the Vejle
   Digital Schools project. It is important to focus on teachers, as they
   have a central role in implementing educational transformations involved
   in the digitalisation of schools. Schools face two main challenges, we
   propose, in connection with this massive development of skills:
   ICT-based soft-and hardware has evolved, and continues to evolve in
   tremendous speed: A teacher who has taken a course in educational ICT
   today, can easily feel (and perhaps rightly so) incompetent the next
   year, even with regard to the same ICT-based learning methodologies.
   Interviews with teachers and principals in Vejle (and elsewhere) suggest
   that when a teacher has been trained, he/she may find it difficult to
   apply what he/she has learned in practice. Even if the courses touch on
   basic topics, it may still be difficult to translate the course content,
   and adapt it for the teacher's own purposes. One of the issues involved
   in responding to these challenges is developing teachers' competences
   through practice, i.e. through practice-based development of ICT based
   teaching and learning. Against this background the question is asked:
   What strategic considerations and decisions may be involved in improving
   the ICT competences of teachers as seen through the example of Vejle
   Digital Schools?}},

   industrialization methods and tools used in AIRBUS Military,
   contributing to the A400M program success. The document presents: the
   background and reasons motivating the project, the context and the main
   barriers identified, and the definition of a Final Assembly Line. An
   innovative concept of industrial Digital Mock-Up (iDMU) was coined,
   representing the interoperable grouping of product, processes and

Abstract = {{Between 32 and 74 million smartphones are forecast in the Indian market
   by 2015. This article looks more closely into this phenomenon by
   comparing two studies conducted at urban and rural sites in India. Study
   A was based upon a corporate ethnography of `middle class' urban user
   segments in Mumbai and Belgaum. Thirty-three in-depth interviews were
   conducted with `Mobile Only' and `Mobile Heavy' users. A number of
   respondents reported that a mobile phone was their first `personal'
   device, which led to a complex relationship between the user and their
   phone that was manifest both physically and symbolically. Study B
   details a development communication project based upon a six-month
   participant observation of a community radio station located in the
   rural Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh state. The strategic aim of
   Study B was to explore the potential of the smartphone as a tool for
   development communication. Nokia N97 smartphones were provided to
   community radio reporters and these devices facilitated the production
   of new programming and innovative community engagement pilots. Both
   studies suggest that low levels of income and digital literacy, and
   certain social structures and cultural norms may further constrain
   forecast adoption rates. However, the studies also demonstrate the range
   of new possibilities afforded by mobile-and smartphone-enabled
   applications and services once such constraints are reduced or removed.}},

Abstract = {{The double role piston pump based on the symmetrical gear and
   crank-link-slider mechanism driven by servo motor is innovated, its
   working principle and technical characteristics are introduced. In this
   new type of piston pump, the hydraulic cylinder piston is drived, and
   the velocity can be adjusted, but the flow pulse of a single pump is
   undoubtedly great. So two piston pumps are adopted, whose velocity are
   controled by NC, then the variable stepless timing in wide range can be
   achieved. If the velocity in this two pumps vertical bar v(1)vertical
   bar+vertical bar v(2)vertical bar=C (C is a constant), the flow curve of
   two pumps will be coupled into a straight line, in order to achieve
   constant flow output without the need of complex and inefficient
   throttle controlling loops, and there has not any power machines and
   mechanical parts in high-speed rotation,and the noise pollution is very
   low. According to the varied circumstance, the high and low pressure
   conversion can be achieved when the angle velocity in this piston pump
   is controlled by the instructions. It is also very easy to achieve the
   dynamic and intelligent control.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the impact of a radical technological innovation
   on business models. Do firms react by adjusting their business models
   incrementally, through iterative steps? Or do such innovations lead,
   instead, to a big bang of new innovative business models that are all
   adopted and experimented with by the industry? To answer these
   questions, we analyze the impact of digitization-a radical innovation-on
   business models in the recorded music industry. Using an economic
   analysis of the effects of digitization, we begin by building five
   potential digital business models for the music industry. Then, using
   data from a survey on a sample of French record companies, we map these
   record labels on our digital business models. Our analysis suggests that
   digitization has led to a big bang of business models in the music
   industry, rather than to incremental adjustments of the existing
   business model.}},

   Elsa Margarita Ramirez Leyva
   Digital culture is considered an innovative culture of reading, which
   has given rise to changes in patterns of getting informed and inform.
   The identity of ``digital native{''} has been also configured to
   characterize, in particular, the young generations that coincide with
   the birth and development of electronic technology, and they are
   conceived as intensive users of technological artifacts, also with
   electronic writing and reading skills, and at the same time, with a
   progressive decline in their interest for printed media reading. This
   article presents the results of the analysis intended to explore
   representations of digital culture in the context of reading and
   informative activities of an UNAM high school students group. Fragments
   concerning the topic narratives, collected between 2010 and 2011 for
   research on representations and reading and informative practices of
   that community were analyzed for this purpose.}},

   framework where students can practice and develop their skills in CT

   supports various CT concepts and how these concepts can be mapped to
   programming constructs to facilitate learning introductory computer
   programming. Moreover, we discuss the potential benefits of our approach
   as a support tool to foster student motivation and abilities in problem
   solving. As initial evaluation, we provide some analysis of feedback
   from a survey response group of 25 students who have played our game as
   a voluntary exercise. Structured empirical evaluation will follow, and
   the plan for that is briefly described.}},

Abstract = {{Large organizations develop layers and rules for members to operate
   within accepted processes and conventions whereas innovation tends to
   occur in a less constrained, less conventional, and less risk averse
   environment. This basic cultural difference creates a need for protected
   semi-autonomous centers that cultivate great ideas, providing freedom to
   explore new concepts and harbor the zealots to champion them past
   institutional barriers to change. The management objective at the
   Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) is to
   advocate and accelerate technology development and ensure beneficial
   implementation in the shortest possible time. TATRC accomplishes this
   objective through integrating multidisciplinary teams that combine
   engineering technology and physical sciences with both basic and applied
   clinical biosciences to solve medical problems. This convergence in
   medical research complements Department of Defense (DoD) investments in
   long term basic research and large investments in high risk problem
   solving. TATRC successes in this ``technology push to satisfy clinical
   need{''} began with radiograph digitization standards and has continued
   to spin out medical systems and program initiatives to new DoD core
   programs in rehabilitative medicine (e.g., regenerative medicine,
   advanced prosthetics, vision research, and integrative pain management),
   medical modeling and simulation, and current combat zone telemedicine
   applications. TATRC ``technology scouts{''} look for transformational
   approaches across traditional boundaries and provide active assistance
   to build new capabilities and to successfully complete projects through
   commercialization and DoD implementation. Many near term problems can be
   addressed by mature technologies in medical robotics, synthetic biology,
   tissue engineering, nano-and biomaterials science, medical imaging, and
   neuroengineering. Everyday technologies such as smartphones can be
   immediately harnessed for better access to medical care, improved safety
   and efficiency in medicine, technology management and ultimately reduced
   medical costs. The end result of this culture of convergence can be
   transformational, calling for disruptive change in technology and
   capability as exemplified by telemedicine and m-Health, fostered through
   the unique TATRC research management model.}},

   architectural designing and modeling, the manual and digital processes.
   We study the relationship that the drawing maintains with the body and
   its emotional states checking the conditions in which the body becomes
   the generator of architectural space as living space. Digital processes

Abstract = {{The world is going digital, human infatuation with gadgets is increasing
   and a very short product lifecycle of these products has resulted in a
   horrendous threat to the environment. Waste electrical and electronic
   equipment (WEEE) reverse logistic management has been a key area for
   researchers to innovate and produce insights that could sustain
   businesses without compromising the environment. In this paper, we aim
   to understand the consumer return behaviour of end of life goods at
   different incentive levels and make an attempt to incorporate the latest
   research practices. A novel attempt is made in this paper, where we have
   for the first time applied product and component reliability in
   determining the incentives given to the consumer so that the efforts of
   WEEE recycling and disposal could be conducted in an economically
   sustainable manner to promote ecological sustainability, thereby
   envisaging upon the fact that there is a hidden synergy between the
   trade and environment, and only innovative managerial approaches that
   are thoroughly pragmatic, could exploit them. The optimisation model has
   been solved using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and the insights
   produce highlight upon the feasibility of such a model.}},

Abstract = {{Organic agriculture is a sustainable cultivation ecologically,
   economically and socially. Several researches in organic agriculture
   have been made from technical perspectives, economic traits or related
   to ecological aspects. There are practically no investigations into the
   nature of the technology used in organic agriculture, especially from an
   ergonomic perspective. From the activity analysis, this study aimed to
   map the technology used in the production of organic vegetables.
   Properties producing organic vegetables were selected representing the
   State of Sao Paulo. It was applied an instrument (questionnaire and
   semi-structured interview) with their managers and it was made visual
   records to identify adaptations, innovations and technological demands
   that simultaneously minimize the workload and the difficulties in
   performing the tasks and increase work productivity. For some of the
   technological innovations a digital scanner was used to generate a
   virtual solid model to facilitate its redesign and virtual prototyping.
   The main results show that organic farmers have little technology in
   product form. The main innovations that enable competitive advantage or
   allow higher labor productivity occur in the form of processes,
   organization and marketing.}},

   Massstabs als Sackgasse fur die Digitalen Geisteswissenschaften{''}.
   Programs aiming to develop large scale digital infrastructure for the
   humanities motivate this development mostly by the wish to leverage
   methodological innovation through digital and computational approaches.
   It is questionable, however, if large scale infrastructures are the
   right incubator model for bringing about such innovation. The necessary
   generalizations and standardizations, management and development
   processes that large infrastructures need to apply to cater to wholesale
   humanities are at odds with well-known aspects of innovation. Moreover,
   such generalizations close off many possibilities for exploring new
   modeling and computing approaches. I argue that methodological
   innovation and advancing the modeling of humanities data and heuristics
   is better served by flexible small-scale research focused development
   practices. It will also be shown that modeling highly specific
   distributed web services is a more promising avenue for sustainability
   of highly heterogeneous humanities digital data than standards
   enforcement and current encoding practices.}},

Abstract = {{The innovative development of computer technology promotes the
   application of the cloud computing platform, which actually is the
   substitution and exchange of a sort of resource service models and meets
   the needs of users on the utilization of different resources after
   changes and adjustments of multiple aspects. ``Cloud computing{''} owns
   advantages in many aspects which not merely reduce the difficulties to
   apply the operating system and also make it easy for users to search,
   acquire and process the resources. In accordance with this point, the
   author takes the management of digital libraries as the research focus
   in this paper, and analyzes the key technologies of the mobile internet
   cloud computing platform in the operation process.
   The popularization and promotion of computer technology drive people to
   create the digital library models, and its core idea is to strengthen
   the optimal management of the library resource information through
   computers and construct an inquiry and search platform with high
   performance, allowing the users to access to the necessary information
   resources at any time. However, the cloud computing is able to promote
   the computations within the computers to distribute in a large number of
   distributed computers, and hence implement the connection service of
   multiple computers. The digital libraries, as a typical representative
   of the applications of the cloud computing, can be used to carry out an
   analysis on the key technologies of the cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{The high level of accumulated expertise by ULIS and CEA/LETI on uncooled
   microbolometers made from amorphous silicon enables ULIS to develop 1/4
   VGA IRFPA formats with 17 mu m pixel-pitch to enable the development of
   small power, small weight (SWAP) and high performance IR systems. ROIC
   architecture will be described where innovations are widely on-chip
   implemented to enable an easier operation by the user. The detector
   configuration (integration time, windowing, gain, scanning direction
   ...), is driven by a standard (IC)-C-2 link. Like most of the visible
   arrays, the detector adopts the HSYNC/VSYNC free-run mode of operation
   driven with only one master clock (MC) supplied to the ROIC which feeds
   back pixel, line and frame synchronizations. On-chip PROM memory for
   customer operational condition storage is available for detector
   characteristics.
   Low power consumption has been taken into account and less than 60 mW is
   possible in analog mode at 60 Hz and < 175 mW in digital mode (14 bits).
   A wide electrical dynamic range (2.4V) is maintained despite the use of
   advanced CMOS node. The specific appeal of this unit lies in the high
   uniformity and easy operation it provides. The reduction of the
   pixel-pitch turns this TEC-less 1/4 VGA array into a product well
   adapted for high resolution and compact systems.
   NETD of 35 mK and thermal time constant of 10 ms have been measured
   leading to 350 mK. ms figure of merit. We insist on NETD trade-off with
   wide thermal dynamic range, as well as the high characteristics
   uniformity and pixel operability, achieved thanks to the mastering of
   the amorphous silicon technology coupled with the ROIC design. This
   technology node associated with advanced packaging technique, paves the
   way to compact low power system.}},

Abstract = {{In designing digital literacy content for marginalized demographics, we
   need to garner local resources to structure engaging and meaningful
   media experiences. This paper examines the socio-cognitive implications
   of a novel edutainment product in rural India on learning, stemming from
   an e-development initiative funded by Hewlett-Packard. This product
   encapsulates a multiplicity of media forms: text, audio and visual, with
   social-awareness folk themes endemic to the locality. It uses the
   karaoke same language subtitling' feature that won the World Bank
   Development Marketplace Award in 2002 due to its simple yet innovative
   application that has proven to have an impact on reading skills. The
   product strives to combine cultural regeneration, value-based education,
   incidental literacy and language practice through entertainment. The
   paper investigates how this product addresses engagement and empowerment
   simultaneously, based on elements such as emotional appeal, multimodal
   stimulation, interactivity, contextual content and local representation.
   This is useful for practitioners and scholars interested in the design
   of novel edutainment content for international, underrepresented

Abstract = {{Focal plane arrays with associated electronics and cooling are a
   substantial portion of the cost, complexity, size, weight, and power
   requirements of Long-Wave IR (LWIR) imagers. Hyperspectral LWIR imagers
   add significant data volume burden as they collect a high-resolution
   spectrum at each pixel. We report here on a LWIR Hyperspectral Sensor
   that applies Compressive Sensing (CS) in order to achieve benefits in
   these areas.
   The sensor applies single-pixel detection technology demonstrated by
   Rice University. The single-pixel approach uses a Digital Micro-mirror
   Device (DMD) to reflect and multiplex the light from a random assortment
   of pixels onto the detector. This is repeated for a number of
   measurements much less than the total number of scene pixels. We have
   extended this architecture to hyperspectral LWIR sensing by inserting a
   Fabry-Perot spectrometer in the optical path. This compressive
   hyperspectral imager collects all three dimensions on a single detection
   element, greatly reducing the size, weight and power requirements of the
   system relative to traditional approaches, while also reducing data
   volume.
   The CS architecture also supports innovative adaptive approaches to
   sensing, as the DMD device allows control over the selection of spatial
   scene pixels to be multiplexed on the detector.
   We are applying this advantage to the detection of plume gases, by
   adaptively locating and concentrating target energy. A key challenge in
   this system is the diffraction loss produce by the DMD in the LWIR. We
   report the results of testing DMD operation in the LWIR, as well as
   system spatial and spectral performance.}},

   planning of ubiquitous media by taking the multidisciplinary approach.
   The model presented supports decision-making process driven by an
   optimal investment cost and the techno-economic analysis of digital
   terrestrial wireless technologies using innovation service diffusion
   Bass model. The method of estimating the benefits of advanced digital
   dividend exploits the capacity gained due to DVB-T2 technology
   novelties. The simulation results for Serbia show that the profitability
   of broadcast network is achieved in some cases already after 2 years if
   DVB-T2 standard is used.}},

Abstract = {{This article draws on the concept of spatialisation to better understand
   the development of a digital games industry on the periphery of mainland
   Europe, on the island of Ireland. Positioning digital games within the
   cultural and creative industries, we explore how global networks of
   production in this industry get territorialised, negotiated and shaped
   by local factors. Drawing upon an industry-wide survey in Ireland we
   found that employment has grown by 400\% in the last decade but that
   this rate of employment growth and its concentration in large urban
   areas masks significant ruptures and shifts which more detailed spatial,
   occupational and social analysis reveals: in particular, how the state,
   multinational game companies, and physical and human capital interact to
   shape an industry which is strong in middleware, localisation and
   support but weak in content development. An understanding of global
   digital games production networks and of occupational patterns in this
   industry is, we believe, crucial for national and European cultural
   policies for the digital games industry and for the cultural and
   creative industries more generally.}},

Abstract = {{Despite massive funding from the Australian government, the literacy
   achievement of Australian Indigenous children remains significantly
   lower than for non-Indigenous. With the aim of identifying innovative
   ways to improve Indigenous children's literacy achievement, this study
   explored the social practices surrounding everyday mobile phone use by
   Indigenous people in a remote Australian community. Informed by the
   notion of `placed resources', which highlights the understanding that
   digital literacies are best considered as resources situated by social
   practices that have local effect, the study surveyed 95 people living in
   a remote Indigenous community about their mobile phone practices. The
   study also examined a video of a literacy event between a mother and her
   child around the use of a mobile phone. The findings revealed the strong
   relational aspects of phone use in remote communities. Integral to the
   concept of placed resources is a respect for the practices communities
   find important as they adopt artefacts for their everyday communication.}},

Abstract = {{Today's digital image sensors are used as passive photon integrators and
   image processing is essentially performed by digital processors
   separated from the image sensing part. This approach imposes to the
   processing part to deal with already grabbed pictures with possible
   unadjusted exposition parameters. This paper presents a fast
   self-adaptable preprocessing architecture with fast feedbacks on the
   sensing level. These feedbacks are controlled by digital processing in
   order to modify the sensor parameters during exposure time. Exposition
   and processing parameters are tuned in real life to fit with
   applications requirement depending on scene parameters. Considering
   emerging integration technologies such as 3D stacking, this paper
   presents an innovative way of designing smart vision sensors,
   integrating feedback control and opening new approaches for machine
   vision architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation in multimedia systems impacts on our society. For example
   surveillance camera systems combine video and audio information.
   Currently a new sensor for capturing fingerprint traces is being
   researched. It combines greyscale images to determine the intensity of
   the image signal, on one hand, and topographic information to determine
   fingerprint texture on a variety of surface materials, on the other.
   This research proposes new application areas which will be analyzed from
   a technical-legal view point. It assesses how technology design can
   promote legal criteria of German and European privacy and data
   protection. For this we focus on one technology goal as an example.}},

Abstract = {{Single kernels of durum wheat have been analyzed by hyperspectral
   imaging (HSI). Such an approach is based on the utilization of an
   integrated hardware and software architecture able to digitally capture
   and handle spectra as an image sequence, as they results along a
   pre-defined alignment on a surface sample properly energized. The study
   was addressed to investigate the possibility to apply HSI techniques for
   classification of different types of wheat kernels: vitreous, yellow
   berry and fusarium-damaged. Reflectance spectra of selected wheat
   kernels of the three typologies have been acquired by a laboratory
   device equipped with an HSI system working in near infrared field
   (1000-1700 nm). The hypercubes were analyzed applying principal
   component analysis (PCA) to reduce the high dimensionality of data and
   for selecting some effective wavelengths. Partial least squares
   discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied for classification of the
   three wheat typologies. The study demonstrated that good classification
   results were obtained not only considering the entire investigated
   wavelength range, but also selecting only four optimal wavelengths
   (1104, 1384, 1454 and 1650 nm) out of 121. The developed procedures
   based on HSI can be utilized for quality control purposes or for the
   definition of innovative sorting logics of wheat.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate propagation models are required for predicting the propagation
   of electromagnetic waves within complex environments. This paper
   proposes the use of a new method to accurately compute the divergence
   and curl of electromagnetic fields. The computation of the derivatives
   of vector fields is normally approximated using numerical methods such
   as the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method (FDTD), the Finite
   Integration Technique and the Multi-Resolution Time-Domain Method. These
   methods are all limited in terms of their accuracy, resolution,
   computational efficiency and numerical stability. This paper introduces
   a new method for computing derivatives based on Two-Dimensional (2D)
   Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques. The method involves
   computing a numerical approximation of the derivative of a function by
   considering the frequency domain definition of the derivative and
   designing a 2D finite impulse response (FIR) filter that implements the
   differentiation. Appropriate windowing functions are used to ensure that
   the FIR response is as close to the ideal 2D differentiator response as
   possible. This paper provides an example where the curl of a vector
   field is determined using this method and accuracy within a few percent
   is achieved. The proposed innovative method can be extended to three
   dimensions and used to find numerical solutions of Maxwells Equations,
   thus allowing it to be applied to the design of accurate propagation
   models.}},

Abstract = {{A droplet (digital) microfluidic device has been developed that enables
   complete protein sample preparation for MALDI-MS analysis. Protein
   solution dispensing, disulfide bond reduction and alkylation, tryptic
   digestion, sample crystallization, and mass spectrometric analysis are
   all performed on a single device without the need for any ex situ sample
   purification. Fluorinated solvents are used as an alternative to
   surfactants to facilitate droplet movement and limit protein adsorption
   onto the device surface. The fluorinated solvent is removed by
   evaporation and so does not interfere with the MALDI-MS analysis. Adding
   a small amount of perfluorooctanoic acid to the MALDI matrix solution
   improves the yield, quality and consistency of the protein-matrix
   co-crystals, reducing the need for extensive `sweet spot' searching and
   improving the spectral signal-to-noise ratio. These innovations are
   demonstrated in the complete processing and MALDI-MS analysis of
   lysozyme and cytochrome c. Because all of the sample processing steps
   and analysis can be performed on a single digital microfluidic device
   without the need for ex situ sample handling, higher throughput can be
   obtained in proteomics applications. More generally, the results
   presented here suggest that fluorinated liquids could also be used to
   minimize protein adsorption and improve crystallization in other types
   of lab-on-a-chip devices and applications.}},

Abstract = {{In 2008, we changed the gastrointestinal pathology laboratories in a
   gastrointestinal pathophysiology course to a more interactive format
   using modified team-based learning techniques and multimedia
   presentations. The results were remarkably positive and can be used as a
   model for pathology laboratory improvement in any organ system.
   Over a two-year period,. engaging and interactive pathology laboratories
   were designed. The initial restructuring of the laboratories included
   new case material, Digital Atlas of Video Education Project videos,
   animations and overlays. Subsequent changes included USMLE board-style
   quizzes at the beginning of each laboratory, with individual readiness
   assessment testing and group readiness assessment testing, incorporation
   of a clinician as a co-teacher and role playing for the student groups.
   Student responses for pathology laboratory contribution to learning
   improved significantly compared to baseline. Increased voluntary
   attendance at pathology laboratories was observed. Spontaneous student
   comments noted the positive impact of the laboratories on their
   learning.
   Pathology laboratory innovations, including modified team-based learning
   techniques with individual and group self-assessment quizzes, multimedia
   presentations, and paired teaching by a pathologist and clinical
   gastroenterologist led to improvement in student perceptions of
   pathology laboratory contributions to their learning and better
   pathology faculty evaluations. These changes can be universally applied
   to other pathology laboratories to improve student satisfaction. (C)

Abstract = {{The time is ripe for a comprehensive mission to explore and document
   Earth's species. This calls for a campaign to educate and inspire the
   next generation of professional and citizen species explorers,
   investments in cyber-infrastructure and collections to meet the unique
   needs of the producers and consumers of taxonomic information, and the
   formation and coordination of a multi-institutional, international,
   transdisciplinary community of researchers, scholars and engineers with
   the shared objective of creating a comprehensive inventory of species
   and detailed map of the biosphere. We conclude that an ambitious goal to
   describe 10 million species in less than 50 years is attainable based on
   the strength of 250 years of progress, worldwide collections, existing
   experts, technological innovation and collaborative teamwork. Existing
   digitization projects are overcoming obstacles of the past, facilitating
   collaboration and mobilizing literature, data, images and specimens
   through cyber technologies. Charting the biosphere is enormously
   complex, yet necessary expertise can be found through partnerships with
   engineers, information scientists, sociologists, ecologists, climate
   scientists, conservation biologists, industrial project managers and
   taxon specialists, from agrostologists to zoophytologists. Benefits to
   society of the proposed mission would be profound, immediate and
   enduring, from detection of early responses of flora and fauna to
   climate change to opening access to evolutionary designs for solutions
   to countless practical problems. The impacts on the biodiversity,
   environmental and evolutionary sciences would be transformative, from
   ecosystem models calibrated in detail to comprehensive understanding of
   the origin and evolution of life over its 3.8 billion year history. The
   resultant cyber-enabled taxonomy, or cybertaxonomy, would open access to
   biodiversity data to developing nations, assure access to reliable data
   about species, and change how scientists and citizens alike access, use
   and think about biological diversity information.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of educating students to think critically and creatively
   was recognized over 2,000 years ago by Socrates, reworked in the 1950s
   by Benjamin Bloom, and reinforced by many modern-day educators. With
   changes in lifestyle brought on by innovations in digital technology,
   teachers, administrators, and parents alike are questioning the effect
   that these habits could be having on a student's ability to focus.
   Teachers, especially, are faced with challenges and unknowns in working
   with students who have grown up in a digital environment that some
   researchers warn could be disabling important systems of brain
   development that relate to lack of exposure with traditional reading.
   Faced with balancing use of traditional texts and an increase in
   technological resources, teachers are questioning whether today's
   students have the innate capability of negotiating higher-order thinking
   and generating creative ideas, as the nature of study habits undergoes
   transformation. This article explores how ability to use creative and
   higher-order thinking processes relates to exposure to modern
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays SMEs have a high quality production but relatively small
   batches respect to current automation technologies that are tailored on
   big production batches.
   There is the request to develop innovative methods and tools to increase
   flexibility and reconfigurability of systems for SMEs; the goal is short
   delivery time for high quality customized products.
   In this paper we discuss a case study of a robotic system for complex
   surfaces of statues extraction, model digitalization and generation of
   part program for rapid prototyping or small batch series production.
   A complete robotic cell was developed based on a milling manipulator
   equipped with a rotary table and a laser scanner.
   In the first section the challenging application, on the antique stone
   carving, is presented; the scanning system completely self-made at
   ITIA-CNR laboratories is able to scan, in a reliable way, in an
   uncontrolled environment and characterized by an open and modular
   architecture.
   In the second section the integration of the industrial robot with the
   laser scanner is analyzed within the calibration algorithm. The robot
   has to manipulate the scanner in order to cover all parts of the target
   object; normally each sensor position is described through an individual
   and local coordinate system, an innovative calibration routine was
   developed to allow transformation of all the data collected in a global
   and unique coordinate system.
   The system becomes fully autonomous and able of dealing with small
   production series with minimum human intervention.
   In the third section the prototype is presented with particularly
   attention on the ITIA-CNR laser scanner solution: a low cost instrument
   with high performances.
   With an innovative calibration methodology it has been possible to shift
   the focus from the components and the technological processes to the
   power of the calculus because it requires the management of a huge
   quantity of data.
   In the last section experimental results showed the solution
   flexibility.
   For example, the 3D data can be used by artists in their work and as a
   tool to realize their ideas. The artist can create sculptures one tenth
   of the size of the final sculptures and employ the milling system for
   realize a small batch production of their works of art.}},

Abstract = {{The crossover of high-speed digital electronics, MEMS, and cost
   reduction presents an exciting opportunity to extend optical lithography
   with multiple e-beam direct write systems. Massive parallelism overcomes
   the throughput limitation of e-beam direct write systems. Many
   innovative concepts on multiple e-beam imaging have been conceived and
   are being developed for various applications, such as maskwriting,
   prototyping, writing critical layers in high volume manufacturing (HVM),
   and writing all layers in HVM. MEB DW systems are capable to do all of
   the above. For maskwriting, the writing time can be saved by between a
   factor of 5 and 10 but it takes similar efforts to develop the
   maskwriting technology as direct wafer writing. There is insufficient
   demand for maskwriting and prototyping tools to warrant the development
   efforts. Writing critical layers in HVM makes economic sense for wafer
   production and makes economic sense to develop the imaging tool.
   However, using MEB DW for critical and non-critical layers, especially
   for 450-mm wafers, presents a unique opportunity to save lithography
   cost for the 450-mm wafer technology. This is the most desirable
   application for MEB DW. Once this application is established, all other
   applications easily follow.}},

Abstract = {{We describe our Innovative Multi Aperture Gimbaless Electro-Optical
   (IMAGE) testbed which uses coherent detection of the complex field
   reflected off a diffuse target with seven hexagonally arranged
   apertures. The seven measured optical fields are then phased with a
   digital optimization algorithm to synthesize a composite image whose
   angular resolution exceeds that of a single aperture. This same
   post-detection phasing algorithm also corrects aberrations induced by
   imperfect optics and a turbulent atmospheric path. We present the
   coherent imaging sub-aperture design used in the IMAGE array as well as
   the design of a compact range used to perform scaled tests of the IMAGE
   array. We present some experimental results of imaging diffuse targets
   in the compact range with two phase screens which simulates a similar to
   7{[}Km] propagation path through distributed atmospheric turbulence.}},

Abstract = {{An organization's ability to learn from past experience and observation
   of the environment around it affects the efficiency and effectiveness of
   its operations. Organizational learning (OL) theory broadly defines this
   process in terms of seeking, interpreting, and using knowledge, with the
   process triggered by a reference gap and resulting in learning. The
   ability of the organization to leverage knowledge obtained through OL
   results in absorptive capacity (ACAP). ACAP specifically measures how
   the organization acquires, assimilates, transforms, and utilizes new
   information, resulting in both knowledge and commercial outputs and
   competitive advantages. While OL describes the construction of the
   knowledge base, ACAP describes how learning results in performance,
   flexibility, and innovation. ACAP is especially critical in rapidly
   changing, complex, or highly uncertain environments requiring the
   assimilation of a great deal of information in contexts which may not be
   programmable. Today's digital environment, with the widespread
   availability of vast amounts of detailed, real-time information, renders
   the ability to screen, analyze, communicate, retrieve, store, and use
   new information into the key to increased performance, better
   organization-environment strategic fit, and lasting competitive
   advantage.}},

Journal = {{MUSIC EDUCATION RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{103-117}},
Abstract = {{This article examines one possible approach to teaching music in higher
   education with regards to creative rights and copyright. The author
   shares theoretical ideas underlying changes in content, creativity and
   culture brought about by the rise of new media and the Internet.
   Comparing examples of professional and student works, the author details
   increasingly prevalent creative practices. As these creative practices
   are intimately involved with new media, this brings increased attention
   to copyright in the classroom. The author reviews the predominant
   approach for teaching copyright, concluding that it favours compliance
   and centres on illegal downloading and digital infringement. A critique
   of the compliance approach finds four key weaknesses: first, that it
   ignores the norm/law gap; second, the inherent ambiguity in copyright
   makes compliance nearly impossible to achieve; third, a compliance
   approach is not in harmony with contemporary creative practices teachers
   should promote and; fourth, it has lead to the omission of critical
   areas that belong in every child's education. In its place, the author
   argues for a creative rights approach, focusing upon creativity and
   innovation. The article closes with three approaches for the enacting of
   a creative rights approach: recognition of student work, attention to
   the intellectual property dimensions of the curriculum and the allowance
   of transgressive works.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The growing development of information and communication technologies
   (ICTs) has influenced the use of urban spaces. People tend to depreciate
   physical place, while they extend structures of associational life
   beyond geographic limitation and focus on a place-less, networked form
   of human relationship as community. On the other hand, urban spaces are
   strategically designed and developed with the help of technological
   innovation to boost local tourism, draw global investment, and
   effectively control the public. This study deals with this
   technology-driven, bifurcated, urban spatial transformation. First, we
   discuss what drives such change and how the use of ICTs affects the way
   people use urban spaces. Based on this assessment, we address a
   normative use of ICTs for community-based urban planning. For this, we
   provide the concept, Community Informatics-Supported New Urbanism
   (CI-NU), which basically suggests ways of collaboration between
   community informatics practitioners and new urbanists to accomplish
   their shared goals of integrated community development.}},

Abstract = {{Novel methods, such as Internet-based interventions, are needed to
   combat the spread of HIV. While past initiatives have used the Internet
   to promote HIV prevention, the growing popularity, decreasing digital
   divide, and multi-functionality of social networking sites, such as
   Facebook, make this an ideal time to develop innovative ways to use
   online social networking sites to scale HIV prevention interventions
   among high-risk groups. The UCLA Harnessing Online Peer Education study
   is a longitudinal experimental study to evaluate the feasibility,
   acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of using social media for
   peer-led HIV prevention, specifically among African American and Latino
   Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). No curriculum currently exists to train
   peer leaders in delivering culturally aware HIV prevention messages
   using social media. Training was created that adapted the Community
   Popular Opinion Leader (C-POL) model, for use on social networking
   sites. Peer leaders are recruited who represent the target population
   and have experience with both social media and community outreach. The
   curriculum contains the following elements: discussion and role playing
   exercises to integrate basic knowledge of HIV/AIDS, awareness of
   sociocultural HIV/AIDS issues in the age of technology, and
   communication methods for training peer leaders in effective,
   interactive social media-based HIV prevention. Ethical issues related to
   Facebook and health interventions are integrated throughout the
   sessions. Training outcomes have been developed for long-term assessment
   of retention and efficacy. This is the first C-POL curriculum that has
   been adapted for use on social networking websites. Although this
   curriculum has been used to target African-American and Latino MSM, it
   has been created to allow generalization to other high-risk groups.}},

Title = {{Exploration and study of multilingual thesauri automation construction
   for digital libraries in China}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},

Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{233-247}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The paper aims to explore multilingual thesauri automation
   construction based on the freely available digital library resources.
   The key methods and study results are presented in the paper. It also
   proposes a way that terms are automatically extracted from multilingual
   parallel corpus.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted the technology of
   natural language processing to analyze the linguistics characteristics
   of terms, and combined this with statistical analyses to extract the
   terms from technological documents. The methods consist of automatically
   extracting and filtering terms, judging and building relationship among
   terms, building the multilingual parallel corpus, and extracting term
   pairs between Chinese and foreign languages through calculating their
   associated probability. The experiments run on the Java test platform.
   Findings - The study obtains the following conclusions: finding the
   similarities and differences between the Chinese thesaurus standard and
   international thesaurus standard. The methods for automatically
   extracting terms and building relationships among them are presented.
   Eventually the multilingual terms' translation sets are generated based
   on real corpora. The results of the study show that the proposed methods
   can obtain better performance. The effect of automatic terms'
   translation alignment method is better than that of traditional IBM
   model method.
   Practical implications - The study results can provide references for
   further study and application of multilingual thesauri automation
   construction using Chinese as a pivot.
   Originality/value - The paper proposes new ideas on thesaurus automation
   construction in the digital age. The presented method based on
   linguistics and statistics is a new attempt. According to the
   experimental results, this exploration and study is innovative and
   valuable. In addition, these ideas and methods give a good start for
   improving information services of the PRC's National Science and
   Technology Digital Library.}},

Abstract = {{This communication describes the experience gained when implementing a
   Digital Manufacturing methodology to validate the industrial design of
   the AIRBUS A400M Final Assembly Line using commercial Product Lifecycle
   Management tools. The implementation project generated a remarkable
   innovation in the industrialization methods and tools used in AIRBUS
   Military, contributing to the A400M program success. The document
   presents: the background and reasons motivating the project, the
   context, the main barriers identified and the definition of a Final
   Assembly Line (FAL). An innovative concept of industrial Digital Mock-Up
   (iDMU) was coined, representing the interoperable grouping of product,
   processes and manufacturing resources data.}},

Abstract = {{Blogs were the original poster child of digital democracy as an
   egalitarian public forum. Some scholars have challenged this theory of
   equality based on race and ethnicity, but no empirical analysis of
   American adults has questioned a class-based divide over time. Blogs, as
   a form of digital content production, appear to mirror other
   technological innovations in which a small elite group of users begin to
   incorporate them in their daily living after which the innovation
   spreads quickly to the general population, as with basic Internet
   access. However, the author argues that unlike this consumptive
   practice, blogging fits into a productive framework that requires more
   resources. Furthermore, most studies on blogging and inequality, in
   general, derive from samples of college students, which make it
   difficult to understand class issues. By drawing on 13 national surveys
   of American adults from 2002 to 2008, this study incorporates class
   differences and finds that an educational gap in blogging persists,
   rather than narrows, even among people who are online. Race and
   ethnicity do not have a relationship with class in accounting for the
   inequality.}},

Abstract = {{Amid the digital disruption for journalism, the U. S.-based Knight
   Foundation has made a highly publicized effort to shape the nature of
   news innovation. This growing influence raises questions about what it
   is trying to accomplish for mass communication and society. This
   qualitative case study shows how and why the Knight Foundation has
   sought to change journalism by renegotiating its boundaries. Namely, by
   downplaying its own historical emphasis on professionalism, the
   foundation has embraced openness to outside influence-for example, the
   wisdom of the crowd, citizen participation, and a broader definition of
   `news.'' These rhetorical adaptations have paralleled material changes
   in the foundation's funding process, typified by the Knight News
   Challenge innovation contest. In recent times, the foundation has
   undergone a further evolution from `journalism'' to `information.'' By
   highlighting its boundary-spanning interest in promoting `information''
   for communities, the Knight Foundation has been able to expand its
   capital and influence as an agent of change among fields and funders
   beyond journalism.
   ``Thus we seek to bestir the people into an awareness of their own
   condition, provide inspiration for their thoughts and rouse them to
   pursue their true interests.'' - John S. Knight (1969)}},

   studies the control system of servo spiral coining machine. We design
   the hardware of control system based on the scheme about ``PC+moving
   controller{''}, take OT 200-SV moving controller as upper control unit,
   alternating current servo driver and special alternating current servo
   electrical machinery as actuating element to constitute full-closed loop
   control system. On the basis of it, we choose Visual C++ 6.0 as
   development tool on the software, adopt modularized and object-oriented
   design procedures to design control system software.}},

Abstract = {{Digitisation projects require well-rehearsed workflows to save time and
   costs while generating high value for both content-providers and
   end-users. But cultural heritage institutions such as museums, libraries
   and archives (MLA) often lack advanced knowledge and experience in this
   field and tend to contract service providers to carry out digitisation
   services. This paper outlines an innovative approach that will enable
   the MLA community to develop their own workflows and share the knowledge
   gained with others. The core concept is to collaboratively create,
   share, modify and manage workflows without in-depth technical and
   procedural knowledge. This paper introduces the applied framework model
   and its underlying architectural principles. Its main focus lies on the
   perspective of the content-providing libraries.}},

Abstract = {{Large construction projects involve collaboration among a large number
   of participants with different specialised knowledge from various
   construction processes. A readily accessible bridge information model is
   needed to enable engineers to innovate prefabricated bridge
   construction. Three-dimensional (3D) information models can include
   multi-layered information for different users such as designer,
   contractor and owner. A construction project life-cycle management
   system was suggested to integrate and to accumulate valuable
   information. In this paper, 3D bridge information models for an
   international concrete bridge construction project were built to
   integrate design and construction processes. The 3D bridge models were
   realised by considering work breakdown structure and product breakdown
   structure to enable digital mock-up and design enhancement and to
   shorten the learning time of construction engineers. The models were
   also utilised for the fabrication of precast box segments and for the
   geometry control during construction. Assessment from the construction
   director was discussed and additional usage of the bridge information
   models was suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Front digital projection (FDP) displays have the features of being
   portable, economical and scalable for large size displays.
   Unfortunately, existing FDP technologies suffer with poor image contrast
   in well-lighted environments, due to the ``black-level{''} issues of the
   conventional white diffusive screens. More powerful projectors can be
   applied to enhance contrasts by increasing the brightness, at the
   expenses of significantly increased cost, weight, power consumption, and
   viewer eye fatigue due to the bright projection.
   In this joint paper, we demonstrate an innovative full color, high
   contrast front projective display system on a black emissive screen
   (BES). It comprises of a novel transparent fluorescent screen on
   pitch-black substrate, and a digital image projector with optic output
   that excite the fluorescent screen. The fluorescent layered screen is
   comprised of at least 3 layers of RGB emissive materials, which are made
   in fully transparent form. The ``excitation{''} projector is based on
   DLP (R) projector platform, where a UHP lamp is filtered by a color
   filter wheel which sequentially excites the RGB emissive layers
   resulting in RGB emissions from the screen.
   This display combines the best of both worlds of front projection and
   emissive display technologies. Like projection displays, it is scalable
   and economic at large displays, the screen has no pixel structure and
   can be manufactured using a roll to roll method. Like emissive displays
   ( e. g. plasma or field emission displays with phosphor screen), the
   quality of the emissive images on black back-plate is superior, with
   large viewing angles and superior contrasts in any environments. The new
   projection display can favorably compete with existing flat panel
   displays and other projection displays.}},

Abstract = {{The design of a service life extension program that is being applied to
   the modernization of continental U. S. en route air surveillance radar
   known as long range radar (LRR) network is presented. The LRR network
   consists of 69 L-band radars that are used for the joint purposes of air
   traffic control and surveillance. Initially the architecture of the
   radar system is presented and key components selected for upgrade are
   identified. In addition to hardware upgrades innovative signal
   processing algorithms have also been added.
   The upgraded radar consists of a solid state transmitter, a digital
   receiver, and a signal data processor. With advanced signal processing
   algorithms, the upgraded radar system provides 200 nmi coverage in
   natural interference environments while minimizing the false alarms. The
   radar has also been upgraded to enhance weather detection performance.}},

Title = {{The benefits of sketching for knowledge management}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{372-382}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In this paper the authors aim to review the benefits of
   sketching or ad-hoc, collaborative hand drawings for knowledge creation,
   knowledge sharing, and knowledge documentation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a comprehensive
   literature review in the fields of design, psychology and computer
   science that documents the multiple advantages of sketch-based
   approaches for managing knowledge in organizations, especially on the
   team-level. The authors argue for the complementary use of this
   ``low-tech knowledge management{''} approach with existing digital
   infrastructures and tools. The literature survey is based on a search
   for the title term ``sketching{''} on the ISI Web of Knowledge online
   database. After topic filtering and eliminating all articles where
   sketching was used in the sense of a project proposal or a theoretical
   sketch, there were only 48 articles left related to the keyword
   ``sketching{''}. Based on the authors' awareness of important
   contributions in the field of sketching, which did not appear in the
   database search, they extended their inclusion criteria to include grey
   or conference literature and examined the reference sections of highly
   cited articles. The article concludes with a set of propositions for
   practitioners regarding the use of sketching in different knowledge
   management contexts and with implications for future research in this
   area.
   Findings - Knowledge creation contexts, such as innovation management or
   problem solving sessions, provide participants with the opportunity to
   jointly devise large scale sketches in order to integrate their views
   and experiences on joint frameworks. Knowledge sharing situations, such
   as in team briefings or debriefings, in hand-over processes, or in
   strategic alliances, equip all participants with pens and paper
   tablecloths to augment their knowledge dialogues with visible means that
   facilitate interaction and turn-taking, increase vividness and
   memorability and allow for an authentic and personal follow-up
   documentation.
   Research limitations/implications - An implication for research is to
   study sketching in knowledge management through interdisciplinary
   research efforts. This could be done by paying attention to the way that
   digital and hand-drawn sketches affect interactions differently among
   professionals and the way that they share, defend, and integrate their
   knowledge. Specifically researchers with a background in organizational
   psychology could work jointly with human computer interaction
   specialists to study differences among analogue and digital sketching
   activities. In this way one can learn about the respective advantages
   and risks of hand-drawn versus computer-supported sketching for
   knowledge-intensive group collaboration tasks.
   Originality/value - The literature review resulted in an extended list
   of benefits which support three relevant tasks in knowledge management,
   namely knowledge creation, knowledge sharing and knowledge
   documentation. This compilation shows simple and effective ways in which
   the use of hand drawings can enhance existing knowledge management
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the well-known wavelength challenges in optical
   lithography, sustaining increases in total layout information density-a
   doubling every two years or so, per Moore's Law-further strains pattern
   transfer capabilities and costs for advanced designs. Emerging
   lithography methods address these barriers by leveraging optical,
   materials, and process techniques that deliver more useful information
   to the wafer image on top of modest improvements to the spatial
   bandwidth of the lithography channel. Lithography is a communication
   channel specialized in delivering high-definition, high-density physical
   images to silicon wafers. Parallels can be drawn to communication
   theory, where key innovations have steadily improved the efficiency of
   digital communication within increasingly precious bandwidth. Several
   recent lithography process innovations will be outlined in terms of

Abstract = {{Visual illusion is a new computer abstract art style in information age.
   Depending on digital design technology, applying digital image with
   visual illusion, digital jacquard fabric featuring visual illusion
   effect is produced based on the application of half-backed woven
   structure. Key technology is that using digital layered-combination
   design mode and backed structure design method, the structure of
   jacquard fabric can be designed to express entire color changes of yarn.
   If random covering effect among weft yarns were realized in compound
   fabric structure, delicate and random color transition can be produced
   on face of fabric. In this paper, the design principle and method of
   visual illusion effect digital jacquard fabric were introduced and
   analyzed with proper design illustrations and objective results. It is
   envisaged that this study has good reference to design innovation of
   digital jacquard fabric.
   Computer art, known as digital art, including computer graphics, 3D
   animation, game scenes, graphic design, web design and virtual reality,
   computer music and so on, is an emerging art form in information
   age({[}1]). Because of the restriction of the structure and color
   expression, traditional jacquard fabric cannot express the delicate and
   mutative effect of the computer visual illusion patterns. Based on the
   application of digital design techniques, it applies the methods of
   layered-combination design mode and backed structure, which possess the
   ability of perform computer visual illusion patterns and gives jacquard
   fabric a new digital style.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING}},

Pages = {{2277-2295}},
Abstract = {{Traditional `in situ' measurement techniques often fail to record the
   spatial distribution of floodplains. In that case, remote sensing
   provides inexpensive and reliable methodologies to map flooded areas and
   compute flood damage. The identification and monitoring of floods, due
   to their highly dynamic nature, require the use of high-time-resolution
   satellite images with the drawback that such images usually have low to
   medium spatial resolution. In this context, the traditional
   classification techniques would not be suitable for delineating floods
   because they use `hard methods' of classification, where the coarse
   pixel is assigned to a unique land cover class, generating inaccurate
   maps of the flooded area. In contrast, the `soft methods' assign several
   land cover classes within the coarse pixels. In this article, the
   theoretical basis regarding an innovative methodology of sub-pixel
   analysis (SA) to identify flooded areas is developed. The improvement in
   flood delineation is achieved with the use of primary topographic
   attributes, which stem from a digital elevation model (DEM). The
   methodology was applied to the monitoring of flood events in the lower
   Senegal River Valley, using satellite images with moderate spatial
   resolution. The proposed methodology was demonstrated to be effective
   for mapping the flood extent: the correct mapping of flooded areas was
   about 80\% in all considered regions, whilst the better performance of
   supervised classification was 53\%.}},

Title = {{Matrix Analysis of the Digital Divide in eHealth Services Using
   Awareness, Want, and Adoption Gap}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: The digital divide usually refers to access or usage, but
   some studies have identified two other divides: awareness and demand
   (want). Given that the hierarchical stages of the innovation adoption
   process of a customer are interrelated, it is necessary and meaningful
   to analyze the digital divide in eHealth services through three main
   stages, namely, awareness, want, and adoption.
   Objective: By following the three main integrated stages of the
   innovation diffusion theory, from the customer segment viewpoint, this
   study aimed to propose a new matrix analysis of the digital divide using
   the awareness, want, and adoption gap ratio (AWAG). I compared the
   digital divide among different groups. Furthermore, I conducted an
   empirical study on eHealth services to present the practicability of the
   proposed methodology.
   Methods: Through a review and discussion of the literature, I proposed
   hypotheses and a new matrix analysis. To test the proposed method, 3074
   Taiwanese respondents, aged 15 years and older, were surveyed by
   telephone. I used the stratified simple random sampling method, with
   sample size allocation proportioned by the population distribution of 23
   cities and counties (strata).
   Results: This study proposed the AWAG segment matrix to analyze the
   digital divide in eHealth services. First, awareness and want rates were
   divided into two levels at the middle point of 50\%, and then the
   2-dimensional cross of the awareness and want segment matrix was divided
   into four categories: opened group, desire-deficiency group,
   perception-deficiency group, and closed group. Second, according to the
   degrees of awareness and want, each category was further divided into
   four subcategories. I also defined four possible strategies, namely,
   hold, improve, evaluate, and leave, for different regions in the
   proposed matrix. An empirical test on two recently promoted eHealth
   services, the digital medical service (DMS) and the digital home care
   service (DHCS), was conducted. Results showed that for both eHealth
   services, the digital divides of awareness, want, and adoption existed
   across demographic variables, as well as between computer owners and
   nonowners, and between Internet users and nonusers. With respect to the
   analysis of the AWAG segment matrix for DMS, most of the segments,
   except for people with marriage status of Other or without computers,
   were positioned in the opened group. With respect to DHCS, segments were
   separately positioned in the opened, perception-deficiency, and closed
   groups.
   Conclusions: Adoption does not closely follow people's awareness or
   want, and a huge digital divide in adoption exists in DHS and DHCS.
   Thus, a strategy to promote adoption should be used for most demographic
   segments.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term preservation of digital film productions is a challenging
   task. Conventional storage media with relatively limited lifetimes
   require data migration at certain time intervals. As a result, today's
   digital archives need permanent care, maintenance, and thus financial
   resources. On the other hand, many cinematographic film materials offer
   an excellent long-term stability, and traditional archiving of the
   (analog) film negatives is both a safe and cost-effective long-term
   storage solution. This paper discusses an innovative approach that aims
   at using these well-established film materials for storage of digital
   data by means of ``Bits on Film.{''} Various arrangements of the digital
   data on the film are suggested, optionally also with analog image
   information on the same medium. A major focus of the paper is on
   possible applications including a discussion of their practical
   relevance.}},

Title = {{The `digital native' in context: tensions associated with importing Web
   2.0 practices into the school setting}},
Journal = {{OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{63-80}},
Abstract = {{This report draws on 53 focus group interviews conducted with students
   aged 13 and 15 in both representative and innovating UK secondary
   schools. The schedule for these discussions covered a wide range of
   issues relating to the use of Web 2.0 services both in and out of
   school. These young people were often deeply engaged with this
   technology and broadly positive as to that experience. However, they
   also identified a shared set of circumstances associated with its use
   (or potential use) in school that could be variously stressful,
   frustrating, threatening or devious. It is argued that the social and
   cognitive practices young people cultivate through the recreational use
   of Web 2.0 tools and services should not be regarded as general
   competencies. Rather those practices will be shaped and constrained by
   the particular socio-cultural settings in which such tools are used. If
   neither students nor teachers are firmly embracing Web 2.0 in the
   settings of education, then this may reflect tensions that exist between
   different ambitions and expectations associated with in-school versus
   out-of-school cultures. If adoption of Web 2.0 in education remains
   modest, the present perspective goes beyond merely denying a rhetoric of
   the `digital native'. Moreover, these findings suggest a sophisticated
   awareness among young people of institutional, social and moral tensions
   associated with modern web-based services, as well as a greater level of
   ambiguity of attitude than is normally recognised.}},

Title = {{Developing a Second Life virtual field trip for university students: an
   action research approach}},
Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{17-38}},
Abstract = {{Background: Integrating 3D virtual world technologies into educational
   subjects continues to draw the attention of educators and researchers
   alike. The focus of this study is the use of a virtual world, Second
   Life, in higher education teaching. In particular, it explores the
   potential of using a virtual world experience as a learning component
   situated within a curriculum delivered predominantly through
   face-to-face teaching methods.
   Purpose: This paper reports on a research study into the development of
   a virtual world learning experience designed for marketing students
   taking a Digital Promotions course. The experience was a field trip into
   Second Life to allow students to investigate how business branding
   practices were used for product promotion in this virtual world
   environment. The paper discusses the issues involved in developing and
   refining the virtual course component over four semesters.
   Methods: The study used a pedagogical action research approach, with
   iterative cycles of development, intervention and evaluation over four
   semesters. The data analysed were quantitative and qualitative student
   feedback collected after each field trip as well as lecturer reflections
   on each cycle.
   Sample: Small-scale convenience samples of second-and third-year
   students studying in a Bachelor of Business degree, majoring in
   marketing, taking the Digital Promotions subject at a metropolitan
   university in Queensland, Australia participated in the study. The
   samples included students who had and had not experienced the field
   trip. The numbers of students taking part in the field trip ranged from
   22 to 48 across the four semesters.
   Findings and Implications: The findings from the four iterations of the
   action research plan helped identify key considerations for
   incorporating technologies into learning environments. Feedback and
   reflections from the students and lecturer suggested that an innovative
   learning opportunity had been developed. However, pedagogical potential
   was limited, in part, by technological difficulties and by student
   perceptions of relevance.}},

Abstract = {{``Humanity 2.0{''} refers to the title of my recent book (Humanity 2.0:
   What It Means to Be Human Past, Present and Future, Palgrave Macmillan,
   2011), in which I present humanity as historically poised to
   re-negotiate its sense of collective identity. There are at least five
   reasons for this, which are addressed in this paper: (a) the prominence
   of digital technology in shaping everyday life and human
   self-understanding; (b) the advances (both promised and realized) in
   biotechnology that aim to extend the human condition, perhaps even into
   a phase that might be called ``trans-{''} or ``post-{''} human; (c) a
   growing sense of ecological consciousness (much of it promoted by a
   sense of impending global catastrophe); (d) a growing awareness of the
   biological similarity between humans and other animals, reviving doubts
   about strictly naturalistic criteria for demarcating the ``human{''};
   and (e) an increasing sense of human affection and sympathy migrating to
   animals and even androids, during a period when national health budgets
   are stretched perhaps to an unprecedented extent. The article is
   structured into two parts. The first part follows the humanistic
   implications of the claim that the computer was the innovation that most
   changed the human condition in the twentieth century. The overriding
   significance of the computer provides a gateway to our emerging sense of
   ``Humanity 2.0{''}. The second part focuses on the implications of
   Humanity 2.0 for welfare policy, concluding with a thought experiment
   concerning health policy. Here the basic point is that the ontological
   framework for conceptualizing the just liberal society is subtly
   shifting from the potential to the virtual as the normative benchmark of
   our humanity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate new entry as a
   process of organizational change against the background of the digital
   revolution in the music industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study analyzes questionnaire data
   gathered from 131 companies active in the Dutch music industry that
   collectively engaged in 215 new entries in the wake of the introduction
   of new information and communication technologies.
   Findings - The most salient finding concerns a strong positive
   relationship between financial performance and having access to the
   dominant set of institutional gatekeepers, i.e. radio DJs.
   Originality/value - This investigation prompts rethinking the concept of
   new entry, highlighting the importance of the institutional context in
   which it takes place. Beyond entry modes and new entry motivations,
   special consideration is given to specific resources that grant new
   entrants access to institutional gatekeepers because they are key
   predictors of performance upon new entry.}},

Abstract = {{While technological innovations are important for many industries,
   takeoff sales for innovative products can have long lead times due to a
   variety of factors. This article identifies the main parameters
   affecting digital camera take-off sales in the US between 2001 and 2004.
   The study constructs an empirical model for film and digital camera
   shipments and finds that digital cameras primarily served as a
   substitute for low-end film compacts rather than high-end film
   Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) cameras. Also, growth in household PC ownership
   and Windows XP market share were the main contributing factors to the
   decline of film cameras, with PC penetration rate as the most important
   factor for digital camera diffusion.}},

Abstract = {{Telecommunications have been in constant evolution during past decades.
   Among the technological innovations, the use of digital technologies is
   very relevant. Digital communication systems have proven their
   efficiency and brought a new element in the chain of signal transmitting
   and receiving, the digital processor. This device offers to new radio
   equipments the flexibility of a programmable system. Nowadays, the
   behavior of a communication system can be modified by simply changing
   its software. This gave rising to a new radio model called Software
   Defined Radio (or Software-Defined Radio - SDR). In this new model, one
   moves to the software the task to set radio behavior, leaving to
   hardware only the implementation of RF front-end. Thus, the radio is no
   longer static, defined by their circuits and becomes a dynamic element,
   which may change their operating characteristics, such as bandwidth,
   modulation, coding rate, even modified during runtime according to
   software configuration. This article aims to present the use of GNU
   Radio software, an open-source solution for SDR specific applications,
   as a tool for development configurable digital radio.}},

   repeated measures}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIA AGRICOLA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{69}},

Pages = {{210-216}},
Abstract = {{The increasing demand for raw material for multiple uses of forest
   products and by-products has attracted the interest for fast growing
   species, such as the Australian Cedar (Toona ciliata), which presents
   high productive and economic potential. This study aimed at estimating
   genotypic parameters and values for the species through the use of the
   BLUP procedure, at individual level, with repeated measures, by means of
   the conventional evaluation procedures and the introduction of
   innovative digitalization of the measurements by digital camera with the
   images provided by the Imagej software system. The main objective is to
   subsidize the beginning of a breeding program for the species. The
   assays were carried out in private properties, in plantations located in
   the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The results generated by three
   evaluations revealed that the image digital analysis is adequate to
   quantify characteristics of Toona ciliata. It is also an effective and
   accurate alternative to minimize the costs of data collection in
   evaluations with the species. There was high accuracy for the characters
   plant height, diameter at breast height and cylindrical volume. Out of
   the 90 genotypes evaluated, 38 expressed genotypic values predicted for
   the diameter at breast height higher than the general average of this
   character, 33 for the cylindrical volume and 49 for height, allowing
   gains of up to 24.9\% in average for cylindrical volume. The method of
   mixed models (REML/BLUP) applied via the SELE-GEN software system, using
   the BLUP procedure at individual level and repeated measures in each
   individual proved to be adequate to estimate the genetic parameters and
   predict genotypic values in situations of unbalanced data. Therefore, it
   is very useful and practical for Toona ciliata genetic breeding
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents a case study of a user-centred design process of an
   energy service to be used by households. This case study is used to
   explore the nature of participation of users in the design process. The
   purpose of the design was to create a prototype for an IT-based service
   to facilitate for households to learn about their electricity
   consumption and implicitly to reduce it. By applying methods from
   human-computer interaction (HCI) throughout the design process, we
   designed the digital prototype EnergyCoach. The final prototype of
   EnergyCoach is structured to visualise electricity consumption in
   households and to coach members of the household in learning about, and
   reducing their own consumption. The service is mediated through a
   combination of a web-based platform and one for the mobile phone.
   EnergyCoach was tested and evaluated in its intended context.
   Qualitative interviews were carried out with six households who tested
   the service for six months in their home environment. Results reveal
   that although the design of EnergyCoach was appreciated and the service
   as such considered useful, informants varied in how frequently they used
   it. Reasons to this are discussed and related to methods for early and
   later phases of the design process.}},

Abstract = {{A constant-temperature anemometer has been developed which uses a single
   high-fidelity speaker driver as a combined signal and power amplifier.
   Owing to its small size and simplicity of construction, the anemometer
   is well suited for applications requiring a large number of channels
   (such as hot-wire rakes) as well as applications requiring the embedding
   of instrumentation within confined experimental models (such as
   reduced-scale wind turbine blades). The anemometer is shown to have
   performance characteristics similar to those of a commercial anemometer
   when used under its design conditions. An operating bandwidth as high as
   10 kHz can be achieved, which is greater than most available
   time-resolved digital particle-image velocimetry systems and is shown to
   be sufficient to track large-scale turbulence structures in channel
   flow. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A 4-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) scheme for the
   HIgh Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) forecasting system is
   described in this article. The innovative approaches to the
   multi-incremental formulation, the weak digital filter constraint and
   the semi-Lagrangian time integration are highlighted with some details.
   The implicit dynamical structure functions are discussed using single
   observation experiments, and the sensitivity to various parameters of
   the 4D-Var formulation is illustrated. To assess the meteorological
   impact of HIRLAM 4D-Var, data assimilation experiments for five periods
   of 1 month each were performed, using HIRLAM 3D-Var as a reference. It
   is shown that the HIRLAM 4D-Var consistently out-performs the HIRLAM
   3D-Var, in particular for cases with strong mesoscale storm
   developments. The computational performance of the HIRLAM 4D-Var is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of the Eastern Quebec telepathology project is to
   provide uniform diagnostic telepathology services across a huge
   geographic region with a low population density. This project is
   intended to provide surgeons and pathologists with frozen section and
   second opinion services anywhere and at any time across the entire
   region in order to avoid unnecessary patient transfer.
   Methods: The project has been implemented in 21 sites, each equipped
   with a whole slide scanner, a macroscopy station, two videoconferencing
   devices and a viewer/case management and collaboration solution. Of the
   21 sites, 6 are devoid of a pathology laboratory. Of the remaining 15
   sites, two have no pathologists, 6 have one and 7 have two or more.
   Results: The project has been successful and most appreciated by
   pathologists and surgeons. We report a number of challenges related to
   change management that we had to take into account in the course of
   implementation of this network. The challenges underscore the need for
   regular visits and active support to participating centers by the
   project team.
   Conclusion: The Eastern Quebec telepathology network is successful and
   improves medical care in this region. In the course of implementation,
   we encountered a number of challenges which required innovative
   solutions.}},

Title = {{Finding support for disruption: developing a digital humanities project
   in Mexico}},
Journal = {{ASLIB PROCEEDINGS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{97-103}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper seeks to provide a description and reflection on
   some of the structural problems and challenges faced when developing a
   digital humanities (DH) project in a Mexican public university.
   Design/methodology/approach - As DH is a relatively new field and
   practice in Mexican academia, this article is based on a case study of
   developing the Biblioteca Digital de Pensamiento Novohispano (Digital
   Library of New Hispanic Thought). This is one of the few DH at the
   Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), the largest public
   university in the country.
   Findings - It was found that there were three central problems for
   developing a DH project in a Mexican public university: existing
   technical knowledge and abilities at the UNAM will be challenged by DH
   projects; projects are the place to train human resources in DH
   methodology; and researchers need to consider different long-term
   infrastructure and hosting solutions, with or without using
   institutional infrastructure, at the same time researches need to work
   within the institution to establish a specific policy for research
   projects.
   Practical implications - The paper concludes that the structure, goals
   and products of DH projects need to be modified and expanded in order to
   also consider alternative goals and products such as: proposals of
   institutional policy, creation of infrastructure and academic and
   student training. DH projects must be regarded as disruptive, that is
   that the project needs to assume rupture as a part of the project
   itself.
   Originality/value - The experience of innovation and disruption is not
   necessarily the same in all fields and all institutions. This article
   documents for the first time the particular experiences of a public
   university in a developing country with DH projects. It has been found
   that the delay in using computers in the humanities in Mexico has led to
   the development of a specific paradox: a gap between institutional
   interest and disposition in the use of computers in humanities, and the
   lack of DH culture in those who have to develop the project.}},

   librarians}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{10-19}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This lecture, reflecting on future roles, posits the potential
   dawning of a ``great age of librarians,'' if librarians make the
   conceptual shift of focusing on their own skills and activities rather
   than on their libraries.
   Discussion: In the digital age, physical libraries are becoming less
   relevant to the communities that they serve. Librarians, however, are
   more necessary than ever in helping members of their communities
   navigate the increasingly complex information space. To meet their
   social responsibilities requires that librarians seek new roles and
   recognize that their most important activities will take place outside
   of the physical library.
   Conclusion: A great age of librarians is possible, but not guaranteed.
   We are at the very beginning of the development of a digital culture
   that parallels the print culture that has been dominant for five hundred
   years. Innovative and creative librarians have the potential to shape
   the development of that culture in ways that will truly serve the needs
   of their communities.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To determine, by postal questionnaire, the demographic
   profile and practising details of general dental practitioners in the UK
   in 2008. Methods A piloted 89 question postal questionnaire was
   distributed in 2007/2008 to 1,000 dentists, with effective addresses in
   the UK, whose names and addresses were obtained by random selection from
   the General Dental Council (GDC) register. Results Six hundred and
   ninety-one questionnaires were returned, of which 662 were useable - an
   acceptable 66\% useable response rate. Of the respondents, 69\% were
   male and 59\% were practice principals. Fifty-three percent of the
   respondents' practices were in town or city centres with a wide
   geographic distribution. Single-handed practitioners accounted for 17\%
   of respondents, with the mean number of dentists per practice being 3.6
   (median 3.0). Typically, respondents' practices provided a mean of 26
   patient care sessions per week, with each dentist treating on average 15
   patients per session - 16 minutes per patient on average including
   surgery turnaround time, assuming 4 hour sessions. Hygienists typically
   treated seven patients per session - 34 minutes per patient on average
   including surgery turnaround time, assuming 4 hour sessions. Respondents
   stated that 57\% of patients were treated under the NHS arrangements,
   with 28\% being private, 7\% independent and 7\% insurance-based.
   Responses indicated that 73\% of the respondents used a computerised
   patient management system, 67\% had an internet connection and 60\% used
   email, principally for correspondence, ordering materials and other uses
   such as referrals and research. Forty-five percent of respondents owned
   an intra-oral camera, with 45\% of those using it routinely. Regarding
   new concepts, the use of nickel-titanium endodontic files (61\%),
   digital imaging (28\%) and zirconia all-ceramic bridgework (27\%) were
   the most frequently cited innovations currently used by the respondents.
   Regarding the most notable changes in findings when compared with a
   related study conducted in 2000, these were connected to the method of
   payment with the proportion of NHS patients dropping to 57\% compared
   with 86\%; the volume of postgraduate education undertaken by dentists,
   with a 50\% increase in the proportion of respondents having attended
   five or more courses each year (63\% compared with 40\% in 2000); and
   the use of zirconia all-ceramic bridgework (27\% of respondents).
   Conclusions The findings of the present study are considered to indicate
   increasing commercialism of dentistry in the UK, with evidence of many
   practitioners adopting new technologies, underpinned by substantial
   participation in postgraduate education.}},

Abstract = {{The key innovation in Hadamard transform spectral imager (HTSI)
   introduced recently is the use of digital micro-mirror device (DMD) to
   encode spectral information. However, it brings some new problems for us
   to solve synchronously. An interlaced encoding phenomenon caused by the
   application of DMD to our HTSI was investigated and analyzed. These
   interlaced encoding pixels were not encoded based on Hadamard transform;
   therefore they should be processed specially in spectrum recovery. To
   improve the quality of the recovered spectral images, a positioning
   method and a decoding method for the interlaced encoding pixels were
   proposed. In our experiment, we first directed a beam of laser into our
   HTSI to fill the field of view and labeled the positions of the
   interlaced encoding pixels. Then we recorded two groups of the encoded
   images of the target by changing the positions of all the encoding
   channels on the DMD. The interlaced encoding pixels could be
   distinguished easily by observing the number of non-zero constants and
   zero elements in a column vector which is made up of the gray values of
   a pixel of the encoded images in sequence. The interlaced encoding
   pixels of the first group of the encoded images turned into the normal
   Hadamard encoding pixels of the second group of the encoded images. The
   interlaced encoding pixels of the first group of the encoded images can
   be decoded through applying inverse Hadamard transform to the
   corresponding pixels of the second group of the encoded images. The
   experimental results prove the feasibility of the decoding method.}},

Abstract = {{Lately, the sense of chronic time pressure promotes the need for a
   reexamination of media temporal configuration. The basic assumption of
   this article is that the spread of neoliberalist ideas, together with
   technological innovations (e.g., digital TV, digital remote control, and
   digital video recorder), has encouraged the privatization of media time,
   leading to the experience of media time squeezing. To be more concrete,
   multichannel applications allow control over viewing schedules, time
   settings, and time flow. But while the diffusion of digital
   technological platforms has made privatization of the television time
   sphere possible, the regulation of these technologies is based on state
   time management subject to traditional, linear, nontechnological
   principles. Moreover, even though neoliberalism facilitates systematic
   deregulation and privatization in the arena of television and new media,
   one cannot overlook the dualism sustained between technological vision
   and cultural substantiation.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to compare the thermal comfort levels in conventional
   and innovative residences of Projeto CASA (Center of Alternative Energy
   System Analysis) from UNIOESTE - campus of Cascavel. The measures of the
   thermal comfort parameters were accomplished using digital
   thermo-hygrometers, in all of the rooms of the residences and in the
   outer area, in different hours of the day. We used the Temperature and
   Humidity Index to compare the obtained results. The innovative residence
   presented lower values of Temperature and Humidity Index than the
   conventional residence, justifying its differentiated architecture in
   order to obtain a higher thermal comfort.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a broadband diffusion analysis for European OECD
   member countries. The Bass diffusion model is used to estimate the total
   number of potential adopters, the coefficient of innovation and the
   coefficient of imitation. The analysis shows that if the present trends
   continue broadband services will not reach the 100\% penetration rate in
   the near future. Based on these findings, the question of a possible
   revitalization is discussed with a focus on those segments of the
   population which are slower to adopt broadband. A survey of households
   in rural areas provides preliminary investigation of reasons for
   continuing non-adoption, such as social habits and lack of both
   knowledge and interest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X Add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements) is a
   high-resolution interferometric mission with the main goal of providing
   a global and unprecedentedly accurate digital elevation model of the
   Earth surface by means of single-pass X-band synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR) interferometry. Despite its usual quasi-monostatic configuration,
   TanDEM-X is the first genuinely bistatic SAR system in space. During its
   monostatic commissioning phase, the system has been mainly operated in
   pursuit monostatic mode. However, some pioneering bistatic SAR
   experiments with both satellites commanded in nonnominal modes have been
   conducted with the main purpose of validating the performance of both
   space and ground segments in very demanding scenarios. In particular,
   this letter reports about the first bistatic acquisition and the first
   single-pass interferometric (mono-/bistatic) acquisition with TanDEM-X,
   addressing their innovative aspects and focusing on the analysis of the
   experimental results. Even in the absence of essential synchronization
   and calibration information, bistatic images and interferograms with
   similar quality to pursuit monostatic have been obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The historical buildings and archeological sites of countries belong to
   the cultural heritage and need to be protected and preserved for next
   generations. The innovations and improvements in digital imaging sensors
   and scanners, surveying equipment, computer modeling, as well as the
   availability of many powerful graphics PCs and workstations make
   rendering methods for digital documentation with 3D modeling
   functionality feasible. Digital documentation methods of the historical
   buildings and archeological sites are an important tool for monitoring
   and conservation. Topographical documentation methods are well suited
   for such purposes. These methods include GPS and remote sensing
   techniques. 3D modeling and digital recording of historical buildings in
   several locations from Alba County was and still is conducted. These
   works showed the necessity of using data from different sources having a
   very large spatial extension like site. Aerial and space images can be
   used together to produce the digital elevation model (DEM) of the area.
   Local objects such as historical buildings should be modeled by advanced
   topographical and CAD methods.}},

Abstract = {{Within the 3rd International Digital Citizenship Conference celebrated
   in San Sebastian-Spain in May 8th, we took part in a round table debate
   about the use of Smartphone in education with teenagers. There is an
   open discussion about the benefits or threats of using such an
   innovative technology. Usually the main trend is to forbid the use of
   mobile phones in the classroom. We bet for considering the use of any
   technology if it can benefit somehow our learning/teaching process.
   Smartphones are very powerful devices that can be used in many
   innovative ways. We can profit their availability, since many students
   have one. In this paper we analyze how different authors understand
   mobile learning, we review previous experiences and their results in
   educational institutions using mobile learning, and we reflect on the
   threats and opportunities of using mobile devices in education. Finally
   we show an approach to a new educational paradigm that is being
   implemented thanks to the educational revolution derived from the use of
   mobile devices and we provide simple guidelines for its implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The rate of change of knowledge and information that is required in
   working and social environments as well as the rate at which knowledge
   is produced in every sector of human activity creates the need for
   institutions, companies and people to redefine the strategy of managing
   knowledge {[}1]. The aim of this work is to study the role of
   three-dimensional virtual environment (3DVEs) in the creation and
   development of Personal Learning Networks (PLNs). More specifically this
   work focuses on investigating the role of Education Orientated Groups
   (hereafter ``Groups{''}) in Second Life (SL). It studies the role of
   Groups in the creation and development of PLNs. The work explores the
   reasons that urge members of SL Groups in the adoption of 3DVE and the
   ways in which they use them to create and develop their PLN. For the
   purposes of the study, a qualitative approach is applied and the model
   of electronic interviews, Salmons, {[}2] is adopted. The collaborative
   and creative social characteristics of these environments encourage
   access to digital learning communities and contribute to the creation of
   new PLNs, while participation in activities organized by the Groups not
   only provides access to excellence and leadership in knowledge but also
   promotes innovative ideas on a global scale. The development of PLN, in
   these environments, facilitate professional and personal development,
   through sharing educational resources and developing good educational
   practices without spatial and temporal constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is an emerging nanotechnology
   paradigm that is currently being investigated as a possible CMOS
   substitute. It offers higher speed and lower area and power consumption
   than CMOS transistors. However, due to its intrinsic pipelined nature,
   QCA circuits suffer from serious throughput reductions due to feedback
   signals. As a consequence to fully exploit the true potential of this
   technology, circuits architecture must be designed with the aim to
   reduce or eliminate the presence of feedbacks.
   This work proposes as a relevant design case, the QCA implementation of
   Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Algorithm. A novel architecture for partial
   parallel FFT processor is presented which not only reduces the circuit
   complexity but also eliminates the need of feedback signals, allowing to
   maximize the throughput. The proposed architecture is described using an
   accurate, layout aware VHDL model which is exploited in a hierarchical
   bottom up approach to evaluate the logical behavior, area and power
   dissipation of whole design. This innovative approach widely expands the
   field of application for QCA circuits.}},

Abstract = {{A pre-fabricated printed circuit board (PCB) was designed to demonstrate
   the functions of the combinational circuits: half-adder, full-adder,
   half-subtractor, and full-subtractor. A Manual containing guidelines on
   how to assemble the PCB, and experiments to be performed using the
   assembled PCB, was also prepared. The PCB and Manual were mass-produced
   and distributed to four hundred and ten (410) respondents classified as
   student-respondents (400) and faculty-respondents (10), from four (4)
   different universities. The student-respondents were specializing in
   Computer Engineering (CoE), Electronics and Communications Engineering
   (ECE), Computer Technology (CT), Electronics Technology (ET), and
   Electronics and Communication Engineering Technology (ECT). The
   faculty-respondents were engineering instructors, lecturers and
   professors teaching digital electronics.
   Respondents were asked to use and evaluate the PCB in terms of
   functionality, reliability and ease of use. Likewise, they were asked to
   evaluate the Manual in terms of thoroughness, clarity of instructions,
   and ease of use. For the PCB, findings of the study showed a mean
   distribution of 1.78-2.00 for functionality, 1.69-2.00 for reliability,
   and 1.57-2.00 for ease of use. The Manual has a mean distribution of
   1.80-2.10 for thoroughness, 1.70-2.00 for clarity of instructions, and
   1.91-2.09 for ease of use.
   The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, alpha = 0.05) showed that there is no
   significant difference in the evaluation of the PCB in terms of
   respondents' classification (rho=0.815), and specialization (rho=0.726),
   but there is significant difference in terms of gender (rho=0.016) and
   university to which the respondents belong (rho=0.000).}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of content distribution on the Internet has brought
   with it proportional increases in the costs of distributing content.
   Adding to distribution costs is the fact that digital content is easily
   duplicable, and hence can be shared in an illicit peer-to-peer (P2P)
   manner that generates no revenue for the content provider. In this
   paper, we study whether the content provider can recover lost revenue
   through a more innovative approach to distribution. In particular, we
   evaluate the benefits of a hybrid revenue-sharing system that combines a
   legitimate P2P swarm and a centralized client-server approach. We show
   how the revenue recovered by the content provider using a
   server-supported legitimate P2P swarm can exceed that of the
   monopolistic scheme by an order of magnitude. Our analytical results are
   obtained in a fluid model, and supported by stochastic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Daylighting has an important role in sustainable architecture as it
   affects the energy consumption in a building. Especially for an office
   building, daylight helps not only to reduce the load on artificial
   lighting but also to promote work efficiency through promoting good
   human health, wellbeing and user comfort.
   The objective of this research is to invent an innovative facade design
   strategy that comes from the development of digital technology and
   dynamic daylight performance measuring methods. Thus, the various
   parameters are studied through the computational process of Cellular
   Automata (CA) to generate the several alternative opening patterns on
   the building facade. The each CA design values were tested under static
   and dynamic sky condition to analyze the quality and quantity of
   daylight and visual comfort throughout the whole year. The results were
   compared to find the optimum alternative designs in terms of the
   daylighting design criteria, which were researched from building code,
   standard and design guidelines for the office building.
   Finally, the research of an adaptive facade design strategy was
   concluded with the results from the above hybridization of generative
   and performative design methodology. This study discovers the
   architectural design approach from the CA and it will make not only
   progress in building facade aesthetics, but also human comfort with
   building sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{This research describes a case study of a project to develop a web-based
   Virtual Teaching Assistant System (ViTAS) for college students and
   instructors. ViTAS, a digital homework assignments submission and
   grading system, is an innovative idea to provide homework assignments
   grading system for the instructors and to provide an interactive
   learning environment outside the lecture period for the students. Using
   ViTAS, students will be able to submit the homework assignments online,
   to engage in anonymous homework review, and to discuss with their peers.
   The idea of students grading the homework assignments of their peers is
   very beneficial, because during the process of grading other's homework,
   the students get the opportunity to learn/review their own
   work/mistakes. Also, the instructors finalize all grades and post them
   on the website to confirm the students' learning activities. In
   particular, this project focuses on the Agile software development
   process, which is a group of software development methodologies based on
   iterative, interactive, and incremental development, where requirements
   and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing and
   cross-functional teams; i.e., software development and user-experience
   design of the ViTAS. Also, the research considers that the teams are
   working cooperatively rather than collaboratively and this cooperation
   is implemented via articulation work, meaning that the developers had
   additional tasks to ensure that the user-experience design is
   accomplished. Overall, the paper provides an insight into a culture
   where developers and user experience designers work together, adds
   evidence to support the Agile principle of self-organizing teams and
   recommends the recognition of interaction tasks as valuable work in
   Agile software development.}},

Abstract = {{Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) is a new provider of Engineering
   in New Zealand and faces numerous challenges. These include a general
   ignorance of engineering amongst our secondary school students and very
   strong competition from established providers. Traditional marketing
   strategies have been unsuccessful in achieving the level of growth our
   programme requires. In collaboration with the regional polytechnic,
   Wellington Institute of Technology (WelTec), VUW undertook a major
   exercise to identify issues relevant to recruitment and retention in the
   ``digital{''} engineering specializations. This paper considers the
   recruitment aspect of this project. Demographic studies indicate that
   our target audience strongly identify with being ``geeks{''}, something
   that no New Zealand tertiary training institute incorporates into its
   marketing strategy. In response, a novel website, hard-copy ``geek
   hero{''} publication and clothing range was created. The publications
   have been extremely well received by secondary school students, teachers
   and career advisors. Informative and promotional posters have also been
   created for display in secondary school laboratories and classrooms.
   Whilst final enrolment numbers are not at this stage known, one
   indicator of the success of our initiatives can be seen in the
   unprecedented increase in pre-enrolment numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Programmable logic devices have revolutionized the way in which digital
   circuits are built. FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) and CPLDs
   (Complex Programmable Logic Devices) have become the standards for
   implementing digital systems. FPGAs and CPLDs offer much higher circuit
   density, improved reliability, and fewer system components when compared
   with traditional digital design using discrete small-scale or
   medium-scale integrated circuits, all of which make programmable logic
   devices very attractive to the digital designer. However, these devices
   hide important details involved in understanding digital fundamentals,
   and the resulting hardware is really more of a computer-generated black
   box than it is a carefully crafted, finetuned design. Creativity in the
   design is less visible when using FPGAs or CPLDs, and designers are not
   rewarded as satisfyingly for ``elegant{''} solutions to design problems.
   FPGAs and CPLDs implement solutions to digital design problems quickly
   and economically, both qualities that are important in an industrial
   setting. However, in an educational setting, the solution is not as
   important as understanding how the solution is reached, and these
   programmable devices automate and hide that process, making them less
   attractive as educational tools. Teaching digital design in a
   programmable logic device arena requires the instructor to inform
   students what is going on behind the scenes in the synthesis software.
   Otherwise, digital design degenerates into just another programming
   exercise, albeit using a hardware description language rather than
   traditional software languages.
   During Fall semester 2011, programmable logic devices were used for the
   first time 1 as the basis for lab exercises in a second semester,
   advanced digital design laboratory at UMD, replacing design using
   discrete digital integrated circuits. The experience exposed some
   limitations imposed by the technology. For example, when circuits must
   avoid logic hazards (momentary `` glitches{''} during transitions) as in
   asynchronous finite state machine design, FPGAs cannot be used properly,
   and CPLDs must be coerced into working by clumsily `` fooling{''} the
   synthesis software. These specific digital circuit designs cannot be
   mapped cleanly to programmable devices without some innovative
   techniques. This paper reveals some of the author's experiences in
   adapting his digital design laboratory to the programmable logic device
   arena.
   Programmable logic devices, though attractive to the experienced
   designer, can be awkward to use in certain educational settings. Digital
   design instructors must be aware of their limitations. Instructors must
   find creative ways around the limitations, and must restrain themselves
   from being brainwashed by the glitz of FPGAs and CPLDs. This paper
   identifies techniques for maintaining the excitement and rewards of
   creative digital design within the confined restrictions of a
   programmable logic device arena.}},

Abstract = {{College graduates should be prepared to work in culturally diverse
   workplaces, work across national borders and understand global
   challenges. Engineering students seem to have fewer opportunities during
   their studies, than those in liberal arts and business, due to a very
   packed technical curriculum and sometimes the high cost of education.
   In the electrical and computer engineering, as the complexity of
   microelectronic systems is steadily increasing, universities must update
   their curricula to cope with the increased demands of research and
   development required in industry. By integrating Digital Design
   competitions into the undergraduate and graduate education, students are
   better prepared to enter the field of engineering and make more
   meaningful contributions to their firms at an earlier rate. According to
   published reports, looking at particular skills and attributes needed
   for engineers, top priorities in terms of future skills will be:
   practical applications, theoretical understanding and creativity and
   innovation.
   Trying to address the above mentioned issues, instructors at different
   universities in Europe, USA, China and India joined efforts and have
   integrated an annual Digital Design Competition open to students
   enrolled in Electrical and Computer Engineering and similar majors such
   as Electronics and Telecommunications, Computer Science, etc.
   This paper presents the results of organizing regional competitions in
   Europe, USA, China and India and the results of the First Global
   Digilent Design Competition, collocated with FPGAWorld conference in
   Munich, Germany. The logistics and challenges of the regional and global
   competitions, the results of the past editions and plans regarding the
   future of the regional and global competitions are presented.
   Evaluations of the competition and students' perceptions as an
   alternative learning experience were investigated through student
   surveys.}},

Abstract = {{WISEngineering is an innovative, free online learning environment that
   supports students through engineering design projects designed to
   improve science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning in
   middle and high school classes. WISEngineering builds from an informed
   engineering design pedagogy, knowledge integration learning framework
   and the open-source Web-based Inquiry Science Environment technologies.
   WISEngineering uses engineering design modules to facilitate engineering
   habits of mind such as systems thinking, creativity, optimism,
   collaboration as well as standard-based mathematics and science
   concepts. In these modules, students use CAD technologies and digital
   fabrication to create, build, and refine their designs. The environment
   leverages technologies such as an electronic design journal, portfolio
   and ``design wall{''} that enables students to create, share, critique,
   and communicate with their peers. These engineering design projects give
   students a context and real-life application for learning math and
   science concepts.
   The Community Challenge project sequence engages 7th grade students in
   the design of their local community. The first two-week project guides
   students through the design of a community building, the second project
   involves students in designing a community garden, and the third project
   engages students in designing windmill and solar panel systems to help
   power their building and garden. This presentation focuses on the first
   project in the sequence, the Community Building project. Students are
   given volume and surface area constraints and specifications for their
   building design. Based on these parameters, students must learn and
   apply several Common Core Mathematical Standards of Geometry, Ratios and
   Proportional Relationships, and Expressions and Equations. Once students
   have their initial design, they create and refine models using digital
   fabrication technologies. The Community Building project leverages the
   success of the Skyline Design project that has demonstrated success
   improving students' understanding of standards-based math concepts.
   This paper provides an outline of a work-in-progress study of the
   Community Building project. This implementation involves around 200 7th
   grade low performing students in an urban middle school. Pretest,
   posttest, and embedded assessments, as well as targeted interviews, have
   been designed to assess learner outcomes in mathematical understanding,
   engineering habits of mind, and an interest in STEM subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Multimedia Systems is becoming very important in undergraduate
   education. The word multimedia refers to speech, audio and video data.
   Speech, audio and video and general digital signal processing (DSP)
   devices are very common-place in everyday life. This is due to the
   growth of popularity of personal digital assistants (PDA), cellular
   phones, and other embedded speech/audio/video devices. One of the major
   applications of DSP processors is in speech, audio and video processing.
   We are developing a 3-part course sequence that will help teach
   undergraduates multimedia systems. The first part of the 3-part course
   sequence is about speech. The second and third parts will focus on audio
   and video. The goal is to demystify these applications of real-time
   multimedia signal processing so that undergraduates can have a mastery
   of the basic techniques.
   In this paper, we provide details of a course we designed for
   undergraduates which focuses on understanding how to process speech. We
   provide examples of the curriculum, what is covered and how we cover it.
   We also provide examples of laboratory projects that are used to
   complement the class lecture sessions. We use MATLAB software in all the
   lab projects.
   We also discuss possible implementations of the speech coding and
   processing using hardware such as DSPs. In the future, we plan to
   introduce the use of FPGAs for this application as well.
   Details of the course and our experiences in developing and offering
   them will be presented at the conference.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical and computer engineering students at our university are
   required during their junior year to take a three credit lecture course
   and a two credit laboratory in analog electronics. Over the past seven
   years, several attempts have been made to enhance student learning
   through participation in PBL projects. In Project-based learning
   ``PBL{''}, since the project is developed by the instructor and the
   learning path is predictable, student creativity, ingenuity and
   innovation may be diminished. In order to provide opportunities for
   student creativity and innovation, a service oriented project was
   introduced in the fall of 2011. Project-based service oriented learning
   ``PBSOL{''} is a learner-focused form of active learning where students
   work to solve a real life problem while also providing a rich learning
   experience.
   Since the major topics of study in analog electronics include the study
   of such semiconductor devices as diodes, zener diodes, BJT's
   transistors, and MOSFETs, the projects were required to be designed
   around the use of an Amplitude Shift Keying ``ASK{''} transmitter and
   receiver. The project makes use of previous knowledge such as impedance,
   resonance, loading, and matching, learned in their Circuits I and
   Circuits II courses while challenging their search for future topics
   such as RF communication theory, digital electronics, and
   microcontrollers, which are learned in later engineering courses. The
   wireless characteristics of the ASK transmitter and receiver promoted
   the design of such service projects as a wireless security system, a
   mail alert system, and a wireless home control system for a handicapped
   person.
   In the lab course, students work in small teams and have 12 weeks to
   design and implement their service oriented project. During the first
   two weeks, research is conducted about their project ideas, followed by
   several weeks of draft designs, re-calculations and testing. At the end
   of the semester they must write a report, deliver a Power Point
   presentation, and demonstrate their project. Surveys were conducted
   before and after each design session, and at the end of the final
   project. Student understanding and mastery of the course content was
   measured using quizzes, tests, the project presentations, and written
   final reports. A comparison between this year's results and the previous
   year's results is included. Improvement of student learning and the
   development of decision-making skills through service oriented projects
   may prompt the implementation of other projects that may include
   multidisciplinary collaboration, integration of projects between
   classes, and projects across concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Much of formal educational provision correctly focuses on developing
   critical numeracy and literacy skills. Contemporary living in a digital
   image culture supports education now developing what Fish 1 describes as
   our visualizing instinct.
   At second level the national graphics curriculum in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has
   moved from Technical Drawing (TD) to Design and Communication Graphics
   (DCG). The traditional vocational focus is now replaced with learning
   graphics through design driven activities, which encourage outcomes of
   innovation and creativity. While students still develop subject specific
   content knowledge, drafting skills and communication skills, the
   approach to learning is concerned with the design process as a vehicle
   for transferable learning.
   Capturing the process of learning and not the product can be a challenge
   for conventional assessment methods. This paper explores the impact of
   determinist and non-determinist approaches to assessment on the nature
   and outcomes of the learning activity.
   The method employed an off-set cohort analysis type study to explore the
   performance and output of two homogenous groups of initial teacher
   education students (stratified sample n=40). Group one were given
   defined assessment criteria, while the second group were expected to
   define the criteria based on their definition of graphical capability.
   The paper highlights the variance between groups in selecting, applying
   and executing appropriate graphical principles and medium, while solving
   an identical design brief.
   The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding the
   impact of assessment criteria on student performance. Students, who
   constructed not only their own meaning, but also the rationale for their
   meaning, demonstrated a higher level of graphical capability.}},

Abstract = {{The ICE-HS was developed to address the need to define an engineering
   curriculum in a charter high school. The research team reviewed several
   vendor prescribed curricula such as project lead the way and infinity,
   and digital libraries funded by NSF and ASEE such as
   teachengineering.org, cadrek12. org and egfi.org. The inflexibility of
   vendor sold curricula and lack of structure with the digital libraries
   posed some challenges for teaching engineering in high school. The
   school needed some customization of available curricula for implementing
   a discrete engineering course The ICE-HS was thus developed to address
   this need. The ICE-HS presents a step-by - step methodology for
   developing a four-year high school engineering curriculum framework
   based on backward design and systems thinking approaches. The ICE-HS is
   structured around two major objectives: attracting the high school
   students to STEM and providing a flexible engineering foundation. It
   does not prescribe specific modules but offers integration with the
   other disciplines such as language/arts and traditional science courses.
   The ICE-HS uses digital libraries and vendor sold curricula providing a
   framework that allows the school to customize its delivery for
   appropriate grades and levels.
   The ICE-HS is currently being piloted in a charter high school, Da Vinci
   School for Science and the Arts. This paper presents the ICE-HS
   approach, syllabus of each of the courses developed using ICE-HS, and
   initial data indicating positive impact on student learning}},

Abstract = {{Legacy ATE typically requires economical obsolescence upgrades ranging
   from minor to major at various points during its life cycle, due to
   availability and viability of repair assets. System level replacement
   costs are generally prohibitive. For mature systems where significant
   investments in TPS software and hardware have been made, there is
   substantial incentive to maintain compatibility with legacy operation in
   order to preserve the cumulative investment in Test Program Set (TPS)
   assets. The ATE assets may be obsolete for many reasons, but shifts in
   microcircuit level technology seem to be a recurrent theme. Therefore,
   the replacement asset may operate significantly different internally
   than the legacy asset even though it may be advertised as a plug and
   play replacement. We will follow a major obsolescence upgrade for the
   Avionics Intermediate Shop (AIS), where three automated stations are
   being upgraded after more than thirty years in the field. While TPS
   changes are allowed where absolutely required, we determined that the
   lowest risk and lowest cost approach was to preserve legacy performance
   at the asset level where possible. Assets to be replaced include the
   computer, display, printer, digital multimeter, frequency counter,
   waveform digitizer, spectrum analyzer, waveform generators, synchro
   generator, synchro receiver, digitizer calibrator, pneumatic controller
   and pneumatic pump. The legacy computer precedes the microprocessor era
   and does not employ standardized word sizes, which presents some
   interesting design challenges. The computer communicates via custom
   designed buses, mostly clocked serial although parallel direct memory
   address (DMA) buses were used for critical high throughput instruments.
   The test programs are written in F-15 Adapted PLACE ATLAS (FAPA), which
   the offline compiler converts into assembly language then machine code
   for the legacy computer. Aspects of the test programs are timing
   critical, so an approach using indeterminate software emulation of the
   legacy computer was not completely compatible with the existing TPSs due
   to instabilities. The original AIS instruments were largely custom
   designed for military usage before commercial instruments with extended
   operating ranges were available. These legacy instruments preceded many
   of the modern standard building block performance envelopes, so unusual
   features required innovative modern instrument selections. This paper
   describes the Boeing determinate hardware based design approach which
   preserves the legacy computer timing. Modern instrument selection
   examples to match legacy instrument performance are discussed as space
   permits.}},

   this is not the first multi-university capstone engineering, design and

   employ CAx tools that have been modified to allow more than one
   designer, engineer or manufacturing personnel to concurrently access the
   same part or assembly cloud-based model file. Single-user CAx
   applications of the past three decades are not being modernized by
   implementing Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG)
   techniques, methods and servers to bring dispersed team members together
   to more rapidly model, analyze and prototype the most challenging
   designs. Allowing more engineers, a global digital-brain paradigm, to
   simultaneously enter the cloud-based CAD model has also shown improved
   designs, i.e. more innovative solutions than a single designer would
   generate. It also leads to more reliable and reusable contextual
   geometry, topology and constraints for downstream analyses and
   manufacturing. The modification of these traditional engineering tools
   is suggesting a major restructuring of undergraduate laboratories,
   curriculum changes to design, engineering and manufacturing classes and
   in particular the existing approaches to capstone using antiquated CAx

Abstract = {{A volume holographic correlator (VHC) can function as an optical
   processing unit (OPU). With its multi-channel processing ability, the
   VHC is capable to extract inner products between the target image and
   all the stored remote sensing images with high speed and high
   parallelism. An opto-electronic hybrid system based on the VHC for scene
   matching is proposed. The innovative hybrid processing mode of the
   system combines the advantages of the high parallelism in VHC with the
   high flexibility and accuracy of digital processing, improving the
   overall system performances. The influences of the VHC's unique
   multi-channel parallel processing ability on the system speed and
   accuracy are theoretically studied in the context of different VHC
   working modes. The improvements of the system adaptability for different
   situations, such as illumination conditions and noise, are also analyzed
   by numerical simulation. Finally, experimental results are discussed to
   evaluate the system feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{There have been many advancements and accomplishments over the last few
   years using human modeling for human factors engineering analysis for
   design of spacecraft. The key methods used for this are motion capture
   and computer-generated human models. The focus of this paper is to
   explain the human modeling currently used at Kennedy Space Center (KSC),
   and to explain the future plans for human modeling for future spacecraft
   designs and ground processing tasks.
   United Space Alliance's Human Engineering Modeling and Performance
   program, or HEMAP, uses state-of-the-art motion capture tools to examine
   the interfaces between people, equipment, and the work environment. In
   addition to real-time motions and interactions, HEMAP's ability to
   stream multiple-person tasks and objects simultaneously provides
   revolutionary real-time feedback of the ergonomic effects on the
   participants to allow for real-time changes or optimization of the
   process or task at hand. Use of head-mounted displays, physical mockups,
   data-tracking gloves, and/or bi-directional collaboration of interactive
   motion data offer variations to resource and time requirements in
   meeting customer and engineering needs.
   The real-time ergonomic evaluations with ability to infinitely replay
   and alter the viewing angles of simulations adds increased fidelity to
   assure the workspace, including human interactions, are validated or
   adjusted to optimize human-system interfaces to prevent risks to
   personnel, equipment, designs, and schedules in the long term. This
   innovative, forward-reaching technology can be a powerful, cost-saving,
   time-saving tool to customers who want to optimize design prior to
   build, and to develop processes and procedures with optimal efficiency
   and safety in mind.}},

Abstract = {{The development of innovative techniques and concepts, and the emergence
   of new plays in carbonate rocks are creating a resurgence of oil and gas
   discoveries worldwide. The maturity of a basin and the application of
   exploration concepts have a fundamental influence on exploration
   strategies. Exploration success often occurs in underexplored basins by
   applying existing established geological concepts. This approach is
   commonly undertaken when new basins `open up' owing to previous
   political upheavals. The strategy of using new techniques in a proven
   mature area is particularly appropriate when dealing with unconventional
   resources (heavy oil, bitumen, stranded gas), while the application of
   new play concepts (such as lacustrine carbonates) to new areas (i.e.
   ultra-deep South Atlantic basins) epitomizes frontier exploration.
   Many low-matrix-porosity hydrocarbon reservoirs are productive because
   permeability is controlled by fractures and faults. Understanding basic
   fracture properties is critical in reducing geological risk and
   therefore reducing well costs and increasing well recovery. The advent
   of resource plays in carbonate rocks, and the long-standing recognition
   of naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs means that new fracture and
   fault analysis and prediction techniques and concepts are essential.
   Akey area of progress has been integration of stratigraphic, structural,
   geomechanical and diagenetic analysis to populate reservoir models
   accurately. Dramatic increases in computing and digital imaging
   capabilities are being harnessed to improve spatial analysis and spatial
   statistics in reservoirs and ultimately improve 3D geocellular models.}},

Abstract = {{Landslides, lateral spreading and other similar forms of ground failures
   due to natural disasters, such as heavy rains, floods and earthquakes,
   continue to be catastrophic events with extreme economic and societal
   costs, despite our increased understanding of the mechanisms of failure
   and large ground deformation, primarily because these events occur
   without much warning. Real-time monitoring programs are essential to
   develop warning systems of impending danger from active areas in any
   site specific or regional hazard program. Unfortunately the current
   state-of-the-art in real-time geotechnical monitoring is either based on
   very expensive monitoring systems or on periodic measurement of ground
   surface displacements. The evaluation, health monitoring and response
   prediction of soils exposed to extreme hazard conditions are on the
   verge of a paradigm shift due to new and less expensive sensing
   technologies, together with recent advances in information technology
   related to wireless sensors networking. This condition enables the
   development of innovative monitoring technologies in addition to
   advanced interactive modeling tools that utilize this real time
   monitoring data in construction, sensor-assisted design and early
   warning of impending failure hazard. The work presented herein
   highlights the development of novel, affordable sensing technologies for
   use in a framework to monitor, manage and ensure the safety of
   geotechnical infrastructure. The MEMS-based in-place inclinometer
   system, Measurand's ShapeAccelArray (SAA), is now established as a
   sensing tool for simultaneous measurement of 3D soil acceleration and 3D
   ground deformation up to a depth of one hundred meters, with an accuracy
   of +/- 1.5 mm per 30 m. This system is now being further developed to
   include digitally integrated pore pressure measurement. Each sensor
   array is connected to a wireless sensor node to enable real-time
   monitoring as well as remote sensor configuration.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth in popularity of digital communications has led to
   numerous industrial enterprises adopting online channels as their
   preferred method to communicate management information effectively with
   employees and customers. Digital communication has benefits for large
   enterprises because management can disseminate the information quickly
   to a large audience. It is also argued that the communication allows
   senior management to connect directly with their employees and
   customers, acting as an effective motivational and customer relationship
   tool. One such innovative technique is the use of management blogs as a
   means of communication. The management blog is an innovative management
   tool within the automotive sector because enterprises operate globally
   and the communication medium provides a unique opportunity for
   enterprises to communicate with employees and customers. The paper will
   study the currentmanagement communication practices by assessing the
   techniques adopted by General Motors (GM). The objective is to draw upon
   existing communication, relationship management and behavioural theory
   to develop an innovative model of communication applicable to the wider
   automotive sector. As a result the paper will highlight benefits and
   problems of adopting management blogging as a communication tool in the
   automotive sector within the Slovak Republic and global enterprises.}},

Abstract = {{Bridges, before putting into use, are subjected to test loads in order
   to their acceptance. According to Polish Standards, the aim of loads is
   to verify the computational model designed for the construction and to
   confirm the safety margins. Such tests are designed and executed under
   static and dynamic loads. In the case of static loads conventional
   surveying techniques are widely applied, while for dynamic loads the
   measurements using accelerometers are typically provided. These methods
   are characterized by significant limitations which include i.a. low
   sampling rate (measurements performed by total stations, digital levels,
   GPS receivers) and discrete (limited to points) nature of measurement (a
   set of accelerometers). The authors present the results of comparing the
   measurements carried out during test loads of a cable-stayed bridge,
   performed using classical measurement methods and ground-based radar
   interferometer. This innovative measuring device operates on the basis
   of stepped-frequency continuous wave modulation and microwave
   interferometry technique. It allows to determine deformation and
   vibration frequency of the object through a non-invasive observation of
   its behaviour at a frequency of up to 200 Hz.}},

Abstract = {{With the incessant advancement in optics, electronics and computer
   technologies during the last three decades, commercial digital video
   cameras have experienced a remarkable evolution, and can now be employed
   to measure complex motions of objects with sufficient accuracy, which
   render great assistance to structural displacement measurement in civil
   engineering. This paper proposes a novel image-based approach for
   dynamic measurement of structures. One digital camera is used to capture
   image sequences of planar targets mounted on vibrating structures. The
   mathematical relationship between image plane and real space is
   established based on computer vision theory. Then, the structural
   dynamic displacement at the target locations can be quantified using
   point reconstruction rules. Compared with other tradition displacement
   measurement methods using sensors, such as accelerometers,
   linear-variable-differential-transducers (LVDTs) and global position
   system (GPS), the proposed approach gives the main advantages of great
   flexibility, a non-contact working mode and ease of increasing
   measurement points. To validate, four tests of sinusoidal motion of a
   point, free vibration of a cantilever beam, wind tunnel test of a
   cross-section bridge model, and field test of bridge displacement
   measurement, are performed. Results show that the proposed approach can
   attain excellent accuracy compared with the analytical ones or the
   measurements using conventional transducers, and proves to deliver an
   innovative and low cost solution to structural displacement measurement.}},

Title = {{A Smart Grid Testbed: Design and Validation}},
Booktitle = {{COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING IN SMART GRIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{169-193}},
Abstract = {{The concept of smart grid is a form of electricity network that will
   deliver electricity from distributed suppliers to consumers, with the
   help of two-way digital communications that will control the energy
   storage and distribution process. This will save energy, reduce costs,
   and increase reliability in the presence of failures. The transformation
   of an existing traditional centralized electricity grid into a
   state-of-the-art smart grid will need innovation in a number of
   dimensions, such as seamless integration of renewable energy sources,
   management of intermittent power supplies, real-time demand response,
   dynamic energy pricing strategy, self-healing for disruption resilience,
   information communication infrastructure, etc. The grid configuration
   will need to change from the centralized power broadcasting network into
   a more distributed, dynamic, and robust network with two-way energy
   transmission. Another necessary component for smart grid is distributed
   information network, which will measure the status of the entire or part
   of the power grid, and will control the energy flow according to defined
   policies. With such significant changes required in architecture and
   operations, the need of a practical and laboratory-based research
   environment becomes valuable. In this work we have designed a
   laboratory-based practical smart grid research testbed, called
   SmartGridLab. It is an efficient smart grid testbed designed to help the
   research community analyze their designs and protocols for solving the
   open problems. This will boost the smart grid researchers to develop,
   analyze, and compare different protocols and designs conveniently and
   efficiently. SmartGridLab consists of the following major components:
   (1) intelligent power switch for power routing, (2) power supplies (main

Abstract = {{Personalization is an emerging issue in the digital age, where users
   have to deal with many kinds of digital devices and techniques.
   Moreover, the complexities of digital devices and their functions tend
   to increase rapidly, requiring careful attention to the questions of how
   to increase user satisfaction and develop more innovative digital
   products and services. To this end, we propose a new concept of
   micro-reality mining in which users' micro behaviors, revealed through
   their daily usage of digital devices and technologies, are scrutinized
   before key findings from the mining are embedded into new products and
   services. This paper proposes micro-reality mining for device
   personalization and examines the possibility of adopting a GBN (general
   Bayesian network) as a means of determining users' useful behavior
   patterns when using cell phones. Through comparative experiments with
   other mining techniques such as SVM (support vector machine), DT
   (decision tree), NN (neural network), and other BN (Bayesian network)
   methods, we found that the GBN has great potential for performing
   micro-reality mining and revealing significant findings.}},

Abstract = {{The generalisation of user-friendly and mobile interfaces like smart
   phones, eBook readers and tablets has accelerated the transition of
   comic books to the digital format. Although such user interfaces are not
   always fit for use by people with special needs, the underlying platform
   offers a large number of innovative services which opens a wide spectrum
   of new possibilities for enhancing accessibility.
   This paper explores how these new technologies can improve the digital
   access to comic books. Our main contribution is the inclusion of optical
   character recognition within text bubble associated to comics
   characters. The recognised text can then be fed into a text-to-speech
   engine for an improved experience. We also details performance
   improvements of other functionalities such as the panel order detection
   and special backgrounds. Finally, we discuss how these application
   specific adaptations can be applied to other contexts and which kind of
   future deployment can be anticipated.}},

   cyberliteracies which have extended the trajectory of 21st century
   literacies (Unsworth, 2001). This was to enable a transformation of a
   pedagogy of multimodalities-visual, textual, a multiplicity of semiotic

   Italian Chamber of Deputies launched in November 2009 ``Temi dell'

   research material, and hyperlinks to a variety of external information
   sources are integrated in a unified digital resource structured
   according to topical indexes. The new website's section has been
   conceived as an evolution of documentation and research activities done
   by the internal staff of the Research Department of the Chamber of
   Deputies and benefits from the domain knowledge of the parliamentary
   documentation experts. The chapter discusses future innovation implied
   by the implementation of the project in the areas of institutional
   communication, documentation supporting legislators, and their staff
   internal organization. It also suggests that these innovations relate to
   the passage from e-government to the conceptual and operational model of
   `` transformational government{''} (t-government), that emphasizes a
   citizen-centric delivery of public services, a shared services culture,
   and innovative methods in management of resources and skills in public

Abstract = {{This chapter examines and discusses the approach taken by local
   governments in developing countries to using the Web as a means of
   providing e-services. In particular, we focus on the capital cities of
   Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries to discover whether their
   public administrations are using the Internet to transform how they
   interact with citizens through the delivery of online public sector
   services, thus advancing a benchmarking process. An empirical study was
   carried out of e-government services in these cities, focusing on the
   content of e-services by applying the CapGemini (2009) methodology,
   which has been widely used in prior research. Our findings confirm the
   existence of a wide variety of e-services among the cities examined,
   with many of these local administrations remaining unaware of the
   possibility of using Internet to facilitate the delivery of public
   sector services. Therefore, there is great scope for improvement in the
   field of e-government. Reforms in public administration are needed in
   order to make government more participative and open. Likewise, setting
   effective policies to ensure e-inclusion is the key to the future of
   LAC's new empowered societies, with a more visible voice and more
   chances to express their concerns.}},

   creation and delivery of information and services inside governments and

Abstract = {{The concept of mobility, related to technology in particular, has
   evolved dramatically over the last two decades including: (i) hardware
   ranging from walkmans to Ipods, laptops to netbooks, PDAs to 3G mobile
   phone; (ii) software supporting multiple audio and video formats driven
   by ubiquitous mobile wireless access, WiMax, automations such as radio
   frequency ID tracking and location aware services. Against the
   background of increasing budget deficit, along with the imperative for
   efficiency gains, leveraging ICT and mobility promises for work related
   tasks, in a public administration context, in emerging markets, point to
   multiple possible paths. M-government transition involve both
   technological changes and adoption to deliver government services
   differently (e.g. 24/7, error free, anywhere to the same standards) but
   also the design of digital strategies including possibly competing
   m-government models, the re-shaping of cultural practices, the creation
   of m-policies and legislations, the structuring of m-services
   architecture, and progress regarding m-governance. While many emerging
   countries are already offering e-government services and are gearing-up
   for further m-government activities, little is actually known about the
   resistance that is encountered, as a reflection of civil servants'
   current standing, before any further macro-strategies are deployed.
   Drawing on the resistance and mobility literature, this chapter
   investigates how civil servants' behaviors, in an emerging country
   technological environment, through their everyday practice, react and
   resist the influence of m-government transition. The findings points to
   four main type of resistance namely: i) functional resistance; ii)
   ideological resistance; iii) market driven resistance and iv)
   geographical resistance. Policy implication are discussed in the
   specific context of emerging markets.}},

Abstract = {{Organizations are increasingly investing in social collaboration and
   communication platforms for integrated exchange of information within
   and between enterprises. These Enterprise 2.0 projects always have a
   deep impact on organizational and cultural changes and need a critical
   mass of user involvement across all different groups. Users that grew up
   in the digital age and use new forms of collaborative platforms within
   their daily activities are often more technologically adept and more
   willing to share information. This leads to a digital divide between
   Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, which needs to be addressed
   within such projects. The main objective of this paper is to investigate
   the perceived differences in success factors for Enterprise 2.0 seen by
   Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants and its implications on the
   implementation of a process oriented methodology for Enterprise 2.0
   projects.}},

Abstract = {{In an astonishingly short period of time, the Internet and mobile
   commerce have profoundly shaped the way consumers live their lives as
   well as the way organizations do business with them-and with each other.
   With these electronic technologies and tools, businesses have remarkable
   new opportunities to connect with their customers and to build their
   brands as never before. Consequently, this chapter provides a broad
   overview of digital media and its effects on marketing and advertising.
   In doing so, we identify and define the most important digital media and
   advertising tactics as well as explain how they can be introduced into
   traditional marketing and advertising programs. The innovations
   presented here will help the reader understand how digital technology
   can improve marketing and advertising strategy formulation and
   execution. With so many online changes and innovations happening daily,
   this is a challenging-and exciting-time to practice marketing and
   advertising. As such, it is imperative that organizations have a
   presence in the Internet spaces that their customers and potential
   customers are exploring on a daily basis. In essence, organizations need
   to provide online listening posts for customers so that they can
   communicate what they think, as well as what they want or don't want.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers innovative marketing within the context of a micro
   firm, exploring how such firm's marketing practices can take advantage
   of digital media. Factors that influence a micro firm's innovative
   activities are examined and the development and implementation of
   digital media in the firm's marketing practice is explored. Despite the
   significance of marketing and innovation to SMEs, a lack of literature
   and theory on innovation in marketing theory exists. Research suggests
   that small firms' marketing practitioners and entrepreneurs have
   identified their marketing focus on the 4Is. This paper builds on
   knowledge in innovation and marketing and examines the process in a
   micro firm. A qualitative approach is applied using action research and
   case study approach. The relevant literature is reviewed as the starting
   point to diagnose problems and issues anticipated by business
   practitioners. A longitudinal study is used to illustrate the process of
   actions taken with evaluations and reflections presented. The
   exploration illustrates that in practice much of the marketing
   activities within micro firms are driven by incremental innovation. This
   research emphasises that integrating Information Communication
   Technologies (ICTs) successfully in marketing requires marketers to take
   an active managerial role far beyond their traditional areas of
   competence and authority.}},

Abstract = {{The most recent and significant transformations of European landscapes
   have occurred as a consequence of a series of diffused, varied and often
   connected phenomena: urban growth and sprawl, agricultural
   intensification in the most suitable areas and agricultural abandonment
   in marginal areas. These phenomena can affect dramatically ecosystems'
   structure and functioning, since certain modifications cause landscape
   fragmentation while others tend to increase homogeneity. Thus, a
   thorough comprehension of the evolution trends of landscapes, in
   particular those linked to urban-rural relations, is crucial for a
   sustainable landscape planning.
   In this framework, the main objectives of the present paper are: (a) to
   investigate Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) transformations and dynamics that
   occurred over the period 1955-2006 in the municipality of Serra San
   Bruno (Calabria, Italy), an area particularly representative of the
   Mediterranean mountainous landscape; (b) to compare the settlement
   growth with the urban planning tools in charge in the study area; (c) to
   examine the relationship between urban-rural gradient, landscape
   metrics, demographic and physical variables; (d) to investigate the
   evolution of urban-rural gradient composition and configuration along
   significant axes of landscape changes.
   Data with a high level of detail (minimum mapping unit 0.2 ha) were
   obtained through the digitisation of historical aerial photographs and
   digital orthophotos identifying LULC classes according to the Corine
   Land Cover legend. The investigated period was divided into four
   significant time intervals, which were specifically analysed to detect
   LULC changes.
   Differently from previous studies, in the present research the
   spatio-temporal analysis of urban-rural gradient was performed through
   three subsequent steps: (1) kernel density analysis of settlements; (2)
   analysis of landscape structure by means of metrics calculated using a
   moving window method; (3) analysis of composition and configuration of
   the urban-rural gradient within three landscape profiles located along
   significant axes of LULC change.
   The use of thematic overlays and transition matrices enabled a precise
   identification of the LULC changes that had taken place over the
   examined period. As a result, a detailed description and mapping of the
   landscape dynamics were obtained. Furthermore, landscape profiling
   technique, using continuous data, allowed an innovative and valuable
   approach for analysing and interpreting urban-rural gradient structure
   over space and time.}},

Abstract = {{Learning in architecture has shifted from an individual focused approach
   to a larger system of interacting individuals in a situated,
   tool-mediated and socio-technical context. In addition to developing
   essential skills to work with diverse design software and taking part in
   collaborative design activities, learners also need to be equipped with
   competencies that will allow them to operate intelligently outside of
   situations of distributed cognitions. The challenge in present
   educational climate is to develop pedagogical approaches where
   situations of distributed cognition are not the ends themselves but are
   the means for improving mastery of solo competencies. The paper
   contributes to the current discussion about the need to re-orient
   architectural education and proposes a pedagogical framework for the
   development of a new web-based teaching/learning environment
   (socio-cognitive eco-system) as an integrated platform to support both
   autonomous and distributed learning.}},

Abstract = {{Pioneers of wireless telegraphy working 100 or so years ago believed the
   new technology would soon be put to useful purposes. Among initiatives
   at this time were new ways of learning, emphasizing a more imaginative,
   learner-centered approach. It was realized that educational broadcasting
   had great potential in both formal and informal education by adding to
   what teachers could provide, reaching isolated groups of learners,
   filling in for non-existent teachers, and acting as an agent of
   in-service training. Before long, ``radio schools{''} were operating in
   countries with dispersed and remote populations (Schindler 2006). In
   line with its mandate, Kenya Institute of Education (KIE) has over the
   years produced volumes of educational programmes to support curriculum
   implementation. These are both audio and video materials disseminated
   through live broadcasts, pre-recorded broadcasts, and sale of recorded
   audio and video tapes as well as outreach programmes. In response to the
   dynamics of a changing society, KIE has continuously explored new and
   innovative ways to reach its target audience. This has been necessitated
   by the need to expand its coverage, improve the quality of transmission
   and be cost-effective. The impact has been increased access to quality
   programmes in an attempt to meet the expanded demand for education
   following the introduction of free primary and secondary Education in
   tandem with Education for All (EFA) and the Millennium Development Goals
   (MGDs). The use of television in curriculum delivery gives rise to
   better and improved methods of educational content delivery, methodology
   and pedagogical skills as well as expanding the available teaching and
   learning knowledge base. Whereas technology cannot replace a teacher in
   the instructional process, it forms an important and additional resource
   for both the teacher and the learner. This presentation addresses the
   `Use of Television as a Mode of Curriculum Delivery: A Case Study of
   Kenya's Education Broadcast Channel (EDU Channel)'. The introduction of
   digital television broadcasting technology provides the ultimate
   solution to educational broadcasting. Television signal, audio signal
   and multimedia signal are the core of education through media. The
   formats are able to engage the visually and auditory sensory learning
   abilities of the learners creating memorable learning experiences. The
   use of television in curriculum delivery fills in the gap of building
   competence especially in concepts that involve processes and procedures.
   These would not be delivered very effectively using text or audio as
   they apply more to the visual.
   Kenya's Education Broadcast Channel was launched by His Excellency the
   President on 30th March, 2010, and it targets learners and teachers as
   well as the general public. It is one of the Kenya Vision 2030 Flag Ship
   projects in the Ministry of Education. Kenya Vision 2030 is the
   country's new development blueprint covering the period 2008 to 2030.
   The vision for the education sector for 2030 is `to have a globally
   competitive quality education, training and research for sustainable
   development'. This is evident that Kenya recognizes education as
   fundamental to the success of the Vision. It is therefore envisaged that
   the Education Broadcast Channel will contribute to improve National
   capacity building efforts and skills transfer towards the attainment of
   Vision 2030 through enhanced equity and access to quality education.}},

Abstract = {{Art is the soul of the community because it opens new horizons of
   advancement and progress to the human being. The interest of various
   visual arts is an essential element in the composition of the human
   cultural, emotional and social aspects, therefore, the technical
   progress which is made by the information technology becomes a key
   criteria for measuring progress of societies, the issue of interest in
   innovation in all fields has become an inevitable and necessary to keep
   pace with the global technological progress which is visible in all
   aspects of life.
   The current era is characterized by the Explosion of Knowledge:
   Technology, Proliferation of Communication Systems, the increasing use
   of computer has made the world a Global Electronic Village.
   The recruitment of Information Technology and Internet in education is
   considered as the most important indicator of the transformation of A
   Society to an Information Society, where it contributes to increase the
   efficiency and effectiveness of education systems.
   The technology of education in Arts is the curve systems for the design
   of educational process, implementation and evaluation as a whole,
   depending on the specific objectives derived from the product of
   research in the field of education and human contact, and use of human
   and non-human resources in order to give the education of arts and
   design more effectiveness and accuracy.
   This research aims to build a program for virtual education in the
   faculties of arts as an expressive visual mediator and shows how to
   utilize it in teaching of students of these colleges in order to find
   effective communication processes between the student and professor.
   We are in a rapidly changing world and it sees the global transformation
   unprecedented in the various fields where it deletes all the
   geographical boundaries of the impact of satellite and the globalization
   that has helped to exchange cultures and ideas and the spread of
   information and technological innovation, as part of that change has
   become virtual education in the arts and design of the most important
   means of cultural communication and that the difference about the means
   of traditional education because it is accessible to all students at
   different levels.
   The researcher should take advantage of the integration of visual art
   and values with the new technology in the use of all available methods
   of electronic, tricks, graphics, chroma key and digital programs to
   provide new technology for education and to achieve all the requirements
   of installation formal of the reality education in the faculties of arts
   with developed attractive style, it is the product of advanced thought
   link the form to the content in an integrated co-operation between the
   reality and the virtual and provides a new form for the education.}},

   education, even with the use of technologies to bridging digital divide,
   impacting on social inclusion. The h@puma habitat program at the
   National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autonoma
   de Mexico UNAM) invites to create value for users' information and
   communication technologies (ICT), within extending ICT permanent access,
   to enable innovations' services for education at digital hubs in the
   university. ICT access looks forward to provide students with the
   conditions to enable them to use computers and communications
   infrastructure. In order to achieve this, it is desirable to establish
   and maintain the sustainable growth of ICT capabilities, with a focus on
   high value-added services based on the knowledge economy. The
   contribution to this innovation has outweighed the common welfare and
   competitiveness between the various stakeholders in each project. The
   experience is integrated into best practices and knowledge to the
   screening, management and operation of ICT services in order to provide
   access to the Internet, online services, computers and connectivity.
   From a provisioning value model ICT, for infrastructure and connectivity
   availability, used in the UNAM, which objective is promoting spaces to
   endorse the socialization of knowledge from development and training in
   the use of ICT for teachers and students, this proposal desires to focus
   on digital hubs. It is desired to highlight the importance of
   collaboration and cooperation among those actors involved in technology
   services, to boost growth.}},

Abstract = {{School has long recognized and accepted Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) as a means to promote students learning. The wiki
   presents specific characteristics concerning communication and
   information publishing and sharing. These characteristics have important
   potential value that makes it a significant tool to be used by teachers.
   However, wikis place new challenges related to a different teacher role,
   a different attitude concerning learning and teaching strategies.
   In order to meet those challenges, teachers have to adapt teaching, by
   accommodating innovations and by reconciling old and new ideas. However,
   they can be resistant to introducing changes in their practice.
   In-service training programmes can play an essential role in overcoming
   those resistances, by promoting collaboration, supporting the design and
   implementation of activities involving wikis, facilitating data
   collection concerning its impacts and reflection about teaching and
   learning.
   The project `intTT: An INTegral Teacher Training for developing digital
   and communicative competences and subject content learning at schools',
   was funded by Lifelong Learning Programme. Within this project, we
   developed a training programme with the goal to promote teachers' use of
   wikis in the classroom. The training programme lasted 50 hour and
   included two phases. Initially teachers were acquainted with science
   curriculum and the possibilities it offers for developing inquiry
   activities using wikis. In this phase, teachers also learnt about wikis
   use and inquiry activities in science classrooms and they designed,
   collaboratively, inquiry activities for being explored using a wiki.
   During the second phase, teachers were involved with activities'
   implementation in their classrooms, shared their experiences, and
   reflected, conjointly, on the difficulties, solutions and potentialities
   envisaged. The present communication aims at describing the challenges
   that teachers faced and the potentialities that they attribute to the
   use of wikis.
   Participants were twenty physics and chemistry teachers from ten
   different schools, nearby Lisbon, who frequented the training programme.
   The methodology has its roots in qualitative research, with an
   interpretative orientation. Data was collected by means of interviews
   and written reflections during and after the programme. Results show
   that challenges presented to the teachers have different nature.
   Teachers mostly mention difficulties related with the need to overcome
   technical limitations, either in school or at home; related to
   restrictions of available computers and with making Internet
   connections; related with the time necessary for exploring the
   activities; related with limitations in the edition of text and pages
   and with the impossibility of simultaneous publication of the pages,
   which can lead to information loss. However, they also point several
   potentialities in wiki use, namely the possibility to diversify teaching
   strategies, occurring in formal or informal context, to allow a more
   open and free exploration of scientific contents, the possibility to
   diversity learning situations, facilitating pupils' development of
   scientific, communicative and digital competencies.
   It is important now to explore which new competencies should the
   teachers develop, in order to overcome these challenges related to wikis
   use and to enact all the potentialities associated with its use in
   exploring inquiry activities in science classes.}},

Abstract = {{New technologies form an inseparable part of teaching both in secondary
   and tertiary education. Both teachers as well as high-school and
   university students underscore the necessity to redefine the terms of
   their usage so that they are conducive to the more even conduct of the
   teaching act and trainees are integrated into a new framework of
   knowledge discovery which, under new terms, will give further
   significance to the learning procedure as well as new bases to the
   high-school and university student community. The economics as well as
   theoretical -humanitarian studies audience is of special interest as it
   forms an audience stemming from a different educational and training
   basis in secondary education and the objects of study traditionally lay
   within a different scientific field in which new technologies are
   accordingly required or not.
   The economic department students' attitudes and perceptions on new
   technologies and their usage for teaching and educational objectives are
   being illustrated in this study. More analytically, the usage motives
   and expediency are sought after since their familiarization with them is
   being studied. The traditional teaching act is being compared with
   innovative interactive knowledge discovery methods. Semi-constructed
   questionnaires were used, which were distributed to students through the
   internet, and the results were studied through digital analysis
   programs.
   The outcome of the research is the familiarization with new technologies
   and the necessity to redefine the teaching practices both on a
   collective and individual level. Afterwards, a concurrent comparison
   with similar researches of theoretical disciplines was ventured out of
   which comparative research findings were drawn. The students'
   familiarization with new technologies, most times, is identical with the
   computer usage on a personal level and stems from secondary education.
   In only a few cases, it seems to be the result of tertiary education
   whereas only a small percentage identifies this familiarization with the
   school knowledge provided.}},

Abstract = {{According to the 2010 Horizon Report, the technology market has more
   than four million subscribers around the world, whose latest evolution,

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze how commercial video games become an
   educational tool to develop skills related to new forms of literacy
   (Jenkins, 2009). New digital technologies can be thought of as
   instruments that require from the user some understanding of their
   languages, a ``visual literacy{''} (Gee, 2004) to comprehend the
   messages conveyed in all its complexity. It is refers to different
   communication systems that include language, images, symbols, graphs,
   diagrams, artefacts, etc. In this framework, video games can introduce
   the students in this multimodal world, since they combine different
   languages.
   Our data comes from an ethnographic study (Atkinson et al., 2001; Lacasa
   \& Reina, 2004; Pink, 2004) conducted in a workshop developed in a
   secondary school in Coslada (Madrid) during Spanish Language subject,
   while working with The Sims 3 video game. In this research we show how
   some simulation video games, specifically The Sims 3, can be used as
   learning resources that help students to develop digital skills while
   they learn curricular contents in the area of language.
   We worked from a participatory action research perspective (Kemmis \&
   McTaggart, 2005) assuming a reflexive-dialectical view of
   subjective-objective relations and connections. In this context we
   combine analytical and narrative ways of thinking to approach human
   practice (Bruner, 2002). Moreover, we understand our participatory
   action research as a process of mutual inquiry wherein researchers and
   teachers collaborate to ``create circumstances in which people can
   search together collaboratively for more comprehensible, true, authentic
   and morally right and appropriate ways of understanding and acting in
   the world{''} (Kemmis, 2005: 601). In this project, we collaborated with
   teachers in the process of sharing goals and creating innovative
   educational activities situated in the classroom context. It helps
   teachers to analyze their own practices in order to improve their
   teaching skills.
   Our works are based in the belief that schools need to develop
   educational uses for many of the instruments that have not been
   specifically designed for this purpose, but are meaningful in children's
   everyday life as videogames. The educational potential of simulation
   games has become a subject for discussion and research (de Freitas \&
   Oliver, 2006; Mitchell \& Savill-Smith 2004) that encouraged us to
   developed this study. From this particular study our findings revealed
   that during the workshop students developed new literacies (Jenkins,
   2009) by working with different media (Manovich, 2001).
   The video game and its virtual world enhanced students' creativity
   regarding linguistic skills. For example they were able to write
   descriptions of the characters created in the game, using the
   possibilities and vocabulary offered in it. They also described the
   environment that they constructed and re-built while playing. At the
   same time they took pictures and recorded videos from the game. Also,
   the stories enacted during the sessions gave them a lot of ideas to come
   up with narratives, that both wrote on paper and showed in audio-visual
   productions edited using Movie Maker. All this process is an example of
   the ability that Jenkins (2009) called ``appropriation{''}.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a rising commitment to strengthen the delivery of
   education in Nigeria for some time now. The quality assurance agency for
   university education in Nigeria (National Universities Commission - NUC)
   is unwavering in her cause to facilitate capacity building activities.
   This is to ensure that academic staff involved in the Open and Distance
   Learning (ODL) education programmes are equipped with the requisite
   Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills and competences
   for quality delivery via the ODL mode. The Nigerian University System
   has one single-mode open and distance learning University as well as six
   ``dual-mode{''} Universities (conventional universities with distance
   learning Centers / Institutes). Before now, the Nigerian distance
   learning education has been more or less part-time studies as it lacks
   the qualities of an Open and Distance Learning system. There was no
   learning management system in place, instructional materials were not
   structured and the teachers were more or less digital immigrants. A lot
   of challenges were encountered. This ranges from resistance to change,
   poor ICT infrastructure and concern about intellectual property rights
   and shared rights between faculties and institutions. As the national
   consultants, we have increased digital literacy sporadically by
   following a few ideas with the best chance of success. We have developed
   processes that leverage best practices from both the instructional
   design and software development areas. Through a mixture of
   instructional media, learners and educators can experience synchronous
   and asynchronous interactions. The e-learning projects embarked on were
   a software project combined with a performance enhancement ('training')
   project as well as instructional design for course development. In the
   bid to effectively service the ODL Institutions in Nigeria, we
   determined the actual training need of each distance learning
   institutions. We have developed e-teaching capacity building workshop as
   well as collaborative development of distance learning courses,
   designing of online courses to meet the needs of a diverse student
   population and the use of synchronous and asynchronous mode of distance
   learning tools. To begin the implementation of the research effort, a
   series of courses were developed and reviewed among the teaching staff
   (course experts) of the ODL Institutions. The Learning Management System
   provided an accessible, innovative, online learning and facilitation

Abstract = {{Web 2.0 is the second generation of online services which is
   characterized by enhancing forms of publishing, sharing and organizing
   information, and expands the space for interaction among participants
   process. The communication boosted collaborative and participatory
   principles. The use of Web 2.0 occurs in two main areas: the teaching of
   information literacy that is, developing the ability to transform
   information into knowledge; and the promotion of transversality of
   knowledge, innovation and managing change. The Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) refers to forms of technologies that are
   used to transmit, process, store, create, view, share or exchange
   information electronically. Systems include not only computer but also
   cell phones, laptops, smartphones, netbooks, tablets, digital
   newspapers, etc. Millions of applications that are used in different
   areas such as health, administration, justice, education, and all these
   technologies are part of this component. It must be known how these new
   technologies impact on education, and is also important to investigate
   the technological resources used by teachers of higher education in the
   classroom. And so, the role of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is
   to enable informed choice in the matter of those tools, and to support
   them and their effective deployment.}},

Abstract = {{As mentioned Manuel Area: `` ... technologies for information and
   communication should be considered more than mere hardware or mere
   transmitters of information channels that convey communication between a
   sender and a receiver. We now know that the learning environments in
   educational settings is a complex process involving a number of
   variables and factors associated not only with the internal attributes
   of the material (content, hardware, forms of representation and coding
   systems information, ...), but also with variables of the subjects that
   interact with the material (such as prior knowledge, attitudes, age,
   cognitive styles, ...) and context variables used the material (work
   done with the media, educational goals and teaching method integrating
   pedagogical material, ...).{''}
   Additionally we consider that the incorporation of such technologies in
   schools in addition to its technical characteristics, as well as
   educational objectives, they face not a lack of educational vision
   either by the institution or but also by themselves teachers. We believe
   that there is barriers not by age, not the institution, not the
   infrastructure but by the absence of the teacher's own experience allow
   you to use and innovate with these technologies in their daily practice
   in the classroom.
   Do not forget to Incorporate the technology simply because It is new,
   does not imply Educational automatic improvement. Any incorporation of
   technology requires an educational approach, it requires teacher's
   skills. Our arguments are based from the study of the use of these
   emerging technologies by senior teachers from a school particularly in
   engineering in advanced technologies (UPIITA) belonging to the National
   Polytechnic Institute, Mexico at the Autonomous University of Mexico
   City, in the career of Communication Sciences, both institutions of
   higher education in Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of new professional undergraduate tertiary programs in
   Australia indicates that a closer engagement is being encouraged between
   universities and industry, and government and community. The
   Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) Report (2008) shows not only the
   diversity but the popularity of such courses across the tertiary sector.
   Building workforce capacity has been on te national agenda for over a
   decade, as the Australian government puts policy frameworks in place to
   guarantee a measure of work-readiness in graduates; and funds research
   about trands and employer perceptions of new graduate workers. The
   literature shows that learning is improved through the use of
   `authentic' tasks and in what are seen as apropropriate locales outside
   the university. Yet, adopting WIL approaches to tertiary industry
   placements poses challenges to course convenors, academic colleagues,
   students, and industry hosts. They do not fit easily with student
   expectations or routine course quality assurance systems and
   benchmarking processes. Institutionally, they can be seen as eccentric:
   their pedagogy, assessment protocols, and shared grading protocols;
   off-site and varied locations of learning; and student expectations
   differ in key ways from tertiary courses delivered in traditional
   face-to-face lectures and tutorials, or in blended learning modes. In
   industry, host assumptions, work-requirements and workplace cultures
   differ from those operating at the university. Students who come to a
   course expecting `work-experience' find that academic criteria may
   deliver them lower grades than they expected after an enjoyable and
   productive placement. This paper is based on five years' course
   convening experience and oversight of more than 200 media industry
   placements in a new digital and participatory media degree at an
   Australian research university. It describes the issues involved in
   developing, delivering and stewarding an `alternative' program through
   diverse expectations, and it focuses on how the program is run, and
   assessment is designed, and defended.}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous computing is computing power that is integrated in devices
   and environments in such a way that they offer optimal support to human
   daily life activities. For industrial design engineering students,
   applying ubiquitous technologies offer a great opportunity and challenge
   for innovating everyday products. To teach the students about ubiquitous
   technologies and their application in design, we have done an exercise
   called ``Innovate with ubiquitous technologies!{''} with more than 100
   students in our Advanced Design Support-course. The exercise is
   threefold. The first task for the students is to find information on the
   Internet about ubiquitous technologies and to share the information
   found by writing about the collected information in an open content
   repository (WikID, our industrial design engineering wiki). In the
   second part of the practical exercise, the students have to create a
   concept for an incremental innovation of an existing product, and
   produce an abstract prototype of this concept. They are given a digital
   computer-aided design model of a product and they have to extend this
   product by applying a combination of ubiquitous technologies with the
   goal to improve an aspect such as new functionality, function and price
   trade off, performance, energy consumption, information richness, and/or
   user experience. In the third part the students have to make a cost
   calculation, comparing the product with and without the ubiquitous
   technologies. For this exercise a design infrastructure, and knowledge
   sharing sessions have been established including mobile blogs and group
   sessions and the students have been provided with extended creativity
   triggering techniques, a knowledge framework for ubiquitous
   technologies, and design tools. This paper reports on the way these
   ubiquitous learning applications have been received by the students, and
   on the results achieved. We present student design cases to illustrate
   how the exercise has been carried out and to present the students
   opinions on this ubiquitous learning exercise.}},

Abstract = {{Beginning at the ancient debate of whether architecture is or is not
   part of the ``good-arts{''} system because of its contamination to a
   specific utility and a proper function, this article will emphasize once
   more the essence of ``dwelling{''} to its definition and ``to Dwell{''}
   as the an inner and an intrinsic character of Architecture. In this way
   one can understand architecture as the ``form of being{''}, or ``form of
   living{''} whose matter is, as sculpture, painting and, especially,
   music, the human being himself. The gap between the ancient architect
   and the modern building engineer can be in this way deleted. The one as
   the other stay at the origin of the compositional architectural process,
   determining its reasons (arche - tek-ton), mixing two worlds: the one of
   ``ideas{''} or their intimate representations (A), and the one of
   matter, techniques and technologies through which the author can
   materialize its final product (B). It is therefore in the relationship
   between these two worlds, called World 1 and World 3 by Karl Popper,
   that intervenes the typical dynamics of the process of architectural
   composition. If one thinks that aesthetic judgment intervenes only on
   the final product of a project, quite apart from the compositional
   process that intervened in shaping the object, it is inevitable to fall
   in a substantially romantic conception, and educating for an authentic
   freedom in the act of architectural composition is impossible. If ``the
   forms of beauty{''} can be many, that through which these forms are
   determinated reveals to be a process characterized by recurrent
   features, that is a consistent circularity between the term (A) to the
   term (B), between World 1 and World 3. This kind of circularity, between
   World 1 and World 3, need a specific communication ``medium{''}, a sort
   of ``medium matter{''}, which appears to be fundamental when an artist
   cannot act directly on his final object (as is the case in
   architecture). In these cases he needs to use a ``medium matter{''}
   through which he can progressively conceive, simulate and verify his
   program, ideas and final results. The purpose of this article is also to
   develop a few considerations specifically on this medium matter in order
   to evolve some considerations on its proper nature and required
   ``ductility{''}. This medium matter is in fact the principal means
   through which the artist can manage the process of architectural
   composition. It is the fundamental ``sanctuary{''} in which the original
   inner inspiration finds a first comparison with measures of matter that
   is the space where the dynamics of action-reaction and problem-solving
   begin. Focusing on this particular aspect, the article will take into
   account the great changing intervened within the last few years, from
   paper\&pencil to Information Technologies and digital data elaboration
   as typical instrument to evolve the architectural compositional process.
   From a medium matter which was able to represent the final object by
   means of well-tried design techniques, we have arrived at new software
   which can control the process of architectural drawing, once elaborated
   only in the artist mind. Finally, this paper will try to investigate the
   main consequences of these changes (A) on the processes of education in
   architectural composition, and (B) on its final results: can these new
   instruments change the aesthetics of architecture and transform our
   general sense of beauty?}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the experiences of Mexican women living in
   disadvantaged communities on using Technology. The research followed a
   qualitative methodological approach guided by the objectives of this
   research. This research analyses observation and semi-structured
   interviews. Nine participants were selected through a snowball sample
   technique. The emphasis of this research is on the experiences of
   Mexican women living in disadvantaged communities who have, according to
   their own appraisal, changed their perceptions towards computers and the
   Internet by using the services offered by a Community Technology Centre
   and their experiences with the digital divide.
   The results of this research suggests that Mexican women living in
   disadvantaged communities have a positive perception of computers and
   the Internet even if they don't have one at home. Participants expressed
   a positive expectation on the use of technology for them and their
   families regardless of their lack of technological infrastructure and
   skills. As part of the conclusion of this study, it is suggested that
   the participants' social context need to be considered when implementing
   technology access initiatives in disadvantaged communities in Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology and the Internet are becoming a necessary
   resource for the convenience and enjoyment of individuals. Web 2.0, the
   new and improved Web, has created a sophisticated user base with new
   online functionality and tools such as blogs, wiki's, online social
   networking. As a result of Web 2.0, the Internet is changing from merely
   a place to get information or give information, to a place to access a
   whole set of interactive applications, online sharing and collaboration.
   Moreover, the population of elderly people and the use of computers and
   the Internet are both growing at extraordinary rates in the European
   Union. The potential exists for elderly people to improve their own
   lives as well as the lives of others by making more use of this
   technology. However, the elderly are currently among the lowest users of
   computers and the Internet. In this paper we show how, through a course
   of ten lessons length, we have instructed elderly from barely use a
   computer to managing social networks independently. We also have
   developed new ways to deal with the learning disadvantages that age
   involves. Some of those problems such as the digital divide are exceeded
   by other more serious deficiencies like being trouble when reading or
   writing. Nonetheless, the perseverance during the learning process
   showed by this group of people plus a correct and gradual course
   planning have provided us very significant data about the learning curve
   showed by the elderly during the course. The purpose of this research
   was to explore whether the elderly were familiar with modern technology.}},

Abstract = {{Currently the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) play an
   essential role. We might even say that they have become indispensable,
   for both economic and social development of citizens, as also of
   regions, nations ... This requirement represents a serious risk of
   marginalization for people who do not have access to these technologies
   and a decrease in their opportunities of social participation.
   We are living in the information society and this implies also changes
   in social interaction, teaching, learning ... Therefore, one of the key
   elements in guaranteeing equal opportunities is the access to
   information and, for that, it is also necessary to have personal tools
   and resources.
   Spain is already involved in the introduction of technology into
   schools, by adoption of the policy ``one computer per child{''} (School
   2.0 program) and the ``Institutes of Technological innovation{''}. But
   it is necessary to know the initial and final digital competence of
   students participating in these innovation projects. We are developing a
   project which aims to explore how using technology in the classroom can
   improve:
   a) their skills when using the Internet,
   b) the increase of knowledge based on the information quality,
   c) the production of online content using Web 2.0, and
   d) their social participation.
   This paper shows our point of view about the schools can not simply
   perform functional literacy training in the use of ICT but it is
   necessary to train new generations to be able to lead self-directed
   lives and generate processes of empowerment, awareness and civic
   engagement on the basis of these technologies to get a real impact on
   the society and the people's life.}},

Abstract = {{Social computing or web 2.0 applications have been developed all over
   the world by key research centres in a number of projects that aim to
   assess the impact of web 2.0 trends on the field of learning and
   education. The new millennium learners, as described in the literature,
   still provoke profound discussion about how and when institutions must
   use innovative Learning 2.0 approaches. This paper is a result of a
   study conducted at the Polytechnic Institute of Guarda - Portugal, to
   identify the ``typical{''} properties (Technology usage, Multi-tasking,
   Individualisation and personalisation, Increased connectedness,
   Immediacy and Multiple media types) of these new students in an effort
   to make learning more efficient, equitable and innovative in higher
   education. The study presents the outcomes and synthesizes the insights
   collected through a survey of a total of 1,354 students from four
   schools (Education, Technology and Management, Health and Tourism). With
   regard to student opinion on certain activities involving ICT, we find
   greater agreement among statements related to the frequency and the ease
   of use of various media simultaneously. Contrastingly, the more negative
   opinion of respondents regarding the use of ICT to perform social
   activities such as studying or simply chatting denotes a greater
   appetite for traditional social relationships and for personal contact.}},

Abstract = {{Demand for knowledge is increasing and becoming necessary and
   fundamental in a global society. In this scenario, digital technologies
   represent a strategy for innovation and expansion of teaching and
   learning process. Besides, they can also act as an instrument of
   information dissemination, providing expansion of knowledge, job
   opportunities and lifelong learning. Education for the XXI Century is
   one of the engines of development, but it requires renewal of teaching
   methods in order to train people to learn and to be able to manage their
   own jobs. In this context, the management of new technologies in higher
   educational institutions is characterized as an essential element in
   modernization, expansion and innovation of education systems. From this
   perspective, this article - based on the literature review of
   educational technology applied to higher educational institutions - aims
   to analyze the impact of applying new technologies in these
   institutions. Besides, considering the results of a survey applied at a
   Higher Federal Educational Institution called CEFET/RJ located at Rio de
   Janeiro in Brazil, the authors describe the critical success factors
   faced by this institution while applying to use new technologies
   resources in the teaching and learning process. As a research result,
   the authors show the importance of educational planning aligned with
   information technology as a tool for targeting strategic alignment in
   higher educational institutions in the context of a technology-based
   education system.}},

Abstract = {{The use of new technologies by contemporary society has a strong
   influence on social relationship in the present moment, especially
   because of the changes it makes when referring to time and space. The
   changes resulting from the advance and innovation of information and
   communication technology have a direct impact on the use of information
   systems by humans, especially in the light of new ways to interact,
   collaborate and communicate. It works like a paradigm shift from
   Industrial Society to Information Society, which can be fit into new
   forms of relationship advances in the mood of a digital culture. From
   this perspective, the collaborative models and theories provide insight
   into how and why people interact in groups. In this context,
   communication systems called Computer Support Cooperative Work (CSCW)
   are used to support group activities in the dynamics of a Modern
   Society. So, by analyzing CSCW from an educational perspective, web
   popularization has influenced collaborative learning environments,
   enabling new forms of acquisition, sharing and dissemination of

Abstract = {{The use of podcasts, digital audio files that are delivered through the
   Internet, became very popular due to the availability of Web 2.0. tools
   and the ease of production, editing and delivery of the episodes. These
   can be further downloaded to computers or mobile devices, which use has
   increased enormously in the last decade, and this portability creates
   exciting opportunities for education. This way, teaching and learning
   can be mobile and portable and education can be personalized and
   provided at any time and any place. This is particularly appealing for
   working students or for students with special needs or challenges but
   also suitable to any student who wishes to be in control of the learning
   process itself.
   In the last years, podcasting has been explored for various purposes in
   several universities, with the goals of improving teaching/ learning
   processes and simultaneously engage students through innovation and
   motivation. According to some studies conducted worldwide, this
   technology has a great potential in the pedagogical arena for all the
   actors involved, yet there is the need to evaluate and consolidate the
   claimed results at the pedagogical level.
   Under the scope and following a project related to the integration of
   podcasts in higher education, several studies were conducted between
   2007/ 2008 and 2009/ 2010 at University of Minho, in Portugal, regarding
   the use of different types of podcasts in teaching/ learning of
   Genetics. The main conclusions of the research developed and some of the
   questions raised by the same studies will be presented in this work,
   namely the relevance of podcasting technology in teaching/ learning of
   Genetics, ii) the role of this innovation in engaging students, iii) the
   motivation achieved with this new pedagogical strategy, iv) the fact
   that students, considered digital natives, do not use mobile devices for
   learning and v) the implications for teachers of using podcasts with
   pedagogical approaches. In any case, evidence was collected towards
   students' acceptance and receptiveness to podcasting in Genetics
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Education is the foundation of any society and it is to transmit a
   common set of beliefs, values, norms, and understanding from the adult
   generation to its youths. Recent development in the field of information
   and communication technologies (ICTs), the sharp growth in education,
   and the new delivery mode of education is transforming the forms of
   learning and instruction. As a result, educators and training developers
   need not only rethink their approaches to teaching and training but also
   decides how technologies can support the learning or teaching process.
   Electronic education (e-education) is the next evolutionary step by
   electronic means using formal teaching methodologies and styles. The
   objective of education is not just making a student literate but also
   makes him a good human being. Today's youth are digital learner and
   their minds are being filled with lot of information through ICTs, but
   rather to teach them original objective of education. It is challenging
   to incorporate moral and ethical values into the students in
   e-education. This paper discuses the objective of education, integration
   of ICTs in e-education and suggests an innovative approach to obtain
   desired objectives with the aid of ICT equipments and tools.}},

Abstract = {{The promotion and development of foreign language learning and digital
   literacy are high on the European political and policy agenda, as set
   out in the eight key competencies for European citizens by the European
   Commission. The mobility, cooperation and employability within Europe of
   architectural and design learners, educators and practitioners may
   nevertheless be restrained by the emerging diversity and inequality of
   language learning opportunities in tertiary education. Foreign language
   teaching and learning is often separated from disciplinary content
   teaching and learning and English is increasingly the medium of
   instruction without language learning support. In 2003, Content Language
   and Integrated Learning was listed as one of the innovative methods to
   improve the quality of language teaching and learning, resonating
   strongly with European aspirations and goals of educating citizens and
   promoting lingual diversity, pluriculturism and mobility within the
   European Union. Whilst this approach has been used extensively in basic
   education, higher education has lagged behind. Compliance with the
   Bologna Process (1999) and harmonisation of higher education institution
   programmes in the European Higher Education Area offers opportunities to
   introduce change to existing curricula.
   This paper highlights one phase of an exploratory blended course, called
   ``CritIMPACT{''}, to enhance multiliteracies of French architecture
   undergraduates which was designed and implemented converging foreign
   language and content teaching and learning supported by information and
   communication technologies. The aim was to raise student awareness to
   the affordances of a three-dimensional immersive environment such as
   Second Life as both an experimental and real world design space. The
   specific aims were to 1) collaboratively co-design a trans-disciplinary
   course integrating English as a foreign language and architecture, in
   order to 2) raise awareness to existing professional practice using
   three-dimensional immersive technologies or `virtual worlds' as working
   tools and creative design spaces, and to 3) develop language of, in and
   through virtual architectural design. From a perspective of
   ethnomethodology, this paper captures a snapshot of culture in action
   and adopts awareness and accountability as core aspects of collaboration
   in the unfolding social situated learning. The results show that
   converging authentic content with natural occurring language can foster
   a deeper understanding of and appreciation for the affordances of
   immersive virtual environments and produce effective information access
   to relevant learning. The implications of these results, the outcomes,
   their interpretation and evaluation, together with the challenges and
   lessons learnt are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Analysing the features of v-learning environments we address the
   question of what effect a video-based teaching/learning architecture and
   the traditional processes of mathematical knowledge transfer have on
   each other. In the target group of college students in the worst
   situation we investigate the relationship Knowledge Architecture +
   Learning Design = Learning Experience (KA+ LD= LE) in order to address
   the following questions. What are the options to keep up the interest in
   a video-based learning environment? What tools may assist, supplement or
   even substitute the ``guidance of thought{''} that is so crucial in a
   face-to-face set-up? What are the technological and didactic solutions
   that support the student in the event of a loss of the train of thought,
   so critical from the point of view of understanding? Reflecting on the
   possibilities of various v-learning solutions and the latest
   instructional-technology innovations of the market, we outline what sort
   of web 2.0 related tools are capable of replacing traditional didactic
   elements and may supplement direct communication, and how the
   traditional teaching methods could be transformed alongside the KA+ LD=
   LE relationship as a result of the transformation of the learning
   environment. Further developing R. S. Wurman's vision of Information
   Architecture and adapting J.J. Garrett's concept of User Experience in
   the educational context we label Knowledge Architecture (KA) all
   information structures that lend themselves for design and
   representation in an independently interpretable form as long as they
   integrally contain the information required for their interpretation.
   KAs are didactically distinguished from the architecture of the learning
   environment serving knowledge transfer (KT'(2)). KT'(2) itself consist
   of elements, functions, designable interfaces for plannable activities,
   which establish contact between KAs and their structural elements. An
   e-didactic analysis of the KA+ LD= LE relationship shows that live
   recording of lectures integrated into proper knowledge transfer
   environment change the linear structure of knowledge acquisition in
   spite of the fixed nature of the video-stream. This raises the question
   of when and to what extent the subject matter demands the ``bound
   guidance{''} of attention and the control of understanding. This
   control, and the guidance of attention bound to the train of thought,
   often conflict with the learning practices of the digital generation
   within fields of study like mathematics that have deep and far reaching
   didactic traditions.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the paper is the design, enhancement and subsequent
   evaluation of open source learning platform for sub-Saharan immigrant
   women. With this, it is intended not only to make available to pupils in
   literacy Saharan immigrant population but also to exchange learning
   objects between schools for literacy of immigrants at risk of social
   exclusion. Also open and modular architecture allows the extension of
   the platform for the inclusion of library modules such as Greenstone
   with which to share information resources deposited in repositories at
   university libraries and schools that already have repositories of
   learning resources as Repository of the University Carlos III. It is
   intended that the dissemination of learning objects and educational
   resources is carried out taking into account the community iconographic
   female immigrant learner. It is designed to interface with icons adapted
   to their cultural environment of origin. Project researchers have
   teaching experience applicant on these platforms, as well as experience
   in the implementation of digital libraries in Open Course platforms.
   Been directed to work on the application level and evaluation of a
   digital library in a cultural center for the formation of immigrant
   communities at risk of social exclusion. They have worked with the
   University Cheikh Anta Diop in two projects funded by AECID on the use
   of Moodle to train teachers in innovative teaching techniques. The
   result was the creation of a common learning platform between
   universities Carlos III and Cheikh Anta Diop that allows the delivery of
   courses to students of both universities by professors from both
   universities. From the experience gained in both projects recently
   completed, we intend to design a new learning platform in a system
   called Drupal Open Course. With this we adapt the information
   architecture of the platform to the difficulties of learning the learner
   community who come to train in House of Senegal. These adaptations
   include a user interface design for the technique `` Drag and Drop{''}
   learners are capable of learning objects move across the platform and
   access them through an iconic language defined from their cultural
   heritage. We start with a map of icons defined from a sample of images
   taken objects from Wolof culture. Surveys are conducted on the
   significance of each image among students of Casa de Senegal. It gives
   them a meaning of each symbol and asked to confirm or otherwise indicate
   what it means to them. With the map icons and the meanings assigned to
   each of them, digitize and include it in the platform handle replacing
   the buttons with new buttons to the iconography of the map. Then the
   teachers ask the center to evaluate the new tool for use as a learning
   platform with their students. Finally, we introduce a test of
   participant observation among students in order to know the usability of
   the tool in meeting their educational needs.}},

Abstract = {{Drama provides a rich complement to academic studies, and in most
   English-speaking countries, some of the richest experiences with
   dramatic language involve Shakespeare's plays. It is an unfortunate
   habit of teachers that this complex subject area is usually left until
   the end of most students' high school years, when few students are as
   engaged with the study of English, and most would argue that they are
   only studying Shakespeare to do well on a final exam, with no further
   implications in their lives. More innovative teachers have brought the
   ``young English{''} that Shakespeare described in some of most memorable
   lines in any language into intermediate and even primary classrooms. In
   order to assist younger learners with their first encounter with
   Shakespeare plays, the author proposes an investigation of the current
   pedagogical practices involving Shakespeare in the elementary
   classrooms, with special attention to how network and digital media play
   a part in this experience. Is it possible to create a Virtual Learning
   Environment (VLE) that will allow students access into the plays as they
   were originally written for the stage, rather than as they are usually
   text printed, studied and worked over in paper-bound books? How
   interactive can this on-line resource become while still presenting
   Shakespeare's plays as works of literature? Finally, will students who
   explore the plays using the VLE become better equipped to understand the
   plays when they see them performed on stage, or even stage one of the
   plays themselves? These questions and concerns will be addressed in
   research conducted at elementary schools and learning centres in
   Vancouver, Canada, and the surrounding Lower Mainland in the province of
   British Columbia.
   Informing this investigation into Shakespearean VLEs are the thoughts
   and pedagogical practices of Mary Hartman, the Director of Education for
   Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival, an internationally recognized
   theatre company founded by current Artistic Director Christopher Gaze.
   Ms. Hartman's strong belief that children are ideally suited to play
   with Shakespeare's language, reflected in their readiness to communicate
   and collaborate with social media, makes a well-designed VLE a valuable
   tool for any teacher at any grade level. With these innovative thoughts
   on technology's place in drama at school, the oral presentation will
   also model what the VLE will look like, and even demonstrate how it will
   be used by students who now do not even need to be in the same classroom
   to experience and learn about Shakespeare's plays. The possibilities for
   e-learning and student-centered study of the plays are as boundless as
   Juliet's sea, where the more students put into the resource, the more
   they have to learn from, ``for both are infinite.{''} (Rom. \& Jul. II,

Abstract = {{The emergence of electronic learning (e-Learning) has transformed the
   ways of communication between learner and teacher as a consequence
   changing their roles and responsibilities. It presents huge challenges
   to the roles and responsibilities of teacher and students. The teachers'
   role has been changed from traditional role as transmitter of knowledge
   to facilitator who helps the learner through virtual environment.
   Teachers have to decide whether to try to pull learner away from their
   native digital world or to motivate digital learner by tapping into
   their digital world and using their natural inclination and
   inquisitiveness about all that is digital. There is great challenge for
   educators and training developers to rethink their approaches to
   teaching and training and also to decide how technologies can support
   the learning and teaching. The paper will discuss the roles and
   responsibilities of teacher and students and will suggest an innovative
   approach for the best use of technologies for e-Learning.}},

Abstract = {{Our students are our future dentists therefore we have an obligation to
   teach them how to intertwine the most advanced and innovative technology
   available in their day to day patient interaction. Our students mission
   is to improve patient quality of care. To be a student leader in using
   advanced technology is a rewarding fact for their patients, bringing
   student-patient interaction to a much higher level. The students need to
   apply clinical and educational visualization techniques when relating
   treatment plans and alternatives to their patients. This can be done
   with a number of diagnostic treatment-planning tools at our disposal:
   digital radiography, intraoral cameras, digital photography, smile
   simulation and interactive programs. The visual modality of
   communicating dental information to patients increases case acceptance.
   The modality used by the students educates them with treatment options
   in order to best serve patients. The future dentist has an obligation to
   provide patients with the most innovative technology available. Our
   mission as dental educators is to provide our students with the tools
   necessary in order to better serve their current and future patients,
   with emphasis on improving their dental, oral and ultimately general
   ultimate goal our students need to achieve is to enter the work force as
   confident, proficient clinicians serving the dental needs with the
   highest level of education and professionalism.}},

Abstract = {{Technological innovation has given access to information anytime
   anywhere through various hand held devices. The content type has evolved
   from plain text to rich media. Content delivery is based on the user
   preference and their likings. Technology has also changed the job
   requirements, with relevant skills based on emerging technologies.
   Students and professionals need to acquire required skills that are
   relevant to the industry. Educational institutions will have to address
   the required training needs for specific job skills. Need arises to
   identify the use of emerging technologies in the digital economy. In
   this paper, the authors discuss e-learning based on industry needs using
   emerging technologies such as mobile, cloud, social media and business
   process management (BPM) tools. It further discusses the adoption of
   technological innovation, and how BPM tools can give more flexibility to
   change the delivery model, in turn change the learning pattern of
   students. A delivery model integrated with Social media, BPM tools
   hosted on portal server deployed on Cloud infrastructure accessible from
   internet browser and mobile devices is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Content and Language Integrate Learning (CLIL) is experiencing a moment
   of great attention at European level because of its potential to improve
   the quality of language as well as content. The same interest is devoted
   to the opportunity that technology can offer to education in formal
   settings, e. g., school, university, professional development. The aim
   of this paper is to report about a research in the field which involved
   primary and secondary schools in Lombardy (Italy). In particular the
   focus of the investigation was the relationship between CLIL and
   technology. The CLIL methodology has proved its efficacy in involving
   students in active learning, albeit its practical use in curricular
   activities has still some difficulties to overcome. The main issue is
   the level of qualification that a school teacher is requested to deal
   with the new approach in her/his curricular classes. As a result most
   European states are reinforcing teacher training. In particular teachers
   have to find the right balance between language and content so that the
   CLIL can prove its efficacy improving not only language learning, but
   also the quality of content learning. The research also focused on the
   role of technology and the enhancement that CLIL could experience with
   the support of it. The basis for this statement can be found in a new
   reference paradigm which considers new technology not only an
   instrument, but also an active scenario where we interact {[}1].
   The study was based on a multi focus perspective where theory, research
   and practise work together in a dynamic process {[}2]. The reference
   paradigm was the interpretative one which wanted to highlight learning
   strategies, management and control of the classroom as well as new
   approaches to professional development. According to the naturalistic
   nature of the investigation the instruments used where mainly
   qualitative; e. g., classroom observation, video recording of lessons,
   teacher's diary, interview with teachers and semi-structured
   questionnaire. The research was divided in the following stages:
   selection of samples
   creation of Web tools
   creation of specific CLIL materials
   implementation of the intervention
   evaluation of the findings
   The first stage requested to search for representative cases where to
   develop a targeted intervention was possible. The sample was made up of
   one classroom of primary school and one of lower secondary school. The
   second stage was dedicated to the creation of an educational portal
   www.wordofmouth.it which should satisfy the need for a space easy to
   access, attractive and dynamic. In it different Web tools were embedded;
   i.e., Wiki, Blog, Forum, Video-conference, Calendar, Video and
   Photo-sharing. The use of advanced technology was sustained by the
   support of the Interactive Whiteboard (IW). The teachers were actively
   involved in the creation of CLIL materials. Both teachers chose science
   as content subject. The investigation was conducted during the school
   years 2008/2010 and was completed in 2011.
   The research proved the positive effect of digital learning in enhancing
   CLIL. Students and teachers were satisfied with the experience and hoped
   to continue with it. In particular teachers asserted that they had
   experienced a positive moment in their career.}},

Abstract = {{As competition among higher education institutions intensifies, colleges
   and universities are developing innovative strategies to attract and
   retain students, and to prepare them for the workforce of the 21st
   century. Online education and other technology based tools are being
   increasingly utilized to meet these objectives. As a result, some of the
   underlying premises of higher education and thoughts of how student
   needs should be met are fundamentally changing. At the core of these
   changes is the belief that because traditional college students of today
   are digital natives, they are necessarily digital learners. In other
   words, students are exposed to technology so early and in so many areas
   of their lives, they now expect to experience technology in their
   learning as well ({[}1]).
   Researchers also suggest that increased technology in the education
   experience enhances learning as it motivates students, encourages
   participation and interaction, and energizes the classroom ({[}2],
   {[}3], 4], {[}5], {[}6]). Most importantly, incorporating technology in
   their education helps students prepare for their future roles as working
   professionals ({[}3]). In order to compete for scarce employment in the
   21st century, entry-level employees must not only have advanced
   education, but they must also demonstrate the ability to use and apply
   technology in innovative ways to solve problems and to interact in a
   global society.
   Faculty are, therefore, encouraged to incorporate technology in online
   as well as face-to-face instruction. Moreover, in some institutions,
   faculty are denigrated for failing to embrace or incorporate new media
   and technologies. The assumption is that these faculty are behind the
   times or resistant to change and innovation. This quantitative study
   investigated the use and acceptance of some of these technologies by
   surveying the faculty of a private, Catholic University. The
   significance of the paper is that faculty are constantly bombarded with
   new and unique ways to incorporate technological tools into teaching,
   and on occasion may even be pressured into believing that the tool
   itself enables or encourages learning among students. Findings show that
   respondents incorporated technology with their instruction, and they
   believed this technology enhanced student learning. However, faculty did
   not believe the institution provided adequate support or training in the
   use of the technology. Implications of this research, recommendations
   for the effective use of advanced technologies, and suggestions for
   additional research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Knowledge Society made the concept of lifelong learning a continuous
   objective, necessity and challenge driving changes in the way we learn.
   Today lifelong learning became an essential ``way of life{''} for many
   individuals permanently engaged in personal self-development by seeking
   new ways of extending their knowledge and skills. For them lifelong
   learning is a tool for better and faster professional development thus
   building a sustainable career.
   In itself, lifelong learning sets new requirements to learning - to be
   faster, cheaper and better. But to be more efficient lifelong learning
   needs new concepts, approaches, integrated solutions and flexible tools
   that can be easily adapted to various informal training needs and
   models.
   Obviously today there is a critical need of significantly improved
   concepts and methodologies to guide a new instructional design and
   development of more efficient e-learning/e-training processes.
   The paper describes a new instructional design and its implementation
   into lifelong learning and vocational education and training. Course
   development and learning process management methodology based on Lean
   principles makes e-learning more efficient by:
   -shifting from the ``passive{''} book paradigm to a new ``active{''}
   e-learning content structure and information workflow conveying the
   knowledge,
   -integrating measurement and control elements into the digital content
   workflow and thus improve the efficiency of the whole e-learning process
   and its management,
   -designing knowledge maps by dynamically hyper linking ``active{''}
   knowledge and learning objects on them and charting shortest learning
   paths.
   -The major advantage of the proposed innovative methodology is that the
   well performed self-directed autonomous learners get the exact required
   outcomes (=knowledge) with no waste of time (=improved efficiency).
   The presented methodology is well suited to all learning areas, but it
   has clear advantages in learning applications with precisely predefined
   learning goals (the exact knowledge and skills to be acquired at the end
   of the course). From this point of view, the paper presents the way of
   integration of this methodology into learning/training process oriented
   on the improving knowledge in the area of renewable energies.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays it is essential to think education differently. In particular
   the effect of globalisation and of the unification of European countries
   asked the European members to rethink the way education is conceived.
   Digital competence as well as foreign language fluency can be considered
   mandatory for the new generations. As a consequence the whole education
   has to be reconsidered from the ground up. A particular attention should
   be dedicated to the training of the next generation of teachers.
   Specifically for the language field the growing interest in Content and
   Language Integrate Learning (CLIL) in European countries has led to pay
   higher consideration to the language training. As a consequence
   university courses in education should include CLIL training on a
   regular bases and as an important part of their curriculum as well as
   they have to involve more technology in teacher training.
   Taking into account the above issue and working in pair with a school
   research in the field a research in Catholic University (Milan) was
   developed during the academic years 2008-2010. It involved the course of
   General Teaching of the School of Education. The positive result led to
   the decision to turn the experimental project into part of the
   curricular activities. This paper reports about the development of the
   project from an investigation to its regular inclusion in the curriculum
   of the course.
   The idea of stimulating the future teachers developed from the
   observation of the English curriculum of teacher students in Italy. They
   have to attend three English courses during their university career and
   when they take their Bachelor Degree they also obtain a certificate to
   teach English in primary school. They usually know the theoretical
   foundations of CLIL, but they have not experienced it enough on their
   own. The result is uncertainty and fear of failure that lead the new
   teachers not to use it with their students. To overcome that problem it
   was decided to introduce a module of the General Teaching course using
   the CLIL approach and sustained by the use of technology.
   The research was divided in five stages: selection of the sample,
   creation of the Web tools, creation of specific CLIL materials,
   implementation of the intervention, evaluation of the intervention.
   During the research period different attempts were done to evaluate the
   most effective strategies according to the age of students and their
   general lack of desire to face further difficulties in the study of the
   specific subject. The investigation demonstrated the efficacy of the
   project. Its inclusion in the regular course during the next academic
   years was sustained by the increasing interest of students who declared
   to be highly motivated in learning content in English. The initial
   mistrust towards something new was changed into a positive attitude
   which was able to help students to develop a specific interest in the
   project and to work hard although they faced some difficulties because
   of their prior unfamiliarity with the foreign language. In fact they
   were not used to conceive it as a communication tool, but an end in
   itself.}},

Abstract = {{Social media is traditionally defined as a plurality of Web applications
   supporting creating and exchange of user-generated content. In this
   paper, we propose a more general understanding to this phenomenon. We
   consider the Social media as a cultural phenomenon, enhancing
   interpersonal communication and changing the nature of relationship
   between an individual and a society. Web 2.0, that is a technological
   basis of social media, provides possible forms of network activity such
   as social networks, blogs, forums, wikis, etc. Digital curation is one
   of the most innovative types of the social media. The curation is a
   specific form of blogging, in which one receives an input stream of data
   generated according to a predefined set of keywords, and then carries
   out his/her own filtering by selecting messages around specific topic,
   which in the curators opinion are of interest and are ``worthy{''} to be
   included in his/her personal ``curation blog{''}. The result of
   ``individual curation{''} is a curated stream of content. Different
   curated streams may interact, thus forming meaningful networks. In turn,
   management of the curated streams of different users may be called
   meta-curation. A meta-curator may direct the streams in a desired
   direction. In our paper, this model is proposed for new learning
   activities where students created curated streams and a teacher performs
   meta-curation, for example, according to the aim of a lesson. The
   curation phenomenon is a natural result of the evolution of learning
   activities in the classroom.
   Indeed: a) in a traditional class characteristic for industrial society,
   the learning process goes from observation to forming the content, then
   to an oral and written statement of the content in a form of
   presentation or composition; b) in a post-industrial class, the process
   goes from learning materials mostly found on the web, and web surfing to
   analysis and storing the content, and finally leads to the curation. We
   conduct our study in a group of MA students' participating in a research
   seminar. Scoop (http://www.scoop.it/) is used as a curation tool. Each
   of participants curates his research topic. He/she selects, collects,
   tags, comments and shares materials enriching the topic. At the end of
   the course, students summarize their curation experience in a form of
   written report.
   The study consists of two stages. At the first stage, we follow the
   participants' curation topics in order to understand how their personal
   identities affect their work. The second stage includes observations of
   the class discussions regarding the curation activity and analysis of
   students believes about the curation process. The paper provides our
   preliminary results that allow estimating the curation as a tool with
   great potential in education.}},

Abstract = {{The assertions and empirical evidence in the research world of
   technology and language teaching and learning support and highly
   encourage the use of technology in second and foreign language teaching
   and learning. Research on computer-assisted language learning puts
   forward the belief that the integration of technologies into language
   teaching and learning provides EFL/ESL learners with more authentic
   input and creates an ample environment which promotes situations that
   stimulate interest, allow communication, enhance reactivity, foster a
   sense of personal worth, facilitate collaborative and cooperative work,
   and most importantly permit rich learning experiences.
   Situated in the field of technology and language teaching and learning,
   the current paper reports a mixed-method research study on the use of
   digital storytelling for developing EFL learners' speaking skills. The
   purpose of this research study, therefore, was threefold: primarily, to
   investigate the impact of digital storytelling on EFL learners' speaking
   skills, secondly, to reveal the learners' attitude towards implementing
   the program, and thirdly, to report the students' learning behaviours
   when using the program.
   Accordingly, this quasi-experimental study revealed the effect of a
   7-week's instructional treatment on speaking skills, in which speaking
   was addressed to be developed in terms of the integration of digital
   storytelling. 12 learners assigned to the experimental group and the
   same number to the control group participated in the study. The
   experimental group received the treatment, while the control group got
   the placebo, i.e. speaking tasks were carried out by traditional means
   of storytelling. The learners' oral performance was elicited by means of
   interactional tasks.
   The instrumentations used for data collection constituted pre and post
   tests, an attitudinal questionnaire, and a semi-structured interview
   which served to collect quantitative and qualitative data, respectively.
   The results of statistical analysis displayed that there was a trend
   towards significant gains in the learners' oral production after the
   treatment. It also documented the learners' positive attitude towards
   the program.}},

Abstract = {{Sangakoo is an online network focused on the collaborative learning of
   mathematics. This unique approach to learning is based on three core
   principles:
   1. Creating: Why learn actively? There is no better way to learn than by
   creating new problems. If students are able to create math problems they
   can solve them. Additionally, learning actively fosters creativity,
   confidence and personal skills such as knowledge, intelligence and study
   habits.
   2. Sharing: Why learn collaboratively? Collaborative learning is a
   powerful educational tool. The ``we{''} is more intelligent than the
   ``I{''}. Sangakoo creates a virtual space where students can help and
   teach each other. The learning process is enhanced with the introduction
   of an accepted and appropriate form of tutoring.
   3. CSCL: Computer Supported Collaborative Learning. We put today's
   technologies at the service of active and collaborative learning in
   coherence with the principles of knowledge societies: global, connected,
   trans-cultural, trans-disciplinary and adaptable.
   How it works:
   Sangakoo may be used individually or collectively by a group, an entire
   school or different classes to learn collaboratively. Each group forms a
   community of teachers and students. It is possible to create as many
   virtual classrooms with as many members as needed. Each classroom is
   managed by a teacher.
   Sangakoo, more than a methodology:
   As digital book, Sangakoo provides the equivalent of more than 1,000
   printed pages of math theory. The contents are organized into sections,
   topics and levels ranging from secondary education right on through to
   first years of university education with a focus on technical
   disciplines. Each topic and level can help students in their learning
   process complementing contents introduced by the teacher.
   The driving force behind Sangakoo:
   Sangakoo is the result of a meeting between Enrique Gracian,
   mathematician and expert in pedagogy and communication, and Pere Monras,
   leader in the knowledge economy and founding partner of the
   ``constructary{''} helix3c, a constructive consulting firm. Both had
   reflected on pedagogy, intelligence and collaborative work, so they
   jointly created Sangakoo, a platform designed not to teach but to learn.
   Our Pledge:
   Sangakoo relies on a trans-cultural and trans-disciplinary community of
   people committed to proactive education, creating a collaborative
   learning technology applicable to diverse contents.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The object of this presentation is to emphasize the need, in
   digital learning -web classroom application- to define an appropriate
   method that focus the digital inquiry from drafting a guidelines set. In
   this paper I want to underline the utility of general and specific
   guidelines to pilot the student digital learning in `history, theory and
   criticism of architecture' at the School of Architecture - Universidad
   Politecnica de Madrid-.
   Conclusions: The conclusions of my classroom application research is
   that the use of general and specific guidelines is the only method to
   guarantee similar or superior results in digital learning as opposed to
   traditional lecturing on `history, theory and criticism of
   architecture'. It is therefore convenient to encourage the teaching
   skills to define an appropriate methodology, based on the definition of
   general and specific guidelines.
   Method and guidelines in digital learning: we understand that the
   difficulty in digital learning does not lie in applying digital tools
   -right software- but in defining the proper guidelines in order to
   ensure learning, edition and knowledge transfer.
   In this sense, we consider the IBL -Inquiry Based Learning- the suitable
   method to warrant the acquisition, transmission, processing and storing
   of information of a particular subject in the university education.
   For our purposes -the education in architecture-, we understand that
   once the technological skills are tested as suitable -training in
   technological resources and their classroom application- teachers must
   focus the digital education through: 1. State precisely the objectives
   and criteria of the research, according to the target achieved, 2.
   Select the exploration tools and the information management, 3. Define
   the pursuit results, 4. Divert to the resources and educational content
   repositories -web pages, databases...-, 5. Delineate the goals and
   appropriate software to process the information results -2D + 3D-, 6.
   Outline the evaluation and self-evaluation systems, and 7. Facilitate
   the storage and transmission of results.
   The general and specific guidelines in digital learning constitute the
   elemental device to settle the digital education based on IBL; it is
   therefore a top priority to define the general guidelines - according to
   the analytical study of architecture- and the specific ones - according
   to the historical, theoretical, and critical study of architecture-. The
   guidelines must lead and manage the student digital search - supported
   by the advisory teacher-, promoting: 1. The acquisition of the proper
   information - exploration/selection-, 2. The analysis and synthesis of
   the information, 3. The definition of the objectives and systems -2D +
   3D- that prevail in the processing of the information, and 4. The
   digital storing and publication of the information -2D + 3D-.
   Postscript: the need to transform university learning into a more
   dynamic activity, - based on digital technologies-, as well as to
   motivate students towards knowledge training, will require the
   definition of a methodology based on the application guidelines to
   provide a proper use of the emerging technologies of education.}},

Abstract = {{The current study is designed as a quantitative study, which aims to
   investigate preservice ICT teachers' perceptions about the use of
   digital games for educational purposes within educational settings. The
   participants of the study are preservice ICT teachers who are currently
   enrolled in the Middle East Technical University, which is one of the
   top-notch universities in Turkey as well as one of the top 100
   universities in the world. In this study, survey method was used. A
   questionnaire that contained fifty-seven likert-type items was delivered
   to the senior students of Computer Education and Instructional
   Technology Department, who are prospective ICT teachers. In Turkey, it
   is expected from ICT teachers to be the innovators and early adapters of
   new technologies and instructional methods and to not only integrate
   them to their own instruction but also help other branch teachers for a
   seamless integration in their instruction. Thus, understanding
   preservice ICT teachers' perception can provide important information
   and insight about the diffusion of technology use within schools and
   should be investigated thoroughly and analyzed meticulously. More
   specifically, exploring preservice ICT teachers' perception about
   digital games and their use in educational settings might shed light on
   the debate of whether educational games developed by educators are
   serving their purposes or not.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increased interest in competitive technologies, access
   network operators are keen to deploy a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
   that uses the existing copper-based telephony infrastructure. This is
   because of its low deployment cost compared to fiber user based access
   networks and relatively high bandwidth compared to wireless access
   networks. As power costs and sustainable business operations become key
   concerns, energy-efficient access networks including DSL is gaining
   traction. In this book chapter, the authors study different ways to save
   energy in access networks: spectral optimization at the physical layer
   and deployment practices. While they focus on DSL technology, the
   concepts as described can be readily applied to other access
   technologies such as fiber, cable, or wireless.
   Traditionally, communication systems are focused on the rate
   maximization as an end-user utility and hence do not care about the
   energy consumption. The authors show that they can trade-off power
   against data rate, as long as this does not impact the required service
   by taking into account the power cost to achieve certain user's social
   utility, e.g. data rate. The potential energy gains depend on both the
   hardware technology and the aggregate transmit power.
   The second part of this chapter focuses on deployment practices and
   describes how different access network architectures can improve the
   energy consumption, when considering both the telecom equipment and its
   supporting functions. The authors show that introducing an access
   network architecture that distributes more functions in the outside
   plant does not negatively impact energy consumption of the access
   network. A use case for the Benelux is worked out and a related
   innovation in the Swisscom access network shows that also in the more
   centralized architectures further optimizations are possible.(1)}},

Abstract = {{The speech will describe the recent evolutionary paths of European
   research about Enterprise Interoperability. In 2006, the Enterprise
   Interoperability cluster of European projects coined the term ISU
   (Interoperability Service Utility) as the new IT infrastructure able to
   provide interoperability services to all SMEs, at low cost and under
   non-rivalry and non-discriminatory principles. This concept has been
   studied and developed further by the COIN flagship Integrated Project
   (COllaboration and INteroperability for networked enterprises),
   coordinated by TXT e-solutions, which started in 2008 and developed a
   first prototype of ISU by means of a dynamic federation of open and
   trusted Generic Service Delivery Platforms as well as envisaging a set
   of innovative business models for Enterprise Interoperability as a
   Service-Utility. More recently, the advent of EU 2020 Strategy and
   Digital Agenda for Europe confirmed the importance of having
   ``interoperability and standards{''} as one of the most important
   pillars for a single digital market for European citizens and
   enterprises. This evident commoditization trend could induce readers to
   think that in 10 years time interoperability will not matter anymore (N.
   Carr ``IT does not matter{''}) and that it will soon be absorbed by
   Cloud Computing and Future Internet as one of the fundamental services
   of a so-called Universal Business System. However, more and more eminent
   scientists tend now to agree that it is when a technology really becomes
   a utility and apparently does not matter anymore (Z. Turk calls it
   sedimentation) that innovation could find the most fertile and promising
   ground to develop and grow. Based on the sound and solid base of Future
   Internet core platform and enterprise interoperability utility
   infrastructure, a new project, MSEE (Manufacturing SErvice Ecosystem),
   coordinated by TXT and started in October 2011, is now trying to explore
   how the commoditization and openness of IT could become an enabler for
   service innovation in the manufacturing industry, allowing virtual
   factories and enterprises to adopt a value co-creation and service
   dominant logic instead of a traditional perspective of producing and
   selling just physical goods. It is thanks to Enterprise Modelling and
   Interoperability as an integrated part of a Universal Business System
   that a milling machine industry could sell ``holes per minute{''} or
   that an aircraft engine industry could sell ``flying hours{''} or that a
   traditional car manufacturer could sell ``mobility kilometers{''}. As a
   future perspective, the speech will also address the key question
   whether technical-service-business innovation, implemented for instance
   by the Factories of the Future and the MSEE project, could be sufficient
   for European manufacturing industry to overcome the current economic
   crisis or, instead, a re-thinking of skills and competencies of
   employees is needed in order to implement and take up the changes
   imposed by innovation. In this perspective, a new research initiative,
   coordinated by TXT and called TELL ME (Technology Enhanced Learning
   Livinglab for Manufacturing Environments), is going to be launched in
   November 2012 with the aim of implementing human-centric manufacturing
   and innovative methods and solutions for blue collar workers lifelong
   training, via open innovation and participative creativity Living Labs.}},

Abstract = {{The beta website of Science-Forums.net was developed by Information
   International Associates, Inc. (IIa) through the Department of Energy
   (DOE) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. By leveraging
   scientist/researcher information in databases managed by DOE'S Office of
   Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), Science-Forums.net will
   allow scientists to easily collaborate on a scientific topic of
   interest. In addition to potentially yielding commercial applications,
   the functionality of Science-Forums.net is well suited to OSTI's family
   of scientific and technical information (STI) websites for research and
   development.
   The objective of the SBIR-{''}Interactive Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Scientific
   Communication in the Digital Library Environment{''}-was to research and
   identify web-based tools and other concepts that will foster online
   interaction and collaboration among scientists and researchers. These
   tools can facilitate scientific discovery and innovation.
   Phase I methods included (1) survey of available technologies, (2)
   analysis and prioritization of technologies, (3) design and planning of
   a foundational tool for online interaction, (4) development and
   implementation of approaches to obtain feedback from researchers and
   scientists, (5) research into privacy and communications examples and
   guidelines to address government privacy and survey requirements, and
   (6) investigation into scientists' use and interest in social media
   tools for research and communication.(1)
   Phase II has focused on (1) development of the tool into a beta-ready
   site for feedback from a test group of previously identified, interested
   researchers, (2) refinement of the privacy policy and user terms and
   conditions documents, and (3) further research of bibliographic/metadata
   controls to create and exchange documents and other content.}},

Abstract = {{Social networking debuted in 1997 and is now an established and common
   method of communication and is increasingly related to and supportive of
   academic publishing, scholarship and generating new information. Some of
   the most mature and popular sites are Facebook, Bebo, Twitter, Linked-In
   and Plaxo plus many more specialized examples. As many professional
   societies and individuals choose to develop a presence on social
   networking sites (SNSs), the utility of them has become more valuable
   and ubiquitous. With emerging forms of technology to provide personal
   space and networking opportunities, the sites gain a new presence
   blending information products with new means to be discovered and
   searched. This paper explores how academic libraries are implementing a
   range of social networking activities to augment their online presence
   through traditional websites and launch new ways for their users to
   find, discover, access, navigate, evaluate, create and apply content.
   Libraries are also extending access with greater mobile optimized sites
   for Smartphones (iPhone, Droid, and Blackberry) and other emerging
   technologies that enhance information in utilizing and managing data,
   images, audio and streaming media. Today, library collections and
   services are being transformed due to electronic publishing, data
   curation, preservation and archiving efforts in order to allow users
   dependable 24/7 access to resources with potential for interactive
   communication. In an increasingly global and mobile society, the new
   social communication mediums reduce boundaries, transcend the digital
   divide and invite more transparency and participation by shadowing the
   grey parameters in the scholarly community and redefining publishing
   outputs and opportunities. This evolution did not happen without
   cautious regard to intellectual property, privacy and confidentiality.
   The new by-products are not always tangible but remain instructive and
   promote innovation within communication as a new adopted and accepted
   form of authorship and creative expression. By adding the social
   communication features of this kind of networking that promotes
   introduction, networking, commentary, critique, discourse, sharing, and
   the building of new communities, grey content is enhanced and the
   sources of access multiply with an open and entrepreneurial future for
   SNSs.}},

   Radio Dialogue in Zimbabwe}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{484-500}},
Abstract = {{This article critically discusses audience participation and civic
   engagement in Radio Dialogue as a pirate radio station. As an illegal
   broadcaster, the station innovatively combines the use of ward
   committees and digital media technologies such as the Internet and
   mobile phones to create a participatory culture that is potentially
   organic, bottom-up, and democratic. While the democratic potential of
   participation and the digital media in pirate radio are acknowledged,
   they are seen as very much socially and historically contingent. While
   participation and the digital media are sometimes erroneously seen as
   synonymous with deliberative public spheres, I argue that they can also
   be used to support and legitimize authoritarian cultures that are
   embedded in the everyday, non-institutionalized forms of power.
   Participation is not always positive, as it can be top-down, mediated,
   regulated, and therefore exclusive and undemocratic. It can serve as a
   regime of endorsement and disapproval for political, economic and
   cultural power. Digital media can also be reconstructed to support
   undemocratic cultures that are not only embedded in radio's
   organizational and institutional journalistic practices, but also in the
   power relations concealed by the rituals of how society communicates
   with itself. These norms ultimately determine whether it is the voices
   of men, women, youth, the poor, or the elite in the community that find
   expression through digital media.}},

Abstract = {{The FinFET devices have been on focus in recent years due its elevated
   gate control capability over the channel region, what gives this
   technology a scalability advantage against others. The planar Diamond
   MOSFET layout, on the other hand, has also shown great results regarding
   its possible use on integrated circuits applications. In this paper, the
   concept of the Diamond layout style is extended to its three-dimensional
   version, the Diamond FinFET. 3D numerical simulations are performed in
   order to compare the possible advantages and disadvantages between this
   innovative layout style and its conventional counterpart, keeping the
   same gate area, geometric factor and bias conditions. It is shown that
   this new device inherits the qualities of its planar MOSFET version and
   it is proved that it can reduce significantly the die area of the analog
   and digital (mixed) low-power low-voltage integrated circuits due to its
   high capability as current driver.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative approach to online fruition of theater
   performances. Web applications like traditional viewers are already
   available for the wide audience of Internet users. Our proposal aims at
   adding both interactivity and multi-layer fruition, and a way to
   manipulate and create new media. The premise to reach these goals is
   digitizing a number of heterogeneous materials in order to describe a
   single performance comprehensively, e.g. different video and audio-takes
   from different perspectives, and a number of related materials such as
   scripts, fashion plates, playbills, etc. The format we adopt to encode
   such information is based on the XML international standard known as
   IEEE 1599. Finally, an advanced Web player supporting search and play
   functions for synchronized materials must be designed. This work
   describes the whole process, from the acquisition of materials directly
   on the stage to their publishing on a Web portal.}},

Abstract = {{Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) oscillators are now replacing
   quartz crystal oscillators. These new oscillators provide higher
   performance, new features, improved relaiability, shorter lead times,
   and reduced cost. This paper describes the design and construction of
   MEMS oscillators and presents data from the highest performance devices
   to date. They have frequency stability of +/- 0.5 parts per milions
   (ppm) from -40 to 85 degrees C, random phase jitter of 0.5 ps RMS
   integrated from 12 kHz to 20 MHz, period jitter of 1.5 ps RMS, and Allan
   deviation under 5 parts per billion (ppb) at 0.1 to 10 second strides.
   Recent advances in MEMS resonators, temperature-to-digital converters
   (TDCs), and fractional synthesizers have enabled this performance.
   Additional capabilities supported by these innovations are highlighted,
   includeing digital controlled oscillators (DCXOs) and frequency
   selectable oscillators (FSXOs).}},

Abstract = {{Electronic inks have been developed for each primary color to serve as
   the imaging fluids for novel electro-kinetic display (EKD) technology,
   which uses in-plane optical effects and out of plane switching fields to
   switch between color and clear states, allowing a stacked color layer
   approach. The need for compaction into small volumes to achieve a clear
   state and repeated cycles of spreading and compaction creates challenges
   for the stabilization and charging of colorant particles. Surfactants
   play a critical role in determining system behaviors. This paper reports
   on the latest findings of surfactant influence on optical switching and
   bistability characteristics of display performance for some proprietary
   surfactant formulations.
   HP's combination of novel device architecture, proprietary inks, and R2R
   manufacturing platform enables the required attributes for electronic
   media such as flexibility, robustness, low power, transparency,
   print-quality color, and scalability at low cost. The innovations
   described in this paper are applicable to either segmented or pixilated
   electronic media, and are currently being developed for both digital

Abstract = {{As global environmental consciousness emerges, use of high technology to
   reduce environmental pollution has become a critical imperative for
   economies the world over. In recent years' development and applications
   of ICT monitors have increasingly served to displace traditional paper
   based displays, yielding tremendous environmental efficacy. Digital
   e-paper displays enjoy numerous competitive advantages including energy
   efficiency, eye friendliness, resilient durability, and readability, but
   are currently generally only deployed in e-book uses, so enhancing their
   application scope, in addition to relying on their reading comfort, the
   market will no doubt develop appreciable economic and environmental
   benefits. Hence this study deploys the perspective of applications
   innovation, to explore uses of e-paper solutions in MRT advertising
   contexts on the advertising efficacy aspects of both advertising memory
   and advertising attitudes. This research relies on in situ experimental
   methods, at an existing MRT station in Taipei on the island of Taiwan,
   through convenience sampling to select 100 study subjects, who were
   asked to view two encased displays (either a digital e-paper display or
   paper display) with public notice contents, prior to completing the
   study survey and statistical analysis of the valid responses. The study
   findings indicate that, for the general public MRT patrons, digital
   e-paper advertising solutions yielded optimal efficacy for both
   advertising memory and advertising attitude, with significant results
   along the dimensions of both advertising receptiveness and interest.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a snapshot optical imaging system capable of taking
   multiple images simultaneously and sending them to a CCD detector. Using
   an innovative lens array design, the beam obtained from the fundus
   camera is segmented into several different images passed through several
   different bandpass filters. Each bandpass filter defines a unique
   spectral region of imaging. The images are taken simultaneously into a
   large silicone chip with a dynamic range of 16 bits (highly sensitive)
   and are integrated with a single optical connection to a digital fundus
   camera.
   Our algorithm maps blood oxygen saturation of the retina using several
   wavelengths. These wavelengths are capable of approximating the whole
   hemoglobin spectrum and have been found from a previously developed
   hyperspectral algorithm. They include four isosbestic points (522, 548,
   569, and 586 nm) and three oxygen-sensitive points (542, 560, and 586
   nm) where the difference between fully oxygenated and deoxygenated blood
   is at a maximum. Using MatLab code, color maps of oxygen saturation are
   produced.
   The average value taken from all vein areas was 60.53\%, assuming that
   the artery oxygen saturation value is 98\%. Oxygen saturation of the
   tissue was 75.78\%. Oxygen saturations of the temporal/inferior/nasal
   veins ranged from 61.86\% to 63.37\%; the superior vein was
   significantly lower (54.19\%). Tissue oxygen saturations in different
   quadrants of the eye ranged from 74.17\% to 76.74\%.
   Our algorithm has been developed for measuring oxygen saturation of the
   retina clinically. This was done for one subject only; further work can

Abstract = {{We have developed a snapshot optical imaging system capable of taking
   multiple images simultaneously and sending them to a CCD detector. Using
   an innovative lens array design, the beam obtained from the fundus
   camera is segmented into several different images passed through several
   different bandpass filters. Each bandpass filter defines a unique
   spectral region of imaging. The images are taken simultaneously into a
   large silicone chip with a dynamic range of 16 bits (highly sensitive)
   and are integrated with a single optical connection to a digital fundus
   camera.
   Our algorithm maps blood oxygen saturation of the retina using several
   wavelengths. These wavelengths are capable of approximating the whole
   hemoglobin spectrum and have been found from a previously developed
   hyperspectral algorithm. They include four isosbestic points (522, 548,
   569, and 586 nm) and three oxygen-sensitive points (542, 560, and 586
   nm) where the difference between fully oxygenated and deoxygenated blood
   is at a maximum. Using MatLab code, color maps of oxygen saturation are
   produced.
   The average value taken from all vein areas was 60.53\%, assuming that
   the artery oxygen saturation value is 98\%. Oxygen saturation of the
   tissue was 75.78\%. Oxygen saturations of the temporal/inferior/nasal
   veins ranged from 61.86\% to 63.37\%; the superior vein was
   significantly lower (54.19\%). Tissue oxygen saturations in different
   quadrants of the eye ranged from 74.17\% to 76.74\%.
   Our algorithm has been developed for measuring oxygen saturation of the
   retina clinically. This was done for one subject only; further work can
   extend the measurements to different pigments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the passive radar imaging system which exploits
   digital video broadcasting (DVB) satellites as opportunity illuminators.
   Firstly, we establish the imaging model and then analyze the imaging
   performance in the wavenumber domain. Because of the practical
   limitations, we are likely to get an undersampled wavenumber domain
   coverage so that traditional imaging methods such as matched filter (MF)
   would fail to provide good imaging performance. Therefore, we consider
   to use the sparse recovery techniques to achieve good inversion results.
   However, the compressive sensing (CS) imaging methods would be severely
   affected when off-grid scatterers exist. According to the theories of
   the Xampling and the finite rate of innovation (FRI), we propose a
   high-resolution sparse imaging method to overcome the problems above,
   which is based on the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm.
   Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the joint system of flat panels as parts of a
   freeform building. This topic is a key area of the ongoing founded
   research project, in which we investigate nonstandard shapes, realised
   with standard building materials, namely cross-laminated timber (CLT).
   We use different discretisation algorithms to overlay arbitrary freeform
   surfaces with ornaments consisting of polygonal flat panels. We
   investigate a series of ornaments and their discretisation results on
   different surfaces. In this paper, we will present and discuss a new
   timber-to-timber joint system that we developed exclusively for this
   project. We discuss the results of the load tests that we performed
   recently and we take a look at the construction dependent requirements
   of the joint system concerning the tolerances and the geometry and also,
   how these constraints inform the digital process. As we will discuss
   throughout the paper, in earlier publications we described the form
   finding process and the geometrical guidelines for the discretisation of
   a desired freeform building using ornamental flat patterns. This paper
   moves one step further as the digital becomes physical and it is closely
   related to building construction and the computational design outset.}},

Abstract = {{How can small architectural practices participate in contemporary
   architectural experimentation? One route is through engagement with
   complex, parametrically controlled geometries. However, the utilisation
   of such geometries by small practices is comparatively rare. We sought
   to explore the circumstances of such engagements with the hope of
   finding what can make them more feasible. To this end, we developed a
   purpose-specific methodology based on the simulation of an integrated
   design workflow. To develop and assess this simulation, we exposed a
   hypothetical project to multiple stakeholders including fabricators,
   engineers, architects, builders, clients, planning authorities and
   researchers. The outcomes suggest that the conceptual stance described
   as optioneering in application to large projects can also be productive
   at smaller scales.}},

   Rotated constellation is one of the main innovations in DVB-T2 system
   configuration and should improve performance infrequency selective
   channels. For the determination of differences between the techniques of
   non-rotated and rotated constellations, a Gaussian (reference) and 0 dB
   Echo channel models were used. Simulation results of the BER (Bit Error
   Ratio) before and after LDPC decoding for both types of constellations
   were obtained and compared. An application for analysis and simulation
   of different constellation techniques was developed in MATLAB. Finally,
   achieved results are evaluated and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Most social network users hold more than one social network account and
   utilize them in different ways depending on the digital context. For
   example, friendly chat on Facebook, professional discussion on LinkedIn,
   and health information exchange on PatientsLikeMe. Thus many web users
   need to manage many disparate profiles across many distributed online
   sources. Maintaining these profiles is cumbersome, time consuming,
   inefficient, and leads to lost opportunity. In this paper we propose a
   framework for multiple profile management of online social networks and
   showcase a demonstrator utilising an open source platform. The result of
   the research enables a user to create and manage an integrated profile
   and share/synchronise their profiles with their social networks. A
   number of use cases were created to capture the functional requirements
   and describe the interactions between users and the online services. An
   innovative application of this project is in public health informatics.
   We utilize the prototype to examine how the framework can benefit
   patients and physicians. The framework can greatly enhance health
   information management for patients and more importantly offer a more
   comprehensive personal health overview of patients to physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Today's net-generation college students were weaned on multimedia,
   regularly viewing, sharing and loading video with YouTube and other
   social networking sites. At University of Southern California (USC),
   students across curriculum are producing video for their assignments and
   class assignments. Faculty in diverse disciplines now assign projects
   requiring some manner of video feed. Not surprisingly, we're seeing
   universities across the nation considering video production and related
   skill sets as part of their undergraduate core curricula (Young, 2011).
   Today's growing digital environment, new education programs are merging
   traditional information and research skills with IT fluency, digital and
   multimedia literacies demanding more-and-more knowledge of emerging
   technologies. A successful literacy education requires collaborative
   efforts from stakeholders including librarians, information
   technologists, faculty members, and media specialists on campus. This
   paper will first define the scope of digital and other technical
   literacies and their collective impact upon current higher education.
   Based on our home example, we'll discuss how USC Librarians corroborate
   with other campus colleagues in developing a coordinated,
   discipline-oriented literacy program meeting the pedagogical goals of
   the new undergraduate curricula. Furthermore, we will also talk about
   how to empower a culture of learning and innovation among faculty and
   graduate students. Marshall McLuhan stated half-a-century ago, ``the
   medium is the message.{''} Digital literacy is becoming integral to
   higher education and contributes to students' success in
   technology-enriched environments.}},

Abstract = {{3D modeling of floating or semi-submerged objects is a challenging and
   attractive task for the marine industry especially if the manufacturing
   of components that have to be replaced or repaired after a damage is
   necessary or the ship itself has to be converted. Up to now the 3D
   reverse engineering of ships has required docking operations to carry
   out a geodetic or photogrammetric survey with high costs for shipowners.
   In this paper an innovative 3D acquisition method for digital recording
   of floating objects is presented. The method is based on digital
   photogrammetry both underwater and terrestrial. Preliminary tests are
   presented for the case study of a 19-foot motor boat. Two surveys of the
   boat in floating conditions are carried out and then joined by means of
   special rigid orientation devices built ad hoc.}},

Title = {{Making a Business Case for Intelligent Transport Systems: A Holistic
   Business Model Framework}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{781-804}},
Abstract = {{Intelligent transport systems (ITS) are technologies, applications and
   systems for accident warnings, reduction of driving workload, congestion
   avoidance and traffic management. The infrastructure also opens up
   opportunities for new digital services to users and for new ways of
   managing and maintaining transport infrastructure. Despite the
   significant potential benefits identified by previous research since the
   1980s, the market for ITS has so far failed to take off, and a robust
   business case for the full-scale development of ITS remains absent. This
   is important because the potential benefits of ITS can only be realized
   if the technologies and services are widely used. Today, many ITS are
   still too expensive to purchase and install, often requiring substantial
   upfront investment, but the returns could take many years to
   materialize. This paper will provide a systematic overview of previous
   research on ITS and propose a holistic business model framework to help
   make a business case. This is still a rapidly evolving area, and a new
   research agenda will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in
   e-Government seems to be changing into a new e-Government-as-a-whole
   concept which focuses on the provision of services at the front-end
   supported by integration, consolidation and innovation in the back-end
   processes and systems to achieve cost savings and improved service
   delivery. In Europe the adoption of the INSPIRE Directive emphasises
   geographic information (GI) and a well functioning spatial data
   infrastructure (SDI) as fundamental elements in e-Government. Due to the
   UN especially the Nordic approach to establishing digital
   infrastructures is an important conceptual way to efficient
   e-Government. In Denmark the development within the GI-community is
   characterised by an informal, bottom-up approach with little attention
   regarding organisational aspects. This paper will refer to a number of
   cases based on examples from the municipal of Rudersdal illustrating how
   the collaboration and innovation among different players within the
   GI-community actually is a determining factor for a successful
   development of spatial data infrastructures with the potential of
   enabling connected governance concepts.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years, Microsoft has driven innovation in the aerial
   photogrammetry community. Besides the market leading camera technology,
   UltraMap has grown to an outstanding photogrammetric workflow system
   which enables users to effectively work with large digital aerial image
   blocks in a highly automated way. Best example is the project-based
   color balancing approach which automatically balances images to a
   homogeneous block. UltraMap V3 continues innovation, and offers a
   revolution in terms of ortho processing. A fully automated dense
   matching module strives for high precision digital surface models (DSMs)
   which are calculated either on CPUs or on GPUs using a distributed
   processing framework. By applying constrained filtering algorithms, a
   digital terrain model can be derived which in turn can be used for fully
   automated traditional ortho texturing. By having the knowledge about the
   underlying geometry, seamlines can be generated automatically by
   applying cost functions in order to minimize visual disturbing
   artifacts. By exploiting the generated DSM information, a DSMOrtho is
   created using the balanced input images. Again, seamlines are detected
   automatically resulting in an automatically balanced ortho mosaic.
   Interactive block-based radiometric adjustments lead to a high quality
   ortho product based on UltraCam imagery. UltraMap v3 is the first fully
   integrated and interactive solution for supporting UltraCam images at
   best in order to deliver DSM and ortho imagery.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is reflecting a study on developing and reconstructing a 3D
   model from registering an aerial image on a point clouds or a DTM. The
   point clouds has been chosen as the main data for reconstructing a 3D
   model. For achieving the aspects of the study, all objects were
   individually detected and extracted from the point clouds and captured
   in a particular layer in a CAD environment. Then each object will be
   converted to a raster format and will be registered on the image. This
   process is called the reverse registration in this study. Since the
   object segmentation and detection from a digital image is a complex
   process, the reverse registration is implemented in order to assist the
   process of the object detection from the image. This paper will discuss
   two methods of object detection from point clouds for the reverse
   registration. These methods were proposed and implemented for this
   study. Also, the paper will discuss the reverse registration and how
   this method improves the process of the object detection and extraction
   from the image. Discussion of reconstructing a 3D model from registering
   the digital image on a DTM or DSM (both of which developed from the
   point clouds data) is another goal of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the application of Information Management Systems
   (IMS) for documenting and monitoring World Heritage (WH) properties. The
   application of IMS in WH can support all stakeholders involved in
   conservation, and management of cultural heritage by more easily
   inventorying, mining and exchanging information from multiple sources
   based on international standards. Moreover, IMS could assist in
   detecting damages and preparing management strategies to mitigate risks,
   and slowing down the deterioration of the integrity of WH properties.
   The case study of the Silk Roads Cultural Heritage Resource Information
   System (CHRIS), a Belgian Federal Science Policy Office funded project,
   illustrates the capabilities of IMS in the context of the nomination of
   the Central Asian Silk Roads on the WH List. This multi-lingual,
   web-based IMS will act as a collaborative platform allowing for the
   completion of improved transnational nomination dossiers and subsequent
   monitoring activities with all necessary baseline information to easily
   verify consistency and quality of the proposal. The Silk Roads CHRIS
   Geospatial Content Management System uses open source technologies and
   allows to georeference data from different scales and sources including
   data from field recording methods and combine it with historical and
   heritage features documented through various means such as textual
   descriptions, documents, photographs, 3D models or videos. Moreover,
   tailored maps can also be generated by overlaying a selection of
   available layers and then be exported to support the nomination dossier.
   Finally, by using this innovative information and decision support
   system, the State Parties and other interested stakeholders will have
   access to a complete nomination dossier and could therefore respond more
   effectively to hazards and disaster phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Tetrapods evolved from sarcopterygian fishes in the Devonian and were
   the first vertebrates to colonize land. The locomotor component of this
   transition can be divided into four major events: terrestriality, the
   origins of digited limbs, solid substrate-based locomotion, and
   alternating gaits that use pelvic appendages as major propulsors. As the
   sister group to tetrapods, lungfish are a morphologically and
   phylogenetically relevant sarcopterygian taxon for understanding the
   order in which these events occurred. We found that a species of African
   lungfish (Protopterus annectens) uses a range of pelvic fin-driven,
   tetrapod-like gaits, including walking and bounding, in an aquatic
   environment, despite having a derived limb endoskeleton and primitively
   small, muscularly supported pelvis. Surprisingly, given these
   morphological traits, P. annectens also lifts its body clear of the
   substrate using its pelvic fins, an ability thought to be a tetrapod
   innovation. Our findings suggest that some fundamental features of
   tetrapod locomotion, including pelvic limb gait patterns and substrate
   association, probably arose in sarcopterygians before the origin of
   digited limbs or terrestriality. It follows that the attribution of some
   of the nondigited Devonian fossil track-ways to limbed tetrapods may
   need to be revisited.}},

Title = {{Digital Subtraction Phonocardiography (DSP) applied to the detection and
   characterization of heart murmurs}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: During the cardiac cycle, the heart normally produces
   repeatable physiological sounds. However, under pathologic conditions,
   such as with heart valve stenosis or a ventricular septal defect, blood
   flow turbulence leads to the production of additional sounds, called
   murmurs. Murmurs are random in nature, while the underlying heart sounds
   are not (being deterministic). Innovation: We show that a new analytical
   technique, which we call Digital Subtraction Phonocardiography (DSP),
   can be used to separate the random murmur component of the
   phonocardiogram from the underlying deterministic heart sounds.
   Methods: We digitally recorded the phonocardiogram from the anterior
   chest wall in 60 infants and adults using a high-speed USB interface and
   the program Gold Wave http://www.goldwave.com. The recordings included
   individuals with cardiac structural disease as well as recordings from
   normal individuals and from individuals with innocent heart murmurs.
   Digital Subtraction Analysis of the signal was performed using a custom
   computer program called Murmurgram. In essence, this program subtracts
   the recorded sound from two adjacent cardiac cycles to produce a
   difference signal, herein called a ``murmurgram{''}. Other software used
   included Spectrogram (Version 16), GoldWave (Version 5.55) as well as
   custom MATLAB code.
   Results: Our preliminary data is presented as a series of eight cases.
   These cases show how advanced signal processing techniques can be used
   to separate heart sounds from murmurs. Note that these results are
   preliminary in that normal ranges for obtained test results have not yet
   been established.
   Conclusions: Cardiac murmurs can be separated from underlying
   deterministic heart sounds using DSP. DSP has the potential to become a
   reliable and economical new diagnostic approach to screening for
   structural heart disease. However, DSP must be further evaluated in a
   large series of patients with well-characterized pathology to determine
   its clinical potential.}},

Abstract = {{As a modern radar receiver must rapidly search a large frequency range
   with maximum sensitivity, capabilities such as high instantaneous
   dynamic range (IDR), good multiple-signal-detection capability, wider
   bandwidth (BW), and high-frequency resolution are indispensable. Many
   techniques proposed to improve digital wideband receiver performance are
   computationally intensive and limit their real-time performance due to
   hardware constraint. In this paper, an innovative three
   gigasample-per-second hybrid computing platform digital wideband
   receiver system is presented, which employs two Nvidia Tesla C2050
   graphics processor units and a Xilinx Virtex-5 field-programmable gate
   array for hardware acceleration to drastically improve receiver
   performance over its predecessor designs. The receiver detects five
   simultaneous signals in 1.25-GHz BW (125-1375 MHz) with a maximum IDR of
   42.5 dB and a frequency resolution of 0.5 MHz. The proposed receiver
   architecture achieves high-resolution spectral estimation and employs a
   hardware mechanism for multiple-signal detection before the next set of
   data arrives for processing.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we document observations of our own young children's
   usage of technology in their ``out-of-school{''} worlds. How might these
   technologies and practices be changing the understandings and usage of
   texts and literacies of the children who enter into classroom spaces?
   What transformative possibilities might these home technology practices
   announce for teaching and learning within classroom environments? In
   both Canadian and Australian curriculum documents, as well as in OECD
   reports, the need to develop innovative approaches to educational
   practices and the inclusion of digital technologies is acknowledged as
   necessary in facing 21st century challenges. We provide examples linking
   to media news stories in both countries, addressing the use of
   touch-screen technologies in schooling and examine how these
   presentations are very different from the practices we have observed in
   our homes, where the children have relative openness and freedoms with
   their device usage. Within the article we demonstrate, using media links
   and images, the ways in which our own children have begun to navigate
   digital devices and texts and to create new sorts of narratives that
   open possibilities for literacies in multiple ways, as ``creators{''},
   ``designers{''}, and experts. We argue that, once translated into
   classroom practice, technological tools tend to be ``domesticated{''} by
   practices that resist the transformative affordances of these tools, and
   may even provide barriers to student engagement and practice. Finally,
   we conclude the article by making some practical suggestions for
   creating opportunities for transformative technology use in education.}},

Abstract = {{New methods are emerging in the material characterisation field with the
   aim of exploiting innovative full-field strain measurement techniques.
   Besides experimental issues, also numerical procedures for inverse
   problems should adapt to a new philosophy: the large amount of data
   referred to local strains should be used in an appropriate way to obtain
   as much benefits as possible. In this context, an experimental and
   numerical procedure for the characterisation of hyperelastic materials
   is proposed. Planar tension tests have been performed on flat rubber
   specimens of different geometries. Strain maps obtained by means of a 2D
   Digital Image Correlation system are used to implement the virtual
   fields method, to estimate material dependent parameters of two of the
   most known hyperelastic constitutive laws: Ogden and 2nd order
   Mooney-Rivlin models. Numerical results and comparisons with
   experimental data are shown, analysing also aspects concerning
   implementation of the numerical procedures and computational efficiency
   of the algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design: A discectomy study on human cadaveric lumbar spine.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of
   manual versus powered discectomies using a transforaminal lumbar
   interbody fusion approach.
   Summary of Background Data: To achieve fusion, removal of nucleus tissue
   and endplate cartilage is essential for preparation of the interbody
   space. Quantitatively, it has been established that maximal structural
   graft or implant coverage of the endplates are of critical importance
   for fusion and subsidence prevention.
   Methods: Twenty levels underwent conventional manual discectomy (group
   1) and 20 underwent powered discectomy (group 2) by 3 attending spine
   surgeons and 2 spine fellows. Each discectomy procedure was analyzed for
   time and number of instrument passes. Postoperatively, each level was
   measured grossly and digitally for percentage of appropriate discectomy
   and endplate preparation. For analysis, the superior and inferior
   endplate surfaces were divided into ipsilateral and contralateral
   halves, and ventral and dorsal halves. Each quadrant was then analyzed
   separately.
   Results: A total of 40 discectomies on 9 fresh-frozen cadaver torsos
   between T12-L1 and L5-S1 were performed in this study. Within each
   quadrant, the discectomized area was greater in group 2 than in group 1.
   The largest difference was observed on the contralateral ventral
   quadrant, group 1 (38.2\%) and group 2 (52.4\%), respectively (P =
   0.012). Average procedure time was also significantly less in group 2
   versus group 1 (P = 0.009). Group 2 had an overall increased discectomy
   and appropriately prepared endplates (46.8\%) compared with group 1
   (36.3\%) (P = 0.025). Significantly fewer instrument passes were seen in
   group 2 versus group 1 (P < 0.001). Two iatrogenic endplate fractures
   were observed in group 1 and 1 in group 2.
   Conclusions: In addition to a significantly superior discectomy
   efficacy, the group 2 had significantly fewer instrument passes and
   shorter procedure times. In vivo studies are required to further
   evaluate the differences and cost benefit of this innovative tool.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, two popular topics of discussion within intellectual property
   law have been the statutory damage regime and the legality of
   peer-to-peer (P2P) downloading. This Note examines a rarely discussed
   interplay between these two concepts: the innocent infringement defense.
   Innocent infringement allows a court to dramatically reduce the minimum
   statutory damage award for an act of copyright infringement from \$750
   to \$200 per act. Both the Fifth and Seventh Circuits have found that
   402(d) of the Copyright Act eliminates innocent infringement as a matter
   of law in a P2P download setting.
   This Note examines those circuits' reasoning as well as the various
   responses from the legal academic community. It argues against those
   circuits' interpretation of the phrase ``access to published
   phonorecords,{''} found in 402(d), to mean a general availability and a
   duty to inquire as to the copyright status of the songs in question. By
   viewing 402(d) in this light, those courts have effectively eliminated
   the defense when applied to P2P downloading. This Note advocates for an
   actual inquiry into a defendant's state of mind to determine if they had
   ``reason to believe{''} their actions constituted infringement, which
   would preserve innocent infringement in a digital environment.}},

Abstract = {{Social commerce has taken the e-tailing world by storm.
   Business-to-consumer sites and, more important, intermediaries that
   facilitate shopping experience, continue to offer more and more
   innovative technologies to support social interaction among like-minded
   community members or friends who share the same shopping interests.
   Among these technologies, reviews, ratings, and recommendation systems
   have become some of the most popular social shopping platforms due to
   their ease of use and simplicity in sharing buying experience and
   aggregating evaluations. This paper studies the effect of electronic
   word of mouth (eWOM) communication among a closed community of book
   readers. We studied the entire market of Amazon Shorts e-books, which
   are digital microproducts sold at a low and uniform price. With the
   minimal role of price in the buying decision, social discussion via eWOM
   becomes a collective signal of reputation, and ultimately a significant
   demand driver. Our empirical study suggests that eWOM can be used to
   convey the reputation of the product (e.g., the book), the reputation of
   the brand (i.e., the author), and the reputation of complementary goods
   (e.g., books in the same category). Until newer social shopping
   technologies gain acceptance, eWOM technologies should be considered by
   both e-tailers and shoppers as the first and perhaps primary source of
   social buying experience.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a multidisciplinary research devoted to correlate
   estimation of the rock mass characteristics with parameters and features
   obtained by the use of digital photography. The data obtained from
   remote slope analysis are then undertaken to a statistical analysis of
   discrete data samples comparing different survey areas in terms of shape
   and dimension of the sampling window. The method is developed by an
   application to the North rock face of the Aiguilles Marbrees (Mont
   Blanc). This slope was chosen as case of study since it represents an
   important high mountain location from the environmental and touristic
   point of view, where the severe working condition led to the application
   of innovative methodology. This site is monitored by a local authority
   (Fondazione Montagna Sicura) devoted to the territory safe control since
   a rock fall of considerable size occurred in September 2007. After a
   photogrammetric survey, an orthophotograph has been created; circular
   windows have been materialized on the orthophotograph to perform area
   sampling. Statistical analysis of the obtained data enables us to
   calculate parameters and estimators for rock mass classification. (C)

Abstract = {{Although providing an invigorating foundation for instructional design
   and technology theory and research, the postmodern agenda would benefit
   from clearer articulation and further refinement of ontological,
   epistemological, and methodological positions. Consequently, we reveal
   possible weaknesses in the radically constructivist-inspired position
   and, in the spirit of scholarly dialogue, counter with a
   critical-realist perspective that presents a potentially more innovative
   and defensible approach to the discovery of scientific knowledge about
   teaching and learning infused with technology. Without doubt, we concur
   with postmodernists that issues of agency, identity, race, gender and
   ethnicity must be addressed and given a central position in
   instructional design and technology research and practice. Under the
   critical-realist designator, case study, ethnographic, arts-based, and
   phenomenological methodologies are appropriate and can co-exist. Our
   point of distinction is that as a scientific venture, instructional
   design and technology as a discipline must be more public and
   transparent in warrants, claims and discourse for proposed change to
   take place. We conclude by indicating future lines of inquiry inspired
   by the critical-realist perspective, detailing topics in technology
   integration and digital games.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations associated with information and communication technology
   (ICT) have opened up new opportunities for the global economy and
   ushered in the age of e-commerce. Our objective in this research is to
   explore the role of Internet-based selling technology, which acts as
   technology infrastructure for B2C e-commerce growth at the country
   level. This study proposes the use of a new hybrid growth theory
   approach as the theoretical basis for examining exogenous and endogenous
   factors that influence e-commerce growth over time. We estimate three
   different models to evaluate their explanatory capabilities. We
   investigate a panel-corrected feasible generalized least squares
   regression that incorporates the direct effects of country-level
   variables. We also specify an endogeneity-adjusted two-stage least
   squares model and estimate it with an embedded technology adoption
   function in a simultaneous equation model. This permits the analysis of
   the relevance of IT infrastructure, as well as reverse causality between
   e-commerce growth and Internet-based selling technology. We test these
   models using archival data for four different regions, based on either
   24 or 42 countries around the world, depending on the data requirements
   of the models. Our empirical tests evaluate quasi-production
   environmental inputs, in which technology determines the environment of
   production of e-commerce services. Our main finding is that both
   endogenous variables (e.g., Internet user penetration, capital invested
   in telecommunication) and exogenous variables (international openness)
   drive the GDP-normalized level of B2C e-commerce revenues over time. A
   second main finding is that it is useful to include an embedded
   technology adoption function in a modeling specification for growth,
   since growth is founded on the availability of relevant IT
   infrastructure that is made possible by the availability of venture
   capital. In addition, B2C e-commerce revenue growth and venture capital
   also contribute to the adoption of Internet-based selling technology. We
   discuss our overall approach for the interpretation of the strength of
   our main findings, as well as the policy implications, and why our
   hybrid growth theory approach is useful.}},

Abstract = {{Repurposive appropriation is a creative everyday act in which a user
   invents a novel use for information technology (IT) and adopts it. This
   study is the first to address its prevalence and predictability in the
   consumer IT context. In all, 2,379 respondents filled in an online
   questionnaire on creative uses of digital cameras, such as using them as
   scanners, periscopes, and storage media. The data reveal that such
   creative uses are adopted by about half of the users, on average, across
   different demographic backgrounds. Discovery of a creative use on one's
   own is slightly more common than is learning it from others. Most users
   discover the creative uses either completely on their own or wholly
   through learning from others. Our regression model explains 34\% of the
   variance in adoption of invented uses, with technology cognizance
   orientation, gender, exploration orientation, use frequency, and use
   tenure as the strongest predictors. These findings have implications for
   both design and marketing.}},

Abstract = {{Hearing instrument technology research is almost entirely focused on the
   projected needs of the consumer market in the developed world. However,
   two thirds of the world's population with hearing impairment live in
   developing countries and this proportion will increase in future, given
   present demographic trends. In developing regions, amplification and
   other hearing health needs may differ from those in industrialized
   nations, for cultural, health, or economic reasons. World Health
   Organization estimates indicate that at present only a small percentage
   of individuals in developing countries who are in need of amplification
   have access to hearing aid provision. New technologies, such as
   trainable hearing aids, advanced noise reduction algorithms, feedback
   reduction circuitry, nano coatings for hearing aid components, and
   innovative power options, may offer considerable potential benefits,
   both for individuals with hearing impairment in developing countries and
   for those who provide hearing health care services in these regions.
   This article considers the possible supporting role of innovative
   hearing instrument technologies in the provision of affordable hearing
   health care services in developing countries and highlights the need for
   research that considers the requirements of the majority of the world
   population in need of hearing instrument provision.}},

Abstract = {{This conceptual article discusses strategies of corporations in the
   information and communication technologies (ICT) sector and their role
   in the conflict over access to knowledge in the digital environment. Its
   main hypothesis is that ICT corporations are very capable actors when it
   comes to bridging digital divides in both developed and developing
   countries-maybe even the most capable actors. Therefore, it is argued
   that ICT corporations could use their capabilities to help citizens gain
   sustainable access to knowledge in order to enable them to lead
   self-sufficient lives. In a nutshell, capabilities are presented as both
   the input (capabilities of ICT corporations) as well as the output
   (capability building for empowering citizens) of corporate
   strategy-making focusing on fair ICT. Corporate citizenship is put forth
   as the theoretical concept bridging corporate strategies and access to
   knowledge: If ICT corporations act in accordance with their
   self-understanding of being `good corporate citizens', they could be
   crucial partners in lessening digital divides and helping citizens gain
   access to knowledge. From the perspective of `integrative economic
   ethics' (Ulrich 2008), it is argued that ICT corporations have good
   reason to actively empower citizens in both developed and developing
   countries by pursuing `inclusive' strategies in many fields, such as
   open-source software development. That way, ICT corporations could
   enable, support and provide citizens with capabilities enabling them to
   help themselves. In order to make inclusive business models work, the
   rules and regulations companies find themselves in today must enable
   them to act responsibly without getting penalized by more ruthless
   competitors. This article explores several cases from the ICT field to
   illustrate the interplay between a responsible business model and the
   rules and regulations of the industry. From a capabilities perspective,
   the most desirable mix of corporate strategies and industry regulation
   is one that results in the highest level of generativity (Zittrain
   2008). Thus, ICT should not be closed systems only driven by the company
   behind them. Instead, they need to be open for the highest possible
   level of third-party innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Today there are significant challenges to public health,
   and effective responses to them will require complex approaches and
   strategies implemented by a qualified workforce. An adequately prepared
   workforce requires long-term development; however, local health
   departments have limited financial and staff resources. Schools and
   programs accredited by the Council for Education on Public Health (
   CEPH) are required to provide continuing education but are constrained
   by the lack of resources, limited time, and geography.
   Method: To meet these challenges, a statewide university/community
   collaborative model for delivering continuing education programs was
   developed. A needs assessment of California's public health workforce
   was conducted to identify areas of interest, and two continuing
   education trainings were developed and implemented using innovative
   distance education technology.
   Results: Thirty-six percent of the participants completed electronic
   evaluations of learning outcomes and use of the digital technology
   platform. Participants indicated a significant increase in knowledge,
   reported that the trainings were cost effective and convenient, and said
   that they would participate in future online trainings. Collaborative
   partners found that this model provides a cost-effective,
   environmentally sound, and institutionally sustainable method for
   providing continuing education to public health professionals.
   Discussion: Offering continuing education via distance technology
   requires substantial institutional infrastructure and resources that are
   often beyond what many public institutions can provide alone. This
   project provides a model for collaborating with community partners to
   provide trainings, using a digital technology platform that requires
   minimal training and allows presenters and participants to log on from
   anywhere there is Internet access.}},

Abstract = {{This article sets the context for this special themed issue on the
   `Korean digital wave' by considering the symbiotic relationship between
   digital technologies, their techniques and practices, their uses and the
   affordances they provide, and Korea's `compressed modernity' and swift
   industrialisation. It underscores the importance of interrogating a
   range of groundbreaking developments and innovations within Korea's
   digital mediascapes, and its creative and cultural industries, in order
   to gain a complex understanding of one of Australia's most significant
   export markets and trading partners. Given the financial and political
   commitment in Australia to a high-speed broadband network that aims to
   stimulate economic and cultural activity, recent technological
   developments in Korea, and the double-edged role played by government
   policy in shaping the `Korean digital wave', merit close attention from
   media and communications scholars.}},

Abstract = {{Analogue and digital circuits are both prone to failure because of
   device degradations, transient upsets and large parametric variations.
   Redundancy techniques, such as N-tuple modular redundancy, have been
   widely used to correct faulty behaviour of components and achieve high
   reliability for digital circuits. In this study, the authors propose a
   redundancy based fault-tolerant methodology for analogue circuits. In
   particular, the authors focus on highly reliable analogue-to-digital
   converter, which is a critical component in many mixed-signal systems.
   The authors methodology employs redundant analogue blocks and chooses
   the best result using an innovative analogue voter. Simulation results
   are reported to verify the concepts, measure the system's reliability
   and trade off reliability against cost and power.}},

Abstract = {{Attention and expectations given to born-global small and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs) and export-oriented SMEs internationalizing step by
   step has been persistently increasing. In spite of the limited
   resources, increasing numbers of such export-oriented SMEs have
   successfully entered into global markets and then considerably improved
   their performances. Nevertheless, there are only a few empirical studies
   regarding determinants related to characteristics and
   internationalization of such firms. Based on a survey of 317 born-global
   SMEs, this study used characteristics of organizations, environments,
   and technologies as determinants affecting their international outcomes.
   It also devised 24 hypotheses concerning these determinants, the
   outcomes of internationalization, and partnership building between
   third-party logistics (3PL) providers having logistical competencies and
   export-oriented SMEs and then schematized a study model based on them.
   From the testing of the above hypotheses, it was found that among the
   organizational characteristics of export-oriented SMEs, only
   innovation-oriented culture and export-related information management
   have exerted positive (+) influences significant to the outcome of
   internationalization. All subordinate determinants of the environmental
   characteristics such as overseas environment, local environment, export
   support policy, and export financing support appeared to exert positive
   (+) influences significant to the outcomes, though only the level of IT
   utilization and standardization among the technological characteristics
   showed positive (+) influences significant to the outcomes. In addition,
   the study tested whether partnership building with logistics outsourcing
   providers having digital logistical competencies would control the
   relationships between determinants of internationalization and their
   outcomes. The results showed that only the following could modulate the
   relationships between determinants of internationalization and their
   outcomes: an interaction term among innovation-oriented culture,
   research and development competency, and logistics network competency;
   an interaction term among local environment, export policy support,
   export financing support, and logistics network competency; and an
   interaction term among technological competency, level of IT
   utilization, and logistics network competency The above result indicated
   that the building of successful partnerships with 3PL providers having
   digital logistical competencies are important to successfully
   internationalize and to improve the performance of export-oriented SMEs.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical/methodological issue. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer
   in men. The diagnosis is based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA),
   digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)
   guided biopsy. These techniques have considerable limitations, which
   result in unnecessary biopsies. Furthermore the biopsies are associated
   with morbidity and costs.
   Standard radiological methods. Standard gray-scale ultrasound has a low
   sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection.
   Methodological innovations. New ultrasound technologies, including
   color-and power Doppler ultrasound, contrast enhanced US and real-time
   sonoelastography have shown to improve prostate cancer diagnosis.
   Performance. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound has shown a sensitivity of
   100\% (95\% CI, 95\%), a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.8\% and a
   positive predictive value (PPV) of 88.8\% for prostate cancer detection.
   Real-time sonoelastography has shown a sensitivity of 86\%, a
   specificity of 81\% and NPV of 91\% for prostate cancer diagnosis.
   Achievements. Most studies show that these new ultrasound modalities
   demonstrate a 1.5 to 2.5 times higher detection of prostate cancer per
   biopsy specimen compared with systematic biopsy. Multicenter studies
   results are at present lacking but are, however ongoing.
   Practical recommendations. In patients with suspected prostate cancer
   (elevated PSA, suspicious DRE) these new ultrasound techniques should be
   used. These techniques can detect prostate cancer and allow a targeted
   biopsy approach.}},

Abstract = {{The arrival of new media technologies has the potential to affect
   education radically. Understanding of the behavioral and intentional
   reactions of students toward such innovations has become a new issue for
   academics and educators. The present study develops a Chinese-version
   Media Literacy Self-assessment Scale (MLSS), including the subscales of
   media application skills, learning with media, and attitudes toward
   media, to assess media literacy in early adolescents. More than 1,500
   fifth and sixth graders in Taiwan responded to the scale. The results
   reveal that the MLSS had adequate validity and reliability in assessing
   elementary school students' perceptions of media literacy in digital
   learning environments. In addition, the findings of this study reveal
   the existence of gender differences on the subscales and the real affect
   of library instruction and Internet experience on the media literacy of
   students. Finally, it advances suggestions for future research.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a CMOS phase to digital transducer for optical
   incremental sensors is newly proposed. The proposed chip can easily
   produce phase shifts of signals by using a resistor chain. A set of
   calibration circuits for optical incremental sensors is also designed in
   the proposed chip. Another innovation is that the outputs of the
   proposed chip are directly digitized; they could be easily sent over a
   wide range of transmission media, such as PSN, radio, optical, IR,
   ultrasonic, etc. Besides, it does not also need a ROM component or a
   fast counter as used in the structures of ADC-based and PLL-based
   interpolations. Based upon the device parameters of 0.5 mu m 2P2M CMOS
   technology with 5 V power supply, all the functions and performance of
   the proposed CMOS phase to digital transducer for optical incremental
   sensors are successfully tested and proven through measurements. The
   area of the proposed chip including ESD I/O pads is 2010 x 1502 mu m(2).
   The interpolation factor is 5, 10, and 40. The proposed chip is suitable
   for optical incremental sensors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Animal studies have shown that life span is extended by caloric
   restriction (CR). This manuscript describes the design and methodology
   of an innovative CR intervention, which is the treatment arm of the
   CALERIE Study. This study is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial
   examining the effects of 2 years of CR on biomarkers of longevity among
   non-obese (BMI >= 22 kg/m(2) and < 28 kg/m(2)) adults. CALERIE is the
   first investigation of the effects of long-term CR on the aging process
   in non-obese humans. 220 healthy volunteers across 3 sites were
   recruited beginning in May 2007. Participants were randomized in a 2:1
   ratio between the CR or control group (i.e., ad libitum diet). An
   intensive intervention was designed to assist participants in adhering
   to the 25\% CR prescription for a two-year duration. The intervention
   was designed to optimize the likelihood that 25\% CR would be achieved
   through a variety of nutritional and behavioral strategies, several of
   which are innovative methods for achieving CR. The intervention includes
   the following components: an intensive, ``mixed{''} format schedule of
   group/individual sessions, meal provision phase with exposure to various
   diets, Personal Digital Assistants to monitor caloric intake, unique
   portion estimation training, tailored treatment using a computer
   tracking system, toolbox strategies and algorithms, as well as
   comprehensive coverage of nutrition and behavioral topics in order to
   assist participants in meeting their CR goal. This manuscript provides
   an overview of the CR intensive intervention and may be of assistance
   for other researchers and clinicians in designing future trials. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper is aimed to investigate the operating characteristics of a
   static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) integrated with superconducting
   magnetic energy storage (SMES) for high power applications in the
   transmission network level. The STATCOM controller topology comprises
   multi-level multi-pulse neutral-point clamped-type (NPC) voltage source
   inverters (VSIs) using the harmonics cancellation technique, and
   incorporates a SMES coil. An innovative two-quadrant multi-level dc-dc
   converter is proposed to effectively interface the STATCOM with the
   superconducting coil using a buck-boost topology with neutral point
   voltage control capabilities; thus enabling to simultaneously control
   both active and reactive power exchange with the high voltage power
   system. A detailed analysis of major system variables is presented,
   including analytical results and digital simulations using the
   MATLAB/Simulink environment. Moreover, a three-level control scheme is
   designed, including a full decoupled current control strategy in the d-q
   reference frame with a novel controller to prevent the STATCOM dc bus
   capacitors voltage drift/imbalance and an enhanced power system
   frequency controller. (C) 2011 The Franklin Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{Programmable logic devices (PLDs) are used at many universities in
   introductory digital logic laboratories, where kits containing a single
   high-capacity PLD replace ``standard{''} sets containing breadboards,
   wires, and small-or medium-scale integration (SSI/MSI) chips. From the
   pedagogical point of view, two problems arise in these laboratories.
   First, students have some difficulties in understanding the link between
   discrete and programmable design techniques. Second, using only a single
   PLD, students are not automatically forced to learn modular design
   skills, which is one of the required learning outcomes in electrical
   engineering (EE) curricula. To overcome these problems, an innovative
   laboratory is proposed in this paper. Each training board contains four
   complex PLDs (CPLDs) and peripherals. In the initial sessions, students
   implement designs in which CPLDs are programmed as standard SSI/MSI
   chips and interconnected to construct the target circuit. Then, an
   active learning technique is used: Students form groups of any size and
   can set themselves more complex problems and choose their design
   approach. The proposed laboratory was set up at the Technical University
   of Lodz, Lodz, Poland, and the first classes were given in the 2008-2009
   academic year. The instructors' insights and design reports and feedback
   from students were gathered and analyzed. The results showed the
   effectiveness of the novel approach. Students were deeply involved in
   solving self-imposed problems. They learned ``engineering
   imagination,{''} modular design, and teamwork skills. Some groups went
   far beyond the requirements set by the instructor. However, an
   additional conclusion is that the ``standard{''} approach should not be
   completely eliminated.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the question of the constitution of markets in
   advanced societies. Specifically, the article studies the role of the
   traveling trade show in creating the real time computing market, which
   is part of the US electronics sector, during the mid-1990's. Real time
   computing products assist the transfer, storage and processing of
   digital signals in real time and support many of the internet
   applications we use today. By applying ethnographic methods, we explore
   the general question of how economic actors cope with uncertainty in the
   phase of market-making and at the cutting edge of technology. The paper
   makes two contributions to the existing literature. First, it shows that
   the attempt to organize a trade show in real time computing was
   triggered by the uncertainty experienced by sellers regarding the
   identity of prospective buyers and about the exact use to which they
   would put the emergent technology which is offered for sale. Secondly,
   we trace the history of an emergent market. We claim that trade shows
   for innovative products are important venues at which markets coalesce.
   The identification and ordering of market actors, the
   institutionalization of a distinct business culture and the social
   networks developed among market actors and across the subsidiary markets
   provided the basic social infrastructure for what later became known as
   the real time computing industry.}},

Abstract = {{The first two generations of TV broadcasting are almost history, at
   least from the standardization perspective. Analog and digital satellite
   distributions both have addressed mass markets. The next-generation TV
   systems are close to primetime deployments: HDTV, 3DTV, interactive
   services, hybrid services, and additional innovations will dominate the
   next-generation TV. With the efficiency andmaturity of DVB-S2, satellite
   distribution is a cost-efficient and well-established broadcast
   technology with significant potential for extensions. In this paper, the
   future perspectives of digital TV and HDTV broadcasting will be first
   explored, considering ongoing and future standardization activities that
   will be carried out. Particular attention to innovative solutions based
   on adaptive modulation and coding, source and channel coding, and error
   resilience techniques for satellite TV transmission is paid. In addition
   to broadcast TV, also the perspectives of hybrid and IPTV will be
   considered in a satellite scenario with their pros and cons, trying to
   understand if satellite IPTV will be in competition with
   ``conventional{''} broadcast satellite TV services (like it already
   happens in terrestrial scenarios).}},

Abstract = {{Objective To demonstrate the clinical use of digital tomosynthesis in
   the depiction of labral and chondral pathology in the setting of
   post-operative CAM-type impingement of the hip following intra-articular
   administration of dilute iodinated contrast.
   Materials and Methods We present images from a 46 year-old African
   American female with suspected CAM-type femoroacetabular impingement
   (FAI) following percutaneous pinning of the right hip for slipped
   capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE).
   Results A partial tear of the labrum and clinically significant
   acetabular chondral abnormalities were demonstrated with the use of
   digital tomosynthesis with superb anatomic detail.
   Conclusion Digital tomosynthesis can be of great clinical utility and
   can depict pathology in superb anatomic detail, particularly in
   situations in which MRI is not available as well as under circumstances
   in which artifact due to orthopedic hardware is of concern as shown in
   this case.}},

Abstract = {{A microfluidic system is presented to generate multiple daughter
   droplets from a mother droplet, by the multistep hydrodynamic division
   of the mother droplet at multiple branch points in a microchannel. A
   microchannel network designed based on the resistive circuit model
   enables us to control the distribution ratio of the flow rate, which
   dominates the division ratios of the mother droplets. We successfully
   generated up to 15 daughter droplets from a mother droplet with a
   variation in diameter of less than 2\%. In addition, we examined factors
   affecting the division ratio, including the average fluid velocity,
   interfacial tension, fluid viscosity, and the distribution ratio of
   volumetric flow rates at a branch point. Additionally, we actively
   controlled the volume of the mother droplets and examined its influence
   on the size of the daughter droplets, demonstrating that the size of the
   daughter droplets was not significantly influenced by the volume of the
   mother droplet when the distribution ratio was properly controlled. The
   presented system for controlling droplet division would be available as
   an innovative means for preparing monodisperse emulsions from
   polydisperse emulsions, as well as a technique for making a microfluidic
   dispenser for digital microfluidics to analyze the droplet compositions.}},

Abstract = {{Employing the definition of ``adopter types{''} as the continuum of
   adoption rate, this study attempts to examine the factors influencing
   young people's mobile TV adoption behaviors ranging from non- and
   discontinuous to actual adoption. Demographic and innovative attributes
   were found to have a non-significant influence on the adoption
   likelihood. The findings also revealed that information needs and
   newspaper reading were negatively associated with mobile TV adoption,
   while entertainment needs were found to be a significant positive
   predictor of the adoption likelihood. The results imply that young
   adults tend to adopt and use mobile TV for entertainment purpose, rather
   than for informational purpose. Additionally, the results showed that
   perceived value predicted the adoption. On the other hand, perceived
   price as an available resource did not have an impact on the adoption.
   Inconsistent with the prior findings of people's mobile TV adoption and
   use as both positive information and entertainment sources, the findings
   suggest that young adults are likely to adopt and use mobile TV for
   entertainment and portability. When considering the capabilities of the
   technology, the findings imply young adults' perceptual and behavioral
   tendency toward the different use of the technology in the convergent
   media environment in which they have grown up. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{More and more, a user-centered approach is adopted for information and
   communication technologies (ICT) innovation research. One of the
   recently emerging concepts within this research tradition is the
   so-called `Living Lab'. Within this paper, we argue that the Living
   Lab-concept is closely linked to the notion of `open innovation', the
   `interactionist' stance regarding user research and concepts from the
   social shaping of technology such as `social learning' and `innofusion'.
   We explore the origin and roots of this concept, explain the different
   visions and review a bottom-up approach of Living Lab-characteristics.
   We then present a concrete application of Living Lab-research into the
   possibilities of mobile TV, a notable example of ICT-innovations that
   incorporates the convergence of mobile telephones and television. This
   research was carried out within Flanders' mobile TV trial `MADUF' and
   echoes a long tradition of interactive and digital TV trials. We
   describe the different research steps and the most notable results they
   yielded, and relate these to the characteristics of the Living
   Lab-concept in the first part of the paper. We also propose an analysis
   of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of Living
   Lab-research based on this case study. This way, we contend that a
   Living Lab-approach might serve as a way to meet the challenges posed to
   companies when developing ICT-innovations in general and seems suited
   for innovation research into television technologies in particular, but
   that certain issues remain to be tackled in order to optimize this kind
   of research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle expresses prion protein (PrP) that buffers oxidant
   activity in neurons. Aims: We hypothesize that PrP deficiency would
   increase oxidant activity in skeletal muscle and alter redox-sensitive
   functions, including contraction and glucose uptake. We used real-time
   polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis to measure PrP mRNA
   and protein in human diaphragm, five murine muscles, and muscle-derived
   C2C12 cells. Effects of PrP deficiency were tested by comparing
   PrP-deficient mice versus wild-type mice and morpholino-knockdown versus
   vehicle-treated myotubes. Oxidant activity (dichlorofluorescin
   oxidation) and specific force were measured in murine diaphragm fiber
   bundles. Results: PrP content differs among mouse muscles (gastrocnemius
   > extensor digitorum longus, EDL > tibialis anterior, TA; soleus >
   diaphragm) as does glycosylation (di-, mono-, nonglycosylated;
   gastrocnemius, EDL, TA = 60\%, 30\%, 10\%; soleus, 30\%, 40\%, 30\%;
   diaphragm, 30\%, 30\%, 40\%). PrP is predominantly di- glycosylated in
   human diaphragm. PrP deficiency decreases body weight (15\%) and EDL
   mass (9\%); increases cytosolic oxidant activity (fiber bundles, 36\%;
   C2C12 myotubes, 7\%); and depresses specific force (12\%) in adult (8-12
   mos) but not adolescent (2 mos) mice. Innovation: This study is the
   first to directly assess a role of prion protein in skeletal muscle
   function. Conclusions: PrP content varies among murine skeletal muscles
   and is essential for maintaining normal redox homeostasis, muscle size,
   and contractile function in adult animals. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 15,

Abstract = {{This paper investigated Taiwan-based digital content companies'
   operation in China and examined their international entrepreneurial
   strategies. Based on the classification of Schuler and Jackson's (1987)
   business strategies and the theory of the `life cycle model', this study
   selected two Taiwan-based digital content companies (Wang Film and
   Somode) that represented off-line and web-based firms to look at
   different evolution of these two types of firms. The research found that
   off-line digital content firms tended to adopt cost-reduction strategies
   in their initial stages and innovation strategies in subsequent stages.
   By contrast, web-based digital content companies mainly adopted
   innovation and quality-enhancement strategies rather than cost-reduction
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Chronic allograft injury, the primary cause of late
   allograft failure in renal transplantation, can be diagnosed early at a
   preclinical stage by histopathological changes such as interstitial
   fibrosis (IF). Currently, assessed by semiquantitative analysis in the
   Banff classification, IF quantification is limited by pathologist's
   subjective interpretation.
   Methods. We have designed algorithms dedicated to quantify IF by
   computerized color image analysis. This innovative and objective
   software automatically extracts the green areas characteristic of IF in
   Masson's trichrome based on color image segmentation followed by removal
   of nonspecific IF staining (capsula, sclerosis glomeruli and normal
   glomeruli, normal basement membrane) and computes an index. It also
   counts automatically the number of glomeruli. Sixty-seven Masson stained
   renal transplant biopsies at various IF stages were imaged using a
   digital color camera mounted on a microscope. We tested the robustness
   of the method against varying acquisition parameters.
   Results. We demonstrated that the parameters do not have an impact on
   this quantification and that the algorithm is able to handle biopsy
   color variations. The intra- and interobserver reproducibility was good
   (P < 0.003). The kappa coefficient that was performed on another set of
   90 biopsies to evaluate the concordance of our method with an expert
   Banff quantification was 0.68, indicating a substantial agreement.
   Finally, the computerized IF correlated with renal function.
   Conclusion. This study demonstrates that computerized color image
   analysis is a reliable and reproducible method to evaluate renal IF in
   routine practice and in multi-centric studies.}},

   differentiation i.e. the estimation of partial derivatives of
   multidimensional noisy signals. Starting from a local model of the
   signal consisting of a truncated Taylor expansion, we express, through
   adequate differential algebraic manipulations, the desired partial
   derivative as a function of iterated integrals of the noisy signal.
   Iterated integrals provide noise filtering. The presented method leads
   to a family of estimators for each partial derivative of any order. We
   present a detailed study of some structural properties given in terms of
   recurrence relations between elements of a same family. These properties
   are next used to study the performance of the estimators. We show that
   some differential algebraic manipulations corresponding to a particular
   family of estimators lead implicitly to an orthogonal projection of the
   desired derivative in a Jacobi polynomial basis functions, yielding an
   interpretation in terms of the popular least squares. This
   interpretation allows one to (1) explain the presence of a spatial delay
   inherent to the estimators and (2) derive an explicit formula for the
   delay. We also show how one can devise, by a proper combination of
   different elementary estimators of a given order derivative, an
   estimator giving a delay of any prescribed value. The simulation results
   show that delay-free estimators are sensitive to noise. Robustness with
   respect to noise can be highly increased by utilizing voluntary-delayed
   estimators. A numerical implementation scheme is given in the form of
   finite impulse response digital filters. The effectiveness of our
   derivative estimators is attested by several numerical simulations. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of the effect of the sampling rate on
   the calculation by a digital flickermeter of the flicker severity caused
   by phase jumps. The new edition of the IEC 61000-4-15 standard includes
   an innovative test aimed at verifying that a flickermeter works properly
   during a phase jump event. Since phase jumps are rapid angle changes, it
   seems that a high sampling rate should be used by a digital instrument.
   This requirement could be too demanding, so we have studied this
   hypothesis by defining three analytical signal models. One is based on
   the characterization of ideal phase jump sequences and the other two are
   based on the definition of realistic band-limited signals containing
   phase jumps. We found that the minimum sampling rate necessary to pass
   that test is not as demanding as expected. Practical experiments made by
   an actual generation and acquisition system confirm this conclusion. A
   typical sampling rate of 3200 S/s, usually used in commercial
   flickermeters, becomes clearly sufficient to pass the test. However, we
   give notice that passing this test could not guarantee accurate results
   when the phase jumps are different from those specified by the standard.}},

Abstract = {{Seed oils have been used for centuries by rural communities as food,
   medicine, for cosmetic applications and as fuel. Recently there has been
   a renewed interest in these non-timber forest products (NTFPs)
   specifically for use in cosmetic formulations. The cosmetic industry
   remains under immense consumer pressure to produce innovative products
   for this lucrative industry. Like the pharmaceutical industry, the
   wellness industry turns to nature for guidance, inspiration and as a
   source of novel compounds to produce new consumer products. Furthermore,
   discerning consumers of cosmetic products are nowadays informing
   themselves of the validity of scientific claims made on various
   products. The seed oils extracted from several plant species are
   popularly included as ingredients in cosmetic products due to their high
   fatty acid composition. The information on African seed oils is
   scattered in literature and often published in obscure and dated
   manuscripts. With an emphasis on (but not restricted to) cosmetic
   applications the botanical aspects, uses, physico-chemical properties
   and oil composition as well as biological activity of six commercially
   important species are coherently united and reviewed in this paper and
   include; Adansonia digitata (baobab), Citrullus lanatus (Kalahari
   melon), Schinziophyton rautanenii (manketti/mungongo), Sclerocarya
   birrea (manila), Trichilia emetica (mafura butter) and Ximenia americana

Abstract = {{We introduce Xampling, a unified framework for signal acquisition and
   processing of signals in a union of subspaces. The main functions of
   this framework are two: Analog compression that narrows down the input
   bandwidth prior to sampling with commercial devices followed by a
   nonlinear algorithm that detects the input subspace prior to
   conventional signal processing. A representative union model of
   spectrally sparse signals serves as a test-case to study these Xampling
   functions. We adopt three metrics for the choice of analog compression:
   robustness to model mismatch, required hardware accuracy, and software
   complexities. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between two
   sub-Nyquist acquisition strategies for spectrally sparse signals, the
   random demodulator and the modulated wideband converter (MWC), in terms
   of these metrics and draw operative conclusions regarding the choice of
   analog compression. We then address lowrate signal processing and
   develop an algorithm for that purpose that enables convenient signal
   processing at sub-Nyquist rates from samples obtained by the MWC. We
   conclude by showing that a variety of other sampling approaches for
   different union classes fit nicely into our framework.}},

Abstract = {{Improvements in construction engineering education result when

   applications of internet-based, audio and video technologies currently
   being piloted at Iowa State University (ISU) and at the University of
   Calgary (UC) for the purpose of bringing live construction projects into
   the university classroom. Virtual Project Tours have been piloted at
   Iowa State University in which real-time video and audio are delivered
   from active construction projects to a remote classroom through the
   internet. The second application discussed in this paper, Virtual
   Supervision, is being piloted at the University of Calgary and consists
   of the monitoring and analysis of construction projects by using imagery
   gathered by web-enabled, digital cameras of fixed location transmitting
   video through the internet. This paper also presents a vision of a
   globally networked organization of engineering and construction
   education institutions each sharing the unique engineering and building
   techniques of their respective part of the globe with design and
   construction students located around the world. This exchange of
   construction project observations among the institutions will be enabled
   by the internet-based applications of virtual project tours and virtual
   supervision systems described in this paper. DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper explores the performance of Chinese small and medium sized
   enterprises (SMEs) on Business-to-Business (B2B) electronic marketplaces
   (EMs). Based on a content analysis of 155 cases of high performing
   online Chinese vendors, this paper explains the success of SME online
   B2B vendors within a Motivation-Capability framework. This first
   generation of SME B2B online vendors proved highly motivated to increase
   sales and developed a set of Internet leveraged organizational
   capabilities to compete online, including capabilities for online
   marketing, product innovation, eCommerce management, etc. This study
   differs from traditional wisdom that online marketplaces will render
   Guanxi (a Chinese cultural phenomenon defined as close and pervasive
   interpersonal relationships, Yang, 1994) irrelevant since online
   marketplaces are perceived to be impersonal. In fact, Guanxi still
   matters online, but it takes new forms. This research offers important
   managerial implications for B2B SME online vendors on how to leverage
   EMs for higher performance.}},

Abstract = {{Optical OFDM was proposed for dispersion compensation in long-haul
   optical communications systems in 2006 in two forms, one using
   direct-detection and the other using coherent detection. Since then
   there has been extensive innovation towards developing intermediate
   forms of optical OFDM that are more suited to specific applications.
   This review paper presents our view on the developments in optical OFDM
   for long-haul optical transmission applications. It covers the basic
   elements of radio OFDM before concentrating on direct detection optical
   OFDM and its development, followed by coherent optical OFDM. All-optical
   OFDM is then considered, together with optical methods of generating and
   separating the OFDM subcarriers. The paper then discusses the critical
   issue of nonlinear degradation due to the Kerr effect in optical fibers
   and reviews recent innovations to mitigate the effects of fiber
   nonlinearity. Finally some future research directions are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have served as the basis for signal
   development in a variety of biosensing technologies and in applications
   using bioprobes. The use of QDs as physical platforms to develop
   biosensors and bioprobes has attracted considerable interest. This is
   largely due to the unique optical properties of QDs that make them
   excellent choices as donors in fluorescence resonance energy transfer
   (FRET) and well suited for optical multiplexing. The large majority of
   QD-based bioprobe and biosensing technologies that have been described
   operate in bulk solution environments, where selective binding events at
   the surface of QDs are often associated with relatively long periods to
   reach a steady-state signal. An alternative approach to the design of
   biosensor architectures may be provided by a microfluidic system (MFS).
   A MFS is able to integrate chemical and biological processes into a
   single platform and allows for manipulation of flow conditions to
   achieve, by sample transport and mixing, reaction rates that are not
   entirely diffusion controlled. Integrating assays in a MFS provides
   numerous additional advantages, which include the use of very small
   amounts of reagents and samples, possible sample processing before
   detection, ultra-high sensitivity, high throughput, short analysis time,
   and in situ monitoring. Herein, a comprehensive review is provided that
   addresses the key concepts and applications of QD-based microfluidic
   biosensors with an added emphasis on how this combination of
   technologies provides for innovations in bioassay designs. Examples from
   the literature are used to highlight the many advantages of biosensing
   in a MFS and illustrate the versatility that such a platform offers in
   the design strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Companies organize teams to enhance creativity and innovation.
   Creativity refers to the generation of new and novel ideas, whereas
   innovation encompasses both idea generation and the commercialization of
   these ideas to add value to the enterprises. Standard teams are those,
   wherein participants meet face-to-face to develop new ideas and/or to
   commercialize them. Asynchronous virtual teams are those which allow
   participants to interact via digital means without face-to-face
   meetings. Asynchronous virtual teams are especially convenient for
   participants at global locations.
   The objective of this paper is to outline a third kind of teams, the
   virtual teams with anonymity and structured interactions (VTASIs), in
   which participants remain anonymous, follow a modified Delphi
   brainstorming process, communicate with one another asynchronously via
   electronic means, apply a set of streamlined idea generation strategies
   (the Combinatorial Heuristic and Normatively Generic Method), and
   conduct multiple rounds of structured interactions under the guidance of
   a knowledgeable team leader. Individual team member works alone, yet
   interacts indirectly with all others in a group setting.
   After having briefly reviewed the factors that are known to constraint
   the performance of both the standard and asynchronous virtual teams,
   this paper describes a study conducted in Spring 2009 Semester at
   University at Buffalo, involving eight VTASI teams of a total of 72
   graduate engineering students who worked on generating new ideas for
   improving four specific projects. Key results are discussed.
   For global operations, the asynchronous virtual teams represent an
   improvement over the standard teams in terms of reach, costs, and
   execution. The VTASI teams advocated in this paper represent yet a
   further improvement over the Asynchronous virtual teams, and hold
   promise to be the most effective among the three types of teams in
   promoting creativity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Histopathological examination is a powerful standard for the prognosis
   of critical diseases. But, despite significant advances in high-speed
   and high-resolution scanning devices or in virtual exploration
   capabilities, the clinical analysis of whole slide images (WSI) largely
   remains the work of human experts. We propose an innovative platform in
   which multi-scale computer vision algorithms perform fast analysis of a
   histopathological WSI. It relies on application-driven for
   high-resolution and generic for low-resolution image analysis algorithms
   embedded in a multi-scale framework to rapidly identify the high power
   fields of interest used by the pathologist to assess a global grading.
   GPU technologies as well speed up the global time-efficiency of the
   system. Sparse coding and dynamic sampling constitute the keystone of
   our approach. These methods are implemented within a computer-aided
   breast biopsy analysis application based on histopathology images and
   designed in collaboration with a pathology department. The current
   ground truth slides correspond to about 36,000 high magnification (40x)
   high power fields. The processing time to achieve automatic WSI analysis

Abstract = {{Energy information systems, which manage energy consumptions over
   internet, have been evolving over the past decade and can be considered
   as a part of a specialised sequential decision process, regarding the
   provision of personalised energy services to the community. The aim of
   this study is to develop and present an innovative decision-support
   system and cloud computing software methodology that brings together
   energy consultants, consumers, energy services procedures and modern web
   interoperable technologies. The authors propose a web-based knowledge
   system, using distributed cloud architecture and metering grids over
   ADSL broadband connections. By using some clustering algorithms and a
   web middleware, energy profiles over time are analysed and observed. The
   resulting clusters and centroids are projected and statistically
   analysed over time, producing a centroid-locus. Hypercube topology was
   used for efficient data management and software agent-based parallel
   analysis. The system operates efficiently on a multi-tier cloud-based
   middleware that generates in real-time using various service software
   components to the end consumers. The case study on real Greek energy
   measurements, for the first time in Greece, indicated a compact and
   efficient distributed procedure that could analyse and produce adaptive
   personalised information services.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the ongoing research on the challenges and
   opportunities of delivering on-line and virtual content to apprentices
   in a Polytechnic institution. Due to the current financial recession,
   apprentices are going back to academia in order to update their skills,
   but these potential students are not willing to leave their workplace or
   their personal lives behind to study. In this context on-line delivery
   represents an opportunity to provide access to content without leaving
   the work environment. However, in order to be successful in providing
   on-line materials for apprentices, polytechnics around the world are
   facing two challenges: How to transform hands-on Learning skills to
   on-line Learning material, and how to provide a rich-engaging
   environment for this group of learners. But not only the learner
   expectations should be taken when designing on-line learning.
   Instructors play also a crucial role in this endeavor, as Web 2.0
   technologies offer the instructor an entirely new role in teaching: that
   of a facilitator. In order to analyze apprenticeship students' on-line
   learning, 57 on-line surveys were distributed among a group of students
   registered for on-line apprenticeship programs. The paper presents
   research findings and a comparison of these with a what the literature
   states regarding the new generation of learners and their use of
   technologies, and the behavior (learning preferences, learning styles,
   use of IT) presented by the research sample. Innovative opportunities
   for learning at the workplace (such as recommendations and future areas
   of research) are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{In this review article on identity, language learning, and social
   change, we argue that contemporary poststructuralist theories of
   language, identity, and power offer new perspectives on language
   learning and teaching, and have been of considerable interest in our
   field. We first review poststructuralist theories of language,
   subjectivity, and positioning and explain sociocultural theories of
   language learning. We then discuss constructs of INVESTMENT and IMAGINED
   COMMUNITIES/IMAGINED IDENTITIES (Norton Peirce 1995; Norton 1997, 2000,
   2001), showing how these have been used by diverse identity researchers.
   Illustrative examples of studies that investigate how identity
   categories like race, gender, and sexuality interact with language
   learning are discussed. Common qualitative research methods used in
   studies of identity and language learning are presented, and we review
   the research on identity and language teaching in different regions of
   the world. We examine how digital technologies may be affecting language
   learners' identities, and how learner resistance impacts language
   learning. Recent critiques of research on identity and language learning
   are explored, and we consider directions for research in an era of
   increasing globalization. We anticipate that the identities and
   investments of language learners, as well as their teachers, will
   continue to generate exciting and innovative research in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. This study examined the relevance and fit of the PARiHS framework
   (Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services) as an
   explanatory model for practice change in residential aged care.
   Background. Translation of research knowledge into routine practice is a
   complex matter in health and social care environments. Examination of
   the environment may identify factors likely to support and hinder
   practice change, inform strategy development, predict and explain
   successful uptake of new ways of working. Frameworks to enable this have
   been described but none has been tested in residential aged care.
   Methods. This paper reports preliminary qualitative analyses from the
   Encouraging Best Practice in Residential Aged Care Nutrition and
   Hydration project conducted in New South Wales in 2007-2009. We examined
   congruence with the PARiHS framework of factors staff described as
   influential for practice change during 29 digitally recorded and
   transcribed staff interviews and meetings at three facilities.
   Findings. Unique features of the setting were flagged, with facilities
   simultaneously filling the roles of residents' home, staff's workplace
   and businesses. Participants discussed many of the same characteristics
   identified by the PARiHS framework, but in addition temporal dimensions
   of practice change were flagged.
   Conclusion. Overall factors described by staff as important for practice
   change in aged care settings showed good fit with those of the PARiHS
   framework. This framework can be recommended for use in this setting.
   Widespread adoption will enable cross-project and international
   synthesis of findings, a major step towards building a cumulative
   science of knowledge translation and practice change.}},

Abstract = {{The paper focuses on security measures in the context of interactive TV
   (iTV), leaving out the field of social TV and concentrating on all
   two-way communication between user/viewer and infrastructure or content
   providers. It aims at introducing architecture for regulating all kinds
   of interactions and data streams within an iTV environment, including
   the different parties and their individual interests. By modeling this
   kind of organizational infrastructure, the authors follow the intention
   of finding best compromises between the partly opposing interests. While
   the user is in need of preserving his privacy, the scenario provider as
   well as the content provider together with the advertisers is dependent
   on valuable consumer information about content and general product
   information. In this respect, the proposed outline of the scenario
   considers all ways and directions of data flows, ranging from user
   information in the shape of TV content recommendations or tailored
   product information according to given consumption preferences up to all
   aspects of data protection. The latter appears highly important
   according to the different participants in the scenario, all having
   their own interests and thus forming heterogeneous relationships between
   the different single and corporate actors. The article emphasizes an
   alternate perspective on iTV compared to simple digital TV on the one
   and internet technology on the other hand. It gives a dense description
   of privacy concerns, economic interests, organizational necessities and
   approaches to programming solutions, presenting alongside the latest
   inventions and standards in terms of data protection features, e.g.
   operating with anonymized snapshots helping not only to hide the user's
   identity but also to create profile clusters. One of the main
   suggestions outlined here is to strengthen the consumer's role, thus
   accepting his dominant position in bringing iTV to success. The
   conclusion to be proposed lies in two key aspects: it is as well
   necessary to refer to the organizational structure as a model of
   interest relations as to combine the structure with innovative data
   protection mechanisms. Because the whole scenario deeply depends on
   trust and reputation, it is a need to put the user/viewer into control
   of the origins of data processing. This can only be achieved by a
   special kind of smartcard with far reaching impacts linked to the
   snapshot method. Furthermore, the authors give hints on how to enhance
   the attractiveness of the back channel in order to stimulate the data
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of severe foot deformities in children or adolescents is
   complex and demanding to the surgeon. This paper describes the technical
   strategy of using a Taylor spatial frame and reports on the functional
   outcome.
   The Taylor spatial frame was used by a single surgeon in patients with
   severe foot deformities. Seven patients with eight severe deformities
   were treated. Mean patient age at surgery was 15.1 (9-29) years. A
   double Taylor spatial frame reconstruction was mounted to the limb. All
   patients had a midtarsal osteotomy and an additional inverse dome-shaped
   calcaneus osteotomy. Assessed measures were pre- and postoperative
   deformity and associated complications and clinical results according to
   Ferreira et al.
   Mean follow-up was 576.5 (359-987) days. The final functional outcome
   according to Ferreira was good in seven cases, fair in none, and poor in
   one. Early complications included pin-tract infection, temporary
   hypoesthesia, and temporary shortening of the tendon of the M. flexor
   digitorum. At follow-up there was no deformity recurrence.
   In children or adolescents, the innovative treatment using the Taylor
   spatial frame and a double osteotomy allows joint-preserving correction
   of severe foot deformities. However, the complication rate is relatively
   high due to the severely deformed feet. Furthermore, the Taylor spatial
   frame is expensive. Thus, this treatment is only recommended for severe
   foot deformities and should be handled by experienced orthopedic
   surgeons.}},

Abstract = {{We present test results from the ``TPAC{''} and ``FORTIS{''} sensors
   produced using the 180 nm CMOS INMAPS process. The TPAC sensor has a 50
   mu m pixel size with advanced in-pixel electronics. Although TPAC was
   developed for digital electromagnetic calorimetry, the technology can be
   readily extended to tracking and vertexing applications where highly
   granular pixels with in-pixel intelligence are required. By way of
   example, a variant of the TPAC sensor has been proposed for the SuperB
   vertex detector. The FORTIS sensor is a prototype with several pixel
   variants to study the performance of a four transistors (4T)
   architecture and is the first sensor of this type tested for particle
   physics applications. TPAC and FORTIS sensors have been fabricated with
   some of the processing innovations available in INMAPS such as deep
   p-wells and high-resistivity epitaxial layers. The performance of these
   sensor variants has been measured both in the laboratory and at test
   beams and results showing significant improvements due to these
   innovations are presented. We have recently manufactured the
   ``CHERWELL{''} sensor, building on the experience with both TPAC and
   FORTIS and making use of the 4T approach. CHERWELL is designed for
   tracking and vertexing and has an integrated ADC and targets very
   low-noise performance. The principal features of CHERWELL are described.

Title = {{Digital imaging and the revelation of `hidden' rock art: Vaalekop
   Shelter, KwaZulu-Natal}},
Journal = {{SOUTHERN AFRICAN HUMANITIES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{55-76}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Vaalekop Shelter, a small and seemingly sparsely painted rock art site
   on the upper reaches of the iMpofana (Mooi) River, KwaZulu-Natal, will
   be flooded by the construction of the Spring Grove Dam downstream. In
   mitigation, the site was photographed using a proprietary digital
   imaging process with the acronym CPED (Capture, Process, Enhance and
   Display). CPED provides different views of the rock art: a 360 view of
   the painted rock surfaces and their surrounds, a very high-resolution
   mosaic of the painted rock surface, and enhancements of the painted rock
   surface that reveal details of the art invisible to the naked eye. These
   innovations literally change the way that we look at rock art. Instead
   of the traditional approach to rock art photography in which many
   separate images are recorded of the paintings, CPED takes the painted
   rock surface as the basic unit of analysis and users may zoom in and out
   of the the high-resolution mosaic image depending on the level of detail
   required. Rock art that was formerly considered `indecipherable' due to
   the deterioration of the painted surfaces, becomes more clearly visible
   after applying image-enhancement algorithms that produce `false-colour'
   and greyscale images. Direct tracing of rock art images could be
   obviated because better copies can be obtained from the digital images.
   The benefits of CPED imaging should be shared as widely as possible.

Abstract = {{Engagement is a frequently reported measure in evaluation studies of
   technology mediated learning environments. In the context of novel
   digital technologies, where the `novelty' factor is inherent in
   interaction with emergent technologies, the concept of engagement is
   often reported at a general level of description of fun and enjoyment.
   Although this importantly indicates positive appraisal of the
   environment it does not provide any detail about how the participants
   are `engaged'. For example, what are they doing and thinking about,
   where is their attention focused - is it on a learning task, a
   tangential entertaining activity or even the technology itself? This
   paper offers a more detailed analysis of students' foci of interaction,
   to provide insight into the different ways that children are both
   cognitively and physically engaged during a discovery-based learning
   experience. Three key foci of interaction within the learning space
   (learning concept, tangential activity, technology) were derived from
   video data analysis. A coding scheme for identifying these interaction
   foci was developed and applied to empirical data with a tangible
   learning environment. In depth analysis showed close relationships
   between the different foci of interaction and the learning process:
   engaging with a tangential activity in a exploratory interaction
   engendered cognitive engagement with domain related concepts; while
   engaging with technology to understand the basics of the system's
   functioning could facilitate higher levels of conceptual abstraction.
   This article highlights the different interaction foci that students
   take in innovative, technology-enhanced learning environments, and
   provides an analytical approach, which informs and extends current
   evaluation approaches towards student engagement in novel digital
   environments. (C) 2011 British Informatics Society Limited. Published by

Title = {{A Dialogic Inquiry Approach to Working With Teachers in Developing
   Classroom Dialogue}},
Journal = {{TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1906-1959}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background/Context: This article describes how we refined an innovative
   methodology for equitable collaboration between university researchers
   and classroom practitioners building and refining theory together. The
   work builds on other coinquiry models in which complementary
   professional expertise is respected and deliberately exploited in order
   to question, understand, and improve practice. Drawing on research using
   digital video to help make explicit teachers' pedagogical rationale, our
   approach involved intensive critical scrutiny of video recordings of
   teachers' own and others' practices.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The study explored
   and reformulated definitions of classroom dialogue-in which teachers and
   students exchange, evaluate, and build on ideas-in the context of
   interactive whiteboard (IWB) use. This article focuses on the
   collaborative theory-building process itself, whose aim was to exploit
   insights derived from research to stimulate and inform thinking, guide
   principled development of new classroom practices, and refine the
   theory.
   Population/Participants/Subjects: Three university researchers and three
   (primary, middle and secondary school) United Kingdom teachers, along
   with their students aged 10-14, took part in the research. The teachers
   were all experienced, reflective practitioners with an established
   dialogic pedagogy. They taught personal education, English, and history.
   Research Design: A case study design was used to collect qualitative
   observational data. A series of three in-depth workshops focused on the
   construct of dialogue and critiqued associated literature. Subsequent
   joint review of lesson videos and other data plus two further workshops
   served to characterize effective strategies for supporting dialogue.
   Data Collection and Analysis: The three initial workshops prepared
   teachers to design and teach three consecutive lessons employing a
   dialogic approach supported by IWB use. Teacher and university
   researcher pairs jointly reviewed the lesson videos, along with
   unstructured teacher diaries, interviews (three per teacher), and other
   contextualizing data, and two further team workshops took place.
   Cross-case analysis of the data, including interview and workshop
   transcripts, follow-up questionnaires, and accreditation reports,
   characterized teacher perspectives on the reflexive-and itself
   dialogic-coinquiry process and its outcomes.
   Conclusions: Preconditions, critical features, and scalable benefits of
   our evolving approach are identified for other research partnerships.
   The process additionally yielded negotiated, recontextualized
   understandings of dialogue and strategies for fostering dialogic
   pedagogy. These were framed in accessible language, spontaneously shared
   within the schools and adapted for wider use, thus forming a springboard
   for further critique and modification in new settings.}},

Abstract = {{This Article addresses conservation, preservation, and stewardship of
   knowledge, and laws and institutions in the cultural environment that
   support those things. Legal and policy questions concerning creativity
   and innovation usually focus on producing new knowledge and offering
   access to it. Equivalent attention rarely is paid to questions of old
   knowledge. To what extent should the law, and particularly intellectual
   property law, focus on the durability of information and knowledge? To
   what extent does the law do so already, and to what effect? This Article
   begins to explore those questions. Along the way, the Article takes up
   distinctions among different types of creativity and knowledge, from
   scholarship and research to commercial entertainment and so-called
   ``User Generated Content{''}; distinctions among objects, works of
   authorship, and legal rights accompanying both; distinctions among
   creations built to last (sometimes called ``sustained{''} works),
   creations built for speed (including ``ephemeral{''} works), and
   creations barely built at all (works closely tied to the authorial
   ``self{''}); and distinctions between analog and digital contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Convinced that in the near future digital information will primarily, if
   not exclusively be provided as mobile services, the Bavarian State
   Library is gradually providing its digital services within the framework
   of these innovative environments. First the online-catalogue with
   approximately 10 million titles and the complete web site of the library
   were programmed and designed as generic mobile applications that run on
   all current smartphone browsers. In another step, the library provided
   50 digitised highlights of its collection as the native App ``Famous
   Books - Treasures of the Bavarian State Library{''} for iPad and iPhone.
   The App ``Islamic Books - Oriental treasures of the Bavarian State
   Library followed in spring 2011. Currently, the Bavarian State Library
   experiments with Augmented Reality applications. In the App Ludwig
   II{''}, the library will provide multimedial library content on the
   famous ``Swan King{''} as an interactive Augmented Reality application,
   georeferenced at prominent places of the king's life such as
   Neuschwanstein Castle. The article will introduce these innovative
   services of the Bavarian State Library, take a look at their technical
   implementation and evaluate the challenges, opportunities, and
   limitations of library services in the mobile internet.}},

Title = {{Impacts of organizational assimilation of e-government systems on
   business value creation: A structuration theory approach}},

Abstract = {{Governments worldwide are eagerly anticipating a digital future with the
   proliferation of information system applications, but assimilation of
   such enterprises could be a potentially formidable challenge.
   Assimilation of e-government systems by organizations is important for
   business value creation. Despite significant investments in e-government
   systems, the extent to which organizations have been able to assimilate
   and leverage these systems varies widely. We develop a theoretical model
   grounded upon structuration theory and the literature on organizational
   information systems assimilation to investigate the impact of
   organizational assimilation of e-government systems on business value
   creation by conceptualizing the notions of IS in organizations. Based on
   our model, we argue that the organizational meta-structures of
   signification, domination, and legitimization determine aspects of
   organizational e-government systems assimilation behavior that may
   affect its value creation potential. We experimentally validate our
   model using a total of 367 surveys collected from public organizations
   currently utilizing an e-governmental system. Our results largely
   support the proposed model and shed new light on the factors associated
   with organizational assimilation of e-government systems. Finally, we
   isolate the organizational, technological, and inter-organizational
   factors that shape the meta-structures for the assimilation of
   e-government system. Our findings indicate that assimilation of
   e-government systems has a substantial impact on business value
   creation. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical
   implications of our findings. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the growing interest for integrative medicine (IM),
   no data are available about the attitudes of healthcare professionals
   towards IM.
   Objectives: To assess the attitudes of healthcare professionals towards
   IM.
   Methods: A convenience, volunteer sample was surveyed using a digital
   47-item questionnaire on the key components of IM: 1. The doctor-patient
   relationship; 2. Patients' responsibility in own healing; 3. Use of CAM
   therapies; 4. Healing environment.
   Results: Of the 162 respondents, the majority were part of medical staff
   (51\%), worked in a hospital (39\%), in psychiatry/psychology (28\%) and
   were women (54\%). Most respondents (98\%) believed that IM components:
   Doctor-patient relationship and patients' responsibility for own healing
   process, were of high importance for healthcare. The other IM
   components, CAM use and healing environment, were found to be of
   importance by a lower percentage of responders (64\% and 70\%,
   respectively). 88\% respondents regarded IM an important innovation in
   healthcare, despite the fact that 63\% of them were not familiar with
   IM. The majority believed that patients should be informed about all
   possible treatments (94\%), including CAM (84\%). Of the CAM therapies
   listed, most considered lifestyle (90\%) and mind-body therapies (54\%)
   to be complementary to conventional treatment. Chi-square analysis
   demonstrated that familiarity with IM and being a female (among others)
   were predisposing factors for a positive attitude towards IM.
   Conclusions: This survey among a convenient sample of Dutch healthcare
   professionals showed a relatively positive attitude towards IM. The
   outcome of this study may be useful to further implementation of IM in
   healthcare. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnostic pathways in the field of laboratory medicine could contribute
   economically to integrate modern ``disease management{''} from the
   perspective of healthcare policy into a complex development with limited
   resources. The objective is to bridge the gap between medical and
   economic demand. Diagnostic pathways could be an innovative way to
   optimize processes in medicine with the objective of transparency of
   costs, results and performance, especially if technical prerequisites
   for web-based communication (i.e., order entry, digitized laboratory
   analyzed findings) are given. The precondition is that laboratory
   diagnostics must be appreciated as a core procedure of a hospital.
   Furthermore, diagnostic pathways provide the opportunity to define
   processes concerning disease severity and rate of resource usage. The
   pathways support the physician by finding the probable or medically
   worthwhile primary and secondary diagnosis for coding the DRG (Diagnoses
   Related Groups). This results in guaranteeing revenues and an increase
   in the quality of therapy. The very visualization of medical decisions
   by diagnostic pathways results in the reduction of ill-conceived
   activities and consequently in an improvement of health economics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to diagnose electoral
   fraud using vote counts. Specifically, we use synthetic data to develop
   and train a fraud detection prototype. We employ a naive Bayes
   classifier as our learning algorithm and rely on digital analysis to
   identify the features that are most informative about class
   distinctions. To evaluate the detection capability of the classifier, we
   use authentic data drawn from a novel data set of district-level vote
   counts in the province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) between 1931 and
   1941, a period with a checkered history of fraud. Our results
   corroborate the validity of our approach: The elections considered to be
   irregular (legitimate) by most historical accounts are unambiguously
   classified as fraudulent (clean) by the learner. More generally, our
   findings demonstrate the feasibility of generating and using synthetic
   data for training and testing an electoral fraud detection system.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the theory of the diffusion of innovations through social
   networks, the article discusses the main approaches researchers have
   taken to conceptualize the digital divide. The result is a common
   framework that addresses the questions of who (e.g. divide between
   individuals, countries, etc.), with which kinds of characteristics (e.g.
   income, geography, age, etc.), connects how (mere access or effective
   adoption), to what (e.g. phones, Internet, digital TV, etc.). Different
   constellations in these four variables lead to a combinatorial array of
   choices to define the digital divide. This vast collection of
   theoretically justifiable definitions is contrasted with the question of
   how the digital divide is defined in practice by policy makers. The
   cases of the United States, South Korea, and Chile are used to show that
   many diverse actors with dissimilar goals are involved in confronting
   the digital divide. Each of them takes a different outlook on the
   challenge. This leads to the question if this heterogeneity is harmful
   and if countries that count with a coherent national strategy and common
   outlook on digital development do better than others. It is shown that
   the effect of a coherent vision is secondary to tailor-made
   sector-specific efforts. On the contrary, a one-size-fits-all outlook on
   a multifaceted challenge might rather be harmful. This leads to the
   conclusion that it is neither theoretically feasible, nor empirically
   justifiable to aim for one single definition of the digital divide. The
   digital divide is best defined in terms of a desired impact. Since those
   are diverse, so are the definitions of the challenge. The best that can
   be done is to come up with a comprehensive theoretical framework that
   allows for the systematic classification of different definitions, such
   as the one presented in this article. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In 2009, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music (SMC), the Oriental Digital
   Media Arts Research and Development Centre (based at the SMC), Shanghai
   Technological Engineering University, and members of the Shanghai
   jing.it Company united to create a new performance of the jinu (Beijing
   opera) classic The White Snake (Baishezhuan). Billed as ``Multimedia
   Beijing Opera Music Theatre{''} and ostensibly staged as a Western
   symphony rather than as a jingju, the performance offered an apparently
   innovative take on the possibilities for contemporaiy traditional
   Chinese performance by synthesising a range of musical and theatrical
   forms with multimedia stage technology. This article analyzes the impact
   of these innovations, not only theatrically, but also through an
   examination of the challenges the production offers to established
   Western theories of postdramatic and multimedia theatre.
   Ashley Thorpe is a lecturer in theatre in the Department of Film,
   Theatre, and `Mauision at the University of Reading, United Kingdom. His
   book The Role of the Chou ({''}Clown{''}) in Traditional Chinese Drama
   was published by Edwin Mellen Press in 2007, and his went articles on
   aspects of Chinese performance have appeared in Theatre Research
   International, Studies in Theatre and Performance, and Contemporary
   Theatre Review. Ile is currently researching the performance of Chinese
   drama in the United Kingdom across the twentieth century.}},

Abstract = {{Imagine for a moment that you have to solve a 3D jigsaw of which you
   have lost several pieces. You have also lost the original box-top
   showing the final picture, and as if that were not enough, some of the
   pieces you do have may belong to some other jigsaw. This is in essence
   the sort of challenge that we faced in the novel project that we shall
   be describing in this paper. The final aim of the project was, with the
   help of 3D scanners, to digitalize and reconstruct multi-piece classical
   sculptures. Particularly, we tackle the restitution of the so-called
   ``Aeneas Group{''}, a famous iconographic reference during the Roman
   Empire. We have undertaken this ambitious project in collaboration with
   the research department of the Spanish National Museum of Roman Art
   (MNAR). This paper summarizes the real problems that arose and had to be
   solved, the innovations, and the main results of the work that we have
   carried out over these recent years.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Physical-technical quality assurance is one of the essential
   tasks of the National Reference Centers in the German Breast Cancer
   Screening Program. For this purpose the mammography units are required
   to transfer the measured values of the constancy tests on a daily basis
   and all phantom images created for this purpose on a weekly basis to the
   reference centers. This is a serious logistical challenge. To meet these
   requirements, we developed an innovative software tool.
   Materials and Methods: By the end of 2005, we had already developed
   web-based software (MammoControl) allowing the transmission of constancy
   test results via entry forms. For automatic analysis and transmission of
   the phantom images, we then introduced an extension (MammoControl
   DIANA). This was based on Java, Java Web Start, the NetBeans Rich Client
   Platform, the Pixelmed Java DICOM Toolkit and the ImageJ library.
   Results: MammoControl DIANA was designed to run locally in the
   mammography units. This allows automated on-site image analysis. Both
   results and compressed images can then be transmitted to the reference
   center. We developed analysis modules for the daily and monthly
   consistency tests and additionally for a homogeneity test.
   Conclusion: The software we developed facilitates the immediate
   availability of measurement results, phantom images, and DICOM header
   data in all reference centers. This allows both targeted guidance and
   short response time in the case of errors. We achieved a consistent
   IT-based evaluation with standardized tools for the entire screening
   program in Germany.}},

Abstract = {{A complete UMTS transmitter is proposed. It is composed of a
   radiofrequency (RF) signal generator, a power stage, and a bulk acoustic
   wave (BAW) duplexer. The 90-nm CMOS digital RF signal generator is based
   on a third-order delta-sigma modulator using innovative design
   techniques to increase work frequency and a BAW filter to get rid of
   out-of-band quantization noise. The filter exhibits very high rejection,
   3 dB of insertion losses at 1.95 GHz for a 3\% fractional bandwidth. The
   0.25-mu m BiCMOS power stage feeds a BAW duplexer that allows to share a
   common between W-CDMA emission and reception. This 4 x 4 mm(2) duplexer,
   built with flip-chipped BAW on glass substrate, ensures good isolation.
   The full transmitter measurements show the compliance with respect to
   spurious emissions in the different frequency bands and an EVM
   measurement at the state of the art (< 5 \%). (C) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate whether virtual surgery performed on
   3-dimensional (3D) nasal airway models can predict postsurgical,
   biophysical parameters obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
   Methods: Presurgery and postsurgery computed tomographic scans of a
   patient undergoing septoplasty and right inferior turbinate reduction
   (ITR) were used to generate 3D models of the nasal airway. Prior to
   obtaining the postsurgery scan, the presurgery model was digitally
   altered to generate 3 virtual surgery models: (1) right ITR only, (2)
   septoplasty only, and (3) septoplasty with right ITR. The results of the
   virtual surgery CFD analyses were compared with postsurgical CFD outcome
   measures including nasal resistance, unilateral airflow allocation, and
   regional airflow distribution.
   Results: Postsurgery CFD analysis and all virtual surgery models
   predicted similar reductions in overall nasal resistance, as well as
   more balanced airflow distribution between sides, primarily in the
   middle region, when compared with the presurgery state. In contrast,
   virtual ITR alone produced little change in either nasal resistance or
   regional airflow allocation.
   Conclusions: We present an innovative approach for assessing functional
   outcomes of nasal surgery using CFD techniques. This preliminary study
   suggests that virtual nasal surgery has the potential to be a predictive
   tool that will enable surgeons to perform personalized nasal surgery
   using computer simulation techniques. Further investigation involving
   correlation of patient-reported measures with CFD outcome measures in
   multiple individuals is under way.}},

Abstract = {{Adder structures utilizing SiGe Hetero-junctio Bipolar Transistor (HBT)
   digital circuits are examined for use in high clock rate digital
   applications requiring high-speed integer arithmetic. A 4-gate deep test
   structure for 32-bit addition using a 210 GHz f(T) process has been
   experimentally verified to operate with 37.5 ps delay or 26.7 GHz speed.
   The paper documents a unique blend of CML and ECL circuit innovations,
   which is needed to obtain this result. The chip is estimated to have a
   power-delay product of 109 ps-W at a device temperature of 85 degrees C.
   A low power design is shown to have a power-delay product of 48 ps-W at
   21.7 GHz. Speed-power trade-offs are explored through pure ECL logic and
   varying current. Additionally, with next generation SiGe HBTs, this work
   shows that 40 GHz is achievable at slightly above room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider discrete-time distributed average-consensus
   with limited communication data-rate and time-varying communication
   topologies. We design a distributed encoding-decoding scheme based on
   quantization of scaled innovations and a control protocol based on a
   symmetric compensation method. We develop an adaptive scheme to select
   the numbers of quantization levels according to whether the associated
   channel is active or not. We prove that if the network is jointly
   connected, then under the protocol designed, average-consensus can be
   asymptotically achieved, and the convergence rate is quantified.
   Especially, if the duration of any link failure in the network is
   bounded, then the control gain and the scaling function can be selected
   properly such that 5-level quantizers suffice for asymptotic
   average-consensus with an exponential convergence rate. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Gordon Tullock is one of the most important of the founders and
   contributors to Public Choice. Two innovations are typical ``Tullock
   Challenges.{''} The first relates to method: the measurement of
   subjective well-being, or happiness. The second relates to digital
   social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and to some extent Google.
   Both innovations lead to strong incentives by governments to manipulate
   the policy outcomes. In general, ``What is important will be manipulated
   by the government.{''} To restrain government manipulation, one has to
   turn to Constitutional Economics and increase the possibilities for
   direct popular participation and federalism or introduce random
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Network effects and standards competition introduce significant market
   uncertainty, creating a substantial challenge to the success of
   innovating firms. Although the literature has highlighted the importance
   of establishing a large installed-user base (the number of users
   adopting the same product) in such markets, the authors draw attention
   to a different, but potentially important, market force: the
   supporting-firm base, which they define as the number of firms
   supporting the same technological standard. They test their proposed
   hypotheses using data from two markets: the floppy disk drive and
   personal digital assistant markets. Their results show that (1) consumer
   product valuation is positively affected not only by the installed-user
   base but also by the supporting-firm base, (2) the two positive effects
   interact with each other and the nature of the interaction changes over
   the evolution of the market (i.e., they strengthen each other's impact
   in the early stage but weaken each other's impact in the late stage of
   the product life cycle), and (3) not all supporting firms are equally
   valuable to the innovator specifically, consumers are affected more by
   firms exclusively supporting a single standard than by firms supporting
   multiple standards and by incumbents than by new entrants.}},

Abstract = {{This article foregrounds the distinction between two compositional forms
   and creative strategies in dance music - edits and remixes - as a way to
   gain a better understanding of the relationship between media use and
   media content, between producers and users, artifacts and events. It
   considers how the earliest disco edits in the 1970s were shaped by
   listeners (DJs and dancers) working in tandem with the material
   qualities and functional properties of vinyl records and other analog
   technologies and argues that while contemporary edits are made with
   digital tools, they continue to be in debt to their analog antecedents.
   In doing so this article critiques the enthusiastic adoption of `remix'
   as a metaphor to describe digital culture and questions whether this
   rhetorical usage overshadows the aesthetic priorities and political
   implications of a variety of creative strategies that involve media use
   and re-use.}},

Abstract = {{OVERVIEW: Companies are increasingly using social media and other
   technologies to broaden the approach to idea generation and innovation
   both within and outside the walls of the organization. However, managers
   can tend to focus on installing the technology, rather than on designing
   a socio-technical system that can meet the organization's goals and
   foster authentic participation. In 2008, Pitney Bowes, a \$5.4 billion
   provider of technology and services for mail and digital communications,
   initiated an effort to build an employee innovation community aimed at
   driving organic growth and fostering a culture of innovation among its
   30,000 employees around the globe. The Pitney Bowes Employee Innovation
   Program team took a human-centered approach and used primary research
   and co-creation with individuals across all levels. of the
   organizational hierarchy to design a program that both met company
   objectives and satisfied a value proposition for managers and employees.
   The resulting program delivered measurable value inside of two years, as
   well as providing intangible benefits such as employee engagement,
   improved internal processes, and increased customer satisfaction. The
   outcomes illustrate the types of results managers can expect from a
   thoughtfully designed and implemented innovation community and the
   design principles and key success factors provide guidance to managers
   looking to initiate a similar approach.}},

Title = {{Effect of thermal history on the mechanical properties of three
   polypropylene impact-copolymers}},
Journal = {{POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY}},

Pages = {{1546-1556}},

Abstract = {{The effect of thermal history on static mechanical properties and impact
   fracture behavior of three reactor polypropylene impact-copolymers
   (ICPPs) was investigated for three ICPPs prepared using commercial
   Innovene (R), Unipol (R) and Spheripol (R) polymerization technologies.
   Multiple extrusion employing a co-rotating twin-screw extruder resulted
   in a significant reduction of the molecular weight of the PP homopolymer
   phase evidenced by the increasing melt flow index (MFI). Neither
   cross-linking of the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) phase nor EPR
   particle coarsening was detected for any of the ICPPs after 5
   consecutive extrusions. Decreasing molecular weight of the PP
   homopolymer phase caused change in the crystalline morphology of
   injection molded specimens due to the change in crystallization kinetics
   and reduction of the number of tie molecules, however, the overall
   degree of crystallinity did not change, significantly. The static
   tensile mechanical properties (E, sigma(y), epsilon(b)), critical strain
   energy release rate, G(c), and the Charpy notched impact strength, a(k),
   decreased with increasing MFI in a monotonous manner for all the ICPPs
   investigated. Despite significant differences between the absolute
   values of the mechanical properties for the three ICPPs, the MFI
   dependence of the sigma(y) and G(c) relative to that for the unaffected
   ICPP fell on a single master curve for all of them. High-speed digital
   camera, used to follow the fracture process during the instrumented
   impact test, revealed no significant change of the small scale yielding
   fracture process with increasing MFI. This was in an agreement with the
   negligible change in the size of the crack tip plastic zone, R(p),
   predicted using simple mixed mode fracture model. The plane strain value
   of the critical strain energy release rate, G(1c), calculated from the
   measured G(c) for the INN (2.4 kJ/m(2)), UNI (2.8 kJ/m(2)) and SPH (3.5
   kJ/m(2)) using a simple LEFM model did not exhibit significant
   dependence on the number of extruder passes. The observed differences
   between the three ICPPs were ascribed to the significantly larger EPR
   content in UNI compared to the other two ICPPs and significantly larger
   content of isotactic PP homopolymer in the INN compared to the remaining
   two ICPPs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in mobile and wireless communication technologies have
   enabled various new learning approaches which situate students in
   environments that combine real-world and digital-world learning
   resources; moreover, students are allowed to share knowledge or
   experiences with others during the learning process. Although such an
   approach seems to be promising and innovative, researchers have
   indicated several problems when applying it to practical applications,
   in particular, the lack of proper strategies or tools to assist the
   students to learn collaboratively in such a learning scenario with
   abundant content. Students might feel interested when using the mobile
   devices to learn; however, without proper assistance or guidance, their
   learning achievements are usually disappointing. To cope with this
   problem, this study proposes a concept map-oriented Mindtool for
   collaborative ubiquitous learning. Experimental results from a natural
   science course in an elementary school show that this approach not only
   enhances learning motivation but also improves the learning achievements
   of the students.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial data and imagery generators are set to become tomorrow's key
   players in the information society. This is why satellite owners and
   operators are examining new revenue-producing models for developing
   space-related products and services. The use and availability of
   broadband internet width and satellite data-based services will continue
   to increase in the future. With the capacity to deliver real time
   precision downstream data, space agencies and the satellite industry can
   respond to the demand for high resolution digital space information
   which, with the appropriate technology, can be integrated into a variety
   of web-based applications.(1)
   At a time when the traditional roles of space agencies are becoming more
   hybrid, largely as a result of the greater drive towards commercial
   markets, new value-added markets for space-related information products
   are continuing to attract attention.
   This paper discusses whether traditional data policies on space data
   access and IP licensing schemes stand to remain the feasible prototype
   for distributing and marketing space data, and how this growth market
   might benefit from looking at an `up and running' global IP management
   system already operating to manage end user digital demand.
   Preface: The terminology describing the various types of spatial data
   and space-based information is not uniformly used within the various
   principles, laws and policies that govern space data. For convenience
   only this paper refers to primary or raw data gathered by the
   space-based industry as spatial or raw data, and the data as processed
   and sold on or distributed by ground-based companies as space
   information products and services. In practise, spatial data range from
   generic to specific data sets, digital topography, through to pictures
   and imagery services at various resolutions, with 3-D perspectives
   underway.(2) The paper addresses general IP considerations relating to
   spatial data, with some reference to remote sensing itself.(3) (C) 2011

Abstract = {{In the field of digital imaging, there are pixel topologies whose color
   detection capability relies on the Silicon absorption properties rather
   than on the presence of a Color Filter Array (CFA) deposited on top of
   the pixels. The spectral response of the different color channels is
   thus not always determined a priori as in the case of a CFA, but it
   depends on the way photocarriers are collected from the Silicon bulk. In
   some cases, the spectral responses can be tuned so that the sensor has
   pixels with an adjustable color space. Color space tunability
   potentially enables new features to be implemented at pixel level. In
   this paper, the discussion and the experimental results are focused on
   the Transverse Field Detector (TFD), a CMOS photosensitive device for
   imaging applications that performs color detection without color
   filters. Thanks to the innovative working principle, based on the
   generation of transverse electric fields in a depleted region of a
   semiconductor active layer, the color space of a TFD can be real-time
   adjusted by means of voltage tuning. Three different applications of
   color space tunability are discussed: the increase/decrease of color
   saturation, the implementation of white balance by tunable spectral
   responsivities, and the improvement of interleaved imaging for high
   dynamic range sensors.}},

   VLSI Circuits From Experimental Measurements}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, potential and limits of Germanium pMOSFETs for VLSI
   applications are investigated from a circuit perspective for the first
   time in the literature. Since short-channel Germanium devices have been
   developed only recently, no circuit design tools are currently
   available, hence most of the results available in the literature address
   process and device-level issues (currently, down to the 65 nm node).
   However, the suitability of Germanium MOSFETs for VLSI circuits should
   be assessed at circuit level. To fill this gap, we introduce an
   innovative methodology that extracts the main circuit parameters of
   interest (e. g., speed, dynamic power, leakage) from measurements on
   experimental devices. Appropriate figures of merit are adopted to
   highlight the potential of Germanium MOSFETs under realistic VLSI
   designs that fully exploit system-level schemes to minimize leakage (e.
   g., body biasing, stack forcing, power gating). Measurements and
   evaluations are performed on 125 nm Germanium pMOSFETs with a
   high-kappa/metal gate stack having an equivalent oxide thickness of 1.3
   nm. Comparison with Si pMOSFET prototypes implemented with similar gate
   stack is also carried out to comparatively understand the potential and
   the weaknesses of Germanium transistors. The main experimental results
   are justified through theoretical analysis as a function of the relevant

Abstract = {{We describe a new hand-held 3D modelling device using vision and
   inertial measurements. Our system allows fast and accurate acquisition
   of the geometry and appearance information of any 3D object. We focused
   our work towards an easy manipulation and operating condition.
   Our methods allow automatic registration with no preparation of the
   scene (i.e. no markers) even when the object is moved between two
   acquisitions.
   In this paper, the design of the system and the developed methods for
   its use are presented. The system has been evaluated, qualitatively and
   quantitatively, using reference measurements provided by commercial
   scanning devices. The results show that this new hand-held scanning
   device is really competitive for modelling any 3D object. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{As population aging is a growing phenomenon in the 21(st) century,
   products and services aimed at the elderly have emerged one after the
   other. Great market opportunities in relation to senior citizens have
   attracted increasing investment from industries. Governments across the
   globe are making efforts to work out a variety of programs to meet the
   demands. Among them, the needs for information technology learning, and
   digital and mental growth are regarded as the focus of future social and
   economic development. The main purpose of this study is to investigate
   senior citizens' behavioral intention toward using broadband network
   services provided via television. Based on the technology acceptance
   model (TAM), a model of senior citizens' recognition of digital
   broadband network service technology available through television will
   be developed in this paper to establish an empirical understanding of
   the factors influencing the use and acceptance of innovative technology
   service products by senior citizens. The results of this study are
   described in three aspects as follows: 1. perceived ease of use, social
   norms, mind-stimulating playfulness and product features are variables
   that have significant positive influence on perceived usefulness; 2.
   social norms and product features are variables that have significant
   positive influence on perceived ease of use; 3. perceived usefulness,
   perceived ease of use, social norms and network externality are
   variables that have significant positive influence on user behavioral
   intention.}},

Abstract = {{Digital watermarking is a useful solution for digital rights management
   systems, and it has been a popular research topic in the last decade.
   Most watermarking related literature focuses on how to resist deliberate
   attacks by applying benchmarks to watermarked media that assess the
   effectiveness of the watermarking algorithm. Only a few papers have
   concentrated on the error-resilient transmission of watermarked media.
   In this paper, we propose an innovative algorithm for vector
   quantization (VQ) based image watermarking, which is suitable for
   error-resilient transmission over noisy channels. By incorporating
   watermarking with multiple description coding (MDC), the scheme we
   propose to embed multiple watermarks can effectively overcome channel
   impairments while retaining the capability for copyright and ownership
   protection. In addition, we employ an optimization technique, called
   tabu search, to optimize both the watermarked image quality and the
   robustness of the extracted watermarks. We have obtained promising
   simulation results that demonstrate the utility and practicality of our
   algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to fabricate SERS-active substrates suitable for sensing
   applications, reproducibility and efficiency issues must be tackled.
   Innovative nanofabrication techniques allow the preparation of
   substrates reproducible and easy to model. Theoretical modelling
   provides a very powerful method for optimizing the design of such
   substrates, i.e. tailoring their geometrical parameters for optimizing
   the optical response. In particular in this work a 1D digital metallic
   grating has been theoretically investigated to identify the
   configuration corresponding to the localization of the near-field
   radiation inside the slits. This chip has been fabricated by electron
   beam lithography (EBL) and electrolytic growth. The Raman enhancement
   factor of the chip has been measured and compared with the theoretical
   estimation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the contemporary ICT environment, we are confronted with a growing
   number of failing innovations. New technological innovations often fail
   because too much attention is still given to (technical) product-related
   features without taking into account the most important parameters of
   user acceptance. In addition, suppliers of ICT. products often lack
   accurate insight into the distinguished profiles of their (potential)
   target audience. In this article theoretical considerations and
   empirical results on this matter are highlighted. First of all, an
   approach is proposed in which more traditional and often scattered
   vision(s) on adoption determinants are broadened into an integrated
   framework. The approach provides a stronger base for better targeting of
   (new) users of technologies. Secondly, the authors elaborate on this by
   rethinking these determinants with regard to later adopters. Later
   adopters (or even non-adopters/users) are often ignored in technology
   acceptance research. However, especially for policy purposes, the
   understanding of why people do not adopt or do not use ICT is strongly
   relevant in the light of the development of an inclusive information
   society. Both approaches are illustrated by case studies starting from a
   common list of nineteen ICT appropriation determinants. This framework
   enables to better profile both earlier and later adopters as well as it
   allows to formulate recommendations how to bring innovations in the
   market. Summarizing, this contribution offers an integrated approach on
   technology acceptance research by bridging the gap between a market and
   a policy-oriented point of view. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Changes in the composition, distribution and availability of information
   and communication technology (ICT) have taken place in the past two
   decades. Digital technology is now a ubiquitous business requirement,
   whilst the availability of mobile/cellular telephones has ensured
   on-going connectivity. Little has been published on the distribution of
   ICT and other networked infrastructure in developing countries. This
   paper seeks to address that by examining Durban, South Africa. The
   spatial distribution of new technology access is examined in relation to
   urban change and the city's ICT policy. It becomes evident that current
   spatial patterns mirror overall investment patterns. Whilst the city's
   policy claims to address distribution and access, its innovations are
   focused on the business sector, rather than last-mile access,
   essentially reflecting spatial inequalities.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a series of hypotheses that predict that the appropriateness
   of different business strategies is conditional on the firm's relative
   performance, or distance to the ``industry frontier.{''} We use data on
   three 2-digit high-tech manufacturing industries in the United States
   over the period 1972-1999, and apply semi-parametric quantile
   regressions to investigate the contribution of firm behavior to market
   value at various points of the conditional distribution of Tobin's q.
   Among our results, we observe that innovative activity, measured in
   terms of R\&D expenditure or patents, has a strong positive association
   with market value at the upper quantiles (corresponding to the leader
   firms), whereas the innovative efforts of laggard firms are valued
   significantly less. Laggard firms, we suggest, should instead achieve
   productivity growth through efficient exploitation of existing
   technologies and imitation of industry leaders. Employment growth in
   leader firms is encouraged, whereas growth of backward firms is not as
   well received on the stock market.}},

Abstract = {{A quantitative method of mapping the web usage of an innovative
   educational portal is applied to analyze the behaviour of users of the
   COSMOS Science Education Portal. The COSMOS Portal contains
   user-generated resources (that are uploaded by its users). It has been
   designed to support a science teacher's search, retrieval and access to
   both, scientific and educational resources. It also aims to introduce in
   and familiarize teachers with an innovative methodology for designing,
   expressing and representing educational practices in a commonly
   understandable way through the use of user-friendly authoring tools that
   are available through the portal. As a new science education portal that
   includes user-generated content, the COSMOS Portal encounters the
   well-known ``new product/service challenge{''}: to convince the users to
   use its tools, which facilitate quite fast lesson planning and lesson
   preparation activities. To respond to this challenge, the COSMOS Portal
   operators implemented a validation process by analyzing the usage data
   of the portal in a 10 month time-period. The data analyzed comprised:
   (a) the temporal evolution of the number of contributors and the amount
   of content uploaded to the COSMOS Portal; (b) the number of portal
   visitors (categorized as all-visitors, new-visitors, and
   returning-visitors) and (c) visitor loyalty parameters (such as
   page-views; pages/visit; average time on site; depth of visit; length of
   visit). The data is augmented with data associated with the usage
   context (e.g. the time of day when most of the activities in the portal
   take place). The quantitative results indicate that the exponential
   growth of the contributors to the COSMOS Portal is followed by an
   exponential growth of the uploaded content. Furthermore, the web usage
   statistics demonstrate significant changes in users' behaviour during
   the period under study, with returning visitors using the COSMOS Portal
   more frequently, mainly for lesson planning and preparation (in the
   afternoon hours). The findings demonstrate that the new COSMOS users
   follow the ``law of surfing{''} behaviour, a common pattern of surfing
   behaviour in portals. However, users return to the COSMOS Portal:
   returning users comprise more than 50\% of all COSMOS visits, stay
   longer on site and visit more pages. Returning visitors are benchmarked
   against the ``law of surfing{''} and outperform it substantially. These
   quantitative results benchmark the web usage of a portal and provide its
   operators with maps of value-added patterns of the portal's offering to
   its users in the science education community.}},

Abstract = {{Is Google in its quest for search engine optimization through the
   creation of new technologies, which not only improves its search
   algorithms but also refines its search functions for users, doing it in
   a manner that makes it a perpetrator of primary copyright infringement
   or an invaluable facilitator for Internet functionality? How should the
   balance of interests in the treatment of creative works be recalibrated
   in the face of changes in search engine technology and operations, and
   the disputes that have arisen within the last decade in the context of
   the digital age and its needs? Using Google as a case study, this paper
   will look at the two main areas of dispute over the operations of
   information locator tools and services that either threatens search
   engine functionality and efficiency or weakens copyright holders'
   exclusive rights. It proposes a concerted set of solutions through a
   reassessment and amendment of copyright law to optimize the social
   benefits and objectives of both the copyright regime and technological
   innovations in the electronic model of information archiving, indexing
   and delivery. A fair distribution of responsibilities and allocation of
   rights and liabilities will be suggested. In the process, due
   consideration will be given to both public and private interests, with
   the former taking precedence; while the recommended solutions will be
   made within the currently outdated framework for Internet intermediary
   protection (i.e. safe harbor laws) and exceptions (i.e. specific
   statutory exemptions and the general fair use defense) under the
   existing copyright regime. Thus, the proposed changes will be far
   reaching without being too radical a departure from current law, an
   evolution that will likely be more acceptable and realistic a solution
   to the problem.
   This paper is published in two parts. Part One of this paper published
   in the previous edition of the CLSR at {[}2011] 27 CLSR 110-131 dealt
   with the challenges to the copyright regime posed by the operations and
   technology behind the Google Images Search Engine, while Part Two will
   assess the benefits of the Google Books Search Project vis-a-vis the
   effects it will have on the scope of copyright protection.
   Recommendations are made to copyright law to accommodate both functions
   while generally preserving the main objectives of copyright protection.

Abstract = {{Before the US crackdown on the WikiLeaks website in 2010, the narrative
   of freedom dominating discourses on uneasy deployment of new information
   and communication technologies (ICTs) in journalism was more prevalent
   in Africa - and developing regions than in advanced democracies. Little
   wonder WikiLeaks did not, at least initially, include African media
   partners in their potent 2010 `cablegate' exposes. From the 1996 Zambian
   government ban of the Post online to the recent onslaughts on bloggers
   in parts of the continent, ICT uses in journalism have reflected
   national contexts, with restrictions often resulting in self-censorship,
   as well as innovations that borrow from and build on global
   developments. This `glocal' context perspective defines the review here
   of the new media use in journalism in Africa with an examination of
   Kenyan media coverage mainly between the 2005 and 2010 constitutional
   referenda. The focus is on coverage by two leading newspapers as they
   strive to keep up with emerging alternative spaces of networked online
   expression. The aim here is to determine the extent to which the
   coverage reflects immediacy and openness in a networked and converged
   environment, with implications for democracy. The article employs a
   comparative approach and qualitative content-genre analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The possible interactions among tourism organizations, their customers
   and other organizations are considered in this article. Based on these
   interactions, three drivers of an integrated e-business strategy in the
   tourism sector are suggested: (1) customizing tourist products,
   personalizing services and supporting mobile services, (2) sharing
   tourism information and operational data, and (3) offering tailor made
   products and supporting user-generated content. In order to emphasize
   our suggestions, the most representative figures derived from recent
   surveys conducted by the Sectoral e-Business W@tch are selected and
   analyzed. These figures are: (a) the use of customer relationship
   management applications in tourism and the importance of mobile services
   for different sectors of the economy including tourism, for the first
   driver, (b) the use of supply chain management systems, online
   purchasing and finally the use of broadband Internet as a complementary
   indicator, for the second driver, and (c) the use of ICT-enabled product
   and process innovations and dynamic packaging, for the third driver. The
   clear positive tendencies of these figures indicate the rising
   importance of our suggested directions as basic drivers of a tourism
   e-business strategy.}},

Abstract = {{In modern Economies, knowledge management systems (KMSs) applications
   are gradually adopted from a growing number of enterprises,
   organizations and governments. As digital content availability is
   increasing dramatically through centralized of distributed digital
   libraries operation, a great research interest is developed upon
   ``clever'' knowledge retrieval based on each user's individual
   preferences. Modern man usually requests to get knowledge under time
   pressure. In many cases it is not possible to have enough time to
   evaluate extensively the huge amount of results presented after a
   ``string-based'' criteria query to a digital library. Next generation
   KMSs should be able to eliminate the results of a search query, based on
   a certain user's profile. This profile carries information about the
   level of preexistent knowledge that maybe a user has on a certain
   knowledge area, the exact scope of its research and the time that he has
   available in order to exploit the results of this research. In this
   paper a new generation of KMSs is proposed that are supporting
   personalized knowledge retrieval. This is achieved through an innovative
   architecture of enriched knowledge objects for knowledge representation
   and the development of an expert system for diagnosis and dynamic
   knowledge composition.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents experimental results of a quadrature bandpass
   sigma-delta (I I{''}) pound modulator based on distributed resonators.
   The modulator employs transmission lines and transconductors as main
   components and does not require switches in the loop filter as in the
   case of switched-capacitor (discrete-time) filters. In addition, the
   proposed complex modulator does not require a quadrature mixer in the
   receiver. As main feature, the modulator architecture introduces an
   innovative way to produce the I and Q outputs that is immune to path
   mismatch due to the sharing of all the analog circuitry for both paths.
   The one-bit second-order modulator ADC is able to convert IF signals at
   fs/2 and 3fs/2 (fs = 50 MHz), achieving an ENOB = 10 bits within a 1 MHz
   signal bandwidth. Therefore the modulator may be feasible for the
   typical IF frequencies used in cellular base stations. Furthermore, it
   provides an image rejection grater than 70 dB. The 0.35 mu m BiCMOS chip
   consumes 28 mW at 3.3 V supply voltage.}},

Title = {{Taming THC: potential cannabis synergy and phytocannabinoid-terpenoid
   entourage effects}},

Abstract = {{Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been the primary focus of cannabis
   research since 1964, when Raphael Mechoulam isolated and synthesized it.
   More recently, the synergistic contributions of cannabidiol to cannabis
   pharmacology and analgesia have been scientifically demonstrated. Other
   phytocannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabigerol and
   cannabichromene, exert additional effects of therapeutic interest.
   Innovative conventional plant breeding has yielded cannabis chemotypes
   expressing high titres of each component for future study. This review
   will explore another echelon of phytotherapeutic agents, the cannabis
   terpenoids: limonene, myrcene, alpha-pinene, linalool,
   beta-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, nerolidol and phytol.
   Terpenoids share a precursor with phytocannabinoids, and are all flavour
   and fragrance components common to human diets that have been designated
   Generally Recognized as Safe by the US Food and Drug Administration and
   other regulatory agencies. Terpenoids are quite potent, and affect
   animal and even human behaviour when inhaled from ambient air at serum
   levels in the single digits ng.mL(-1). They display unique therapeutic
   effects that may contribute meaningfully to the entourage effects of
   cannabis-based medicinal extracts. Particular focus will be placed on
   phytocannabinoid-terpenoid interactions that could produce synergy with
   respect to treatment of pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety,
   addiction, epilepsy, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections (including
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Scientific evidence is
   presented for non-cannabinoid plant components as putative antidotes to
   intoxicating effects of THC that could increase its therapeutic index.
   Methods for investigating entourage effects in future experiments will
   be proposed. Phytocannabinoid-terpenoid synergy, if proven, increases
   the likelihood that an extensive pipeline of new therapeutic products is
   possible from this venerable plant.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative method of volcano deformation
   measurements, applied to camera images taken from the 2004-2008 eruption
   period at Mount St. Helens. Dome growth was thought to be characterized
   by sustained, near-linear rates of a solid dacite plug. Through spatial
   digital image correlation (DIC) analysis of the camera images, new
   evidences arise that the deformation and strain rate of the spine was
   more complex. DIC yielded cumulative and incremental displacements,
   strain and shear planes at decimetre resolution. It was found that dome
   extrusion rates are highly non-linear, decelerating prior to partial
   collapse, followed by a pronounced dome extrusion increase and direction
   change. Associated processes have been identified through DIC, such as
   shallow landslides and reworking of talus apron material. The work
   highlights the strengths of camera strain monitoring, and illustrates
   that dome growth and collapse is a very dynamic process complexly
   interplaying with the surrounding.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years parents have invested heavily in providing their
   children with technologies at home in order to support their present and
   future educational activities. UK education policy has encouraged
   parents to help their children use these technologies to support their
   learning, but within a broader social context of growing anxiety about
   issues of Internet safety, and the unreliability of knowledge taken from
   the Internet. This paper draws on recent research within a large-scale
   mixed methods project looking at a range of issues relating to the use
   of technologies in the home for learning, in order to explore the ways
   in which parents try to balance the sometimes contradictory roles of
   being both technology providers and technology regulators, and the ways
   in which young people act in response. While parents inevitably
   experience a gradual loss of control over their children's uses of
   technology as they enter the later years of adolescence, findings show
   that although some young people develop highly autonomous and innovative
   uses of technology for learning, many others come to moderate their uses
   of technology in ways that are acceptable to their parents.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Many changes in medical education have occurred during the
   author's 50-year career in the field. The aim of this paper is to
   describe 10 lessons worth recording for others engaged in the training
   of health care professionals.
   THREE CAREER PHASES The first phase in the author's career occurred
   during 1960-1972 in Glasgow, where an interest in medical education
   developed alongside an engagement in clinical medicine and research into
   iodine metabolism. The second phase took place during 1972-2002 in
   Dundee, where, after working for a period as a clinician, the author
   made a full-time commitment to medical education. The third phase, from
   2002 to the present, has provided the opportunity to explore new
   horizons in medical education.
   CONCLUSIONS The following lessons have been learned. (i) People are
   important as role models and collaborators. (ii) Innovation in medical
   education is a complex process and research findings can easily be
   misinterpreted. (iii) Nudges, interventions that encourage rather than
   mandate change, are valuable. (iv) Students are important players in
   planning, delivering and evaluating a curriculum. Each student has
   different needs and aspirations. They are the `digital natives'. (v)
   Offer stake-holders practical solutions to problems that can be
   implemented. (vi) There is always something to learn outside one's own
   practice. Go to a conference or read a journal in a related field. (vii)
   Time spent recording one's work and publishing reports based on it is
   rewarding. (viii) Learn from history. We don't need to keep reinventing
   the wheel. (ix) Obtain independent funding. (x) Finally, and most
   importantly, have fun. Working in medical education can be exciting,
   fulfilling and hugely enjoyable.}},

Abstract = {{Markets are becoming increasingly dynamical and unpredictable. Trends
   such as the shortening of the product life cycle, individualization of
   customer requirements and globalization, which includes an adaptation to
   international markets and standards, can be observed. In result, demands
   for adaptable factory systems are increasingly addressed towards an
   industrial engineering. The department of Factory Planning and Factory
   Management of Chemnitz University of Technology has proven its
   competences on this subject by developing approaches like
   Component-based Planning, PLUG+ PRODUCE, High Performance Ramp-up or
   Competence-Cell-based Production Networks. These competences are now
   used in the project ``Building Blocks for Adaptable Factory Systems{''}.
   In this project, partial factory systems are basically researched and
   transferred to an industrial practice. The objective is to achieve an
   adaptability, which meets the particular requirements of the planning
   situation. This is tried to be met by the elaboration of change-drivers
   like universality, mobility, scalability, modularity and compatibility.
   Therefore, the drivers' working principles have to be understood and
   made accessible. Concepts, procedures and methods for the design of
   future adaptable factory systems have to be developed. The central
   component of the set of building blocks is a manufacturing complex
   connected to the logistics system of an Experimental and Digital Factory
   by custom-built interfaces. The adaptability of the system is supported
   among others by tools for the digital factory, innovative identification
   and positioning systems, concepts for the supply of material and the
   self-controlling of logistical objects, as well as
   man-machine-interfaces. The paper will give an overview about the
   approach of Building Blocks for Adaptable Factory Systems. The relevant
   terms are defined and the underlying concepts are presented. Concepts
   for central controlling as well as distributed controlling with an RFID
   are introduced. First building blocks will be introduced. Deployed tools
   and equipment are discussed. Approaches for an effective energy
   management are explained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The global industry is currently facing a growing increase in the
   competitiveness that forces companies to adopt and develop new
   strategies and methods of production. Therefore, one of the most
   relevant challenges in manufacturing engineering is innovatively
   integrating Product, Process and Factory dimensions and life cycles, in
   a holistic approach, from design to recycling/disposal and reuse. The
   challenge faced here is the synchronization and simultaneous generation
   of all three-domain models by integrating manufacturing engineering
   knowledge into the early stage of the modelling and planning processes.
   The next generation of factories has to be modular, scalable, flexible,
   open, agile and knowledge-based in order to be able to adapt, in real
   time, to the continuously changing market demands, technology options
   and regulations. Therefore, integration, flexibility and efficiency
   requirements and the ability to simulate the production life cycle of a
   factory play a crucial role in decreasing ramp-up and design times.
   Furthermore they play a crucial role in improving the performance in the
   evaluation and reconfiguration of new or existing facilities, in
   supporting management decisions and providing tools that can guarantee
   real-time performance monitoring.
   Therefore, it is necessary to research and implement the underlying
   models and ideas during the foundation stage of a new conceptual
   framework, which is designed to be implemented in the next generation of
   factories. This will be supported by suitable Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) and digital infrastructures and should
   lay down the foundations for future applications in this research area
   the industrial paradigm of ``Factory as a Product{''}.
   In line with the context presented here, we propose the development of
   factory templates to address the design and operation practices
   throughout the entire life cycle of the factory.
   Different dimensions of the factory templates are presented in this
   paper; they cover the design and creation of the factory, its
   remodelling and even the disassembly and recycling stages. This entire
   study takes into account relevant factors such as costs, quality, time,
   flexibility, environmental and social issues and energy efficiency.
   Throughout the article, different kinds of models are presented, which
   describe and adjust the structure of the analysis, design and
   development of a factory integration project that helps provide a formal
   analysis of the system. Furthermore, templates integrating the factory's
   response to internal and external disturbances will also be developed.

Abstract = {{Previous studies have reported the importance and benefits of situating
   students in a real-world learning environment with access to
   digital-world resources. At the same time, researchers have indicated
   the need to develop learning guidance mechanisms or tools for assisting
   students to learn in such a complex learning scenario. In this study, a
   grid-based knowledge acquisition approach is proposed and a Mindtool is
   developed to help students organize and share knowledge for
   differentiating a set of learning targets based on what they have
   observed in the field. An experiment has been conducted in an elementary
   school Natural Science course for differentiating different species of
   butterflies. Forty-one fifth-grade students have been assigned to a
   control group and an experimental group to compare the effect of the
   conventional approach and that of the proposed approach. The
   experimental results show that the proposed approach not only improves
   students' learning achievements, but also significantly enhances their
   ability of identifying species in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In research about digital game-based learning, the likely negative
   perceptions of parents are often enlisted as a barrier toward the
   adoption of games in classroom settings. Teachers, students and policy
   makers appear to be influenced by what parents think about games in the
   classroom. Therefore, it is important to study these parental beliefs
   about games. The present research develops and validates a path model to
   explain and predict parental acceptation of video games in the
   classrooms of their children. The hypothetical model was found reliable
   and valid, based on a survey of 858 parents with at least one child in
   secondary education. Overall, the results show that 59\% of the variance
   in parents' preference for video games can be explained by the model
   comprising hypotheses about learning opportunities, subjective norm,
   perceived negative effects of gaming, experience with video games,
   personal innovativeness, and gender. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Woodlands and forests perform multiple functions for contemporary
   society. Their management affects, and is affected by, numerous
   stakeholders each of which relate to and appreciate woodlands in
   distinct ways. Capturing these stakeholder preferences for inclusion
   within increasingly collaborative planning and management processes is
   recognised as an important task. This paper describes and analyses an
   innovative, strongly qualitative method (field-based interactive
   photo-elicitation) via which to achieve this. Small groups of research
   participants were taken to visit, and thus experience, three
   predominantly oak woodlands in the UK, representing different levels of
   deer browsing. The impact of large herbivores is strongly related to the
   functions that woodlands can perform, but their management can be
   particularly contentious and thus perhaps a key challenge to stakeholder
   collaboration. The participants' were encouraged to record this
   experience through taking photographs, and making notes. These
   photographs and notes formed the stimulus for group discussion,
   immediately following the field visits. Data analysis followed an
   inductive ('grounded') approach and identified seven key themes in the
   participants reported preferences for woodland landscapes. We conclude
   that the method advances the field of landscape preference assessment
   and can capture stakeholder preferences in a rich and cost-effective
   manner. The research identified substantial shared appreciation of
   woodland landscapes across `professional' and `lay' social groups,
   challenging several previous studies. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published

Title = {{The virtual supermarket: An innovative research tool to study consumer
   food purchasing behaviour}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Economic interventions in the food environment are expected
   to effectively promote healthier food choices. However, before
   introducing them on a large scale, it is important to gain insight into
   the effectiveness of economic interventions and peoples' genuine
   reactions to price changes. Nonetheless, because of complex
   implementation issues, studies on price interventions are virtually
   non-existent. This is especially true for experiments undertaken in a
   retail setting. We have developed a research tool to study the effects
   of retail price interventions in a virtual-reality setting: the Virtual
   Supermarket. This paper aims to inform researchers about the features
   and utilization of this new software application.
   Results: The Virtual Supermarket is a Dutch-developed three-dimensional
   software application in which study participants can shop in a manner
   comparable to a real supermarket. The tool can be used to study several
   food pricing and labelling strategies. The application base can be used
   to build future extensions and could be translated into, for example, an
   English-language version. The Virtual Supermarket contains a front-end
   which is seen by the participants, and a back-end that enables
   researchers to easily manipulate research conditions. The application
   keeps track of time spent shopping, number of products purchased,
   shopping budget, total expenditures and answers on configurable
   questionnaires. All data is digitally stored and automatically sent to a
   web server. A pilot study among Dutch consumers (n = 66) revealed that
   the application accurately collected and stored all data. Results from
   participant feedback revealed that 83\% of the respondents considered
   the Virtual Supermarket easy to understand and 79\% found that their
   virtual grocery purchases resembled their regular groceries.
   Conclusions: The Virtual Supermarket is an innovative research tool with
   a great potential to assist in gaining insight into food purchasing
   behaviour. The application can be obtained via an URL and is freely
   available for academic use. The unique features of the tool include the
   fact that it enables researchers to easily modify research conditions
   and in this way study different types of interventions in a retail
   environment without a complex implementation process. Finally, it also
   maintains researcher independence and avoids conflicts of interest that
   may arise from industry collaboration.}},

Title = {{A Technical Comparison of Digital Frequency-Lowering Algorithms
   Available in Two Current Hearing Aids}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recently two major manufacturers of hearing aids introduced
   two distinct frequency-lowering techniques that were designed to
   compensate in part for the perceptual effects of high-frequency hearing
   impairments. The Widex ``Audibility Extender{''} is a linear frequency
   transposition scheme, whereas the Phonak ``SoundRecover{''} scheme
   employs nonlinear frequency compression. Although these schemes process
   sound signals in very different ways, studies investigating their use by
   both adults and children with hearing impairment have reported
   significant perceptual benefits. However, the modifications that these
   innovative schemes apply to sound signals have not previously been
   described or compared in detail.
   Methods: The main aim of the present study was to analyze these
   schemes'technical performance by measuring outputs from each type of
   hearing aid with the frequency-lowering functions enabled and disabled.
   The input signals included sinusoids, flute sounds, and speech material.
   Spectral analyses were carried out on the output signals produced by the
   hearing aids in each condition.
   Conclusions: The results of the analyses confirmed that each scheme was
   effective at lowering certain high-frequency acoustic signals, although
   both techniques also distorted some signals. Most importantly, the
   application of either frequency-lowering scheme would be expected to
   improve the audibility of many sounds having salient high-frequency
   components. Nevertheless, considerably different perceptual effects
   would be expected from these schemes, even when each hearing aid is
   fitted in accordance with the same audiometric configuration of hearing
   impairment. In general, these findings reinforce the need for
   appropriate selection and fitting of sound-processing schemes in modern
   hearing aids to suit the characteristics and preferences of individual
   listeners.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents partial results from research based on case studies,
   in which processes of interactivity in research cycles carried out by
   students and teachers in basic education in the social sciences are
   identified and analyzed from the point of view of socio-cultural and
   linguistic constructivism. One case is developed in a conventional
   educational scenario, with face-to-face communication, while a second
   case is developed in a hybrid or bimodal scenario, with face-to-face
   interaction as well as support from virtual fora, In the results, seven
   types of interactivity segments were found, the most outstanding being
   chose of conversation (between teachers, between students and between
   teachers and students), which correspond to ``types of communicative
   exchanges{''}. In the classroom scenario, triadic dialogue exchanges
   predominate, which corresponded to practices guided by the teachers with
   student participation. The communicative exchanges of joint
   construction, which gradually increase during both cycles, mainly in the
   asynchronous virtual fora, are associated with cooperative practices
   between teachers and students, which facilitate in. dividualized
   adjustments of the educative aids and interactive processes that favor
   the development of reflexive thought. In the hybrid case, the use of
   digital technological tools (asynchronous virtual fora) is peripheral,
   possibly due to a lack of teacher training to convert such technologies
   into amplifying aids in processes of joint construction of knowledge.}},

Title = {{An Online Resource of Digital Stories About Cancer Genetics: Qualitative
   Study of Patient Preferences and Information Needs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Cancer Genetics Service for Wales (CGSW) was established
   in 1998 as an all-Wales service for individuals with concerns about
   their family history of cancer. CGSW offers a range of services such as
   risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing. Individuals
   referred to cancer genetics services often have unmet information and
   support needs, and they value access to practical and experiential
   information from other patients and health professionals. As a result of
   the lifelong nature of genetic conditions, a fundamental challenge is to
   meet the ongoing needs of these patients by providing easily accessible
   and reliable information.
   Objectives: Our aims were to explore how the long-term information and
   support needs of CGSW patients could be met and to assess whether an
   online bank of digital stories about cancer genetics would be acceptable
   to patients.
   Methods: In 2009, CGSW organized patient panels across Wales. During
   these events, 169 patients were asked for their feedback about a
   potential online resource of digital stories from CGSW patients and
   staff. A total of 75 patients registered to take part in the project and
   23 people from across Wales agreed to share their story. All
   participants took part in a follow-up interview.
   Results: Patient preferences for an online collection of cancer genetics
   stories were collected at the patient panels. Key topics to be covered
   by the stories were identified, and this feedback informed the
   development of the website to ensure that patients' needs would be met.
   The 23 patient storytellers were aged between 28 and 75 years, and 19
   were female. The digital stories reflect patients' experiences within
   CGSW and the implications of living with or at risk of cancer. Follow-up
   interviews with patient storytellers showed that they shared their
   experiences as a means of helping other patients and to increase
   understanding of the cancer genetics service. Digital stories were also
   collected from 12 members of staff working at CGSW. The digital stories
   provide reliable and easily accessible information about cancer genetics
   and are hosted on the StoryBank website
   (www.cancergeneticsstorybank.co.uk).
   Conclusions: The Internet is one mechanism through which the long-term
   information and support needs of cancer genetics patients can be met.
   The StoryBank is one of the first places where patient and staff stories
   have been allied to every aspect of a patient pathway through a service
   and provides patients with an experiential perspective of the cancer
   genetics ``journey.{''} The StoryBank was developed in direct response
   to patient feedback and is an innovative example of patient involvement
   in service development. The stories are a useful resource for newly
   referred patients, current patients, the general public, and health care
   professionals.}},

Abstract = {{One of the critical aspects of masonry failure is the shear capacity of
   the composite brick-mortar assemblage. In the last four decades, an
   increasing effort has been devoted to study the shear behavior of
   masonry structures. Different test approaches have been used to
   determine the shear strength of masonry, including laboratory tests and
   in-place measurements. In this paper, a close view of the test method
   used for the in-place measurement of masonry shear strength is taken,
   using an innovative approach based on image correlation techniques. A
   series of in-place shear tests were conducted at one of the masonry
   infilled reinforced concrete (RC) frames tested at the University of
   Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, within the framework of a comprehensive
   NSF-NEESR-SG project at the University of California San Diego, San
   Diego, CA. Initial cohesion and friction angles were determined for the
   infill wall, and the lack of uniformity along the shear failure planes
   was investigated with the aid of finite elements and digital image
   correlations.}},

   Application to the `G1 ` temple in Myson, Vietnam}},

Abstract = {{Image-based modelling for cultural heritage documentation is an issue in
   which photogrammetry plays a fundamental role. Nowadays several
   commercial software packages (also at low-cost) allow the creation of
   accurate models by using digital images. However, a solution which
   automatically creates an accurate digital model from images is not
   available on the market yet, thus a relevant part of the work is carried
   out by interactive measurements. In the paper, the full reconstruction
   pipeline of a temple of the archaeological site of MySon (Vietnam) by
   using the well-known photogrammetric software PhotoModeler (EOS System
   Inc., Canada) is illustrated and analysed. In order to speed up the
   process, an innovative photogrammetric tool that is capable to interact
   with PhotoModeler's environment is presented. This allows the
   orientation of the image block in an automatic way without using any
   target. Then, a point cloud is extracted from the images by using manual
   measurements of corresponding points to plot vector features or by
   multi-image matching techniques, in order to automatically provide a
   reconstruction of the surface of the object. The accuracy of the
   obtained point cloud is similar to that achievable with range-based
   sensors. Finally, the point cloud can be interpolated in order to obtain
   a 3-D surface model. To verify the potential of this method, it was
   applied to the conservation design of the `G1' temple in MySon, Vietnam.
   For this real case, which was listed as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage
   site, the results of the automatic method for image orientation were
   compared with those obtainable with manual measurement, and demonstrated
   a similar accuracy despite a shorter elaboration time. In addition, the
   application of the photogrammetric 3-D model for planning future
   restoration activities is reported and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Managing heterogeneous information related to Cultural Heritage sites
   and artifacts is still a complex task. In latest years, there has been a
   significant trend towards the massive digitization of this data, as this
   allows more efficient and reliable storage and management processes.
   Furthermore, the relationship between conservation managers, who are
   often unfamiliar with current documentation techniques, and information
   providers, who tend to be highly technical practitioners without
   expertise in cultural heritage, is not easy to handle. Moreover, in
   Cultural Heritage objects often have a strong 3D component, and cannot
   be easily represented with conventional data management frameworks like
   Geographic Information System (GIS). The use of a 3D framework may allow
   a closer adherence to the real world, as it respects the spatial
   relationships among various parts. A novel method to access spatial
   information through the interactive navigation of a synthetic 3D model,
   reproducing the main features of a corresponding real environment, is
   proposed in this paper. The result of this work is a system called ISEE.
   An innovative aspect of the ISEE approach is represented by our
   definition of spatial relevance of information. The information is
   ranked with a novel measure of relevance that depends on the
   position/orientation in the 3D space, and allows for an intuitive
   interface. The basic idea of ISEE is to allow retrieving information by
   just looking around in a 3D environment, as moving and looking at the
   world is the main modality we use to gather information from it. Users
   explore in intuitive way a 3D environment and access the related
   information, kept in its spatial context. Information are accessed
   through ``extended zones{''}, i.e. portions of the 3D environment not
   having direct reference to specific elements, rather to the distribution
   of information and to the current user location. The use of extended
   zones gives to the proposed ranking algorithm a superior performance
   than rankings methods based on distance. Indeed the ISEE ranking matches
   the intuitive expectation of the users, as was verified with a formal
   usability test. The system has been applied to case studies related both
   to outdoor and indoor environments, showing its potential also as a
   smart guide with the use of augmented reality technologies. In order to
   enable access to a larger audience, sample applications using this
   method are based on Web technologies and do not require special training
   to be used. At the end of the paper are presented the results of an
   evaluation test, which provided useful suggestion to improve the system
   usability and performances. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

   Challenges
   Writing about contemporary history is facing new challenges in the
   digital age. The article sheds light on the practical implications for
   research resulting from the changes in source materials and the access
   to them. In view of technological innovations, changing cultural
   practices and new legal frameworks, it proposes that the current
   practice of contemporary history to advance ``by decades{''} is outdated
   for the 21(st) century and also does not meet the necessary
   historiographical standards. While wittily written syntheses will be
   among the winners of the digital revolution, there has to be a rethink
   regarding the requirements of monographs written close to the sources.
   With its trenchant and provocative considerations, the article calls for
   a debate on a subject ignored by contemporary history for far too long.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores how contemporary historians can avail themselves

Abstract = {{This work presents an area-and power-efficient realization of a new
   time-encoding oversampling converter (TEOC) consisting of a third-order
   continuous time (CT) loop filter and a self-oscillating pulse-width
   modulator (PWM). The modulator displays similar performance to that of a
   standard multibit CT-Sigma Delta modulator but has the complexity of a
   single bit design. The time-encoding quantizer (TEQ) is implemented
   inside a Sigma Delta modulator by replacing a multibit quantizer. An
   innovative TEQ is used to overcome design issues in a 1.0 V
   supply-voltage 65 nm digital CMOS technology. The TEQ allows an exchange
   of amplitude-resolution by time-resolution. The approach of
   time-resolution alleviates the scaling difficulties of mixed-signal
   circuits in nano-scale technologies. The TEOC features a 63 dB
   dynamic-range and a peak-SNDR of 61 dB over a 20 MHz signal bandwidth.
   Clocked at 2.5 GHz, the complete ADC consumes 7 mW from a single 1.0 V
   supply, including also the reference buffers. The ADC core results in an
   attractively small area of 0.08 mm(2) and in a figure-of-merit (FoM =
   Pwr/2 . BW . 2(ENOB)) of 0.17 pJ/conversion-step.}},

Abstract = {{Radiologists in developing countries cite numerous reasons for poor
   research output including heavier workloads, poor remuneration
   (resulting in ``brain drain{''}), poor infrastructure, language
   barriers, lack of modern imaging equipment, and a disease spectrum that
   may be of little interest to journals and readers in the developed
   world. On the other hand, large populations of patients suffering from
   distinctive diseases, cost-effective healthcare systems, and a set-up
   with highly centralised tertiary referral hospitals, may be seen as
   advantages to those willing to tap into this as a data source for
   research. The lack of resources may even stimulate cost-effective
   innovations relevant to the needs of poor communities. This paper
   challenges preconceived ideas and identifies advantages for radiologists
   in developing countries to producing good research and publications. It
   also cautions against ``annexation of sites{''} by stakeholders from
   developed countries, and suggests simple solutions to maximise research
   output without a significant financial cost.}},

Abstract = {{Current MPSoCs typically consist of less than a dozen processing units.
   Future MPSoCs are likely to integrate many more. With this trend, dozens
   of applications can be running on an MPSoC concurrently and application
   deadlock on MPSoCs will become a severe problem. To address the
   application deadlock problem in current and future MPSoCs, this article
   proposes a parallel multi-unit resource deadlock detection algorithm,
   incorporating four contributions: (1) a classification of resource
   events that enables each category of events to be handled efficiently,
   (2) a parallel node hopping mechanism that explores the entire graph
   exponentially in parallel to obtain information about reachable
   processes of every resource, (3) an innovative hardware implementation
   of the node hopping mechanism using bit-wise computations, and (4)
   proofs of correctness and run-time complexity of the proposed algorithm.
   Based on information about reachable processes as well as sink nodes in
   the graph, the proposed algorithm detects deadlock in O(1) run-time.
   Compared with the worst case run-time of any previous algorithm, which
   employs a single scheme to handle all resource events, ours is
   considerably reduced to O(log(2)(min(m, n))) when implemented in
   hardware, where m and n are the number of processes and resources,
   respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of `greater' China (which includes mainland China, the `special
   administrative regions' of Hong Kong and Macao and - particularly for
   our purposes - Taiwan), marks a transformative process in terms of the
   global political economy. China is now the world's second biggest
   economy, and continues to post double-digit growth despite the global
   downturn. More significant than the numeric size of China's economy per
   se, is the extraordinary scale at which it is combining labour with
   capital to transform raw materials into commodities and, as part of that
   process, embedding the potential for innovation within China's political
   economy and society. In the introductory article to this special issue,
   we highlight the implications arising from the dynamism of Greater China
   for the evolving structures of global production networks (GPNs). The
   GPN framework provides a powerful analytical tool with which to map the
   shifting nature of corporate power and capital in the global economy and
   their consequences for local producers and regions. The externalization
   of the Chinese political economy and, with it, the emergence of Chinese
   lead firms, suggests that Western-centric views on GPNs are likely to be
   challenged. We outline the ways in which the contributions to this
   special issue throw light on this, and the implications that arise for
   analysis of GPNs within China as well as for other developing countries.
   We conclude by considering the consequences this transformative process
   has for the developmental project and how it might be theorized.}},

Abstract = {{IPTV services have been widely deployed by network operators around the
   world over the last years. However, real-time streaming of Linear TV and
   Video-on-Demand (VoD) offerings, especially in High Definition quality,
   still puts a high burden on the network and content servers concerning
   bandwidth, Quality-of-Service, processing performance and scalability if
   100.000s of users have to be supported simultaneously. While multicast
   delivery can cope with some of these problems for Linear TV services,
   the unicast VoD services cannot take advantage of that and especially
   the request for on-demand content is expected to substantially grow in
   the future. With the introduction of Content Download Services (CDSs),
   operators have the option to provide IPTV services in innovative ways:
   They can provide high-quality video services to users with limited
   access bandwidth, offload the streaming request for blockbuster movies
   at peak times from the VoD servers or provided personalized
   advertisements for insertion into a live program event in advance to the
   users end device. The Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) Project has recently
   finalized its CDS specification within its IPTV specification efforts.
   DVB CDS supports push and pull delivery models with unicast, multicast
   and peer-to-peer distribution in order to enable various business models
   and use cases. In this work we introduce the specified technology and
   map it to example use cases and business models.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the rapid changes in users' requirements, a new
   generation of information systems (IS), namely, agile IS, has emerged.
   Agile IS, defined as information systems developed using agile methods,
   are characterized by frequent upgrades with a small number of new
   features released periodically. The existing research on agile IS has
   mainly focused on the developers' perspective with little research into
   end users' responses to these agile IS. Drawing upon the tripartite
   model of attitude, the status quo and the omission bias theories, and
   the availability heuristic, we propose a model that utilizes constructs
   from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, the IS
   continuance model, habit, and individual differences to examine the
   drivers of user acceptance of agile IS. Further, we investigate not only
   users' intentions to continue using the agile IS but also their
   intentions to use new features when they are released, which is a
   surrogate for the ultimate success of agile IS. Data from 477 users of
   an agile IS showed that users' level of comfort with constant changes,
   the facilitating conditions provided, and users' habit are predictors of
   both types of intentions, with users' level of comfort with constant
   changes being the strongest predictor. Users' intentions to continue
   using agile IS are also determined by users' satisfaction with and
   perceived usefulness of the past upgrades. Finally, users who are
   innovative are more likely to use future releases of new features. The
   present work fills a gap in the software engineering literature and
   contributes a technology acceptance model specific to agile IS, which
   are becoming a mainstay of companies' IT portfolio in a fast-changing
   business environment.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This paper provides highlights of a utilization-focused
   evaluation of a collaborative Pan-Arctic Inuit Wellness TV Series that
   was broadcast live in Alaska and Canada in May 2009. This International
   Polar Year (IPY) communication and outreach project intended to (1)
   share information on International Polar Year research progress,
   disseminate findings and explore questions with Inuit in Alaska, Canada
   and Greenland; (2) provide a forum for Inuit in Alaska, Canada and
   Greenland to showcase innovative health and wellness projects; (3)
   ensure Inuit youth and adult engagement throughout; and (4) document and
   reflect on the overall experience for the purposes of developing and
   ``testing{''} a participatory communication model.
   Study design. Utilization-focused formative evaluation of the project,
   with a focus on overall objectives, key messages and lessons learned to
   facilitate program improvement.
   Methods. Participant observation, surveys, key informant interviews,
   document review and website tracking.
   Results. Promising community programs related to 3 themes men's
   wellness, maternity care and youth resilience - in diverse circumpolar
   regions were highlighted, as were current and still-evolving findings
   from ongoing Arctic research. Multiple media methods were used to
   effectively deliver and receive key messages determined by both
   community and academic experts. Local capacity and new regional networks
   were strengthened. Evidence-based resources for health education and
   community action were archived in digital formats (websites and DVDs),
   increasing accessibility to otherwise isolated individuals and remote
   communities.
   Conclusions. The Pan-Arctic Inuit Wellness TV Series was an innovative,
   multi-dimensional communication project that raised both interest and
   awareness about complex health conditions in the North and stimulated
   community dialogue and potential for increased collaborative action.
   Consistent with a communication for social change approach, the project
   created new networks, increased motivation to act and provided new tools
   to do so, and increased local community involvement and ``voice{''} in
   the discussion and dissemination of successful strategies to promote
   Inuit wellness. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2011; 70(3):236-244)}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Values such as promoting free trade in services or protecting public
   morality coexist in a perilous balance nowadays. This peril appears to
   be exacerbated by the manifold possibilities of supplying services that
   the digital age brings with it. Technological advances and innovations
   transform the manner that services are supplied and call for swift
   reaction by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, electronic
   communications erode long-standing traditions in regulating various
   services industries (supply side) and consumer behaviour (consumption
   side) and sometimes allow for easy circumvention of law. The US -
   Gambling and China - Audiovisual Products rulings are the first
   pronouncements of the World Trade Organization (WTO) judiciary on the
   possible clash between trade expansion, on the one hand, and protection
   of public morals, on the other. After a critical review of these two
   important recent rulings on the concept of public morality and its
   treatment by the WTO judiciary, the article goes on to discuss the
   changing scope of regulatory sovereignty regarding the protection of
   public morality in a digital landscape; the paradigm shift in regulatory
   approaches that technological advances bring about; and the role of
   courts and non-state actors in the regulation of cyberspace.}},

Abstract = {{The 2010 U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) calls
   for training programs to develop mid-level dental health care providers
   to work in areas with underserved populations. In 2004, legislation was
   passed in Arizona allowing qualified dental hygienists to enter into an
   affiliated practice relationship with a dentist to provide oral health
   care services for underserved populations without general or direct
   supervision in public health settings. In response, the Northern Arizona
   University (NAU) Dental Hygiene Department developed a
   teledentistry-assisted, affiliated practice dental hygiene model that
   places a dental hygienist in the role of the mid-level practitioner as
   part of a digitally linked oral health care team. Utilizing current
   technologies, affiliated practice dental hygienists can digitally
   acquire and transmit diagnostic data to a distant dentist for triage,
   diagnosis, and patient referral in addition to providing preventive
   services permitted within the dental hygiene scope of practice. This
   article provides information about the PPACA and the Arizona affiliated
   practice dental hygiene model, defines teledentistry, identifies the
   digital equipment used in NAU's teledentistry model, give an overview of
   NAU's teledentistry training, describes NAU's first teledentistry
   clinical experience, presents statistical analyses and evaluation of NAU
   students' ability to acquire diagnostically efficacious digital data
   from remote locations, and summarizes details of remote applications of
   teledentistry-assisted, affiliated practice dental hygiene workforce

Abstract = {{Over the past 30 years, continuous progress in the application of
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance
   spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to the detection, diagnosis and
   characterization of human prostate cancer has turned what began as
   scientific curiosity into a useful clinical option. In vivo MRSI
   technology has been integrated into the daily care of prostate cancer
   patients, and innovations in ex vivo methods have helped to establish
   NMR-based prostate cancer metabolomics. Metabolomic and multimodality
   imaging could be the future of the prostate cancer clinic-particularly
   given the rationale that more accurate interrogation of a disease as
   complex as human prostate cancer is most likely to be achieved through
   paradigms involving multiple, instead of single and isolated,
   parameters. The research and clinical results achieved through in vivo
   MRSI and ex vivo NMR investigations during the first 11 years of the
   21st century illustrate areas where these technologies can be best
   translated into clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an innovative compensation strategy to extract and
   mitigate different current disturbances such as the current harmonics,
   cyclic current fluctuation and random current fluctuation. The
   contribution in this paper is that it does not need any mathematical
   model to represent the current disturbances and consequently extract
   these disturbances like the other common and utilized techniques. The
   proposed technique is simple for formulation and practical for
   implementation compared to the state-estimation techniques used for the
   same applications. The proposed strategy depends on recursive
   formulation of the Wiener filter. The presented ideas in this paper are
   proved by digital simulation results using MATLAB/SIMULINK on the
   aforementioned current problems in the distribution systems. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Radiology undergraduate curriculum has undergone a tremendous
   transformation in the decades reflecting a change in the structure,
   content and delivery of instruction. These changes are not unique to the
   discipline, but rather a response in the cycle of the re-engineering
   process in the medical curriculum in order to ensure its proper role
   into the ever-changing context. Radiology education is now more
   integrated across the curriculum than ever. The diversity of how
   radiology is being taught within the medical undergraduate curriculum is
   extensive and promising with the expanding role of the radiologist in
   the spectrum within the medical curriculum. A strong interface between
   the medical student and the clinicians must always be integrated in the
   learning process in order to convey the essential and practical use of
   the different aspects of radiology essential to the student's career as
   a future clinician. With the recent advancement in educational and
   technological innovations, radiology education is mobilized in the most
   pioneering ways, stimulating a rekindled interest in the field of
   medical imaging. This paper describes the increasing interest in current
   role of undergraduate radiology education in the context of constant
   medical curriculum innovations and in the digital age. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The application of multi-valued (non-binary) signals can provide a
   considerable relief in transmission, storage and processing of large
   amount of information in digital signal processing. Optical multi-valued
   logical operation is an interesting challenge for future optical signal
   processing where we can expect much innovation. A novel all-optical
   quaternary successor (QSUC) circuit with the help of semiconductor
   optical amplifier (SOA)-assisted Sagnac switch is proposed and
   described. This circuit exploits the polarization properties of light.
   Different logical states are represented by different polarization state
   of light. Simulation result confirming described method is given in this
   paper. Proposed all-optical successor circuit can take an important and
   significant role in designing of all-optical quaternary universal
   inverter and modulo arithmetic unit (addition and multiplication). (C)

Abstract = {{Research on information technology has been focused primarily on the
   worlds of IT and management systems for business and government to the
   relative neglect of research on the digital and institutional
   infrastructures that underpin the research enterprise itself. When
   digital research is studied, the emphasis has been on the diffusion of
   technological innovations, rather than the social and political dynamics
   shaping the design and role of technologies in research. However, what
   researchers know, and with whom they collaborate, could be transformed
   through the strategic use of advances designed to support research,
   defined here as `research-centred computational networks'. This article
   presents a framework for conceptualizing the social and technological
   choices shaping the next generation of research in ways that could open
   democratize key aspects of the research process that move well beyond
   academic publication. The framework highlights the limited scope of
   innovation to date, and identifies a variety of factors that maintain
   and enhance institutional control over the research process, at the risk
   of losing the creative and productive bottom-up participation by
   networked researchers and citizen researchers among the public at large.
   Conceptualizing, prioritizing and advancing study of next generation
   research is one of the most significant but difficult challenges facing
   scholars of information technology. Journal of Information Technology

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to review the past history of hand
   surgery briefly and to overview of a vision of hand surgery over next
   generations in republic of Korea. There were three characteristics of
   the past history of digit replantation in Korea. Due to the tremendous
   use of press machine, the replantation surgery for finger amputation had
   been developed rapidly from 1980's to 1990's period. Also new
   microsurgery techniques had been introduced such as toe pulp free flap
   for digit reconstruction. These techniques had been developed based on
   the medical health insurance system for the factory employees. Future of
   hand surgery in Korea can be anticipated as followings: operative
   microscopy and robotics may help surgeons to anastomosis very tiny
   micro-vessels; the functional recovery of fingers and hands will be more
   important; incidence of degenerative disease, musculoskeletal system
   disorder due to excessive use and injury during sports will increase;
   new materials such as artificial joint will be used more frequently
   according to the innovation of tissue engineering and regenerative
   medicine; specialist system for hand surgeon will be settled. Since
   there are a lot of hand surgeon who has a mission to alleviate patient's
   pain and injury, there will be a continuous growth of hand surgery in
   Korea.}},

Title = {{Geostatistical approach for the assessment of the water reservoir
   capacity in arid regions: a case study of the Akdarya reservoir,

Abstract = {{The paper presents the results of a new geostatistical approach to
   generate bathymetric surface models from point measurement converted
   into continuous contour surfaces of reservoir bottoms in Uzbekistan.
   Sedimentation of reservoirs raises engineering, environmental and
   economical issues for the communities around the world in areas affected
   by a strong water deficit. Because of Uzbekistan's arid climatic
   conditions, and uneven spatial and temporal water resources
   distribution, responsive and innovative water availability assessment
   surveys of all major water reservoirs are required. Bathymetric
   surveying is a traditional method that is carried out for the estimation
   of reservoir volumes and surface areas of the corresponding reservoir
   stages in order to assess the water availability. Volume and surface
   area differences derived from multiple surveys of a reservoir provide
   storage loss estimates over time due to sedimentation. However, two main
   factors, such as intensive field data measurement and post
   data-processing, often limit the frequency of these surveys.
   Alternatively, innovative depth measurement technologies coupled with
   contouring and surface mapping programs provide automated reservoir
   volume and surface area calculations. This significantly reduces time,
   workload and financial burdens for reservoir sedimentation projects.
   This research proposes the use of geostatistical approach to assess the
   reservoir sedimentation in the Akdarya reservoir of Uzbekistan. The
   geostatistical approach includes (semi-) variogram analysis and
   interpolation (kriging and simulations-turning bands) techniques
   predicting values at unsampled locations for generating digital
   bathymetric surface models of reservoir bottom conditions in order to
   calculate the volume and surface area at a given water elevation. The
   simulation enables to have range of reservoir volumes and surface areas
   with the same probability, in comparison to the kriging and traditional
   methods. This gives a real estimation of the resource availability for
   water operators to manage natural resources and hydraulic infrastructure
   in a sustainable manner.}},

   This research was carried out in the following stages: (i) EDFF
   mechanical structure development; (ii) data acquisition system and
   embedded software design; and (iii) evaluation of EDIT performance
   parameters. EDFF has routines for instantaneous flow rate measurement,
   interactive calibration, and also several flow meter parameter
   adjustments, allowing data transmission via a RS-232 protocol. The
   real-time flow measurement task updates values of instantaneous flow
   rate each seven seconds, enabling unit selection. The interactive
   calibration routine guides users during all calibration process showing
   instructions on EDFF's display. A data digital filtering procedure was
   implemented in an embedded software using the Grubbs' Test in order to
   identify and to remove outliers from the acquired data. The Method of
   Least Squares was also implemented in the embedded software in order to
   calculate the fitting model coefficients on the calibration procedure.
   This flowmeter is able to work from 1.94 to 7.78 dm(3) s(-1) with an
   uncertainty of +/- 5.7\%. The coefficient of local head loss (K) was
   close to 0.55 for Reynolds number values higher than 10(5). The
   developed EDFF is a low-cost and stand-alone system with potential for
   agricultural applications.}},

Abstract = {{There is global recognition that sustainable land use requires
   monitoring that will detect change on a scale that protects the
   resource. That fundamental necessity is threatened where labor-intensive
   methods and high labor costs cause sampling deficiencies and increased
   Type-II error rates (false negatives). Ground-based imaging is a
   monitoring method that reduces monitoring labor costs. Nadir (vertical)
   images acquired with common digital cameras can be manually analyzed for
   cover using free software. We used an innovative field protocol to
   acquire standardized, freehand, nadir images (samples) of rangeland,
   then compared point intercept (PI) and image-analysis techniques.
   Between methods, precision (repeatability) across users was equivalent;
   cover measurements were often different, and the image-analysis
   technique took only a third as long to complete. Image analysis has
   several advantages over PI besides the reduced labor cost: Images are
   permanent resource records available for reanalysis if data are
   questioned, if software improves, or if management objectives change;
   and image analysis is less biased by moving vegetation, moving pointing
   devices, and bright vegetation color.}},

Abstract = {{Computerized vision and built reality - About the designing of complex
   building shapes. For the past century, architects have been using
   cylinders, cones, rotational and ruled surfaces for their designs.
   Meanwhile computers and corresponding software are necessary for
   throughout the architectural design and planning of the construction
   industry. Whether it is the draft of drawings or the design of new
   complex building shapes, working with digital content has become the
   standard for the industry. There is a continuous tendency to give up
   linear forms with easily manageable numbers of the same elements.
   Free-form structures originated by the creativity of architects
   beginning in the last decade of the previous millennium have developed
   to symbols of elegance, grace, progress, and innovation. The
   construction of arbitrarily shaped building envelopes necessitates the
   computerized design and calculation of large numbers of unique elements.
   This iconic or landmark architecture is commonly used to emphasize the
   brands of enter-prises. To transfer the architectural concept into built
   reality, an intense collaboration of geometrical and structural
   engineers combined with production and material management experience is
   necessary to standardize complexity and hence increase the feasibility
   of the design.}},

Abstract = {{Historical studies reveal how organizational markets supplied artifacts
   that became fashionable because they met not only consumers' cultural
   tastes, but also their technological preferences. This article calls
   such artifacts cultural-technological fusions. The digital mode of
   production tends to generate more types of fashionable fusions, which
   replace each other at a growing rate, and travel increasingly swiftly
   across consumers globally. These changes in fashion markets mandate a
   revised theory of fashion bearing on the organizational production of
   digital culture-technology fusions and on the characteristics of fusions
   so produced. This article's theory describes digital production
   processes enabling fusion's rapid visualization, creation, and awareness
   among global consumers, production processes that create or reinforce
   three types of fusions: `beautiful technologies', that is technologies
   rendered aesthetic; `efficient beauties', that is aesthetic artifacts
   rendered technologically efficient; `concoctions', that is new
   technologies fused with new cultural tastes. Finally, the theory
   discusses the novel characteristics of the market supply and consumption
   of fashionable fusions.}},

Abstract = {{Gestural motions of the hands and fingers are powerful tools for
   expressing meanings and concepts, and the nervous system has the
   capacity to retain multiple long-term motor memories, especially
   including movements of the hands. We developed many sets of successive
   movements of both hands, referred to as ``digit anatomy,'' and made
   students practice the movements which express (1) the aortic arch,
   subclavian, and thoracoacromial arteries and their branches, (2) the
   celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and their branches, and
   formation of the portal vein, (3) the heart and the coronary arteries,
   and (4) the brachial, lumbar, and sacral plexuses. A feedback survey
   showed that digit anatomy was helpful for the students not only in
   memorizing anatomical structures but also in understanding their
   functions. Out of 40 students, 34 of them who learned anatomy with the
   help of digit anatomy were ``very satisfied'' or ``generally satisfied''
   with this new teaching method. Digit anatomy that was used to express
   the aortic arch, subclavian, and thoracoacromial arteries and their
   branches was more helpful than those representing other structures.
   Although the movements of digit anatomy are expected to be remembered
   longer than the exact meaning of each movement, invoking the motor
   memory of the movement may help to make relearning of the same
   information easier and faster in the future. Anat Sci Educ 4:132-141.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative torque control strategy for a switched
   reluctance machine (SRM) operating in continuous-conduction mode (CCM).
   The proposed strategy was first designed to control the torque in
   discontinuous-conduction mode and then extended to operate in CCM as
   well. With CCM, the torque can be increased at high speed without
   modifying the number of turns, the source voltage, or the converter; it
   is achieved through the control. Reviews of past control strategies, as
   well as the principle of this mode and its influence on the machine
   performance, are presented. The advantages and drawbacks of the proposed
   strategy are outlined. In particular, the power and torque densities of
   the SRM are improved so that this machine becomes comparable with ac
   machines without the drawback of field weakening. A new control law has
   been studied and implemented; simulation and experimental results are
   provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.}},

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to reveal the heterogeneity of Internet users in
   rural areas. Who is really using the Internet? Is it the farmer or other
   members of the rural family? Can rural areas be seen as a homogenous
   space or do different types of Internet users exist? Research is based
   on both the descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis techniques
   on a sample of 920 individuals in three administrative regions of rural
   Greece. Basic findings suggest that less than one out of three rural
   residents go online. A set of perceived potentials and pitfalls of
   Internet use are analyzed. Social networking and e-mail are the
   principal uses of the Internet, classifying users into three distinct
   types. For ``basic users{''}, Internet access is influenced by income
   and gender while the ``socially interactive users{''} are influenced by
   the existence of a young member in the family. For ``farm oriented
   users{''}, Internet access is influenced by the digital divide between
   rural and urban location and by farmers' competency. The typology of
   users along with their perceptions regarding Internet use can provide
   useful policy insights on the ways that Internet access can contribute
   to diffusion of innovation and rural development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper examines the hypothesis that ICT penetration has positive
   effects on economic growth. On theoretical grounds, this paper discusses
   three channels through which ICT penetration can affect growth: (i)
   fostering technology diffusion and innovation; (ii) enhancing the
   quality of decision-making by firms and households; and (iii) increasing
   demand and reducing production costs, which together raises the output
   level. This paper conducts three empirical exercises to provide a
   comprehensive documentation of the role of ICT as a source of growth in
   the 1996-2005 period. The first exercise shows that growth in 1996-2005
   improved relative to the previous two decades and experienced a very
   significant structural change. The second exercise uses the traditional
   cross-country regression method to identify a strong association between
   ICT penetration and growth during 1996-2005, controlling for other
   potential growth drivers and country-fixed effects. The third exercise
   uses the system Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) for dynamic panel
   data analysis to tease out the causal link between ICE penetration and
   growth. This analysis also shows that, for the average country, the
   marginal effect of the penetration of internet users was larger than
   that of mobile phones, which in turn is larger than that of personal
   computers. The marginal effect of ICE penetration, however, lessens as
   the penetration increases. This paper points out several policy
   implications drawn from its analyses and findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In 2010, early detection of prostate cancer continues to rely on digital
   rectal examination and serum total PSA. However, selecting patients for
   prostate biopsy requires taking into account the prostate volume and the
   evolution of PSA over time. PSA derivatives such as PSA density, PSA
   velocity and the ratio free PSA / total PSA are useful supplements.
   However, the choice of the threshold value is not well defined and
   depends on the relative sensitivity and specificity desired. The real
   innovations come from basic research that has found potential markers of
   aggressiveness of prostate cancer and molecular biology tools used
   routinely as the PCA-3 score and the pro-PSA. The role of these new
   markers for diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer remains unclear.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative Printed Fabric Computerized Automatic
   Color Separation System. First, a scanner is used to obtain the
   digitized color image of printed fabric in RGB (red, green, blue) mode,
   and the image is then converted to the digitized color image in HSI
   (hue, saturation, intensity) mode. Next, the genetic algorithms are
   applied to search the smaller sub-image having the same color
   distribution as the original fabric for proceeding with the subsequent
   color separation algorithm. For the color separation algorithm, the
   FCM-based (Fuzzy C-Means) Region Splitting Method is used to carry out
   the color segmentation of the printed fabric image. The experimental
   result shows that the color separation method proposed by this study can
   quickly and correctly achieve the automatic color separation of the
   printed fabric.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes two-part research exploring the context for and
   human-centred design of `digital mementos', as an example of technology
   for reflection on personal experience (in this case, autobiographical
   memories). Field studies into families' use of physical and digital
   objects for remembering provided a rich understanding of associated user
   needs and human values, and suggested properties for `digital mementos'
   such as being `not like work', discoverable and fun. In a subsequent
   design study, artefacts were devised to express these features and
   develop the understanding of needs and values further via discussion
   with groups of potential `users'. `Critical artefacts' (the products of
   Critical Design) were used to enable participants to envisage broader
   possibilities for social practices and applications of technology in the
   context of personal remembering, and thus to engage in the design of
   novel devices and systems relevant to their lives. Reflection was a
   common theme in the work, being what the digital mementos were designed
   to afford and the mechanism by which the design activity progressed.
   Ideas for digital mementos formed the output of this research and
   expressed the designer's and researcher's understanding of participants'
   practices and needs, and the human values that underlie them and, in
   doing so, suggest devices and systems that go beyond usability to
   support a broader conception of human activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We focus on four two-digit manufacturing industries that are known for
   their high patenting activity. We then use Principal Components Analysis
   to generate a firm- and year-specific `innovativeness' index by
   extracting the common variance in a firm's patenting and R\&D
   expenditure histories. To begin with, we explore the heterogeneity of
   firms by using semi-parametric quantile regression. We then move on to
   parametric regressions that include a weighted least squares (WLS)
   analysis, which explicitly takes into account the different job-creating
   potential of firms of different sizes. As a result, we investigate the
   effect of innovation on total number of jobs, whereas previous studies
   have focused on the effect of innovation on firm behavior. Indeed,
   previous studies have typically taken the firm as the unit of analysis,
   implicitly weighting each firm equally according to the principle of
   `one firm equals one observation'. Our results suggest that firm-level
   innovative activity leads to employment creation that may have been
   underestimated in previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{P>In this paper new and previously known passage tomb art in north-west
   Ireland is recorded using an innovative recording technique. The use of
   this method, which involves vector drawing from digital photographs
   taken with oblique lighting (VeDPOL), has clarified and increased the
   instances of megalithic carving in the north-west of Ireland. At two
   monuments - Listoghil and Heapstown Cairn - the new recordings have
   allowed us to contextualize the art within the broader corpus of passage
   tomb motifs. Additionally, it is proposed that one of the carvings from
   Listoghil is of later prehistoric origin and not Neolithic as previously
   believed. Finally, and most importantly, this paper highlights a group
   of motifs recently found at Cairn B in the Carrowkeel-Keashcorran
   complex. This discovery demonstrates for the first time that megalithic
   art was a feature of all four major passage tomb complexes in Ireland.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, digital learning has been converting from e-learning to
   m-learning because of the significant growth of wireless and mobile
   computing technologies. Students can learn any time and any where with
   mobile devices. Consequently, context-aware ubiquitous learning
   (u-learning) is emerging as a new research area. It integrates wireless,
   mobile and context awareness technologies in order to detect the
   situation of the learners and provide more seamless adaptive support in
   the learning process. In this paper, a context-aware u-learning
   environment is developed for learning about campus vegetation in
   elementary schools based on an innovative approach by employing
   repertory grid method in designing learning content. In addition, we
   probe the feasibility of context-aware u-learning in courses by
   soliciting feedback from the students and teachers through interviews
   and questionnaires. The findings reveal that the environment is capable
   of enhancing students' motivation and learning effectiveness. Moreover,
   it is also capable of reducing the teaching load while enabling better

Abstract = {{Histogram specification has been successfully used in digital image
   processing over the years. Mainly used as an image enhancement
   technique, methods such as histogram equalization (HE) can yield good
   contrast with almost no effort in terms of inputs to the algorithm or
   the computational time required. More elaborate histograms can take on
   problems faced by HE at the expense of having to define the final
   histograms in innovative ways that may require some extra processing
   time but are nevertheless fast enough to be considered for real-time
   applications. This paper proposes a new technique for specifying a
   histogram to enhance the image contrast. To further evidence our faith
   on histogram specification techniques, we also discuss methods to modify
   images, e. g., to help segmentation approaches. Thus, as advocates of
   these techniques, we would like to emphasize the flexibility of this
   image processing approach to do more than enhancing images.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve significant dose reduction without compromising diagnostic
   efficacy, it is important to understand the effects of exposure
   reduction on image quality, a concept that is often mentioned but not
   well defined in the imaging literature. Studies to assess subjective
   image quality for digital radiography (DR) demonstrate wide variability
   among radiologists and technologists, resulting in substantial
   variability in the determination of acceptable image quality and optimal
   radiation exposure required to obtain a high-quality radiograph. In
   addition to improving detector technology and image processing
   techniques and tailoring exposure to the exam type and patient body
   habitus, it is possible to take advantage of informatics-based and
   psychoperceptual approaches. These can be used to establish the relative
   trade-offs among patient exposure, perceived image quality, and
   diagnostic efficacy. Innovations such as automated quality assessment of
   digital radiographs, use of a mathematical model of the human visual
   system to predict the perceived impact of lower radiation exposure, the
   creation of a quality-assessment database of images, and better
   definition and training of radiologists in the determination of image
   quality can help to reduce variability in assessment and facilitate
   reductions in dose while minimizing negative effects on image quality.}},

Abstract = {{The algorithm we present here is useful for measuring the planimetric
   discrepancy between two models which can be represented by contours. In
   cartography the paradigm of such models is represented by digital
   terrain models (DTMs). The measure we propose is based on an area
   enclosed between homologous contours (two level contours, each belonging
   to two different models). Our measure is similar to another used
   previously, although, in the previous studies, the area enclosed between
   homologous contours was computed manually or it was restricted to
   particular conditions. The innovation of our approach consists of the
   automation of the entire process and in the constraint elimination. The
   main problem to solve before computing the horizontal shift measure is
   how to determine the area enclosed between homologous contours. This is
   a problem because there is no bijective correspondence between
   homologous contours, and therefore the identification of the homologous
   contours is not a trivial task. Our approach overcomes this difficulty
   by closing following the limit of the DTM the open contours (the
   contours which cut the limit of the DIM) and classifying them by the
   external level. We achieve the automation assisted by the Boolean
   polygon operations, specifically using the symmetric difference
   operation. Our algorithm facilitates the computation of accuracy of a
   DTM by comparison with another and it is applicable in such fields as
   hydrology (precision estimation of the hydrological features),
   cartographic generalization, and civil engineering. Finally we use our
   measure for estimating the planimetric discrepancy between the same
   streams derived from different DEMs (different sources and precisions).

   increasing number of broadband networks. In this scenario, users
   insistently demand innovative services for exchanging and sharing their
   own audiovisual contents. In order to meet these needs, in this paper we
   propose a system that broadcasts user-generated audiovisual contents for
   handheld devices in a mobile network based on the DVB-H broadcasting
   standard. Besides, our system offers diverse added-value services to
   these new active users, such as: (i) multi modal access (via Web or by
   client applications running locally in handheld devices) to digital
   contents, (ii) exploitation of return channels to transmit interactive
   contents that enhance the user's experience, and (iii) annotation,
   sharing and personalized distribution of audiovisual contents. To
   achieve these goals, our system adopts well-known technologies for
   broadcasting and semantic annotation of audiovisual contents, as well as
   emergent technology from the so-called Web 2.0. A prototype of our
   system has been experimentally evaluated with a group of students from
   the University of Vigo, who were enthusiastic about the personalization
   capabilities offered by our TV system for a mobile setting. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The technique of magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) has shown several
   improvements in data processing, inversion and interpretation during the
   last years. Along with these improvements, detailed innovations on
   instrumentation have been demanded to support their use. Latest
   developments in surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrumentation
   promise to fulfil these hardware requirements such as decreased dead
   time, improved digital signal detection, multi-channel capabilities and
   improved reference techniques with the second generation surface NMR
   instruments.
   In this paper, we compare data from two generations of instruments and
   assess the impact of the improvements on practical issues, i.e., the
   increased accuracy of data due to shorter dead times and new noise
   reduction approaches and the feasibility for efficient 2D measuring
   schemes. Well-known and documented test sites and synthetic
   considerations are used to evaluate these developments.
   First, the relaxation signals of different devices using the same loop
   match each other. The inversion results coincide within the range of
   data errors. Decay time estimation appears to be more stable for the new
   generation instrument.
   Second, the potential of shorter effective dead times (considering a
   relaxation of the protons during the pulse) is investigated using
   statistical analysis of synthetic data sets with different decay times
   and noise levels. The additionally measured data at early times
   significantly improve the scope and accuracy of the determined
   parameters initial amplitude and T-2{*} time and thus extend the range
   of formations to be characterized. A field example comparing an
   effective dead time of 18 ms and 45 ms is presented.
   Two different reference techniques were successfully applied for noise
   cancellation at the very noisy test site Nauen. We observed an
   equivalent signal improvement using the software-based and
   hardware-based technique. However, software noise cancellation
   approaches are easily adaptable and extendable.
   Finally, considerations are given how to efficiently carry out 2D
   surveys using multi-channel instruments. A 2D field data set using the
   GMR demonstrates that 2D surveys can already be realized in moderate
   measuring times.
   The new generation of instruments provides comparable results and
   improved capabilities that will enable surface NMR measurements to be
   applied in a wider range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{As digital networks emerge as the dominant means of distributing
   copyrighted works, the first sale doctrine is increasingly marginalized.
   To the extent the use and alienation of copies entails their
   reproduction and adaptation to new platforms, the limitations first sale
   places on the exclusive right of distribution decrease in their legal
   and market impact. This fact of the modern copyright marketplace has led
   to calls for statutory clarification of digital first sale rights.
   Acknowledging the obstacles to legislative intervention, this Ankle
   argues that courts are equipped to limit copyright exclusivity, enabling
   copy owners to make traditionally lawful uses of their copies, including
   resale through secondary markets. We argue that first sale is not simply
   an isolated limitation on the distribution right. Instead, it is a
   component of a broader principle of copyright exhaustion that emerges
   from early case law preceding the U.S. Supreme Court's foundational
   decision in Bobbs-Merrill v. Straus. This context reveals a common law
   of copyright exhaustion that embraces a set of user privileges that
   include not only alienation but renewal, repair, adaptation, and
   preservation. Despite congressional recognition of exhaustion in
   sections 109 and 117 of the Copyright Act, this Article concludes that
   courts have ample room to apply and continue to develop common law rules
   that preserve the many benefits of the first sale doctrine in the
   digital marketplace.}},

Abstract = {{We consider minimal-rate sampling schemes for infinite streams of
   delayed and weighted versions of a known pulse shape. The minimal
   sampling rate for these parametric signals is referred to as the rate of
   innovation and is equal to the number of degrees of freedom per unit
   time. Although sampling of infinite pulse streams was treated in
   previous works, either the rate of innovation was not achieved, or the
   pulse shape was limited to Diracs. In this paper we propose a
   multichannel architecture for sampling pulse streams with arbitrary
   shape, operating at the rate of innovation. Our approach is based on
   modulating the input signal with a set of properly chosen waveforms,
   followed by a bank of integrators. This architecture is motivated by
   recent work on sub-Nyquist sampling of multiband signals. We show that
   the pulse stream can be recovered from the proposed minimal-rate samples
   using standard tools taken from spectral estimation in a stable way even
   at high rates of innovation. In addition, we address practical
   implementation issues, such as reduction of hardware complexity and
   immunity to failure in the sampling channels. The resulting scheme is
   flexible and exhibits better noise robustness than previous approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Signals comprised of a stream of short pulses appear in many
   applications including bioimaging and radar. The recent finite rate of
   innovation framework, has paved the way to low rate sampling of such
   pulses by noticing that only a small number of parameters per unit time
   are needed to fully describe these signals. Unfortunately, for high
   rates of innovation, existing sampling schemes are numerically unstable.
   In this paper we propose a general sampling approach which leads to
   stable recovery even in the presence of many pulses. We begin by
   deriving a condition on the sampling kernel which allows perfect
   reconstruction of periodic streams from the minimal number of samples.
   We then design a compactly supported class of filters, satisfying this
   condition. The periodic solution is extended to finite and infinite
   streams and is shown to be numerically stable even for a large number of
   pulses. High noise robustness is also demonstrated when the delays are
   sufficiently separated. Finally, we process ultrasound imaging data
   using our techniques and show that substantial rate reduction with
   respect to traditional ultrasound sampling schemes can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the efforts devoted to the analysis of the digital divide over
   the last years, the regional evidence on this issue is still scarce.
   Within this context, the goals of this paper are twofold: (1) measuring
   the digital divide across the regions of the 27 Member States and within
   each country and (2) explaining the observed regional disparities. The
   analysis leads to identify Dutch regions as the Top-10 in ICT, while
   Greece and Bulgaria occupy the Bottom-10. Therefore, results show that
   the regional digital divide reflects to some extent the income gap.
   However, regional policy seems to be having some positive implications
   for technology adoption. In particular, the rural-versus-urban dimension
   of the digital gap appears to be less important than it is usually
   claimed to. Likewise, some evidence is found of the role of cultural and
   institutional factors in ICT adoption, an issue that has not been
   previously analyzed at the regional level. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A revision of the clinical assessment system of the University of Puerto
   Rico School of Dental Medicine was initiated in 2007, with the goal of
   achieving a system that would be fully understood and used by both
   faculty and students to improve student performance throughout the
   curriculum. The transformation process was organized according to
   Kotter's Eight-Step Change Model. Some of the initial findings in 2007
   were as follows: 87 percent of current daily clinical evaluations were
   scored at the scale's highest level, 33 percent of faculty members
   lacked knowledge of the evaluation system, and 60 percent of students
   reported that faculty members were not well calibrated. As a result of
   the transformation process, a pilot project has been implemented in the
   comprehensive clinical course for senior students. The revised
   assessment methods utilized are verbal daily feedback, clinical
   evaluations once every three months, a digital portfolio, and competency
   exams. There is also a productivity component included in the course
   grade. We conclude that adapting Kotter's model for use in the
   transformation process has been very useful; gaining support from both
   the administration and faculty has been essential; and the provision of
   continuous faculty development activities has been empowering. The
   American Dental Education Association Commission on Change and
   Innovation in Dental Education (ADEA CCI) Liaisons at the University of
   Puerto Rico School of Dental Medicine have been effective in producing a
   greater awareness among the faculty about the value of the
   competency-based curriculum and the need for change.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an analytical model that embeds empirical findings on
   software diffusion to examine optimal pricing strategies for a
   spreadsheet software product under coalescing effects of piracy and
   word-of-mouth through its entire life cycle. We find that the demand of
   the innovators has the most significant impact on the firm's pricing
   decision. Our research recommends market skimming pricing strategy if
   innovators' demand is high and the market penetration pricing strategy
   is preferred otherwise. Surprisingly, the increase of conversion rate of
   imitators to buyers never significantly alters the pricing strategy
   pre-determined by the demand of innovators. Most interestingly, the
   optimal profit from instituting a two prices policy for a software
   product with five years lifespan outperforms that from a one price
   policy by no more than 4\%, a finding that corroborates the common one
   price policy observed in reality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Is Google in its quest for search engine optimization through the
   creation of new technologies, which not only improves its search
   algorithms but also refines its search functions for users, doing it in
   a manner that makes it a perpetrator of primary copyright infringement
   or an invaluable facilitator for Internet functionality? How should the
   balance of interests in the treatment of creative works be recalibrated
   in the face of changes in search engine technology and operations, and
   the disputes that have arisen within the last decade in the context of
   the digital age and its needs? Using Google as a case study, this paper
   will look at the two main areas of dispute over the operations of
   information locator tools and services that either threatens search
   engine functionality and efficiency or weakens copyright holders'
   exclusive rights. It proposes a concerted set of solutions through a
   reassessment and amendment of copyright law to optimize the social
   benefits and objectives of both the copyright regime and technological
   innovations in the electronic model of information archiving, indexing
   and delivery. A fair distribution of responsibilities and allocation of
   rights and liabilities will be suggested. In the process, due
   consideration will be given to both public and private interests, with
   the former taking precedence; while the recommended solutions will be
   made within the currently outdated framework for Internet intermediary
   protection (i.e. safe harbor laws) and exceptions (i.e. specific
   statutory exemptions and the general fair use defense) under the
   existing copyright regime. Thus, the proposed changes will be far
   reaching without being too radical a departure from current law, an
   evolution that will likely be more acceptable and realistic a solution
   to the problem.
   This paper is published in two parts. Part One of this paper will deal
   with the challenges to the copyright regime posed by the operations and
   technology behind the Google Images Search Engine, while Part Two that
   will be published in the subsequent edition of the CLSR will assess the
   benefits of the Google Books Search Project vis-a-vis the effects it
   will have on the scope of copyright protection. Recommendations are made
   to copyright law to accommodate both functions while generally
   preserving the main objectives of copyright protection. (C) 2011 Warren

Abstract = {{The automation of the cargo clearance process has been a high-priority
   item on the agenda of the customs services of the world. Conventional
   clearance of import and export goods uses paper-based manual procedures,
   added as much as 10\% to the product cost and led to delays and time
   penalties, lost business opportunities and reduced competitiveness. The
   World Bank report said ``countries that cannot adapt quickly to the new
   e-trade paradigm will fall behind in export import competitiveness.{''}
   As an export-oriented country, Ministry of Finance of Taiwan had been
   committed to reforming and speeding up the cargo customs clearance to
   sustain the trade competitiveness. The purpose of this research is to
   explore the digital capital measures of automated cargo clearance
   business website. The content analysis and fuzzy analytic hierarchy
   process were used while collecting and analyzing the data. The research
   subject is TradeVan, a semi-government controlled web-based service
   provider. This study has identified four dimensions to measure the
   digital capital of business website that is Internet relational capital.
   Internet customer capital, Internet innovative capital, and Internet
   service capital. The research findings may be referenced for the purpose
   of the design and development of successful website applications to
   catch the revolutionary opportunities and benefits of digital economy.

Abstract = {{High performance analog (HPA) devices in high-k metal gate (HKMG) scheme
   with innovative halo engineering have been successfully demonstrated to
   produce superior analog and digital performance for low power
   applications. HPA device was processed ``freely'' with no extra mask, no
   extra litho, and no extra process step. This paper details a
   comprehensive study of the analog and digital characteristics of these
   HPA devices in comparison with analog control (conventional digital
   devices with matched geometry). Analog properties such as output voltage
   gain (also called self-gain), trans-conductance G(m), conductance G(ds),
   G(m)/I-d, mismatching (MM) behavior, flicker noise (1/f noise) and
   current linearity have clearly reflected the advantage of HPA devices
   over analog control, while DC performance (e. g., I-on-I-off,
   I-off-V-tsat, DIBL, C-jswg) and reliability (HCI) have also shown the
   comparability of HPA devices over control. (C) 2011 The Japan Society of

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of kidney TeleUltrasound
   consultation system. The TeleUltrasound system provides an innovative
   design that aids the acquisition, archiving, and dissemination of
   medical data and information over the internet as its backbone. The
   system provides data sharing to allow remote collaboration, viewing,
   consultation, and diagnosis of medical data. The design is layered upon
   a standard known as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine
   (DICOM). The DICOM standard defines protocols for exchanging medical
   images and their associated data. The TeleUltrasound system is an
   integrated solution for retrieving, processing, and archiving images and
   providing data storage management using Structured Query Language (SQL)
   database. Creating a web-based interface is an additional advantage to
   achieve global accessibility of experts that will widely open the
   opportunity of greater examination and multiple consultations. This
   system is equipped with a high level of data security and its
   performance has been tested with white, black, and gray box techniques.
   And the result was satisfactory. The overall system has been evaluated
   by several radiologists in Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Sudan,
   the result is shown within this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional face-to-face doctor-patient relationship is the core of
   conventional medical practice. One key aspect of this changing
   relationship is the increasing dependency on asynchronous data
   collection in clinical consultations. Such electronic communications and
   data streams may be numeric, text-based, audio, digitized still
   pictures, video and radiologic, as well as emanating from multiple
   medical devices. While asynchronous medicine may be established in
   specialties like radiology and dermatology, there is little research
   regarding the use of asynchronous medicine in areas of medicine that
   traditionally rely on the physical doctor-patient interaction such as
   primary care, internal medicine, geriatrics, and psychiatry. The
   practice of psychiatry stands out as a discipline that is highly
   dependent on the quality of the physical meeting between the doctor and
   the patient, yet even in this specialty it is possible to utilize
   asynchronous medicine for some types of psychiatric consultations.
   Asynchronous medicine has the potential to be significantly disruptive
   to our current healthcare processes, as well as more clinically and
   economically efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Planning information pertaining to the potential visual impacts of
   proposed construction developments is particularly important in the case
   of wind farm planning, given the high levels of concern amongst members
   of the public regarding the perceived negative visual impacts of wind
   turbines on the landscape. Previous research has highlighted the
   shortcomings associated with traditional visualization techniques used
   to assess these impacts, and also the means by which such information is
   then disseminated to the wider public during the consultation stages of
   the wind farm planning process. This research is concerned with
   examining the potential of Web-based mapping and digital landscape
   visualization techniques for addressing some of these shortcomings. This
   article reports the findings of a Web-based survey study designed to
   evaluate the potential of online GIS-based approaches for improving the
   effectiveness and dissemination of wind farm visualizations and
   enhancing public participation in the wind farm planning process.
   Results from the survey study add to the research literature by
   demonstrating how innovative Web-based approaches have real potential
   for augmenting existing methods of information provision and public
   participation in the planning process. The findings of this study are
   also potentially transferrable to other landscape planning scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Telepathology, the practice of pathology at a long distance, has
   advanced continuously since 1986. Today, fourth-generation telepathology
   systems, so-called virtual slide telepathology systems, are being used
   for education applications. Both conventional and innovative surgical
   pathology diagnostic services are being designed and implemented as
   well. We have a successful experience in Egypt in applying the static \&
   dynamic techniques in a pilot project between the Italian Hospital in
   Cairo (NPO) and the Civico Hospital in Palermo This project began in
   2003 and continued till now. In 2004, centers in Venice, London and
   Pittsburgh participated actively in our project. During the past seven
   years we consulted on many problematic pathological cases with these
   different specialized pathological centers in Italy, UK \& USA. In
   addition to the highly specialized scientific value of consulting on the
   cases and exchanging knowledge, we saved a lot of time and money and
   succeeded in providing our patients with a better medical service. In
   view of this success we have already established a new Digital
   Telepathology unit (DTU) in the pathology department, Cairo University,
   using the latest technique of telepathology which is Whole Slide Imaging
   (WSI) since one year. This unit is considered the first Digital
   pathology unit in all the universities of the whole Middle East. During
   the passed year we created a digital pathology library for the under
   graduate students using the WSI technique and changed the teaching
   method of the histopathology slides to be completely digital. We are
   building another digital pathology library (for post graduate
   candidates) which will be available to all pathology candidates in
   Egyptian universities \& universities in the surrounding Arabic
   countries. We are also creating a digital pathology network between
   pathology centers in the Middle East for exchanging knowledge \&
   telepathology.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. This paper is about the challenges of working creatively
   and reflectively in the information-intensive environments
   characteristic of our digital age.
   Method. The paper builds upon earlier work about uncertainty in library
   and information science by incorporating work exploring risk cultures
   and uncertainty as everyday phenomena. It presents arguments emerging
   from an ongoing investigation of the background work involved in
   scholarly research practice. These threads are used to invite discussion
   about the particular strategic contribution that the ISIC community
   might make in answer to calls for more creativity and greater support
   for the human spirit in all that we do.
   Analysis. Ethnographic material about scholarly research practice is
   combined with varied research exploring creativity and uncertainty.
   Results. Analysis of conditions that can stimulate creativity suggests
   that working through and being in uncertainty provides a site of
   creativity stimulation that addresses Howkins's query about how and
   where we wish to do our thinking.
   Conclusions. As information researchers and practitioners, we can act as
   stewards within our communities and help shape the information services
   and infrastructures that support organisations and communities striving
   to be more creative and to engage with information in inventive ways.
   Doing so will require us to not only support the creativity and
   innovation of others, but to be creative and innovative ourselves.}},

   encompasses, but is not limited to, the creation, maintenance,

   offers opportunities for experimentation and innovation that should have
   an impact on the ability of practitioners to interact with users and on
   the ways that users can become involved with and integrated into the

Abstract = {{Advances in remote-sensing technology have led to its increased use for
   posthurricane disaster response and assessment; however, the use of the
   technology is underutilized in the recovery phase of the disaster
   management cycle. This study illustrates an example of a postdisaster
   recovery assessment by detecting coastal land cover, elevation, and
   volume changes using 3 years of post-Katrina hyperspectral and light
   detection and ranging data collected along the south shore of Lake
   Pontchartrain, Louisiana. Digital elevation models and basic land-cover
   classifications were generated for a 34-km(2) study area for 2005, 2006,
   and 2007. A change detection method was used to assess postdisaster
   land-cover, elevation, and volume changes. Results showed that the
   vegetation classes had area increases, whereas bare ground/roads and
   structures classes had area decreases. Overall estimated volume changes
   included a net volume decrease of 1.6 x 10(6) m(3) in 2005 to 2006 and a
   net volume decrease of 2.1 x 10(6) m(3) in 2006 to 2007 within the study
   area. More specifically, low vegetation and bare ground/roads classes
   had net volume increases, whereas medium and tall vegetation and
   structures classes had net volume decreases. These changes in land
   cover, elevation, and volume illustrate some of the major physical
   impacts of the disaster and ensuing recovery. This study demonstrates an
   innovative image fusion approach to assess physical changes and
   postdisaster recovery in a residential, coastal environment.}},

Title = {{` ... Our Fate as a Living Corpse ... ` An Interview with Boris Groys}},
Journal = {{THEORY CULTURE \& SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{69-93}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this interview, Boris Groys discusses his key cultural-theoretical
   ideas, positions his thought in relation to debates on the cultural
   economy and clarifies questions emerging from his work. The conversation
   focuses on his untranslated cultural-theoretical contributions, notably
   Uber das Neue {[}On the New] and Topologie der Kunst {[}Topology of
   Art], but also touches on his writings available in English, for example
   Art Power. The interview contains three sections. The first revisits
   Groys's challenge to the postmodern claim about the end of cultural
   innovation. He problematizes this claim with reference to the current
   rise of digital archives and the loss of individual and collective
   memory. Groys goes on to elucidate the centrality of the ready-made
   method to cultural innovation. Cultural activity, he argues, constitutes
   a ritual which promises immortality in a world of perpetual change.
   Finally, Groys clarifies and illustrates the questions guiding his
   phenomenological investigation of the `scene of evidence' and the `mode
   of suspicion'. The second section is dedicated to the topology of
   culture in 21st-century capitalism. Groys sets out from his observation
   of the privatization and fragmentation of archival space. Humanity is
   entering a `new virtual Middle Age', where individuals are engaged in a
   series of self-installations, travelling through a string of
   heterogeneous valorizing spaces (e.g. personal websites). The `chance'
   of genuine art in these conditions lies in its withdrawal from exchange.
   As inexchangeable `commodity corpses' demanding eternal preservation,
   artworks can provocatively indicate the possibility of a `life after
   capitalism'. His considerations also lead Groys to discuss his notion of
   Soviet Communism as an installation in pursuit of the wish to `step out
   of time'. The third section centres on the problems of politics and
   critique. Responding to a question about the political potential of art,
   Groys proposes consideration of the increasing intensity - presently
   illustrated by the conflict in the Middle East - with which politics
   acts in the realm of aesthetics. The interview closes with reflections
   on the possibility of intellectual resistance. Referring to Nietzsche
   and Adorno, Groys locates the potential of opposition in a resentful
   critique of time: a `rejection of everything' and the insistence upon
   the possibility that what is will vanish.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne LiDAR, also referred to as Airborne Laser Scanning, is widely
   used for high-resolution topographic data acquisition with sub-meter
   planimetric and vertical accuracy. This contribution gives a review of
   recent developments of LiDAR systems (e.g. full-waveform LiDAR) and
   advances in data processing and analysis for geomorphological
   applications. An overview of applications in geomorphology and related
   fields using different LiDAR data products (e.g. Digital Terrain Model
   and 3D point cloud) is given, indicating a great variety of fields of
   applications and data analysis approaches. These applications range from
   visual interpretation. of LiDAR derivatives (e.g. shaded relief map) to
   semi-automatic geomorphological mapping and fully automatic object
   detection (e.g. surface discontinuities). A quantitative analysis of the
   temporal trend of peer-reviewed journal publications confirms the
   increased consideration of airborne LiDAR data for mapping, modeling and
   exploiting Earth surface processes and landforms. Almost 50 \% of the
   papers of the last 15 years were published in the last two years 2008
   and 2009. Airborne LiDAR technology is developing rapidly leading to
   both a great opportunity and challenge for integrating new technological
   developments into existing workflows and stimulating new innovative
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Currently there is a very fundamental change happening in spectrum
   regulation, possibly the most fundamental ever in its history. This is
   the enabling of spectrum sharing, where primary (licensed) users of the
   spectrum, are forced to allow sharing with secondary users, who use
   license-exempt equipment. Such sharing is free for the secondary users,
   subject to the condition that they do not cause harmful interference to
   the primary users. The first instance of such sharing is occurring with
   the UHF digital TV spectrum, in what is commonly called TV white space.
   Regulators such as the FCC in the United States and Ofcom in the United
   Kingdom have indicated that other spectrum will follow suit. Cognitive
   radio is an enabling technology that allows such sharing. Following
   recent rulings by FCC and Ofcom and the emergence of a series of related
   industry standards, CR operation in TVWS is moving from the research
   domain towards implementation and commercialization, with use-cases that
   are of interest to telecom operators. In this article we describe three
   such use cases: future home networks, coverage of the street from inside
   buildings, and broadband access to rural and underserved premises. We
   present results of modeling and trials of technical feasibility,
   undertaken by the Innovate and Design team at BT. Based on our
   experience we draw conclusions regarding the feasibility and commercial
   importance of these use cases, and identify some of the remaining
   technical and commercial challenges.}},

Abstract = {{The field of convergence technology may be defined as an area of
   technologic innovation in which multiple devices or functionalities are
   combined within a single platform in a way that adds functional,
   operational or economic synergies. Within the field of medical devices,
   this concept embodies many different types of novel combinations
   representing syntheses of therapeutic, diagnostic and digital
   information technologies. In the current era of healthcare reform, such
   combinatorial technologies will be pressed to demonstrate improvements
   in comparative effectiveness compared with the use of separate
   independent components. Moreover, the new more stringent regulatory
   environment will require much greater levels of pre- and post-market
   safety reviews conducted under the auspices and authority of the US FDA
   Office of Combination Products. This branch of the FDA scrutinizes
   submissions and divides them into drugs, devices and biological products
   and includes many submissions previously regulated by disparate centers,
   such as the Center for Devices and Radiologic Health and the Center for
   Drug Evaluation and Research. The field of convergence technologies
   already amounts to a worldwide market extending to tens of billions of
   dollars and this article will attempt to summarize some of the key
   elements of this continued push for added value and more personalized
   medicine.}},

Abstract = {{At the present tme, the information and communication technologies (ICT)
   are an ntegral part of the everyday life of societies, and therefore it
   is necessary that they are given greater importance within the school
   context. This work establishes the following goals: getting to know the
   training received in this area by math high school teachers in Portugal,
   identifying the main digital resouces used by them, and discovering the
   benefits and limitations attributed to the use of ICTs. The study is
   located in a qualitative perspective, using the technique of interviews,
   with the participation of eighteen teachers. The main findings show that
   the teachers make very little use of digital resources. While
   recognizing the benefits of integrating ICTs into the teaching and
   learning of mathematics in terms of communication, graphical
   representation, gathering of information, development of calculus and
   motivation, they point out the following limitations, time constraints,
   lack of equipment and/or technical support, the difficulty of managing
   students on the Internet and the fact that they do not have had enough
   training.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative implementation of the wavelet packet
   transform (WPT) using Butterworth passive (BP) filters for differential
   protection of power transformers. The proposed implementation is based
   on designing cascaded stages of high-pass third-order Butterworth
   filters with cutoff frequencies identical to the cutoff frequencies of
   WPT-associated digital quadrature mirror filters. These high-pass
   filters (HPFs) are designed to extract the second-level high-frequency
   components present in three-phase differential currents. Extraction of
   these frequency components is required in order to detect and classify
   transients in three-phase power transformers. The output of the designed
   Butterworth HPFs is utilized to initiate a trip signal in case of
   internal-fault currents. The third-order Butterworth HPFs are designed
   to simplify their practical implementation as well as their integration
   with the differential protective relay for the tested power transformer.
   Different magnetizing inrush, through-fault, and internal-fault currents
   are investigated for different loading conditions. Performances of the
   proposed BP-filter-based differential relay are compared with those of
   the digital WPT-based relay. Comparison results show that the
   Butterworth filter WPT-based differential relay is able to provide a
   low-cost, good diagnosis, and fast responses to internal-fault currents.}},

Abstract = {{The role of chief information officer (CIO) is riddled with ambiguity.
   To better understand the role, together with the causes and consequences
   of the ambiguity, we conducted interviews with CIOs, CxOs, recruiters,
   and industry analysts. Our findings indicate that this ambiguity is
   rooted in the fact that there are five distinct CIO roles: Utility IT
   Director, Evangelist CIO, Innovator CIO, Facilitator CIO, and Agility IT
   Director/CIO. The appropriate role for a particular organization at a
   point in time is determined by the criticality of information and
   technology for competitive differentiation and the maturity of its
   information leadership capabilities. Both are strongly influenced by the
   digital literacy of the CxO team. Moreover, our research suggests that
   in some organizations, the CIO roles follow a clear evolutionary path as
   some responsibilities that CIOs have assumed migrate away from the CIO
   and become embedded in CxO roles. We highlight the implications of this
   shift and provide specific recommendations for CIOs, CEOs, and CxOs as
   they seek to clarify the role of CIO so that they can optimize the value
   they generate from IT investments.}},

Abstract = {{Although podcasting has been a well used resource format in the last few
   years as a way of improving the student learning experience, the
   inclusion of enhanced audiovisual formats such as screencasts has been
   less used, despite the advantage that they work well for both visual and
   auditory learners. This study examines the use of and student reaction
   to a set of screencasts introduced to accompany embryology lectures
   within a second year module at Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Five
   mini-lecture screencasts and one review quiz screencast were produced as
   digital recordings of computer screen output with audio narration and
   released to students via the managed learning environment (MLE).
   Analysis of server log information from the MLE showed that the
   screencasts were accessed by many of the students in the cohort,
   although the exact numbers were variable depending on the screencast.
   Students accessed screencasts at different times of the day and over the
   whole of the access period, although maximum downloads were predictably
   recorded leading up to the written examination. Quantitative and
   qualitative feedback demonstrated that most students viewed the
   screencasts favorably in terms of usefulness to their learning, and
   end-of-module written examination scores suggest that the screencasts
   may have had a positive effect on student outcome when compared with
   previous student attainment. Overall, the development of a series of
   embryology screencasts to accompany embryology lecture sessions appears
   to be a useful addition to learning for most students and not simply an
   innovation that checks the box of ``technology engagement.'' Anat Sci

Abstract = {{Histology is one of the main subjects in introductory college-level
   Human Anatomy and Physiology classes. Institutions are moving toward the
   replacement of traditional microscope-based histology learning with
   virtual microscopy learning amid concerns of losing the valuable
   learning experience of traditional microscopy. This study used live
   digital imaging (LDI) of microscopic slides on a SMART board to enhance
   Histology laboratory teaching. The interactive LDI system consists of a
   digital camera-equipped microscope that projects live images on a
   wall-mounted SMART board via a computer. This set-up allows real-time
   illustration of microscopic slides with highlighted key structural
   components, as well as the ability to provide the students with relevant
   study and review material. The impact of interactive LDI on student
   learning of Histology was then measured based on performance in
   subsequent laboratory tests before and after its implementation. Student
   grades increased from a mean of 76\% (70.3-82.0, 95\% CI) before to 92\%
   (88.8-95.3, 95\% CI) after integration of LDI indicating highly
   significant (P < 0.001) enhancement in students' Histology laboratory
   performance. In addition, student ratings of the impact of the
   interactive LDI on their Histology learning were strongly positive,
   suggesting that a majority of students who valued this learning approach
   also improved learning and understanding of the material as a result.
   The interactive LDI technique is an innovative, highly efficient and
   affordable tool to enhance student Histology learning, which is likely
   to expand knowledge and student perception of the subject and in turn
   enrich future science careers. Anat Sci Educ 4:78-83. (C) 2011 American

Abstract = {{In most medical schools, summative practical examination in Anatomy
   usually takes the format of a ``steeplechase'' ({''}spotters'' or ``bell
   ringers'') conducted in the gross anatomy laboratory using cadaveric
   material and prosected specimens. Recently, we have started to
   administer similar examinations online using the quiz facility in WebCT
   (TM) and Moodle (TM). This article chronicles how we conceived and
   developed this method within the peculiar nature of our medical school
   setting. Over a five year period, practical summative examinations were
   organized as ``steeplechase'' online. The online examinations were
   administered using WebCT (TM) and later Moodle (TM) learning management
   software. Assessment ``objects'' were created from the materials
   available for anatomy teaching. These were digital images of cadaveric
   materials, radiological, and prosected specimens. In addition, short
   video clips of 30 seconds duration demonstrating muscle action were
   produced. These objects were optimized for online viewing and then
   uploaded onto the learning management software. A bank of questions
   (multiple choice or short answer type) was then created and linked to
   the assessment objects. These were used in place of the steeplechase in
   the computer laboratory. This method serves a crucial purpose in places
   like ours where continuous availability of human cadavers is impossible.
   Although time consuming initially, once questions are setup online,
   future retrieval, and administration becomes convenient especially where
   there are large batches of students. In addition, the online environment
   offers distinct advantages with regards to image quality, psychometric
   analysis of the examination and reduction of staff preparation time
   compared to traditional ``steeplechase.'' Anat Sci Educ 4:115-118. (C)

Abstract = {{There has been a considerable increase in the needs for implementation
   of multimedia representation technology into the museum field to develop
   online exhibitions and enhance museum educational functions. China
   Digital Science and Technology Museum (CDSTM) is such an emerging effort
   in this field. The purpose of CDSTM is to provide solutions to issues of
   unbalanced museum distribution, exhibition space limitation in China and
   seeking more ways to offer diverse and multimedia-rich exhibitions. This
   paper addresses the application of incorporating innovative and rapid
   digital technology in digital science and technology oriented museum
   development in China. Three modes of online exhibitions have been
   developed to emphasize user experiences through extensive application of
   animation and virtual reality technologies. CDSTM's e-learning
   functionality in promotion of scientific literacy in the public and
   enhancement of formal school science curriculum is also discussed. In
   addition, evaluation on users' expectation and satisfaction is conducted
   to identify perception based on questionnaire and web logs. The
   feedbacks indicate that CDSTM has positive impacts on mitigating
   traditional science and technology museum challenges, and has the
   potential to promote science education and science literacy in public as
   well. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Some authors question the existence of public television companies in
   the new environment of digitalization, Internet proliferation, growing
   competition and audience segmentation. However, others believe they
   should act as a driving force in the process of convergence and even
   that the new media present an opportunity to redefine the public
   broadcasting service (PBS) remit. The current challenge for the public
   media companies is to deliver their content through the maximum number
   of devices, not only via television sets but also broadband and mobile
   devices. Over the years, the BBC has adapted to new market situations
   and has implemented solutions that have been adopted by other public and
   private broadcasters around the world. The objective of this article is
   to show how the BBC has taken up the leadership of transforming public
   TV companies into online services in order to maintain market share; and
   how it has influenced Spain's public TV broadcaster, RTVE. The
   methodology is based on internal and external documents of both
   corporations, and the findings are complemented by interviews with
   online service managers at RTVE. We conclude that these public companies
   have adapted their activities to the new technologies and have developed
   interactive services to reinforce their public service mission.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Recent advances in endoscope design have placed the
   charged coupled device chip on the tip of the endoscope. The image is
   instantly digitalized and converted into an electrical signal for
   transmission. Digital technology was first introduced into flexible
   cystoscopes/nephroscopes and subsequently into rigid and flexible
   ureteroscopes. Herein, we assess the image characteristics and
   advantages of a new generation of digital flexible ureteroscopes.
   Methods: The Olympus URF-V flexible digital ureteroscope and the Olympus
   URF-P3 fiberoptic ureteroscope were assessed in vitro for image
   resolution, distortion, color representation, grayscale imaging, field
   of view, and depth of field.
   Results: The digital ureteroscope had a higher resolution at 3, 5, 10,
   and 20mm (25.2 lines/mm vs. 8.0, 14.1 vs. 5.0, 6.3 vs. 2.8, and 3.2 vs.
   1.3), respectively. Distortion with the digital flexible ureteroscope
   was lower, though not statistically significant. Color representation
   was better with the digital ureteroscope, whereas contrast evaluation
   was comparable between both scopes. The digital flexlible ureteroscope
   produced a 5.3 times larger image size compared with the standard
   fiberoptic flexible uretersocpe with a narrower field of view. The depth
   of field was limited by light and not the optic or the camera for both
   ureteroscopes.
   Conclusions: The development of digital flexible ureteroscopes
   represents a significant technological advance in urology. These devices
   offer significantly improved resolution and color reproduction as
   compared with traditional fiberoptic flexible ureteroscopes. Future
   clinical trials are warranted to ultimately determine the advantages of
   these innovative endoscopes.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews the design and operation of both flat-panel
   detector (FPD) and image intensifier fluoroscopy systems. The different
   components of each imaging chain and their functions are explained and
   compared. FPD systems have multiple advantages such as a smaller size,
   extended dynamic range, no spatial distortion, and greater stability.
   However, FPD systems typically have the same spatial resolution for all
   fields of view (FOVs) and are prone to ghosting. Image intensifier
   systems have better spatial resolution with the use of smaller FOVs
   (magnification modes) and tend to be less expensive. However, the
   spatial resolution of image intensifier systems is limited by the
   television system to which they are coupled. Moreover, image intensifier
   systems are degraded by glare, vignetting, spatial distortions, and
   defocusing effects. FPD systems do not have these problems. Some recent
   innovations to fluoroscopy systems include automated filtration, pulsed
   fluoroscopy, automatic positioning, dose-area product meters, and
   improved automatic dose rate control programs. Operator-selectable
   features may affect both the patient radiation dose and image quality;
   these selectable features include dose level setting, the FOV employed,
   fluoroscopic pulse rates, geometric factors, display software settings,
   and methods to reduce the imaging time. (C) RSNA,

Abstract = {{Objective: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic, and
   often disabling disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been
   shown to be effective in alleviating IBS symptoms. The aim of this study
   was to establish the feasibility and the efficacy of a
   cognitive-behavioral e-intervention using personal digital assistants
   (PDAs) on the self-management of IBS patients. Methods: A feasibility
   trial was conducted with 38 control group patients receiving standard
   care and 37 intervention group patients receiving standard care
   supplemented with a 4-week CBT intervention on PDAs. All patients
   fulfilled the diagnostic Rome III criteria for IBS. At baseline, 4-week,
   and 3-month follow-up, patients' abdominal pain, dysfunctional
   cognitions, IBS quality of life, and pain catastrophizing thoughts were
   assessed using written questionnaires. Results: Between-group
   comparisons between baseline and 4 weeks showed more overall quality of
   life improvement, more improvement in catastrophizing thoughts, and more
   pain improvement in the intervention group. Only improvement in
   catastrophizing thoughts persisted in the long-term. No significant
   differences between groups were found for dysfunctional cognitions. As
   all 37 intervention group patients completed the intervention and
   completed diaries three times a day for 4 weeks, the e-health
   intervention seems feasible. Conclusions: A cognitive-behavioral
   intervention on pocket-type computers appears feasible and efficacious
   for improving IBS-related complaints and cognitions in the short-term.
   The intervention group improved on several aspects, but most on
   catastrophizing thoughts, and these improvements even persisted after 3
   months. Future studies should focus on unravelling the effective
   components of this innovative e-health intervention. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In order to develop a low-power and high-performance SoC platform for
   multimedia applications, the Parallel Architecture Core (PAC) project
   was initiated in Taiwan in 2003. A VLIW digital signal processor
   (PACDSP) has been developed from a proprietary instruction set with
   multimedia-rich instructions, a complexity-effective microarchitecture
   with an innovative distributed \& ping-pong register organization and
   variable-length VLIW encoding, to a highly-configurable soft IP with
   several successful silicon implementations. A complete toolchain with an
   optimizing C compiler has also been developed for PACDSP. A dual-core
   PAC SoC has been designed and fabricated, which consists of a PACDSP
   core, an ARM9 core, scratchpad memories, and various on-chip
   peripherals, to demonstrate the outstanding performance and energy
   efficiency for multimedia processing such as the real-time H.264 codec.
   The first part of the two introductory papers of PAC describes the
   hardware architecture of the PACDSP core, its software development
   tools, and the PAC SoC with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling
   (DVFS).}},

Abstract = {{Virtual microscopy of histological glass slides can emulate conventional
   light microscopy. Up till now, such a digital simulation does not exist
   for ultrathin electron microscopic slides. Because of the relative
   inaccessibility of electron microscopy, evaluation of subcellular
   structures by (bio)medical students is performed with the aid of
   photographic prints. In this article, the generation and evaluation of
   virtual electron microscopic slides is discussed. A T-lymphoblastic cell
   was used as an example. Electron microscopic pictures were taken at two
   magnifications (25,000 and 50,000), processed in an analogue or digital
   way and stitched to reconstruct the image of the total cell. This image
   is viewed with a webviewer equipped with pan and zoom functions. The
   possibility of distinguishing the trilaminar structure of cellular
   membranes was the requisite. Virtual images obtained at an original
   magnification of 25,000, scanned at a resolution of 800 ppi could
   compete with pictures developed directly from negatives obtained by
   electron microscopy. It is possible to navigate and zoom into details in
   a way emulating electron microscopy. Virtual electron microscopy is
   innovative and offers new perspectives to interpret cytological pictures
   and to teach cell biology in an interactive and unique way. Microsc.

Abstract = {{Aerial photogrammetric surveys are usually expensive and the resolution
   of the acquired images is often limited. For this reason, different
   innovative systems have been developed and tested in order to perform a
   photogrammetric survey in an inexpensive way, with high-resolution
   images. In this context, one of the most promising acquisition
   techniques is represented by the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
   equipped with a digital camera.
   The paper deals with the acquisition and processing of low-height aerial
   imagery acquired by UAVs and Remote Piloted Vehicles (RPVs), in order to
   provide large-scale mapping to support archaeological studies: the pros
   and cons of these acquisition platforms are presented and discussed.
   These systems carry out flights that are usually very different from the
   manned systems as their dimensions and their light weights never allow
   the set course to be flown; for this reason, the acquired images are
   often affected by large rotations and small overlaps. Therefore, an ad
   hoc procedure has been implemented to overcome these limits. In this
   work, two remote-controlled systems (a mini-helicopter and a mini
   fixed-wing plane) were tested over two different archaeological sites in
   order to provide Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and large-scale maps
   (numeric maps and orthophotos). Finally, an accuracy evaluation of the
   final products is reported. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Waste collection and transportation is the contact point between waste
   generators and waste management systems. A proposal for an innovative
   model for the collection and transportation of municipal solid waste
   (MSW) which is a part of a solid waste management system using a spatial
   geo database, integrated in a geographical information system (GIS)
   environment is presented. Pallavapuram is a fast-developing municipality
   of Chennai city in the southern suburbs about 20 km from Chennai, the
   state capital of Tamil Nadu in India. The disposal of MSW was previously
   occurring in an indiscriminate and irrational manner in the
   municipality. Hence in the present study an attempt was made to develop
   an engineered design of solid waste collection using GIS with a vehicle
   tracking system and final disposal by composting with investment costs.
   The GIS was used to analyse existing maps and data, to digitize the
   existing ward boundaries and to enter data about the wards and disposal
   sites. The proposed GIS model for solid waste disposal would give
   information on the planning of bins, vehicles and the optimal route. In
   the case of disposal, composting would be a successful strategy to
   accelerate the decomposition and stabilization of the biodegradable
   components of waste in MSW.}},

Abstract = {{Retinal fundus images acquired with nonmydriatic digital fundus cameras
   are versatile tools for the diagnosis of various retinal diseases.
   Because of the ease of use of newer camera models and their relatively
   low cost, these cameras can be employed by operators with limited
   training for telemedicine or point-of-care (PoC) applications. We
   propose a novel technique that uses uncalibrated multiple-view fundus
   images to analyze the swelling of the macula. This innovation enables
   the detection and quantitative measurement of swollen areas by remote
   ophthalmologists. This capability is not available with a single image
   and prone to error with stereo fundus cameras. We also present automatic
   algorithms to measure features from the reconstructed image, which are
   useful in PoC automated diagnosis of early macular edema, e.g., before
   the appearance of exudation. The technique presented is divided into
   three parts: first, a preprocessing technique simultaneously enhances
   the dark microstructures of the macula and equalizes the image; second,
   all available views are registered using nonmorphological sparse
   features; finally, a dense pyramidal optical flow is calculated for all
   the images and statistically combined to build a naive height map of the
   macula. Results are presented on three sets of synthetic images and two
   sets of real-world images. These preliminary tests show the ability to
   infer a minimum swelling of 300 mu m and to correlate the reconstruction
   with the swollen location.}},

Abstract = {{The placement of the analog-to-digital converter as near the antenna as
   possible is a key issue in the software-defined radio receiver design.
   Direct sampling of the incoming filtered signal is a compact solution
   enabling channel simultaneity. In this brief, in the context of evenly
   spaced equal-bandwidth multiband systems, sufficient conditions for the
   channel allocation assuring that the minimum sub-Nyquist sampling
   frequency does not imply aliasing are provided. Subsequently, as a
   validation example, the design of a minimum-sampling-frequency
   acquisition system for quad-band applications within a ultrawideband
   frequency range is shown. Moreover, an innovative solution for its
   radio-frequency front end, basically consisting of a signal-interference
   multiband bandpass filter, is reported. Experimental results of the
   built microstrip-filter prototype for the proposed 1-3-GHz-range
   quad-band system are also given.}},

   observations over the period 1961-1990, for 74 industries at the
   four-digit s.i.c. level. I estimate Cobb-Douglas production functions
   and Solow residuals for each industry and then use these estimates to
   further analyze the determinates of industrial concentration and
   innovation. The industries having great capital intensity and small
   employment of labor tend to be more concentrated. Cross-section
   estimates reveal a U-shaped mapping from concentration to innovation.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to enhance conventional wound
   assessment and documentation of clinicians by incorporating the use of
   digital imaging into the medical record using standardized photography
   requirements.
   DESIGN: A review of current literature, existing clinician practice, and
   identification of barriers preceded the development and implementation
   of a clinical practice guideline, with a performance checklist, aimed at
   improving the wound photography (WP) process. In addition, establishing
   standards of practice and behavior modification were used to improve
   clinician proficiency in digital photography.
   SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Wound clinicians providing specialty care
   within the acute care setting.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Following educational sessions, evaluation of
   clinician competence in using equipment and adherence to standard
   digital imaging protocols with the use of a performance checklist
   permitted educators to validate clinician skill.
   MAIN RESULTS: Establishing consistency in digital imaging results is an
   overall enhancement of the WP process by increasing clinician
   satisfaction and efficiency, improving assessment skills, and enriching
   documentation. Competency strengthens one's skill set and serves to
   create a common language, leading to improved communication among
   clinicians and resulting in enhanced wound assessment.
   CONCLUSION: WP plays a valuable role in delivering effective patient
   care by strengthening wound assessments and documentation. Recognizing
   the need for consistent standards, clinical educators from Lehigh Valley
   Health Network designed an educational program using a multifaceted
   approach, including clinical practice guideline development, education,
   and competency assessment. Enmeshing current practices, expert opinion,
   and clinician knowledge resulted in an innovative process using
   interdependent, yet independent, components to achieve enhanced wound
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes how a school of nursing implemented an innovative
   program to introduce personal digital assistants to undergraduate and
   graduate nursing students. Undergraduate students studying pharmacology
   and nurse practitioner graduate students in an adult health course were
   asked to purchase a personal digital assistant privately or through the
   university bookstore. Faculty selected an appropriate software package.
   After students were oriented to the hardware and software package,
   innovative teaching strategies were implemented to help guide students
   to use their mobile devices to access clinically relevant information.
   Student feedback about this experience was positive. The most important
   elements for successful adoption of personal digital assistants are to
   provide training for both faculty and students, and to develop learning
   opportunities using the technology. Use of mobile technologies is an
   important competency that will improve the quality of nursing practice
   and therefore should be included in nursing curricula.}},

Abstract = {{Large, data-rich organizations have tremendously large collections of
   digital objects to be ``repurposed,{''} to respond quickly and
   economically to publishing, marketing, and information needs. Some

   other technique such as OWL and RDF, will automatically address the
   workflow and technical issues associated with this reuse. Four case
   studies show that the sources of some roadblocks to agile repurposing
   are as much managerial and organizational as they are technical in
   nature. The review concludes with suggestions on how digital object
   repurposing can be integrated given these organizations' structures.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative methodology to perform avalanche hazard mapping over large
   undocumented areas is herewith presented and discussed. The method
   combines GIS tools, computational routines, and statistical analysis in
   order to provide a ``semi-automatic{''} definition of areas potentially
   affected by avalanche release and motion. The method includes two main
   modules. The first module is used to define zones of potential avalanche
   release, based on the consolidated relations on slope, morphology, and
   vegetation. For each of the identified zones of potential release, a
   second module, named Avalanche Flow and Run-out Algorithm (AFRA),
   provides an automatic definition of the areas potentially affected by
   avalanche motion and run-out. The definition is generated by a
   specifically implemented ``flow-routing algorithm{''} which allows for
   the determination of flow behaviour in the track and in the run-out
   zone. In order to estimate the avalanche outline in the run-out zone,
   AFRA uses a ``run-out cone{''}, which is a 3D projection of the angle of
   reach alpha. The alpha-value is evaluated by statistical analysis of
   historical data regarding extreme avalanches. Pre- and post-processing
   of the AFRA input/output data is done in an open source GIS environment
   (GRASS GIS). The method requires only a digital terrain model and an
   indication of the areas covered by forest as input parameters. The
   procedure, which allows rapid mapping of large areas, does not in
   principle require any site-specific historical information. Furthermore,
   it has proven to be effective in all cases where a preliminary
   cost-efficient analysis of the territories potentially affected by snow
   avalanche was needed.}},

Abstract = {{The use of skinfold thickness measurements to evaluate the distribution
   of subcutaneous adipose tissue and to predict body fat has recognised
   advantages. However, the different types of skinfold calliper available
   present limitations that make them unattractive and perhaps less used in
   daily practice. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
   accuracy and functionality of a new digital skinfold system, the
   Liposoft 2008 + Adipsmeter V0 (LA), for measuring skinfold thickness and
   determining body fat proportion (\%BF). Skinfold thickness measurements
   made by the LA were compared with those obtained with a Harpenden (H)
   calliper from two samples of adults (n 45) and older adults (n 56) in a
   university-based cross-sectional study. A comparison was also conducted
   between estimated \%BF from skinfolds and dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry. Bland and Altman plots show that skinfolds measured by
   the LA and H calliper are in high agreement, with a mean difference of
   0.3 (95\% CI -3.1, 3.4) mm. In regard to the \%BF estimated from LA and
   H skinfolds measurement, the LA produced a similar approximation to
   dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry \%BF, with a mean difference of 0.2
   (95\% CI -0.8, 1.2) \%, compared with \%BF obtained with the H calliper.
   The LA system is an accurate instrumentation and represents an
   innovation in the evaluation of skinfold thickness and body composition
   based on anthropometric measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Low-power design is an important research in recent years. A huge amount
   of papers in the open literature until now were proposed to deal with
   various low-power issues, including technology innovation, circuit/logic
   design techniques, algorithm realization, and architecture/system
   selection. Due to the high-energy electron effect and reliability
   consideration, it is necessary to further reduce the supply voltage of
   integrated circuit in CMOS sub-micro technologies. However, it is hard
   to get a whole view for various low-power low-voltage techniques in a
   short time. In this paper, the motivations and challenges of CMOS
   low-voltage low-power circuit are addressed. Various design
   methodologies are surveyed and summarized in whole. The paper attempts
   to quickly give readers a full-view conception in low-voltage low-power
   CMOS system design.}},

Abstract = {{With the widespread use of digital cameras, freehand wound imaging has
   become common practice in clinical settings. There is however still a
   demand for a practical tool for accurate wound healing assessment,
   combining dimensional measurements and tissue classification in a single
   user-friendly system. We achieved the first part of this objective by
   computing a 3-D model for wound measurements using uncalibrated vision
   techniques. We focus here on tissue classification from color and
   texture region descriptors computed after unsupervised segmentation. Due
   to perspective distortions, uncontrolled lighting conditions and view
   points, wound assessments vary significantly between patient
   examinations. The main contribution of this paper is to overcome this
   drawback with a multiview strategy for tissue classification, relying on
   a 3-D model onto which tissue labels are mapped and classification
   results merged. The experimental classification tests demonstrate that
   enhanced repeatability and robustness are obtained and that metric
   assessment is achieved through real area and volume measurements and
   wound outline extraction. This innovative tool is intended for use not
   only in therapeutic follow-up in hospitals but also for telemedicine
   purposes and clinical research, where repeatability and accuracy of
   wound assessment are critical.}},

Abstract = {{In time-domain or pulse-modulation (PM) imaging, the incident light
   intensity is not encoded in amounts of charge, voltage, or current as it
   is in conventional image sensors. Instead, the image data are
   represented by the timing of pulses or pulse edges. This method of
   visual information encoding optimizes the phototransduction individually
   for each pixel by abstaining from imposing a fixed integration time for
   the entire array. Exceptionally high dynamic range (DR) and improved
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are immediate benefits of this approach. In
   particular, DR is no longer limited by the power-supply rails as in
   conventional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
   complementary metal-oxide semiconductor active pixel sensors, thus
   providing relative immunity to the supply-voltage scaling of modern CMOS
   technologies. In addition, PM imaging naturally supports pixel-parallel
   analog-to-digital conversion, thereby enabling high temporal
   resolution/frame rates or an asynchronous event-based array readout. The
   applications of PM imaging in emerging areas, such as sensor network,
   wireless endoscopy, retinal prosthesis, polarization imaging, and energy
   harvesting are surveyed to demonstrate the effectiveness of PM imaging
   in low-power, high-performance machine vision, and biomedical
   applications of the future. The evolving design innovations made in PM
   imaging, such as high-speed arbitration circuits and ultra-compact
   processing elements, are expected to have even wider impacts in
   disciplines beyond CMOS image sensors. This paper thoroughly reviews and
   classifies all common PM image sensor architectures. Analytical models
   and a universal figure of merit-image quality and dynamic range to
   energy complexity factor are proposed to quantitatively assess different
   PM imagers across the entire spectrum of PM architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Constipation is a common ailment with multiple symptoms and diverse
   etiology. Understanding the pathophysiology is important to guide
   optimal management. During the past few years, there have been
   remarkable developments in the diagnosis of constipation and defecation
   disorders. Several innovative manometric, neurophysiologic, and
   radiologic techniques have been discovered, which have improved the
   accuracy of identifying the neuromuscular mechanisms of chronic
   constipation. These include use of digital rectal examination, Bristol
   stool scale, colonic scintigraphy, wireless motility capsule for
   assessment of colonic and whole gut transit, high resolution anorectal
   manometry, and colonic manometry. These tests provide a better
   definition of the underlying mechanism(s), which in turn can lead to
   improved management of this condition. In this review, we summarize the
   recent advances in diagnostic testing with a particular emphasis on when
   and why to test, and discuss the utility of diagnostic tests for chronic
   constipation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
