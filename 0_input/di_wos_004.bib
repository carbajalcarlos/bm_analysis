Abstract = {{Far from the early twentieth century, film and television animation has
   been born a hundred years, from the advent of China's first cartoon has
   more than 80 years ago. In this century, film and television animation
   has gone from the prototype to a more mature process, as an independent
   art increasingly accepted by people. The rapid development of commercial
   promotion of the diversity of film and television animation art on the
   shape and innovation in film and television animation art continues to
   mature at the same time and the importance of this element art style is
   increasingly valued by people. Modern era media changes so that the
   human mode of transmission has undergone tremendous changes in human
   culture spread from traditional newspapers and magazines, radio and
   television to the Internet-based technology, 3G mobile communications
   computer digital technology, mobile phones, digital TV, mobile media and
   other new means of communication. New media and traditional media
   collision combined the traditional artistic creation and spread has
   undergone tremendous changes, the aesthetic is also produced
   corresponding changes occur aesthetic features such as a virtual,
   interactive, nonlinear, fragmented, and so on. Animation Art, for
   example, the traditional art of animation and new media, said
   co-constitute a new paradigm of animation art aesthetics: it is both the
   traditional animation update and use more of the traditional animation
   expansion and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Signal Processing (Digital Signal Processing, DSP) is a strong
   theoretical and practical subject, has widely used in many practical
   fields. Due to lack of knowledge system, it is difficult for students to
   apply the theory to practice and apply the theory of knowledge to solve
   practical engineering problems. So in the teaching of Digital Signal
   Processing, we must take the theory as the guide, take the practice as
   the center, strengthen the innovation of the teaching mode, and deal
   with the relationship between theory teaching and practice teaching. In
   view of the course, we introduce the Fuzzy Cognitive Diagnosis Framework
   (FuzzyCDF), propose a new teaching effect assessment method. By
   collecting the theoretical examination and experimental results of
   students, using the method of data mining fit out test parameter
   analysis, combining with FuzzyCDF to get master degree of theoretical
   knowledge and practice ability, then according to the experimental
   results, give objective and scientific evaluation and provide good
   advice to improve the quality of teaching.}},

Abstract = {{From ancient times, people have paid much attention to the important
   value and function of art for human beings. Therefore, art has always
   been an important part of educational system. There is different art
   education environment in different times. In the traditional education
   mode, the development of art education is influenced by many physical
   factors. However, art education has undergone unprecedented changes in
   the era of digital network. Especially under the background of Internet
   plus, art education will face more opportunities and challenges. We can
   use the Internet thinking to update our educational ideas and expand the
   form of education by Internet technologies. Internet plus education
   provides new ideas and approaches for the implementation of art
   education. But at the same time, we should also note the negative
   effects of fragmented learning. In general, with the innovation of
   education idea and the perfection of technology, Internet plus will
   bring more positive influence to art education.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation in digital technology has always been changing the way we
   work and education is not an exception. In this paper, we investigate
   the experiences of integrating digital media (combination of text,
   image, audio and video) into the school curricula in Ethiopia. We
   surveyed the accessibility of multimedia-rich digital learning
   resources; the experiences of students and teachers on using multimedia
   technologies; and their experiences on integrating multimedia in their
   learning process. Our finding indicated that the experiences of teachers
   and students on using digital technologies is fair. However, there is
   only limited access to multimedia rich digital learning resources, and
   premature practice of integrating them into the curriculum. The mapping
   of these results to the models of integrating digital learning into the
   curricula showed that the schools' status correspond to the initial
   phase and further recommendations on successful digital learning
   integration is provided. In addition, we proposed an agile and
   continuous model to continuously catch the evolving technological
   innovation and for large scale digital learning integration into a
   curricula.}},

Abstract = {{The business success of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) is
   determined by capital assets and capabilities to adopt innovation of
   social media technology to formulate digital marketing strategy
   improving organizational agility. The vastly developing content of
   social media becomes an opportunity ensuring more agile organizations in
   the accessibility of target markets. Problems of this research proposal
   are formulated (a) to propose a new research model on influences of
   innovation adoption of social media technology on digital marketing
   strategy in improving organizational agility of MSMEs and (b) to design
   hypothetical tests to cognize the influence of each latent variable. The
   research aims to identify and analyze to what extent digital marketing
   strategy can improve organizational agility of MSMEs in Pontianak,
   Indonesia. The combination of a convergent triangulation model and a
   follow-up, explanatory design is used. The sample including 55 MSMEs is
   determined by using Slovin Formula and a simple random sampling
   technique. 5 informants are selected at a sampling site by using a
   purposive sampling technique. The novelty of this research is on
   influences of antecedent variables aiming to improve organizational
   agility of businesses of MSMEs digitally.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to characterize the sector of Mexican cybermedia using
   the diffusion of innovations theory and analyzing the level of adoption
   of technologies associated with discursive elements of the digital
   environment. For this purpose, an inventory of cybermedia in the country
   was made. Furthermore, the cybermedia sector is described based on its
   geographic location. Finally, we analyze the levels of diffusion of
   digital technologies such as multimedia, APPs and augmented reality. We
   conclude that the video technologies have the highest level of adoption.
   Likewise, we found that native organizations have the highest levels of
   adoption in multimedia technologies}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a Learning Design (LD) tool, aimed at supporting
   teachers' conceptualization of collaborative learning activities for
   students. The main element of innovation of the tool, called the
   ``augmented 4Ts game{''}, in respect to the other existing LD tools,
   lays in its being half tangible-half-digital. The tangible component of
   the game is based on a paper board and a set of cards, and it is meant
   to lower teachers' typical barriers towards technology-based tools, and
   to make the game more flexible and engaging. At the same time, the
   digital component allows to continue the design work remotely beyond
   face-to-face sessions, and opens the way for further planning,
   delivering and sharing support.}},

   various industries, develop original augmented reality artifacts, and
   share their findings with international partners. Based on a
   project-based and collaborative learning approach, students communicate,
   research, develop together with the main goal to improve their digital
   literacy skills. By creating augmented reality artifacts, students
   better understand the impact of this technology and its business
   applications, and express their technological creativity in an

Abstract = {{Challenges in spatial planning include adjusting settlement patterns to
   increasing or shrinking populations; it also includes organizing food
   delivery in rural and peripheral environments. Discourse typically
   starts with an open problem and the search for a holistic and innovative
   solution. Software will often be needed to implement the innovation.
   Spatial planning problems are characterized by large and heterogeneous
   groups of stakeholders, such as municipalities, companies, interest
   groups, citizens, women and men, young people and children. Current
   techniques for participation are slow, laborious and costly, and they
   tend to miss out on many stakeholders or interest groups.
   We propose a triple shift in perspective: (1) Discourse is reframed as a
   requirements process with the explicit goal to state software, hardware,
   and organizational requirements. (2) Due to the above-mentioned
   characteristics of spatial planning problems, we suggest using
   techniques of requirements engineering (RE) and CrowdRE for getting
   stakeholders (e.g. user groups) involved. (3) We propose video as a
   medium for communicating problems, solution alternatives, and arguments
   effectively within a mixed crowd of officials, citizens, children and
   elderly people.
   Although few spatial planning problems can be solved by software alone,
   this new perspective helps to focus discussions anyway. RE techniques
   can assist in finding common ground despite the heterogeneous group of
   stakeholders, e.g. citizens. Digital requirements and video are
   well-suited for facilitating distribution, feedback, and discourse via
   the internet. In this paper, we propose this new perspective as a timely
   opportunity for the spatial planning domain - and as an increasingly
   important application domain of CrowdRE.}},

   IIoT is considered to have the potential to launch fourth industrial

   sources to enrich the measurements and analysis. In this paper, we
   propose an innovative IIoT framework that could automate the process of
   creating cloud-based middleware connector for things used in industrial
   settings. The framework significantly accelerates the configuration
   process for heterogeneous connections by using a light-weight and
   convenient connector template and supports the common set of protocols.
   Interoperability with other such implementations is preserved using

Abstract = {{Maintenance strategies based on structural health monitoring are able to
   provide effective support when it comes to optimizing the scheduled
   repair of existing structures, enabling their lifetime to be extended.
   With a particular focus on reinforced concrete (RC) structures, the
   state of the art seems to still be lacking an efficient and
   cost-effective technique that is capable of monitoring inner stresses
   continuously over the lifetime of a structure. Current solutions can
   typically only measure the required mechanical variables in an indirect,
   but economic, manner, or directly, but expensively. Moreover, most of
   the solutions proposed can be implemented only by means of manual
   activation, making the monitoring very inefficient and then poorly
   supported. This study deals with a structural health monitoring solution
   based on a wireless sensor network (WSN) that enables the automatic
   monitoring of a reinforced concrete (RC) structure. The network is
   comprised of wireless distributed sensors embedded in the structure
   itself which can be suitable for a digital monitoring of innovative
   constructions, such as 3D printed structures, thus enabling the creation
   of smart structures according to the requirements of Industry 4.0.}},

Abstract = {{Healthcare as we know it is in the process of going through a massive
   change - from episodic to continuous, from disease focused to wellness
   and quality of life focused, from clinic centric to anywhere a patient
   is, from clinician controlled to patient empowered, and from being
   driven by limited data to 360-degree, multimodal
   personal-public-population physical-cybersocial big data driven. While
   ability to create and capture data is already here, the upcoming
   innovations will be in converting this big data into smart data through
   contextual and personalized processing such that patients and clinicians
   can make better decisions and take timely actions for augmented
   personalized health. This paper outlines current opportunities and
   challenges, with a focus on key AI approaches to make this a reality.
   The broader vision is exemplified using three ongoing applications
   (asthma in children, bariatric surgery, and pain management) as part of
   the Kno.e.sis kHealth personalized digital health initiative.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative cyber culture and computing of social governance of
   citizens is proposed, aimed at the moral metric cloud service of social
   groups through the leverage of digital monitoring and expert evaluation
   of social processes and phenomena. Cyber culture is defined as the
   development level of social, technological, moral and material relations
   between society, the physical world and cyberspace that creates the
   quality of internet services for accurate digital monitoring and cloud
   metric management of processes and phenomena in all spheres of human
   activity including education, science, production and transport, to
   improve the quality of people life and preserve the ecosystem of the
   planet. A new system of cyber-physical relations in society are
   proposed, which will be the basis for creating innovative legislation
   with the functions of digital monitoring and cloud based
   cyber-governance. An analytical model of relations in state structures
   that simulates socioeconomic, political and other collisions as a
   response to regulatory influences is described. Prospective directions
   of the cyber-statehood creation, invariant in relation to a citizen
   residence are considered. A set of measures for destroying corrupt
   relations in society is offered at the expense of radical reduction of
   state property as a source of corruption in management, maintenance,

Abstract = {{Virtual Reality (VR) is a rapidly growing field with innovative
   applications. Two main forms of VR content can be identified in current
   applications: Computer generated 3D environments and adaptations of real
   world scenarios through means of digital imagery and video. While the
   latter provides a more realistic experience, scalable content generation
   methods for adaptations of real world environments to virtual space is
   still unavailable. Needless to say achieving unrestricted navigability
   in such environments, on a mobile platform with near real time response
   is quite challenging. The paper presents the algorithm for scalable
   intermediate view generation, devised as a part of a research to develop
   an universal content generation platform for real world environments in
   virtual reality.
   The algorithm uses adjacent equirectangular images to recreate the 360
   degrees x 180 degrees view of any point in-between, taking directional
   deformation into account. Input can be equirectangular images captured
   using any device, including 360 cameras and panoramas captured through
   mobile phones. The output can be rendered on specialized VR headsets or
   mobile phones. The algorithm is implemented with mobile platform as the
   target, thus rendering is optimized for limited resource utilization.
   The paper presents the concept, design and optimization used in this
   method.}},

Abstract = {{An implementation of a X-band flat array antenna with a synthesized
   shaped beam in the elevation plane and a digital beam forming (DBF)
   capability in the azimuth plane is presented. The shaped beam synthesis
   has been implemented on an array excitation level, the theory used for
   it is based on the Fourier transform method. The criteria for the
   synthesis have been selected in such a way, so to widen and change the
   roll-off slope steepness of the array main beam in elevation plane as
   well as to suppresses the sidelobes. The necessary magnitude and phase
   distribution for the synthesized beam are integrated within the
   corporate feed network of the array, which is printed on a low loss
   planar substrate. An additional beamshaping, achieved by means of
   electromagnetic band gap like structures for the transmitting part of
   the antenna has been demonstrated as well. The DBF capability of the
   array in the azimuth plane secures a field-of-view of 90 deg at a
   grating lobe level below -50 dB. The array makes use of an innovative,
   open-ended waveguide-like, broadband radiating element,
   electromagnetically coupled to the array feeding network. Thanks to the
   corporate feed and to the features of the radiating element, the array
   exhibits a wide instantaneous bandwidth of more than 30\% in X band at a
   VSWR 2:1. A good compliance between simulated and measured performances
   of the array is presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Hiding of information over the internet and sharing secret information
   is becoming impossible owing to the continuous increase in hacking cases
   and also the number of hackers. Cryptography is a method that tries to

   innovative way of encrypting information by making use of some
   trigonometric relations. A key is passed between the sender and receiver
   and can be done using any method, an example being the Diffie-Hellman
   method. The entire data is taken as characters and broken to American
   Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) values. The key is
   taken and a modulus operation is performed with 360. The output say `x',
   obtained is going to be used for the later transformations. Now the
   entire data which has been converted to ASCII will be broken to 8 blocks
   of which at least 7 will be of equal size in terms of digits. Then 2
   consecutive blocks will form a pair of coordinates. We will have 4 such
   pairs. Each pair is then rotated using trigonometric rotation
   transformation using `x' as the angle. Then all the pairs are merged to
   get a new set of values. Then ASCII to character conversion is used, but
   this time to convert the data to encrypted form.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Supply Chain (DSC) is an intelligent process that leverages
   innovative solutions with emerging technological means to generate new
   forms of revenue and business value for organizations. Stakeholders in
   supply chains, whether selling goods or services, do use, generate and
   share information with others. Interest in DSC is growing by both from
   academics and businesses. Supplier selection constitutes one of the
   crucial tasks from a supply chain digitalization perspective. This paper
   approaches the supplier selection problem in a DSC environment, which by
   its nature depends on many parameters. Therefore, a multi-criteria
   analysis and solution methodology is presented, which incorporates
   decision makers' insufficient knowledge and other pressures involved in
   the evaluation with the help of an extension of MOORA (Multi-objective
   Optimization by Ratio Analysis) ratio system approach. This method uses
   interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and a group decision making
   approach, which is demonstrated on a real case study to demonstrate the
   validity of the proposed approach for selecting suitable suppliers in
   DSC.}},

Abstract = {{Maker space is a powerful form of renovated learning which ethos is
   based on invents to learn. It creates, collaborates and innovates to
   engage students in hands-on projects and develop a large range of
   skills. In other words makerspace is place to make choice, create and
   connect. Community based workshops and DIY (Do It Yourself) projects are
   promoting the practice of peer production and fabrication. Existent
   science and multimedia applications are done by tinkering, the idea of
   university maker space is infantile and young but getting well-liked in
   global world. Universities are working a lot in terms to make their
   undergraduates and graduating engineers able to harness innovation and
   creativeness to stay competent and applicable in market or industry with
   increasingly growing requirements.
   This paper delves into a case study where multimedia lab is converted
   into a Makerspace SMMS (Space to Make Multimedia Systems) by assigning
   real time projects, related to the curriculum needs, and making them
   able to identify problem, construct model, become skilled at to apply,
   rework ideas, and share acquaintance with others. Here teacher acts as a
   ``Maker Teacher{''} who designs the concepts of projects and decides the
   moves. Teacher is also redesigning their labs into a makerspace sloping
   multimedia lab. Engineering project ideas and prototype of real world
   scenarios are also part of the multimedia makerspace. In present study
   the students are engaged in inquiring models, building codes and
   architectural blueprints and their processes by hacking and decoding the
   older versions and understanding the prototypes of the real time
   projects.
   Drawing upon observations, videos, interviews and other documentation,
   author concludes with a qualitative discussion and results of the
   connotation of the findings for this embryonic and emergent field.
   Outcomes of applied makerspace in no doubt effective and producing
   better results to blend digital and physical technologies to work better
   in practical and theoretical state of affairs.}},

Abstract = {{Widely applied for monitoring electronic equipment condition, the
   technology of built-in test (BIT) is the basis for Prognostics and
   health management (PHM) of electronic equipment. There are various
   different BIT design methods, but also some problems, such as the
   discrepancy between equipment function and BIT design, etc. This further
   leads to BIT a function, difficulty in verification, uncontrollability
   of size, weight, and power consumption, and so on. This paper proposes a
   new combined BIT chip strategy applicable for plate circuit condition
   monitoring. And the purpose of this strategy is to realize the
   integration of equipment functions with BIT. Furthermore, this strategy
   can solve the difficulty in monitoring the condition of complicated
   circuit board integrating microwave circuit, analog circuit and digital
   circuit. The strategy contains three main innovation points. Firstly,
   standardized chip is adopted to ensure BIT signal acquisition and
   transmission and reduce test cost of BIT design; secondly, a design of
   combining optional function modules is adopted to meet the needs of
   testability analysis of electronic system and optimize BIT test cost;
   thirdly, a design of central chip combination is adopted to meet the
   needs of monitoring microwave, analog and digital functions of plate
   circuit. Experiments show that the combined BIT chip design strategy for
   complicated plate circuit proposed herein is superior to traditional
   separated BIT method in respect of size, weight, power consumption and
   BIT functional integrity for monitoring the condition of plate circuit
   of good testability.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technology has brought about great changes in organizational
   structure, the way of value creation and profit-making methods, which
   brings new challenges to cost control based on ``chain{''}. In this
   paper, cost control in digital context is promoted to the pattern design
   level, combining the cost control process and the value creation process
   into one. with the new characteristics of cost control, this paper puts
   forward that extension method can be the method and tool of cost
   control, and provides the optimization of strategic choice and model

Abstract = {{In today's fast-paced business environment, firms are constantly
   pressured to innovate in order to remain competitive. Business model
   innovation (BMI) has recently attracted increasing attention as a
   promising approach to achieve competitive advantage in the face of
   fierce competition. Despite its great potential, however, BMI also
   entails high degrees of complexity, uncertainty and financial risk.
   Fueled by the rise of digital technologies, BMI has become increasingly
   open and collaborative in the recent past.
   The aim of this paper is to investigate the role and implications of
   open and collaborative practices in BMI and to provide a comprehensive
   review of available literature in this field. Therefore, a systematic
   review of literature at the intersection of Open Innovation (OI) and BMI
   has been carried out. Our analysis of the literature identified two
   major research streams in open business model innovation (OBMI): OBMI
   trends (customer-driven BMI, BM co-creation, early BM validation,
   virtual collaboration, design thinking) and OBMI effects. Overall, the
   findings support a growing trend of collaboration and co-creation in BMI
   supported by digital or tangible tools, and further reveal that OI has a
   direct positive effect on BMI success. Analysis of the literature also
   shows that the field of OBMI is still an under-researched area.}},

Journal = {{BIZNES INFORMATIKA-BUSINESS INFORMATICS}},

Pages = {{17-28}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of digital transformation is to fulfill the needs of
   a ``new digital generation customer{''} for on-demand delivery, quality
   and personalization. ``Anything as a service{''} has become the key
   principle of the digital paradigm. This is about a data-oriented service
   which relies on sharing information resources (including public ones)
   and the requirements for interoperability, security and trust. This
   paper presents the main approaches to digital transformation based on
   the example of the most innovatively active sectors such as banking and
   healthcare. We compare the proprietary development of digital services
   (products) to the building of a digital sector ecosystem aimed at
   attracting an unlimited number of participants. We defined the purpose
   of creating an ecosystem that is to provide the population with digital
   services formed on demand, in real time, in compliance with legislation
   and regulations, as well as in the context of maximum trust. We
   emphasize the role of openness for uniting the efforts of the community
   interested in the development of a digital industry, extension of
   public-private partnerships and building a competitive environment in
   order to ensure the rapid growth of available digital services, as well
   as to improve their quality. Since the knowledge economy is the basis
   for the digital economy, the authors consider it especially important to
   form a semantic core which acts as the carrier of knowledge in a digital
   sector ecosystem. We confirmed the necessity to implement the semantic
   core by a brief analysis of modern semantic approaches to
   standardization of information sharing in the above-mentioned
   industries, such as FIBO, BIAN (banking), HL7 and UMLS (health). The
   research carried out allowed the authors to design the conceptual
   architecture of the ecosystem and to suggest several proposals for
   digital transformation of an industry. The proposals express the
   necessity of state support for innovation and providing the conditions
   for the entry of new digital products based on the following principles:
   accessibility, timeliness, personalization, adaptability and security.}},

Title = {{Informed digital learning through social living labs as participatory
   methodology The case of Food Rescue Townsville}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{9-10, SI}},
Pages = {{518-534}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore social living labs as
   a participatory methodology and context for fostering digital literacy
   and community well-being. This approach is examined through a case study
   of Food Rescue Townsville, a voluntary community organisation in North
   Queensland, Australia.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using qualitative case study methodology,
   the research investigated volunteers' experience of a social living lab
   where they selected, installed and used open source Food Rescue Robot
   software.
   Findings - The social living lab enhanced volunteers' digital literacy
   and the organisation's efficiency. The participatory nature and
   transformative intentions of social living labs are similar to action
   research as both promote social change through collaboration.
   Research limitations/implications - The case study intentionally focuses
   on one community organisation to gain in-depth insights of a real-life
   social living lab.
   Practical implications - The paper models an innovative approach that
   contributes to community learning and well-being. It presents a social
   living labs framework for digital literacy development that is
   underpinned by participatory action research cycle and integrates
   informed learning principles. Social living labs provide a learning
   context and approach that extends beyond digital skills instruction to a
   holistic process of using information to learn. They enable individuals
   to participate as digital citizens in the creation, curation and use of
   digital information.
   Social implications - Informed digital learning through social living
   labs addresses the digital divide by fostering digital participation,
   volunteering and community engagement.
   Originality/value - The paper is of interest to researchers, information
   literacy educators and community groups. Theoretical insights and
   participatory practices of the Food Rescue Townsville case, and the
   proposed social living labs framework are transferable to other
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This research case study shares the partnership between
   librarians and educators to create a live digital literacy experience at
   The Quest (Camelot Project), a virtual world medieval simulation. The
   purpose of the partnership was to gain understanding of the learning
   elements addressed with a group of participants from across the globe,
   working at various skill levels and interacting with an immersive
   virtual world simulation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using field notes, machinima and
   interviews (participatory action research), the study identifies
   learning elements within three contexts: technological, pedagogical and
   content. Learners cycle toward intended learning outcomes in a
   virtual-world treasure hunt game from the perspective of both designers
   and participants.
   Findings - Findings of the case study illustrate the value of
   collaboration in a digital game-based learning (DGBL) environment
   through scaffolding of knowledge and skills in a virtual world. Findings
   exemplify the experiential learning cycle within a virtual world for
   constructing learning, and support a proposed new theoretical framework
   of technology-mediated learning which may help educators in both design
   and implementation.
   Originality/value - As virtual worlds and immersive learning
   opportunities continue to expand for learners and educators, this study
   shares the value of experiential learning from the perspective of both
   the teacher and the learner. Socially constructing knowledge and
   acquiring skills across distance with a team of librarians and educators
   are innovative examples of DGBL in an alternative reality setting.}},

Abstract = {{As DoD SATCOM stakeholders and developers, it is vital to understand
   innovative technical trends and both leverage and influence them in
   order to best address our priorities. These SATCOM development
   priorities are growth, adoption of open commercial standards, systemic
   availability and simplification. Major innovative trends in SATCOM
   development are Digital IF, modem advances and geographical distribution
   of strategic RF entry points. Digital IF uses standards-based DSP
   innovation to enable highly advantageous SATCOM terminal system
   repartitioning. Modem innovations include updated protocols, interface
   reduction, all-digital implementations, tailoring of mod cod sets,
   automated power and mod-cod responsive to traffic demand and link
   condition, and detailed attention to human factors. Geographic
   distribution of strategic RF entry points offers geographic diversity
   through terrestrial IF transport. All of these innovative trends enable
   growth in capabilities, bandwidth, link counts and systemic
   availability. All are based on open commercial standards which serve to
   simplify development, equipment, test processes, planning and
   operations. The challenge now is to leverage the progress of these
   trends optimally to help the DoD SATCOM user best support the
   warfighter. Optimal development along these trend lines, addressing the
   cited priorities, will be realized by greater awareness of these trends,
   rapid adoption of commercial offerings and adoption of open commercial
   standards along the lines of maximum commercial proliferation. On all
   counts, close collaboration between stakeholders is key to realizing the
   potential of these innovative trends.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by the energy turnaround, it can be seen that the centralized
   architecture of our energy system is becoming increasingly
   decentralized. This is fueled in particular by digital innovations.
   Security concerns in bottom-up energy networks such as Crowd Energy
   systems are growing, especially because the protection of private
   information is quite a complex problem. Technology alone is not enough
   to assure accepted levels of security. Energy prosumers are involved in
   every process of energy production, storage, and consumption. It is just
   a matter of time before this Crowd develops a security culture that
   impacts the security outcomes directly.
   In this paper we investigate the components that form this culture, and
   the methods to direct it in a desired path. We present a security
   culture framework that intends to enhance security outcomes, and we
   apply a cultural repositioning framework to further support security.}},

Abstract = {{The Western Cape in South Africa has been earmarked by the government
   and industry, as a digital hub for Africa. The region has a number of
   institutions, enterprises and initiatives in place to realise this goal.
   A study-taking into account the information technology practitioner's
   perspective-was undertaken within the Cape Town region to determine the
   promotion of software development within the Western Cape and the role
   which universities can play in the support thereof. A grounded theory
   research approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methods was
   used. This study found that the main stakeholders do not promote the
   software industry enough. Key initiatives that should be considered
   include: universities need to configure their curriculum appropriately
   for industry needs; more awareness around software development should be
   created particularly at school level in order to attract more students;
   and universities should build partnerships with industry. At the macro
   level, government, through policies and funding mechanisms for education
   and innovation in general, should create an enabling environment to
   foster these initiatives. Potential hindrances to achieving these
   initiatives are poor management of academic programmes, underfunding of
   the sector and a shortage of staff.}},

Abstract = {{The higher education through virtual environment is students centered
   oriented to the interactive learning, in situations to be closer to the
   real world; for that reason, teachers must have new communicative
   competences, nonverbal and with a learning innovative approach which
   allows to guide their students in the complex process of acquiring
   knowledge even more in a foreign language. In the same context, the use
   of technologic platforms of open code is becoming in the best way to
   give solutions which meet the actual needs of the process of acquiring a
   second language; on this basis, the present research is focused in the
   analysis and use of Open Source tools as alternative of complementary
   material to improve the writing skill in the process of Foreign Language
   Acquisition (FLA). Furthermore, teachers should not consolidate in the
   online learning, but also in the interaction with the students as is
   stated by Gibson (1993); in that way, the new technologies should be
   media which help to decrease the digital gap giving fast solutions,
   answers within the learning-teaching process which is visible with the
   application of Open source technologies. Thus, through the use of Open
   Source tools was proposed to demonstrate if it is possible to improve
   the writing skill in the student who took the subject of technical
   writing for software engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The new digital context poses new challenges for corporate communication
   agents. In this new context, the availability of reliable information
   systems for decisions-makers is of particular importance; this is
   precisely the main objective of the RTV2025 project: the identification,
   selection and construction synthetic indicators on governance,
   financing, accountability, innovation, quality and value of the
   audio-visual public services. The Delphi method is one of the most used
   techniques to obtain and aggregate expert valuation on a complex issue;
   in our case, the Delphi will gather the opinion of a group of experts
   about the suitability of a list of partial indicators that will later
   serve as the basis for the synthetic indexes. Our specific Delphi
   proposal is structured in several stages: making an initial list of
   plausible individual indicators, designing of the questionnaires,
   selection of the panel of experts, first round of questionnaires,
   statistical analyse of the responses, second round of questionnaires.}},

   challenge to achieve success in organizations. For universities, the

Abstract = {{The technological convergence of the mass media is the result of a long
   adaptation process of their communicative resources to the evolutionary
   changes of each historical moment. Thus, the new media became (plurally)
   an extension of the traditional media, allowing to the public access
   information in a wide range of digital devices. In this sense, our
   qualitative study with empirical-descriptive nature focuses on a
   literature review about web radio and its educative strand. This is an
   innovator and incipient issue on literature when investigating the
   potentialities of the radiophonic universe to the online educative
   process. By itself, the fruitful study follows the path of the
   radiophonic evolution integrating the online education on the media
   sphere, especially on the production of educational content to the
   programs, and the conception of a new language to the environment, a
   promising ambience to the contemporary radiophonic culture. From this

Abstract = {{The paper addresses the developing method of an adaptive control
   structure for an anaerobic digestion process under the realistic
   assumption that some state variables are unmeasurable, the reaction
   kinetics are incompletely known and time-varying and moreover the
   influent pollutant concentration is completely unknown. More exactly,
   the process that is taken into account is a wastewater biological
   treatment process operated in a continuous perfectly mixed bioreactor.
   The control solution proposed in the paper is based on an innovative
   adaptive technique. The controller design is achieved by combining an
   exact linearizing controller with a sequence of two cascaded state
   observers and with a parameter estimator. The proposed adaptive control
   structure is able to cope with several problems such as uncertainty of
   inputs and of kinetics, unavailability of online measurements,
   disturbances and noisy measurements. The behaviour and efficacy of
   estimation and control structures are evaluated by several digital
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{New watermarking techniques have been created for multimedia security
   and copyright protection due to vast exchange of digital contents over
   internet. And, moreover this has become one of the major reason for the
   development of digital watermarking and to come up with innovations to
   protect intellectual properties of the digital world. Digital
   watermarking is the process that embeds data called a watermark into a
   multimedia object such that watermark can be detected or extracted later
   to make an assertion about the object. It may be visible or invisible.
   In this paper we are doing comparative study of watermarking two
   different formats of images i.e. BMP and JPEG image using a hybrid model
   which is a combination of GA-HBO based optimization techniques with
   another existing hybrid model which is a combination of GA-BFA based
   optimization technique with hash partitioning. Different types of
   parameters are going to be used for comparing the two different
   techniques. The proposed technique is implemented over the MATLAB.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on wideband power amplifier predistortion for current
   and future communications standards such as LTE and 5G. As a matter of
   fact, the large bandwidth and the large dynamic range of exchanged
   signals in these standards make the predistortion task very challenging.
   To overcome these challenges, innovations and improvements are needed in
   the three main blocks of the predistortion system, i.e., modeling and
   estimation algorithms, the transmission path and the observation path.
   In this work, for each of these three blocks, the state of the art is
   briefly presented and solutions are proposed to contribute in achieving
   a low power wideband predistortion compatible with the 5G low power
   transmission cells.}},

   technology. The project described in this paper considers the historical
   benefits described in many business and use cases of RFID in several
   industries around product logistics in the last years and the vision
   D-Business. An existing RFID solution architecture based on the

Abstract = {{Reaping the benefits of the demographic dividends of the large youth
   population of India, experts in the Economic and Knowledge Sector
   predict that India is poised to become one of the largest economies of
   the World. Leaders from policy-making, industry and academia should be
   in action and charting out a Road Map to convert this speculation into a
   reality. The setting up of Knowledge Society (ies) for various
   socio-economic sectors, encompassing the lives of numerous
   cross-sections of society, should be the target achievement for those
   steering the apex bodies in the country. Smart technologies are supposed
   to be the backbone of each of these knowledge societies. Academia plays
   a pivotal rule in training the youth to pick up skills and knowledge of
   new technologies. They should have a mindset to adopt and adapt to these
   technologies effortlessly. Each knowledge society will conform to a
   specific sector i.e. health, renewable energy, manufacturing etc. Each
   society should follow a pyramidal structure with a bidirectional flow of
   knowledge through a Digital Highway Connect. Though each level of
   society may be geographically apart, this Smart Data Connect enables the
   timely and right infusion of technology to build up an inclusive,

   Transtheoretical model supports to identify the stage of human behavior
   and the transition for improvement. Behavior analysis is performed
   through unbiased recording of actions in term of big data. Just-in-time
   coaching is provided to motivate the users, stage-wise to adopt the

Abstract = {{Strategic decision-making processes necessitate a significant amount of
   experience and the consideration of a wide range of factors associated
   with the decision problem. Determination of applicant credit score and
   loan decisions are such decisions that subjective judgement of loan
   officers can produce poor results with substantial losses. This study is
   triggered as a result of an industrial consultancy project with a
   partner providing technological solutions for financial services.
   Anticipated requirement for an e-payment system that connects financial
   lenders, credit applicants and retailers digitally through a system is
   the main motivation of the study. Another focus of the study is on
   providing immediate loan access to retail customers which has
   necessitated automated processes and a decision-support system to assist
   the analysis of loan applications. The proposed system automatically
   evaluates a credit application as soon as the relevant information is
   inputted to the system at the end of the shopping process. The
   decision-making process should be supported with appropriate systems
   performing computerized credit assessment processes for quick and
   accurate decisions. The main complementary tools for the proposed system
   include a fraud detection module and credit risk assessment module which
   runs credit scoring algorithms. The proposed system will make loan or
   credit line decisions faster by eliminating paper work, easier by
   eliminating bureaucracy, and more accurate by newly integrated
   algorithms and approaches. (c) 2017 Published by Future Academy

Abstract = {{The restoration of ancient machinery involves a number of aspects,
   including manufacturing procedure, materials, and scales. Portions that
   cannot be confirmed should be regarded as variable parameters of the
   reconstructed design, and therefore, there is no single result. The goal
   of reconstruction is to establish a prototype of ancient machinery with
   its mechanical engineering techniques and crafts. The problem of this
   study is how digital fabrication tools used in architectural design can
   be applied to the reconstruction of ancient machinery with the
   water-powered armillary and celestial tower as an example. The objective
   was to synthesize results that comply with historical records in a
   systematic, modularized, and parameterized manner and consider the
   feasibility of using modern digital fabrication and materials. With the
   procedure, we can reduce the difficulty of ancient machinery
   reconstruction and provide a reference for the reconstruction designs of
   ancient mechanical technology and crafts, and mass production made of
   different materials and scales in the future.}},

Abstract = {{New possibilities of concrete constructions in architecture, the
   traditional formwork can be gradually replaced by the use of flexible
   textile. At the same time textile reinforcement combined with fabric
   formwork, introduces an innovative integrated solution in the
   fabrication of concrete. Based on a simple understanding of the textile
   weaving and knitting techniques, this project concentrates on the
   architectural production and the structural optimization of the textile
   as both concrete reinforcement and formwork. Furthermore, we present a
   robotic simulation of the process that develops using a series of
   computational experiments to research the sequence of weaving and/or
   knitting. Through the computational process and the design simulations,
   the research is firmly rooted in analog and digital exploration of
   material and its implementation in architecture, with particular
   emphasis on the convergence of robotics and computation. Note that the
   paper deals mainly with the software and weaving simulation as part of a
   larger research project, without dealing with the production of physical

Abstract = {{This research focuses on the transformation from design to fabrication
   without CAD models. In contrast to the conventional ``design - modeling
   - fabrication{''} workflow, which involves multiple software, we
   experimented with a method of programming the bespoke fabrication
   process, and consequently defining the artifact. Algebraic models are
   employed to specify the materialization process carried out by various
   CNC machines. We used the programming language Java to create machine
   instructions for 3D printers, milling machines, and robots. In this
   method, design and production are not two separated processes; rather we
   regarded them as two aspects of one whole activity. Proficiency in
   machines and materials could contribute to design innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless communications is one of the fastest growing technology fields,
   driving numerous other innovations in electronics. One challenging
   research area within the wireless field is to achieve a higher
   transmission speed. Today it is an open question how we can realize a
   wireless system at a speed of 100 Gb/s or even beyond. If we intend to
   use such systems in a mobile environment, we can only afford to spend
   approximately 1 - 10 pW/bit for the end-to-end communication. This
   includes all processing and protocol steps.
   A special priority project within the German research community was set
   up to investigate new paradigms for achieving the 100 Gb/s wireless
   transmission goal. Within 11 coordinated projects researchers from all
   over Germany are looking at several relevant issues ranging from the
   antennas and RF-Frontend, baseband-processing and error correction to
   protocol processing. One of the big challenges is to find the correct
   balance between analog and digital signal processing to achieve an
   extremely high performance at very low energy consumption. Another
   challenge is to find a good balance between bandwidth and bandwidth
   efficiency to achieve the 100 Gb/s goal. Finally, protocol processing
   will need new approaches to decouple the central processor of a computer
   from the high-end input/output operations. Here we report about work in
   progress and initial results of selected projects. One interesting
   finding was that FEC at speed up to 120 GB/s can be realized in a very
   energy efficient way and with small area/power consumption}},

Abstract = {{The EuroMPM {[}1] is a pan-European cooperation on Master education in
   project management with seven well aligned Master programmes in
   different European countries dealing with the ambition to offer an
   academic education in project management on EQF level 7 {[}2].
   Connecting several Master programmes in a crossborder virtual Master
   School is a straightforward approach for high-quality Master education -
   especially in domains with a high level of transdisciplinary,
   international cooperation (e.g. the KIC Master Schools {[}3], or the
   MSPME {[}4]). The EuroMPM uses the concept of the crossborder Master
   School to address some typical competence requirements for international
   project managers: intercultural teamwork \& communication,
   interdisciplinary \& international cooperation, diversity in topics and
   tailored approaches (driven by innovations, technology development and
   new business models, e.g. the digital transformation) and project
   complexity. The EuroMPM Master School goes beyond traditional exchange
   semesters. Important elements are block-oriented teaching in workshops
   with students and lecturers from partner universities, with industry
   involvement {[}5] and with an interdisciplinary teamwork. Exchange is
   fostered by a high number of interaction points between the programmes,
   e.g. summer schools and student conferences. Furthermore, the concept of
   the international classroom contributes to a unique learning experience.
   A virtual cross-border Master School on a European scale as the EuroMPM
   has the required international project culture already in its own DNA.
   EuroMPM conducts the research on the efficiency and effectivity of the
   competence delivery based on a tailored indicator framework. We will
   present the EuroMPM concept, excerpts of the indicator framework and
   examples of measurement results.}},

Abstract = {{Digital health innovation ecosystems describe the need to incorporate
   the components of digital health, innovation and digital ecosystems in
   administering healthcare services. Reviewing the evidence of digital
   health, innovation and digital ecosystems in both developed and

   of implementing a digital health innovation ecosystem. The purpose of
   this paper was to present the results of a scoping review aimed at
   identifying the scope and range of digital health, innovation and
   digital ecosystems literature in developed and developing countries and
   propose guidelines for implementing digital health innovation
   ecosystems. The findings of the scoping review reveal that studies on
   digital health, innovation and digital ecosystems have been conducted in
   developed and developing countries, providing useful insights on the
   feasibility of implementing a digital health innovation ecosystem in
   both developed and developing countries. Guidelines for implementing a
   digital health innovation ecosystem were also proposed. The findings of
   the scoping review as well as the guidelines proposed in this study will

Abstract = {{Digital Signal Processing is an important specialized course for
   undergraduates majoring in electrical information. This course has a mix
   of very abstruse theory, many abstract concepts, scientific methods and
   mathematical knowledge, so it is quite difficult for students to master
   it. In terms of the learning status quo of the major students in our
   university, they have a week foundation for mathematics, so they face
   quite a few barriers in learning process and show a low interest in
   learning this course. They master and comprehend little knowledge in the
   process of learning. Therefore, the paper conducted a reform on the
   teaching methods \& content, practice-oriented teaching and classroom
   teaching models, so as to help students to comprehend and master the
   basic concepts, basic principles and basic analysis methods of the
   course, and fully improve their ability to apply what they learn to
   solve practical problems and their innovative ability in practice.}},

   support a variety of learning styles. Practice teaching is an important
   link in the application of undergraduate teaching, so the application of
   micro course form to practice teaching can not only enrich the spare
   time of students, but also optimize the allocation of teaching
   resources. In the research, micro lectures about Digital Image

   innovative three-layer triple-CGEM (Cylindrical Gas Electron Multiplier)
   with analog readout. The ASIC comprises 64 channels, each of which
   features a dual-branch architecture to extract and digitize the
   timestamp and charge of the input signal. The time-of-arrival is
   provided by a set of low-power TDCs, based on analog interpolation
   techniques, while the charge measurement is obtained either from the
   time-over-threshold information or the 10-bit digitization of the signal
   peak amplitude. Fabricated in a 110 nm CMOS technology, the ASIC has
   been designed to operate with an input capacitance of about 100 pF, an
   input dynamic range between 1 and 50 fC, a power consumption of 10
   mW/channel and a sustained event rate of 60 kHz/channel.}},

Abstract = {{Software systems have established themselves as the heart of business
   and everyday living, and as the pillar of the emerging global digital
   economy. This puts pressure on educational institutions to train people
   for the continuously evolving software industry, which puts additional
   demand for new PhDs and educators. While large universities and research
   centres have the required expertise and infrastructure to providing a
   cost-effective training by research as well as covering wide spectrum of
   software engineering topics, the situation in small universities with
   limited resources is challenging. This is even more difficult for some
   countries where the discipline of software engineering is totally new,
   which is the case of emerging countries. This paper describes the
   Pathways to PhDs project funded by the European Commission. The
   long-term aim is to support the development, modernization and
   international visibility and excellence of higher education, namely
   education by research at the PhD level in Europe, while helping partner
   countries to develop new PhD programs and consolidate existing ones in
   the field of computing in the area of software engineering. This paper

Abstract = {{A flexible power flow control system for distributed electricity
   generation, storage and consumption for small industrial buildings has
   been subject of a public funded research project, which has been
   conducted by two industrial and two research partners.
   Power converter modules in different power rating classes (1.5 kVA up to
   50 kVA) have been developed using 3 level or 2 level topology. Each of
   them can be operated either in AC or DC mode for different types of
   electricity generation, storage or loads. The entire function is
   selectable by means of digital control software from a bunch of software
   defined operating modes.
   A power system contains different types of power converters, which are
   connected over a DC bus, containing a system controller, which
   configures the power modules and optimizes energy flow during system
   operation. The system controller connects to a server via internet for
   maintenance issues like software and firmware updates for the system
   controller and power modules. Thus, new functionality or compliance to
   new or changed regulations can be applied during the expected system
   lifetime of about 20 years. Maintenance is simplified due to the
   software compatibility of spare parts, even if they will be based on
   different technology or on different devices. Charge control of electric
   vehicles has been integrated into the system and the power flow control
   optimization. The converters are equipped with features to stabilize the
   external AC grid (e.g. reactive power control, harmonics cancelation,
   short term active power delivery).
   The project has been funded by the German program ZIM, which supports
   SMEs to develop innovative technology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the digital transformation of e-governance system
   through big data application for Nepal. It explores issues and
   challenges for the enhancement of the existing labor migrant processes
   in the e-governance system of Nepal. The labor migrant industry has a
   huge impact on the economic and social development of this country.
   Nepalese migrant workers are often led to unsuitable jobs causing lower
   benefits and mishaps. Nepal government has taken several steps to
   rectify policies and guidelines to organize processes for this industry.
   But the slow development in implementation of the guidelines has not
   been able to overtake complexity gaps with the rapid growth of the
   industry. This paper proposes a governmental innovation with smarter
   technology to resolve the missing gaps in the existing labor migrant
   processes. Existing scenario of different departmental responsibilities
   and the procedural gaps are explored so as to recommend a wholesome
   consolidated big data labor migrant system. The outcome of this proposed
   solution can deliver proper rights to the Nepalese worker citizens in
   the selection of job and fetch an efficient and transparent knowledge
   based system for the Nepalese labor industry.}},

   revolution changed fundamentally the business world, companies that
   embraced the changes managing to reduce costs and increase innovation.
   In the last two years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) together
   with the increased availability of commercial artificial intelligence
   systems resulted into a new generation of autonomous conversational
   agents or chatbots that engage the user directly and in a personal
   manner. Using these autonomous conversational agents paired with the
   exponentially increasing instant messaging platforms led to the creation
   of modern chatbots, a tool to handle two-way communication between
   company and customer instantly.
   This article aims at identifying and exposing the ways companies can use
   chatbots to empower their relationship marketing efforts and the main
   aspects to be considered when doing that.}},

Abstract = {{The world is subject to constant changes and innovation cycles decrease
   in time as technology advances. The last centuries originated a lot from
   innovations, starting with the 1st industrial revolution in 1780 down to
   the present 4th industrial revolution or the so called digital
   transformation. All main evolutionary changes where shaped by visions
   and innovations and they influenced the economy and the population as
   well.
   The freshest buzzword related to this hotly debated topic is
   ``disruption{''}. Nowadays the innovations must be disruptive, the
   business models and strategies are clustered as disruptive or
   non-disruptive as well as the competition and markets have to have
   disruptive components. But what does disruption in that context mean, is
   it good or bad to have disruptive innovations, and is it a new or an old
   reoccurring phenomenon?
   Based on those thoughts and because of the topicality and controversy of
   this topic the authors have decided to analyze the meaning and
   significant characteristics of ``disruptive innovations{''} and to have
   a short historical examination.
   The obtained results showed that ``disruptive innovation{''} is:
   something breathtaking improved or new which disturbs an existing
   environment or even destroys and reshapes it and is nothing preventable
   or to fear.}},

Abstract = {{After the global ``break-through{''} of the internet within the 2000s,
   today's available technologies seem to ``change{''} once more
   established business models completely by innovative digital
   technologies. Organizations using such new technologies expect to gain
   market advantages in terms of reduced operational costs, increased
   turnover, and simplified or even new business models respectively.
   The present paper explores and compares the current mindset of business
   people within different business sectors regarding their estimated
   financial impact of digital technologies in general, their usage along
   the value-added chain as well as the current stage of existing digital
   skills for its adoption. Therefore, the authors performed a quantitative
   explorative study based on a questionnaire from 15th to 31st January
   2017. The target of this research was to obtain information on how
   business insider's with different experienced background as well as
   sectors assess digital technologies in being mandatory key factors for
   (financial) outperforming on the one hand as well as to evaluate the
   organization's current grade of digitisation and hence to evaluate
   unused potential.
   The analysis shows clearly that age and job experience plays a major
   role on how digital technologies are being evaluated from a financial
   impact point of view. Furthermore, the study indicates that over almost
   all business sectors it is not really known if the own grade of
   digitisation is higher or lower than the one of the competitors.
   However, despite this the majority states that the digitisation has a
   strong impact on their business and further efforts needs to be done for
   adoption.}},

Abstract = {{Communication apps can be a major factor in a digital strategy based on
   being a data and communication hub, and therefore understanding their
   diffusion and growth is of high importance. In this paper, we provide a
   list of factors and concepts that drive their growth, but can also be
   used to differentiate between apps, in order to understand why some are
   successful, but at the same time limited to certain countries or
   regions. With the conceptual diffusion model proposed based on these
   factors, we contribute to our understanding of the dynamics in the

Abstract = {{Bitcoin as concept was coined in 2009 and can be described as a partly
   open and shared transactional database. What makes bitcoin unique is
   that for the first time, we can prove and move ownership of anything
   digital without a central authority. The technology facilitates many
   benefits, one being a worldwide, digital currency and we observe that
   some stores allow payments in bitcoin. Drawing on concepts from the
   Diffusion of Innovation theory we investigated: What are the end-users'
   motivations and barriers for using bitcoin as digital currency? Through
   a small survey, we collected 135 answers during the summer of 2016. Our
   findings include that the bitcoin users embrace bitcoin due to
   technological curiosity, thus an individual reason. The largest group,
   the non-users, state that they are awaiting for others to start using
   bitcoin, as they question the value and security issues. We conclude
   that we may witness a deadlock where ``everybody waits for
   everybody{''}, and that more research is needed. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Teams in most work contexts work virtually to different degrees, for
   example in three-dimensional virtual environments. Regarding the
   development of new information and communication technology, an
   important question is, what influence the pervasion of innovative
   electronic devices, virtual and augmented reality as well as the
   respective software have on individual behavior and as a consequence on
   working processes. Industry as much as research embraces and analyzes
   processes and factors that influence virtual teamwork. In this paper a
   literature review is presented in order to merge findings of factors
   that influence the performance of virtual teamwork, such as the degree
   of virtuality and the presence of shared mental models. Results are
   presented as synthesis of these fmdings and a research agenda is

Abstract = {{This paper presents the result of a study which aimed at identifying the
   potential stakeholders and perceived benefits of a digital health
   innovation ecosystem for the Namibian context as part of a larger study.
   Combining semi-structured interviews and qualitative questionnaires, a
   group of professionals from within the Namibian context and the global
   context were purposively selected to provide insights about the
   potential stakeholders and perceived benefits of a digital health
   innovation ecosystem for the Namibian context. The study adopted a
   qualitative approach. The main findings of the study suggest that
   stakeholders of a digital health innovation ecosystem include patients,
   professionals from various disciplines as well as government
   institutions, research institutions and innovation companies. The
   fmdings suggest that the implementation of a digital health innovation
   ecosystem for the Namibian context could improve healthcare services as
   a result of the collaborative and innovative platform. The findings of
   this study contribute to the emerging body of literature on digital
   health innovation ecosystems, specifically in developing countries.
   Furthermore, the fmdings of the study will inform relevant healthcare
   policy makers within the Namibian context in planning and implementing a
   digital health innovation ecosystem. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Digital Innovation (DI), Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-physical
   Systems (CPS) offer new opportunities for enterprises but also cause new
   challenges for Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM). Based on an
   industrial case from power garden products illustrating potentials and
   challenges of DI and IoT, this paper investigates the integration of
   product-IT into enterprise architecture (EA). Product-IT includes the
   embedded IT-systems in physical products and services / components for
   operations, maintenance or evaluation purposes. The paper investigates
   problems in product-IT and enterprise-IT integration and challenges for
   the field of EAM. The case study shows that industry implemented
   pragmatic solutions for dealing with P-IT integration into EA, but there
   is a clearly expressed demand for improvements and a need for refined
   EAM standards in this context. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Enterprise Architecture (EA) is instrumental to align ICT and business
   strategy, and many organizations carry out substantial efforts to
   implement EA. It is therefore seen as imperative to drive the digital
   strategy, identifying innovative new business models and technologies,
   and realizing more business value of technology investments. However,
   recent work suggest that it is a challenging task to implement
   enterprise architecture in an organization. This study explores the
   implementation of enterprise architecture (EA) in the Norwegian health
   sector. We found a number of challenges that impeded the process toward
   a common EA: unclear enterprise architecture roles, ineffective
   communication, low EA maturity and commitment, and complicated EA tools.
   These challenges were traced to three root causes: the ambiguity of the
   EA concept, difficult EA terminology and the complexity of EA
   frameworks. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing trust among service providers and end-users with respect to
   data protection is an urgent matter in the growing information society.
   In response, CREDENTIAL proposes an innovative cloud-based service for
   storing, managing, and sharing of digital identity information and other
   highly critical personal data with a demonstrably higher level of
   security than other current solutions. CREDENTIAL enables end-to-end
   confidentiality and authenticity as well as improved privacy in
   cloud-based identity management and data sharing scenarios. In this
   paper, besides clarifying the vision and use cases, we focus on the
   adoption of CREDENTIAL. Firstly, for adoption by providers, we elaborate
   on the functionality of CREDENTIAL, the services implementing these
   functions, and the physical architecture needed to deploy such services.
   Secondly, we investigate factors from related research that could be
   used to facilitate CREDENTIAL's adoption and list key benefits as
   convincing arguments.}},

Abstract = {{Internet marketing is the use of Internet means to implement product
   sales. This marketing means, with a variety of characteristics such as
   openness, applicability and service, is not only an efficient and
   important marketing tool, but also an important core of enterprise
   product sales. E-commerce network marketing has low cost, strong
   interaction and other advantages, and can cover the whole world with the
   traffic advantage which attracts customers to participate in and reduces
   sales and maintenance costs. It is the most influential sales approach.
   The innovative strategies of agricultural product network marketing
   under the background of e-commerce are analyzed in this paper. Internet
   marketing is a modern sales way, which makes use of computer
   communications and digital interactive media for product marketing. It
   increasingly becomes an important and key channel for product sales.

   Short Range Radar (SRR) array antenna system for automotive
   applications. The beam forming network consists of a hybrid solution
   including an analog phase shifter, realized with a Rotman lens, and an
   additional digital phase shifting stage on array side allowing to select
   between two states, and consequently to enhance the scan angle. This
   paper will demonstrate that this new concept allows to double the
   scanning capability of the array with respect to a design employing only
   the Rotman lens.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis about Education and current educational settings (or
   educative technological contexts) leads to the need for reflection and
   study on the state of school as a public space and on their role in
   relation to the promotion and development of skills of children and

   future of education there are multiple lines of analysis, as well as
   several authors speculating about the school's future and the future of
   this young technological society. In this paper we intend to discuss the
   state of the art about the school of the future and reflect on possible
   connections, developed under a doctoral project in Portugal, reflecting

Abstract = {{With information technology becoming ever more embedded in our
   surrounding everyday things, the nature of interactions and the way we
   experience digitalization is becoming increasingly embodied. Thus,
   growing effort is placed on examining the multisensory nature of
   interaction experience. From a design perspective, increased knowledge
   of how people experience materials and how to design to encourage
   varying material experiences opens new opportunities for the generation
   of rich multisensory user experience, and accomplishing game-changing
   results. In particular, the innovation space opened up by understanding
   people's material expectations of designs is significant. An experiment
   (N = 78) was conducted to examine how people appraised materials via
   touch and sight. There were three groups: sight, touch, and touch and
   sight. Here, we focus on a task connecting the materials to five design
   contexts according to appropriate, inventive and inappropriate. Results
   reveal the potential in harnessing the least expected and desired
   connections between material and design application, for creating
   imaginative multisensory experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is facing a
   great process re-engineering of the management procedures for new
   constructions, and recent studies show a significant increase of the
   benefits obtained through the use of Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) methodologies. This innovative approach needs new developments for
   information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to improve
   cooperation and interoperability among different actors and scientific
   disciplines. Accordingly, BIM could be described as a new tool capable
   of collect/analyse a great quantity of information (Big data) and
   improve the management of building during its life of cycle (LC). The
   main aim of this research is, in addition to a reduction in production
   times, reduce physical and financial resources (economic impact), to
   demonstrate how technology development can support a complex generative
   process with new digital tools (modelling impact). This paper reviews
   recent BIMs of different historical Italian buildings such as Basilica
   of Collemaggio in L'Aquila, Masegra Castle in Sondrio, Basilica of Saint
   Ambrose in Milan and Visconti Bridge in Lecco and carries out a
   methodological analysis to optimize output information and results
   combining different data and modelling techniques into a single hub
   (cloud service) through the use of new Grade of Generation (GoG) and
   Information (GoI) (management impact). Finally, this study shows the
   need to orient GoG and GoI for a different type of analysis, which
   requires a high Grade of Accuracy (GoA) and an Automatic Verification
   System (AVS) at the same time.}},

Abstract = {{GAMHer is a collaborative project that aims at exploiting and validating
   Geomatics algorithms, methodologies and procedures in the framework of
   new European regulations, which require a more extensive and productive
   use of digital information, as requested by the Digital Agenda for
   Europe as one of the seven pillars of the Europe 2020 Strategy. To this
   aim, GAMHer focuses on the need of a certified accuracy for surveying
   and monitoring projects with photogrammetry and laser scanning
   technologies, especially when used in a multiscale approach for
   landscape and built heritage documentation, conservation, and
   management.
   The approach used follows a multi-LoD (level of detail) transition that
   exploits GIS systems at the landscape scale, BIM technology and ``point
   cloud based{''} 3d modelling for the scale of the building, and an
   innovative BIM/GIS integrated approach to foster innovation, promote
   users' collaboration and encourage communication between users. The
   outcomes of GAMHer are not intended to be used only by a community of
   Geomatics specialists, but also by a heterogeneous user community that
   exploit images and laser scans in their professional activities.}},

Abstract = {{Water resources and management have become a critical global issue.
   During the half-millennium of its existence, the Roman Empire developed
   numerous strategies to cope with water management, from large-scale
   urban aqueduct systems, to industrial-scale water mills designed to cope
   with feeding growing city populations. Roman engineers encountered,
   adopted, and adapted indigenous hydraulic systems, and left lasting
   imprints on the landscape of the Mediterranean and temperate Western
   Europe by employing a range of water technologies. A recent academic
   study has enabled the identification of remains of and references to
   seventy-two dams from the Roman era, constructed in Spain between the
   1st and 4th century AD. Such unique heritage, without comparisons in the
   Mediterranean makes Spain an emblematic case study for the analysis of
   Roman hydraulic engineering and water management policies. Fifty dams
   have been located and detailed. The twenty-two outstanding, although
   identified on the ground, have not been able to be acceptably
   characterized, due in some cases to their being ruins in a highly
   degraded state, others due to their being masked by repairs and
   reconstructions subsequent to the Roman era. A good example of such
   neglected dams is the buttress dam of Consuegra, in Toledo province
   (Castilla-La Mancha). Dating to the 3rd - 4th century AD, the Dam of
   Consuegra, on the basin of the Guadiana, with its over 600 metres length
   and 4,80 metres height, is a remarkable case of Roman engineering
   mastery. It had a retaining wall upstream, numerous buttresses and
   perhaps an embankment downstream, of which no remains are left. The
   application of 3D digital imaging technique to create a high quality
   virtual model of such monuments has proved to be successful especially
   for the study of the technological aspects related its construction. The
   case study of the Roman dam of Muel (Zaragoza) has shown, in fact, as
   best practices in digital archaeology can provide an original and
   innovative perspective on a long time studied monument. In this paper it
   will be explored how deploying recent computer technologies to the Roman
   dam at Consuegra can advance our understanding of the history of local
   and regional landscape change and the technology of water management. In
   summer 2016, the dam has been documented with terrestrial laser scanning
   with two FARO Focus 3D x 330 and aerial photogrammetry image capturing
   with a DJI Phantom 4 drone. Data was processed in various 3D software
   applications to generate 3D representations of the dam including 3D
   point clouds, animations, and meshed models.}},

Abstract = {{In this emerging era of digitalization, our society wants everything
   approachable in just a single click or on hand to hand distance. People
   started communicating from off-line methods like writing letters then
   telephones, smartphones and now they want even something greater from
   these innovations. Most of the industries including Automobiles are
   going towards the era of digitalization bringing new insights to the
   market. This study will emphasize on the digitalization of automobile
   industry. The automobile industry may face the problems in the context
   of digital infrastructure through the process of digitalization. This
   paper will focus on the challenges in respect to India's economy faced
   by industries like Low Purchasing Power as compared to other economies,
   acceptance of purchasing vehicles online, delivering delightful customer
   services and values. It also aims to discuss the viable solutions like
   bringing customer awareness, educate the customers in technical aspects
   \& some practices to promote the usage of digital methods in the
   purchasing process of automobiles.}},

Abstract = {{Like many other products in the age of the Internet of Things, cars are
   becoming increasingly augmented with digital technology and connected
   with their environment. This sea change demands business models that can
   transform the disruptive power of the ``connected car{''} into a
   business model innovation. There is a need for further research to
   advance the industry-specific understanding of the interplay of
   technological product innovation and business model innovation, and the
   industry-specific design knowledge on business models. This article
   addresses both following the recombination school of thought on business
   models. In the conceptual part, we shape our understanding of
   technological product innovation with the connected car and use this
   understanding to adapt business model patterns from previous work to the
   connected car domain. Further, we merge these to form five composite
   patterns and evaluate the entire set of patterns in the empirical part.
   The patterns can be at the center of experimentation and
   discovery-driven business model innovation. Beyond prescriptive
   knowledge, we advance the industry-specific understanding of the
   interplay of technological product innovation and business model
   innovation by, for example, considering the analogy between business
   model patterns and the principle of modularity.}},

Abstract = {{It can be argued, that software development and game development share a
   number of features in their process models, such as the need to design,
   develop and test software functionalities. However, while the software
   engineering (SE) models work successfully supporting the software
   development, their practical application for game development is
   frequently unsuccessful. To understand this problem and number of other
   aspects such as Green IT and business models, we conducted a survey with
   the game industry organizations. Based on our observations on the SE
   practices, the game industry applies mostly the agile process models or
   nothing at all, their major concerns for business were mobile
   development, digital marketing, employees with specific abilities and
   keeping innovation in their business, and their minor concerns were
   eco-impact elements, software reusability and financing. Based on our
   results, we identified areas which would warrant more studies to support
   the game industry practices, eco-aspects and business.}},

Abstract = {{In the literature of the subject, the issues relevant to customer
   satisfaction research are raised quite frequently in the context of
   products or services having a commercial character. However, there is a
   lack of research within the scope of the quality and innovativeness of
   mass events. Taking this into consideration, the authoress is going to
   raise the issues of customer loyalty to a specific product which is
   constituted by Rzeszow Juwenalia. The objective of this publication was
   to determine the degree of loyalty of participants in the event.
   Striving to attain the adopted objective, and to verify the formulated
   hypothesis, in February 2017, a survey research, made accessible in the
   Google form, was conducted. The respondents were requested to provide
   their responses to the following question: `How high is the probability
   of you recommending Rzeszow Juwenalia to your acquaintances?' The
   question was formulated upon the basis of eleven-point scale, on which
   using the digit `0' means: `Without any doubt, I will not recommend the
   event,, whereas using the digit `10' means: `I will recommend the event
   without any doubt.' The questionnaire contained respondent's as well. In
   that section, respondents were requested to provide the information
   about their gender. For the analysis of data, the STATISTICA 12 program
   was applied. In the statistical analysis, it was principally tables of
   numerousness, with the application of which the numerical collation, as
   well as the per cent one, of appropriate responses, were presented. To
   attain the verified hypothesis, the ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test by ranks
   was applied. The obtained results also made it possible to verify the
   adopted research hypothesis, and to ascertained that there is, most
   likely, not existing correlation between gender and inclination for the
   part of the participants in Rzeszow Juwenalia towards promoting the
   event amongst their acquaintances. Both women, and men alike, assess the
   organization of Rzeszow Juwenalia similarly and express willingness to
   advertise this event amongst their acquaintances.}},

Abstract = {{A building design is typically created by a collaboration of
   professionals. Whilst the advent of BIM tools makes the assessment of
   the performance of an iterative design possible, these tools are not
   commonly used, due to traditional practice prevailing, technical
   limitations including differing data formats, and industry resistance to
   innovation. Timely consistent feedback throughout the design process, as
   major design decisions are made, could enable the enhancement of energy
   efficiency. However, current design guidelines are typically not in
   digital rule form, preventing the automated checking and validation of
   developing design models. Furthermore, architectural design tools have
   poor connections to thermal and environmental analysis software, which
   is exacerbated by a lack of knowledge of the data requirements of other
   disciplines both upstream and downstream. This paper explores the
   potential for embedding parameters within architectural model files to
   enable the enhancement of energy efficiency at the design stage and
   through the design process. It explores the architectural to energy
   analysis data exchanges, and demonstrates the way in which energy
   efficiency parameters can be embedded within model files to inform
   decision making at the conceptual design stage. The paper found that by
   using tools readily available, it is possible to add value during the
   design process through the use of BIM, with improved design outcomes as
   the result. The need to develop new workflows between the disciplines as
   a result of this different approach was highlighted. This enhanced
   practice is more responsive and can support better communication within
   project teams through providing timely information and feedback,
   providing analysis before optimisation for energy efficiency. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The adaptation to the European Higher Education Area implies a change in
   the teaching methodologies since, within it, it is fundamental to supply
   students with learning autonomy. This work aims to improve the
   methodology of several engineering related subjects via the design and
   implementation of different activities based on virtual tools.
   Initially, a survey was conducted among students to assess their
   knowledge and interest in different digital tools. Then, depending on
   the teaching modality for which they would be aimed, the kind of
   activity to be developed was described. Finally, the satisfaction of the
   students with their achievements, their comments on the activities, and
   their suggestions for improvement were collected through a survey and
   then analyzed. The design, elaboration, and implementation of those
   activities as well as the satisfaction, participation and academic
   results of the students who experienced them are described in this work.
   Initially, the students' knowledge on the existence of different digital
   tools was scarce. After the experience, the students were generally
   satisfied. The students' participation in the interactive activities was
   greater if they were compulsory and, therefore, computable in the final
   mark. In addition, the interest rate declined as the number of suggested
   activities increased.}},

Abstract = {{Bitcoin is a system created to service micro-payments in e-commerce, as
   well as the digital unit of value functioning in the system's
   environment. When analysed, the behaviour of market participants
   indicates that the introduction of investment applications of the
   cryptocurrency, in parallel with its original payment application, had a
   tremendous impact on the larger-scale functioning of the system. This
   was aided by the functioning of many trading platforms allowing for
   exchange into traditional currencies and a high volatility of
   quotations.
   Without doubt, bitcoin may be branded a ground-breaking financial
   innovation or a work of genius. However, the growing, and even global
   use of bitcoin has brought some of the system's imperfections to light.
   As the system developed, bitcoin users started to have a better view of
   the threats to the correct functioning of the system arising from its
   construction.
   The paper aims to indicate the main barriers limiting the functioning of
   the bitcoin system, and its use in payments in particular. The work has
   adopted the following research hypothesis: In the early stages of
   bitcoin functioning, users had little awareness of the technological
   flaws of the system. The study analyses the literature on the subject
   and the results of a survey carried out among Polish bitcoin users. The
   analysis confirms of the research hypothesis, as it shows that in the
   system's first several years, users identified the following threats to
   the system's functioning: the speculative nature of bitcoin, the lack of
   adequate awareness in society which would allow for a widespread use of
   the innovation, potential too strict regulation of the cryptocurrencies
   market or its banning. The authors also present threats to the
   functioning of the system which in their opinion are of greatest
   importance at the moment. These relate to the existence of
   intermediaries, the lack of systemic incentives addressed to bitcoin
   merchants, growing costs and payment processing time. The authors intend
   to indicate those aspects of bitcoin's functioning in order to make the
   use of cryptocurrencies more conscious and contribute to limiting
   financial risk of system users.}},

Abstract = {{Followed by digital fieldbus and industrial Ethernet technology,
   wireless technology is another major technological innovation in
   industrial applications. As one type of wireless sensor networks,
   WirelessHART garnered great attention. However, it usually takes a long
   time to establish such a network in the industry from a few minutes to a
   few hours. To solve this problem, a new scheme, based on the concept of
   time synchronization and time slotted channel hopping on the data link
   layer is proposed in this paper. We describe a fast node joining
   mechanism and do some experiments to validate the effectiveness of the
   new solution.}},

   has developed novel ion image sensor that can visualize specific ions

   of living things, and understanding their behavior is critical for
   developing innovative drugs and devices based on chemical reactions. If
   we could make photographing ion movement as simple as releasing the
   shutter on a digital camera, we could visualize unseen phenomena and
   contribute to creating a new industry. We has invented a simpler, more
   precise system that converts the quantity of ions into the quantity of
   electrons and allows changes in the ion distribution to be visualized in
   real time.}},

   as a way to reduce unemployment levels, and in line with the take-off of
   the digital economy in the world. Entrepreneurship education is still an

   universities. We describe our experience in running a summer school and
   mentoring the teams created in the context of the EU-XCeL project, and
   ICT focused project funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and
   Innovation Programme. From this experience, we extract some conclusions

   different Degrees studies, mainly Engineering and Business, for
   improving the experience and the course outcomes, especially for

Abstract = {{Large array systems are more and more often chosen for multiple
   applications. This includes AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array)
   which brings the benefit of steering electronically the transmitted
   radio-wave beam through constructive and destructive interference
   between the different channel output - for a transmitter - or input -
   for a receiver. Another example is MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)
   systems. Multiple channels are used to improve the transmission
   capability as well as mitigate and compensate noise effect in the
   transmission medium. These kinds of system can reach up to 100s of
   channels and thus are interested into products that are easy enough to
   implement on a large scale. They also require synchronization between
   channels to be able to control the steering for AESA system or be able
   to transmit the data correctly for MIMO systems. In parallel to the
   large array systems, direct conversion is progressively adopted in order
   to bring new SDR (Software Defined Radio) capabilities to the system,
   translating into flexibility at the application level. In such kind of
   systems, the driving characteristic is the data converter input - for
   ADC (Analog to Digital Convert) - and output - for DAC (Digital to
   Analog Convert) bandwidth. This paper will offer an overview of AESA and
   MIMO systems associated with direct conversion and their benefits at
   application level. It will then present and explain a few features that
   are essential for these types of application at the data converter
   level. It will use the example of the EV12AD500 a dual-channel 1.5GSps
   12 bits ADC by Teledyne e2v offering direct conversion capabilities up
   to the C-band. It will cover in particular serial interfaces with the
   ESIstream (Efficient Serial Interface) protocol and an innovative
   multi-component synchronization method making possible and easier the
   development of such complex system, as well as present performance
   result to demonstrate the C-band direct conversion capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low cost and high data rate downlink transmitter
   at X-band for micro satellite remote sensing applications. The 2W X-band
   transmitter is developed for 412.5Mbps data rate with 8PSK/4D-TCM 8PSK
   modulation to satisfy the LEO satellite link budget requirement at 561
   Km and BER performance of 10e-11. The proposed X-band transmitter
   consists of the digital modulation baseband signal generator and the
   up-converter with 2W RF solid state power amplifier (SSPA). A high data
   rate QPSK/8PSK baseband signal generator with high efficiency, small
   distortion, and digital filters is developed in FPGAs. An innovative
   concept for NSPO micro-satellite X-band downlink system development is
   the 2W RF solid state transmitter combined with a high gain antenna and
   pointing mechanism. Both the output power spectrum and the EVM for 450
   Mbps 8PSK signal at 8200 MHz center frequency have been demonstrated
   separately. The performances are prominent for the micro-satellite data
   downlink system applications.}},

Abstract = {{Ever-evolving technologies allow modern libraries to introduce multiple
   digital devices to enable readers to more easily find their desired
   hooks. However, the cognitive abilities of children might bring about
   incorrect use of these devices. Therefore, it is imperative that
   libraries pursue innovative service such as smart book-finding
   specifically designed for children to accommodate their needs.
   In this study we employed expert interviews and current product analysis
   to examine the informational architecture, graphical user interface and
   interaction over smaller interfaces, thus formulating guidelines for the
   design of smaller interfaces. We also designed a book-finding user
   interface and navigation flow of the smartwatch interface based on the
   proposed guidelines. These will be applied in children's libraries to
   enable young readers to complete hook-finding tasks with the aid a
   smartwatch. This development is of great value to children's libraries
   and serves as reference for smaller interface design.}},

Abstract = {{In the fast moving digital world, it becomes imperative to constantly
   come up with innovation in digitization. The analog to digital converter
   is the second most widely used device in the world of electronic
   circuits. ADCs are composed of dynamic comparators. To overcome the
   challenges faced due to the digital change, improved versions of the
   conventional comparator design for high-speed functioning and low power
   consumption has been proposed. Area is another main factor when keeping
   in mind the design of these dynamic comparators. 180 nm CMOS technology
   and a constant supply voltage of 0.8V have been used. A conventional
   double tail comparator has been designed by adding transistors without
   hindering the functionality. This provides faster, more efficient
   modification of the comparator design. A new design for a dynamic
   regenerative double-tail comparator has been proposed which uses
   clockgating techniques. This further reduces the power consumption and
   provides higher speed by reducing the delay time of the circuit.}},

   is exploding. Massive information may be a lot of quoted term nowadays,
   and a lot and a lot of firms' are craving for helpful applications of
   the volumes of information they generate daily. Several enterprises
   additionally struggle with this trend, as historically they need not
   captured information that's generated within the course of doing
   business. As firms explore for ways that to differentiate themselves in
   their markets, potency in exploitation massive information has become a
   central basis of competition. For businesses that have a lot of
   information data, the dawn of latest techniques in data processing and
   analytics is commencing to facilitate them answer their consumers' wants
   very accurately. Enterprises also are setting out to use these
   technologies to reinforce their price chain and internal operations to
   new levels of potency. Each business is aware that it must leverage
   client information, however few grasp the potential. It is to rework
   business processes, selections and performance. Ancient approaches in
   feature detection and information prediction that use modelling and
   optimization are steady being condemned by machine intelligence-allowing
   for multiple layering of data and evolved learning-ultimately resulting
   in a lot of correct insight for creating business selections. Digital
   genetics may be a key tool in developing such intelligence}},

Abstract = {{Digital signage in general refers to the provision of content
   (advertisements, news, assistance) on electronic scoreboards or large
   displays in places where many people are present or passing by. The more
   this content is expected to be tailored for specific user groups, the
   more context information is required, like, e.g., the preferences or
   profiles of target users or user groups. The ideal digital signage
   solution would be able to provide individualized content for the
   audience consuming the information at any time: if only one person is
   present, the content would be personalized for this person; if a group
   of persons is present the demand of all should be met. Based on a
   digital signage solution for elevator doors, the paper investigates the
   intersecting of preferences as a contribution to determine the most
   relevant content for a group of users. This intersection of preferences
   serves as a basis for new business models for interactive elevator
   digital signage. The main contributions of the paper are (1) an
   industrial case of digital business model innovation motivating
   contextual digital signage, (2) a technical approach for intersecting
   personal preferences, and (3) a methodical approach for digital business
   model innovation.}},

Abstract = {{In recent times, major cybersecurity breaches and cyber fraud had huge
   negative impact on victim organisations. The biggest impact made on
   major areas of business activities. Majority of organisations facing
   cybersecurity adversity and advanced threats suffers from huge financial
   and reputation loss. The current security technologies, policies and
   processes are providing necessary capabilities and cybersecurity
   mechanism to solve cyber threats and risks. However, current solutions
   are not providing required mechanism for decision making on impact of
   cybersecurity breaches and fraud. In this paper, we are reporting
   initial findings and proposing conceptual solution. The paper is aiming
   to provide a novel model for Cybersecurity Economics and Analysis (CEA).
   We will contribute to increasing harmonization of European cybersecurity
   initiatives and reducing fragmented practices of cybersecurity solutions
   and also helping to reach EU Digital Single Market goal. By introducing
   Cybersecurity Readiness Level Metrics the project will measure and
   increase effectiveness of cybersecurity programs, while the cost-benefit
   framework will help to increase the economic and financial viability,
   effectiveness and value generation of cybersecurity solutions for
   organisation's strategic, tactical and operational imperative. The
   ambition of the research development and innovation (RDI) is to increase
   and re-establish the trust of the European citizens in European digital
   environments through practical solutions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce a new methodology to enable the creation of
   massive open online laboratories. The presented solution is based on an
   innovative I/O-ports virtualization and interconnection component called
   Cloud-Lab Weaver. This is an advanced I/O interconnection component to
   interconnect distributed online laboratories which reside in the cloud.
   The main advantage of such a component is its ability to create virtual
   connections between analog and digital signal ports of online
   laboratories which are physically distributed. By creating this
   possibility, it becomes feasible to create new online laboratories by
   chaining the physical analog and digital I/O ports of existing online
   lab-experiments over the cloud. The paper concludes by presenting the
   Lab-Composer environment which demonstrates the possibilities of this
   new methodology.}},

Abstract = {{In digital era, citizen has higher expectation on public sector
   services. Excellence services and delivery system are expected from
   them. Towards this, the need to have a good system such as Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP) system as evidence in private sector is one of
   the crucial efforts. Prior researches especially in private sectors have
   recorded various benefits of implementing ERP systems among others, fast
   data processing, higher integration, up to date information, higher
   staff satisfaction, better governance and transparency and reduce
   operating cost. This study focused on the impact of ERP via ePBT system
   in the local agencies (LAs) of Malaysia. ePBT was developed to improve
   the delivery of LAs via the usage of information, communication and
   technology (ICT). It has been implemented by Malaysian Administrative
   Modernisation and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU) and Local Government
   Department (LGD), at various stages. This study used a questionnaire
   survey distributed to LAs' organization in Peninsular Malaysia that are
   currently utilizing the ePBT system, and drew a total response of 52.53
   percent. The impact of this system was analyzed based on opinions
   received by LAs' accountants, who are mostly the main user of this
   system. There four dimensions of ePBT impacts which are based on DeLone
   and McLean IS success model (system and information quality) and the BSC
   measurement model (internal business and innovation \& learning
   perspectives). This study provides a better understanding regarding the
   impact of ERP implementation in the context of LAs in Malaysian public
   sector. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the paper is to analyse and discuss the foundational ideas of
   the current Industry 4.0 concept in the context of the realities of the
   Usti nad Labem region. Currently, the Usti nad Labem region is generally
   perceived as an area with a number of major socio-economic problems. As
   compared to other regions of the Czech Republic, the region's economic
   performance is below average. Industry 4.0 represents a great
   opportunity for the future development and increase in the
   competitiveness of this industrially-oriented region. The question is to
   what extent the region is ready for the changes connected with
   automation, digitalisation, or robotisation, and what changes it should
   go through in the future in order for the possible ideas and some of the
   Industry 4.0 processes already under way to be successfully implemented.
   Due to the fact that Industry 4.0 is a very complex and comprehensive
   concept, this paper focuses on four key selected factors on which
   Industry 4.0 puts the most emphasis. These comprise research,
   development and innovation, human resources, education, and
   infrastructure. Therefore, the specific aim is to analyse these four
   factors in the territory of the Usti nad Labem region, and point out the
   necessary changes related to the commencement of Industry 4.0. It is
   apparent from the performed analysis that the Usti nad Labem region
   suffers from a lack of capacity (in the field of science and research,
   human resources, or in the qualification structure and communication
   infrastructure) and an insufficient involvement of the stakeholders
   themselves (company owners and management, workers, but also the young
   generation).}},

Abstract = {{Innovative marketing is a process that fosters the innovation of
   products and services based on the wishes of existing and potential
   customers. In the environment of Industrie 4.0, this mainly means
   marketing innovation based on a connection between the virtual cyber
   world and the world of physical reality. The article is based on
   research of marketing innovation and Industrie 4.0. The research was
   used to compile a scenario for a primary qualitative study. The focus
   group study was composed of representatives from 32 Czech companies
   chosen from the database of firms that publicly acknowledge the use of
   Industrie 4.0. The groups were divided based on the size of the
   companies. An evaluation using the method of content analysis produced a
   list of twelve main attributes that can be identified as essential
   marketing innovations connected with digitalisation. These determined
   attributes were briefly explained and electronically compared among the
   representatives of the participating companies, a necessary step given
   that the composed attributes uncovered latent information learned from
   the focus group. The responsible company representatives approved the
   resulting list and they also added a scale of importance. Following a
   statistical evaluation, a ranking of importance was compiled and
   subsequently statistically tested. The tests demonstrated that
   statistically significant differences exist among three attributes; the
   tests concerned the dependence of responses on the size of the
   companies. The results from the study showed that the representatives of
   companies with headquarters in the Czech Republic are aware of the
   content of Industrie 4.0. It also revealed that marketing innovation
   accompanies these great changes.}},

Abstract = {{Here in the Philippines, the motorcycle is in demand even though that
   this type of transportation has the highest risk and prone to accidents
   compared to other mode of transportation. A motorcycle-related accident
   investigation sometimes lacks accuracy due to some inaccurate evidences.
   Basically, one example of that is when the accident happens in rural
   areas where there is no witness. Having this kind of dilemma, the
   researcher decided to innovate the way of collecting data by developing
   a Motorcycle Data Logging System with Visual Basic Data Simulation for
   Accident Analysis. The prototype has two separate devices to be
   connected to the motorcycle body and a helmet.
   First is the device connected to the motorcycle, it has a controller
   module which accept data coming from the sensors (such as hall effect
   sensor, gyroscope, brake detector, ultrasonic sensors) then processes it
   and save it to the memory module. The memory module can be plugged out
   during an investigation and plug into a computer. A Data Logger
   Application was made to easily present and simulate the data saved on
   the Secure Digital Card (SD card) for accident analysis. Second is the
   device attached to the helmet, it has its own controller to process data
   coming from alcohol detector. A Bluetooth Transmitter (TX) and Receiver
   (RX) will also be connected to each controller to send processed data to
   the device attached to the motorcycle. A camera is also added to the
   helmet; it will record and capture images which can also be used as
   evidence.
   After different test on the accuracy of data collected from different
   sensors, it can be concluded that the prototype is successfully designed
   and meets the objective of the study.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of a society where digital information exchange is
   developing, it's essential to be able to take advantage of secured
   system in order to protect personal and confidential data, assure the
   security of financial \& commercial transactions, arrangement of
   contracts without the need of hard copies. Encryption technologies,
   nowadays, are well-known for being essential tools of security \&
   confidence in terms of electronic communications.
   Cryptology is a revolutionary domain: historically used in military \&
   diplomatic fields, has become civil \& integrated in our daily life. Sim
   cards, E-commerce, TV, \& Radiotelephony rely on it. It's completely
   linked to the security in our societies: networks security, PCs, medical
   files, electronic signature. It took its particular importance in
   parallel with the integration of internet in securing commercial
   transactions, guaranteeing the confidentiality of information and in
   protecting personal life.
   Cryptography has been a very wide subject with numerous encryption
   algorithms, which insure Integrity, privacy and vulnerability in order
   to protect telecommunication system. These algorithms are available \&
   accessible to everyone, but with time, they became very old and their
   level of security started to reduce, which made them easy victims
   against hacking \& decryption. This is how our idea of inventing a new
   encryption algorithm came. Its principles are more sophisticated than
   the previous ones \& grant strong security against hacking in relation
   with real factors (time \& temperature).}},

   states of a user, increasing the combined recommendation and repository
   use efficiency. The learning algorithm takes into account the results of
   the cognitive and neural modelling of users' decision behaviour.
   Inspirations from nature used in recommendation systems differ from the
   usual mimicking the biological neural processes. Specifically, a
   cognitive knowledge recommender may follow a strategy to discover
   emotional patterns in user behaviour and then adjust the recommendation
   procedure accordingly. The knowledge of cognitive decision mechanisms
   helps to optimize recommendation goals. Other cognitive recommendation
   procedures assist users in creating consistent learning or research
   groups. The primary application field of the above algorithms is a large
   knowledge repository coupled with an innovative training platform
   developed within an ongoing Horizon 2020 research project.}},

Abstract = {{Creative Industries have largely contributed to employment, GDP growth
   and social cohesion, even during recent economic crises. Despite their
   relevance, there is a lack for monitoring the impacts, especially for
   new technologies involved into their business. The paper aims to
   appraise it when specifically related to the use of Big Data. It
   evaluates the considerable economic benefit on creative business
   performance linked to exploiting vast new flows of information. A multi-
   criteria methodology for assessing these effects on Creative Industries,
   and a model for implementing business performance through collaborative
   and virtual value chains are presented. The model shows positive
   spillovers resulting from the collaboration among Digital Creative
   Industries usually in the fields of innovation, technology and
   intellectual property benefitting from Big Data applications,
   distinguishing a macro from a microeconomic level of effectiveness,
   since transforming data into captured value for the firms, despite their
   size and volume capacity, increases business performance.}},

Abstract = {{The urgency behind this research is twofold. Firstly, the on-going
   development of an aging society could potentially lead to a 40\%
   workforce reduction in the Dutch public sector, and with insufficient
   financing in the healthcare sector requires a participatory society in
   which citizens will need to start taking more responsibility regarding
   their healthcare. Secondly, we also live in an information society,
   which keeps developing itself. This brings new and innovative digital
   opportunities and information services, which potentially makes a
   participatory society viable. Yet, the development of such opportunities
   also brings new design requirements since systems world and life-world
   are converging. Based on an explorative study one of the requirements
   appeared the creation of clear conditions regarding the
   comprehensibility, usability and integration of such information
   technologies. More specifically, this would mean creating digitally
   accessible and usable terminologies in order for citizens and
   governmental bodies and professionals to work together for the quality
   of life. For healthcare this would mean creating so-called a
   citizen/consumer health vocabulary, a machine-readable standardized list
   of terms which links `lay-language' and the standard terms of
   professional terminologies.}},

Title = {{The Regulatory Challenges of `Uberization' in China: Classifying
   Ride-Hailing Drivers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LABOUR LAW AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{269-294}},
Abstract = {{There has been nascent litigation around the world on the employment
   classification of workers in the `sharing economy', `gig economy' or `on
   demand economy'. New business models and forms of work organization
   arising from rapid advancements in digital technologies (or `disruptive
   innovation' as some have described the phenomenon) have sparked
   considerable debate on a wide array of regulatory issues, including the
   role of labour law protections for the emergent `digital workforce'.
   This debate is currently taking place in the People's Republic of China.
   This article analyses how Chinese courts and lawmakers have addressed
   issues that are directly or indirectly relevant to determining the
   status of drivers in the ride-hailing sector. Despite the presence of
   criteria for identifying a `labour relationship' under Chinese labour
   law, the courts have not adopted a uniform approach across different
   types of claims involving these drivers. A new government regulation on
   the ride-hailing sector, which took effect in November 2016, has not
   resolved this issue as it permits ride-hailing platform companies to
   enter into labour contracts and other forms of agreements with drivers
   based on the particularities of their work arrangements. In considering
   these recent cases and regulatory developments, the article concludes
   that a purposive approach to the existing criteria in Chinese labour law
   for ascertaining the status of workers in the sharing economy is useful
   for addressing the basic question of whether they should be protected,
   rather than creating `new' categories of employment classification.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter introduces open digital innovation contests that aim to
   develop digital services. Key stakeholders in such contests are
   identified: organisers, participants, resource providers, and
   beneficiaries. A classification of digital innovation contests is
   proposed based on the length of a contest and its inclusiveness. Other
   design elements of contests are also discussed, including media, target
   group and evaluation. It is argued that innovation contests can be
   viewed as innovation intermediaries that help to connect actors in an
   innovation system. Advantages and disadvantages of innovation contests
   are discussed. Finally, six contests are introduced, which serve as
   running examples throughout the book.
   Open digital innovation contests are competitions that aim to develop
   digital services. Based on the work by Hjalmarsson and Rudmark (2012),
   they can be described as events in which external developers compete to
   design and implement innovative and solid digital service prototypes,
   based on digital resources made available by the organiser. There are
   three key ingredients in this definition. First, the participants of the
   contests are to be external developers, i.e. developers outside the
   organisation that arranges the competition. In this way, new categories
   of people are drawn into the innovation system around an organisation,
   thereby enabling open innovation. Furthermore, the goal is to develop a
   digital service prototype; it is not sufficient just to suggest a new
   idea or create a product without digital content. Finally, the service
   developed is to be based on digital resources made available by the
   organiser.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter deals with how innovation barriers after a contest can be
   managed if the organizer of the contest has decided to provide support
   also after the contest itself has ended. As starting point, a survey of
   such barriers to innovation is presented together with approaches for
   managing such barriers. The management approach is described from a
   contest organizers perspective, and includes an activity description
   followed by a running example. Finally, a read more section presents the
   theoretical base for the innovation barrier approach. Manage Innovation
   Barriers is the second activity in the post contest phase. After the
   contest, the deployment of a digital service will be structured
   according to a decided post contest strategy. See Chap. 12, Develop
   strategy, for managing the relationship between the organisers and the
   former participants. Different barriers can hinder a post contest
   deployment project to transform a prototype to an operational digital
   service ready for market entry.}},

Abstract = {{Gesture recognition has been an attractive area of research since a long
   time. With the introduction of Microsoft Kinect, hand gesture and body
   gesture recognition has become handy for the researchers. Here an
   innovative application has been presented which controls all electrical
   home appliances through hand gestures. The algorithm presented here is
   an assistive application useful for physically challenged and senior
   citizens. In this paper we have used Microsoft Kinect for image
   capturing along with some important computer vision (CV) and digital
   image processing techniques (DIP) for hand gesture recognition. Arduino
   Uno microcontroller and relay circuits are used for controlling
   electrical devices. The algorithm presented gives an accuracy of 88 \%.}},

Abstract = {{As a constituent part of the China's intangible culture, Tibetan folk
   dance contains unique national culture. Because Tibetan folk dance keep
   up its cultural inheritance mainly by depending on its body language,
   which is inconvenient to its propagation an development, however, as a
   new carrier, the digital media brings forth new ideas to its cultural
   form and realized the culture reproduction. This paper mainly discuss:
   through the digital animation creation, conduct the new output of the
   dance culture, realize the maximization of the culture propagation, and
   explore the better way combining the digital media technology and the
   dance prototype culture as well as the appropriate combination degree.
   The digital animation creation, which takes the Tibetan folk dance as
   prototype, is the innovation of its form and the culture reproduction in
   the new era for the Tibetan folk dance culture; in the case of national
   culture, it is a trial of digital recreation conducted by taking the
   cultural elements as the prototypes, which can provide a new possibility
   for the inheritance and development of the national culture.}},

Abstract = {{Estonia has enjoyed success stories in ICT implementation in a broad
   field of public and private sectors for last 15-20 years. The key event
   for that development was the launching of the Tiger Leap program in
   Estonian schools, 1996. The program fully equipped schools with
   computers and Internet access and other ICT services. Computer science
   classes were provided in 84\% of schools in the following eight years.
   Since 2014 World Economic Forum considered Estonia among
   innovation-driven knowledge-based societies, and some years later -being
   hidden entrepreneurship champion in Europe. Besides, Estonia has become
   one of the developed startup ecosystems where young ICT companies are
   booming.
   These events mentioned above refer to the successful combination of
   educational and entrepreneurial ecosystems in Estonia. The paper aims to
   disclose the role of ICT as the engine of the innovation-driven
   development in a small society. Findings of the study show a growing
   importance of digital technology, ICT startups and the entrepreneurial
   ecosystem in the welfare of Estonian citizens.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the research objectives of the enCOMPASS project,
   which aims at implementing and validating an integrated socio-technical
   approach to behavioural change for energy saving. To this end,
   innovative user-friendly digital tools will be developed to 1) make
   energy data consumption available and understandable for different types
   of users and stakeholders (household residents, office employees, school
   pupils, building managers, utilities, ICT providers) and to 2) empower
   them to collaborate in order to achieve energy savings and manage their
   energy needs in efficient, cost-effective and comfort-preserving ways.
   The project will demonstrate how this can be achieved with a novel
   approach that integrates user-centered visualisation of energy data from
   smart sensors and user-generated information with context-aware
   collaborative recommendations for energy saving, intelligent control and
   adaptive gamified incentives enabling effective and sustained
   behavioural change.}},

Abstract = {{The development and innovative application of digital research methods
   in humanities disciplines, characterised as Digital Humanities or
   e-Humanities, is an established feature of the e-Science and e-Research
   landscape. Typically these digital methods enable existing research
   questions to be tackled in new ways, at a scale and speed that transcend
   manual methods. In this paper we present a different approach to the
   application of digital techniques to humanities research, a branch of
   experimental humanities in which digital experiments bring insight and
   engagement with historical scenarios and in turn influence our
   understanding and our thinking today. We illustrate this through a
   series of experiments and demonstrations inspired by the work of Ada
   Lovelace and Charles Babbage, including simulation of the Analytical
   Engine, use of a web-based music application, construction of hardware,
   and reproduction of earlier mathematical results using contemporary
   computational methods.}},

Abstract = {{A relatively recent innovation in the domain of digital filtering has
   been the introduction of signal processing applications with effective
   power utilization. No scope towards the effective and efficient
   architecture realization with existing part of literature, and hence
   investigation is made and is confined with cascade form of filter
   design. In this paper, architectures are realized based on common set of
   specifications to arrive at the high performance recursive filter for
   low power applications using Xilinx System Generator. Infinite Impulse
   Response (IIR) filters can be realized in many forms those are Direct
   form-I, Direct form-II, Cascade, parallel form. All these structures
   provide a space for selection of an appropriate architecture for
   reduction of power consumption and improvement in speed of digital
   filters. In this particular work, a 5th order low pass IIR filter is
   realized in Direct form-I, Direct form-II, Cascade form (Direct
   form-I/Direct form-II) as an example of the methodology in a Xilinx FPGA
   device. Also corresponding power analysis was performed and finally
   concluded that cascade (Direct form-I) realization is the best technique
   to implement higher order IIR filters when power is a main constraint,
   cascade (Direct form-II) technique is best with area and speed as
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on communication in mobility have been taking importance as the
   access to contents has been consolidated among users in all the strata
   and social and cultural levels. In the last ten years, acceleration in
   the technological innovations in mobile telephony was produced. This has
   had its corollary in the corresponding interest in investigating its
   relationship with the diffusion of news contents and, in general terms,
   with social communication. This communication explains the impact of
   mobile telephony on journalism. We reveal the aspect of this device as a
   news medium and present the context of the vertiginous social expansion
   that digital mobile technologies have nowadays. Our objective is to
   disclose this new communicational phenomenon, where the media are
   usually making their incursions very slowly.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates an innovative variable fractional rate Digital
   Down Converter(DDC) architecture for satellite communication where the
   carrier frequency and output sample rate can be changed dynamically at
   run time. The proposed algorithm is highly modular and generic so that
   the DDC can decimate by any fractional ratio i. e. the ADC sampling rate
   may be any integer or non-integer multiple of output sample rate from
   DDC. The algorithm is verified by evaluating the bit error rate(BER)
   performance of Binary Phase Shift Keying(BPSK) modulation with
   theoretical BER in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
   in Matlab. Xilinx FPGA (Kintex-7) realizes the novel DDC hardware along
   with the demodulator implemented in DSP processor which performs timing
   synchronization, frequency offset estimation and correction. Though the
   primary use of the design is in satellite communication, the same
   applies to other multi-standard radio based communication like GSM,
   CDMA, WCDMA, WiMAX, LTE.}},

Abstract = {{E-commerce is the new growing technology in the field of trade systems.
   One of novelty technologies in such area, is an e-coin scheme. The
   e-coin transfer scheme denotes a practical innovation which allows to
   complete the e-operations. In this paper, it presents an efficient
   e-coin scheme based on an elliptic curve. In order to secure the
   incorrupt clients of an e-coin scheme should utilizes the blind
   signature protocol. The proposed scheme requires a trusted authority to
   trace the corrupt participants. It claims that the proposed scheme is
   more efficient compare with already existed schemes}},

Abstract = {{Electronic courseware is an important tool for teachers to impart
   knowledge to students, and an innovative education mode in the
   environment of multimedia, but the courseware in the modern class only
   stays in the visual display stage of knowledge points, audio-video,
   animation and other elements, and is lack of interaction of multimedia
   courseware. The design is based on the interaction between teachers and
   students, students and students, and the popularity of mobile electronic
   devices, combined with image-processing and typesetting tools to
   designed a course which will meet the teaching demands, applying the
   FounderFX 6.0 digital version to realize the static effects of pages,
   and then according to the user experience, to realize the interactive
   effects, finally release it to the mobile terminal to assist the
   classroom teaching. The design makes full use of multimedia technology
   to transfer the interactive courseware to the mobile terminal, and
   students are really participate in the curriculum, which has provided a

   construction of an administrative and institutional process that could
   innovate the metropolitan territories with a strategic development
   approach.
   The new ``Territorial Authorities of the wide areas{''} will need to
   take and actualize the Strategic Metropolitan Plan with a territorial
   planning looking more closely at infrastructures, coordinated management
   of the public services, development of mobility and viability systems
   and structures, coordination of urban planning, promotion of economic
   and social development, strenghtening the information and digital
   systems.
   The Metropolitan City of Bari is a wide area with a strong polycentric
   weave constituted by 41 municipalities, some of them having a
   significant dimension, placed around the regional capital and organized
   in two coronas supplementary to the open spaces of the country side,
   sometimes compromised with a situation of sprawl and land consumption,

   Taiwan's economic developments are mainly based on Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT). However, some Taiwanese in specific
   areas are still left behind the new information era. Therefore, the
   purpose of this study is to discuss public policies for governmental
   intervention regarding the diffusion of the ICT, digital divide, fair
   digital opportunities, popularization of digital applications, and
   Internet in Taiwan. Also, the profile and management system of Digital
   Opportunity Centers (DOC) and digital learning partners were discussed
   from the MOE level to the local level by community approach.
   Furthermore, this study analyzed the experience and achievement of DOC
   projects and digital learning projects in Taiwan. Finally, this study
   demonstrated that DOC certainly plays an important role in the fields of
   education, economy, society, and culture. The successful experiences of
   DOC have encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{Digital natives are born into an information-dense resource-plentiful
   world, which greatly stimuluses their numerous needs with regard to
   libraries. Children have insufficient conceptual framework of knowledge
   and hard to understand the correlation between call numbers and themes.
   Young readers need an interactive, learning environment to enable them
   to find the books which are interested in by thematic order. Researchers
   apply the Cognitive-developmental theory and children's information
   seeking behaviors into the invention of a mixed-reality futuristic
   library for children using cutting-edge technologies. We first created a
   visualized children's book classified system using facet structured
   thesaurus, and employed beacon indoor positioning technologies to locate
   categorization of themes in non-linear arrangement of bookshelves. We
   then designed navigation interfaces to help children search for books
   using smartwatches. An integration of RFID smart bookshelf for popular
   books (placed in thematic-random-order), and visualized browsing
   interfaces were designed for children. Digital wall screens in
   clustering (inspired) and categorization (discovering) representations
   developed to recommend books for children in different
   cognitive-development groups. For children learning library-use
   instruction in a virtual-world environment, we created a mixed-reality
   corridor, in which children were immersed in interactive games and learn
   what the classification numbers mean. The world children live in is a
   three-dimensional space. Children at the concrete operational stage of
   development are apt to use their experiences in this physical world to
   navigate virtual worlds. Researchers proposed and examined various
   spatial-metadata schemes for a mixed-reality environment designed for
   children to find books. Smart library with innovative technologies has
   the power to transform information-seeking behavior and brings libraries
   to life, allowing children readers to benefit from digital learning in a
   state-of-the-art library environment.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the rapid changes that are taking place in the digital
   computer and the graphic display technology employed in a modern human
   system interface, the use of integrated digital display devices to
   replace traditional instruments has become a new application tendency in
   nuclear power plant. The safety control and display device (refer as to
   SCID hereafter) is a safety class digital Human System Interface (HSI)
   device of FirmSys platform. It provides display and control function of
   the safety system in ACPR1000 nuclear power plant. This paper mainly
   introduces the typical application architecture of SCUD in ACPR1000 NPP,
   the main functions (including control and display function, application
   mode management function, data processing function and data
   communication function) of SICD and the innovation and improvement of
   SCID. The application of SCID has improved the integration of the HMI
   system and reduced the workload of the operating staff. It has been
   successfully applied in several ACPR1000 nuclear power plants.}},

Abstract = {{Educational games have been used as an innovative instructional strategy
   in order to achieve learning more effectively in Software Engineering
   (SE) education. However, it is essential to systematically evaluate such
   games in order to obtain sound evidence on their benefits. And,
   although, several SE games have been evaluated adopting diverse research
   designs and measurements, so far no larger scale study across different
   games has been conducted. In this respect, this article presents a
   comprehensive analysis in order to summarize empirical evidence on the
   benefits of digital and non-digital games used for SE education. The
   analysis is based on data collected from 43 case studies that use MEEGA,
   the most commonly used model for educational game evaluation, evaluating
   20 different SE games, involving a total population of 723 students. Our
   analysis indicate evidence that digital and non-digital games can yield
   a positive effect on the learning of SE, providing a pleasant and
   engaging experience to the students and motivate them. Our analysis also
   points out that non-digital games more easily seem to promote a more
   positive experience, principally in terms of fun and social interaction
   than the digital ones used for teaching SE. These results may guide SE
   instructors in the selection of educational games as instructional
   methods and guide game creators with respect to the development of new
   games.}},

Abstract = {{In the present situation huge advancement of android programming and
   equipment innovations, the world has been digitized. Security issues are
   a major test to all concerned. The quick development of the advanced
   mobile phone and getting to different types of touchy substance has
   prompted to the rise of another and continually changing risk scene.
   Most of the attackers are using hacking techniques to get private
   information about their personal life using such gadget. As the features
   of such gadgets increase, their vulnerability also increases and makes
   them prone towards security threats. The encryption of data is a
   technique to achieve the confidentiality of the data in these gadgets. A
   variety of algorithm like AES, DES, and RSA are used to achieve the
   confidentiality in the data. In this paper we are using Elliptical curve
   cryptography technique for sending the encrypted message from one
   android smart phone to another android smart phone also we compare the
   elliptical curve cryptography with the RSA algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Descriptive Geometry forms the foundation of the science of
   representation, and has supported designers, engineers, architects and
   artists throughout the centuries. Its understanding has provided the
   basis to control three-dimensional shapes in space and their
   reproduction through recognizable bi-dimensional images. In this paper
   an extreme case of representation will be discussed, the intriguing and
   infallible technique of Anamorphosis. This is a form of representation
   that takes advantage of linear perspective in order to achieve a
   distorted and disrupted image, or three-dimensional configuration, which
   appears as a regular form only when it is observed from a specific point
   in space, or with the aid of mediating devices, displaying a figure
   which was previously unrecognizable. Known empirically from the
   beginning of the sixteenth century, Jean Francois NIaRON was the
   catalyst of this topic.
   The most challenging aim of the underlying research is the
   identification of an algorithmic digital system able to automatically
   generate this type of representation.}},

Abstract = {{Digital innovations in finance, loosely known as ``fintech{''}, have
   garnered a great deal of attention across the financial industry.
   Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is one such innovation that has been
   cited as a means of transforming payment, clearing and settlement (PCS)
   processes, including how funds are transferred and how securities,
   commodities and derivatives are cleared and settled. An important goal
   of this paper is to examine how this technology might be used in the
   area of PCS, and to identify both the opportunities and challenges
   facing its practical implementation and possible long-term adoption. DLT
   has the potential to provide new ways of transferring and recording the
   ownership of digital assets; immutably and securely storing information;
   providing for identity management; and facilitating other evolving
   operations through peer-to-peer networking, access to a distributed but
   common ledger among participants and cryptography. Potential use cases
   in PCS include cross-border payments and the post-trade clearing and
   settlement of securities. These use cases could address operational and
   financial frictions around existing services. Nonetheless, the
   industry's understanding and application of this technology is still in
   its infancy, and stakeholders are taking a variety of approaches toward
   its development. Given the technology's early stage, a number of
   challenges to development and adoption remain, including how issues
   around business cases, technological hurdles, legal considerations and
   risk management considerations are addressed. To understand fast-moving
   developments in this area, a team of Federal Reserve staff conducted a
   series of discussions with approximately thirty organizations, including
   financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, technology
   start-ups, established technology firms and other government agencies.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative automotive systems require complex semiconductor devices
   currently only available in consumer grade quality. The European project
   TRACE will develop and demonstrate methods, processes, and tools to
   facilitate usage of Consumer Electronics (CE) components to be
   deployable more rapidly in the life-critical automotive domain. Consumer
   electronics increasingly use heterogeneous system integration methods
   and ``More than Moore{''} technologies, which are capable to combine
   different circuit domains (Analog, Digital, RF, MEMS) and which are
   integrated within SiP or 3D stacks. Making these technologies or at
   least some of the process steps available under automotive electronics
   requirements is an important goal to keep pace with the growing demand
   for information processing within cars. The approach presented in this
   paper aims at a technology management and recommendation system that
   covers technology data, functional and non-functional constraints, and
   application scenarios, and that will comprehend test planning and cost
   consideration capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{This assistant teaching system is based on advanced mobile AR technology
   applied in the practical teaching of course design of mechanical
   manufacturing. The assistant teaching system implements the function of
   superimposing the digital information over the real world, rotating and
   zooming the 3D model, showing the cross-sectional model and so on. In
   combination with the actual teaching requirements of course design of
   mechanical manufacturing, the function of arranging the process routes
   of the typical parts in course design of mechanical manufacturing
   process is designed. The assistant teaching system assists teachers to
   carry out some teaching work to alleviate the teaching burden of
   teachers. The practical application shows that the innovative mobile
   augmented reality teaching promotes students to understand the teaching
   content flexibly and enhance the quality of manufacturing technology
   course design. At the end of the paper, the typical part ``CA6140 lathe
   fork{''} is used as an example to introduce the function and operation
   of the system.}},

Abstract = {{The ATISS (Autonomous Flying Testbed for Integrated Sensor Systems) is a
   measurement unmanned aircraft vehicle-commonly known simply as
   ``drone{''}. The ATISS is a multi-purpose sensor carrier drone used for
   professional aerial photography, aerial surveying, air pollution
   measurements, etc., propelled by two carbon fiber propellers.
   The kinetic energy of these propellers can excite undesired vibration
   modes on these blades and excite the drone structure unless a careful
   design is chosen. Generally, a detailed modelling of the vibrational
   characteristics is needed for any aerospace component; for the
   successful correlation and validation of these models through
   experimental vibration testing. However, lightweight, innovative
   composite components such as carbon fiber propellers pose challenges on
   this validation cycle. Material non-linearities and non-proportional
   damping responses are inherent to composite materials and therefore, a
   further degree of precision on the testing and simulation is necessary
   for the successful validation of these components.
   The experimental modal analysis is performed by the combination of a 3D
   Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer and a scalable automatic modal hammer.
   The geometry used for the FE simulation is obtained by means of a 3D
   geometry scanner, a high resolution-digitalization is carried out on the
   tested rotor blade surface. The obtained points are reverse-engineered
   in a CAD model and imported into the FEA software. A further validation
   of the FE modal model would prove the successful implementation of these
   techniques on the study of the vibrational modes of composite
   lightweight structures.}},

Abstract = {{Smart phones with high resolution cameras have enabled innovative
   computer vision applications that apply techniques like real-time image
   processing and virtual reality to provide a close approximation of
   reality. In this paper, we present an Android application that allows
   users to play a virtual piano by using a keyboard drawn on a piece of
   paper. The application allows the user to point the camera of a hand
   held device towards the keyboard, and process image of the paper
   keyboard in real time. The application then detects fingers placed on a
   key and after key detection plays the corresponding sounds. Initial
   results demonstrate the potential of such an application in providing a
   viable replacement for heavy and expensive instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Pioneering developments in electrical engineering are based on
   inspirations from biology. They exhibit naturally an efficient
   information processing. For example, hardware realizations of memristive
   circuits mimicking the anticipatory behavior of unicellular organisms
   like amoebas have been developed in this context. Unfortunately,
   circuits are not appropriate for algorithms dedicated in the area of
   digital signal processing. We intended to get an algorithmic model of
   the anticipation circuit for utilizations in digital signal processing
   applications. In our approach we have applied the wave digital method to
   get a digital replica of the analog circuit. This offers several
   benefits, like the ability for preserving the passivity of the analog
   counterpart, the possibility for a parallel processing approach,
   efficiency, and robustness of the resulting algorithmic model. The
   memristive device of the original circuit has been replaced by a novel
   multilevel memristor model with suitable features for anticipation of
   digital patterns. The resulting algorithmic model offers innovative
   applications in e.g. robotics or artificial neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{In view of advancement in additive manufacturing (also known as 3D
   printing) technique, triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) emerges as
   innovative tool for designing porous bone scaffolds. However, use of
   common CAD software for the design of such complex structures are
   aggregately inefficient, time exhausting, and can lead to processing
   setbacks. In order to overcome such processing issues, this paper uses
   easy to implement implicit functions based methodology for creation of
   gyroid and diamond porous structures. Further, on successful generation
   of these scaffolds, generic STL format has been prepared. We introduce a
   method for generating periodic porous scaffolds frameworks from TPMS,
   which results in geometries that are easier to decompose into digital
   parts ready for direct 3D printing. The effect of changing Z factor (a
   linear term added to implicit functions used) and porosity percentage to
   meet the desired porosity is also shown. Through a range of design
   demonstration and rendering effect, the potential to design complex
   scaffolds is shown.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional imaging methods often separate the two technical procedures
   of optical system design and imaging processing, where the lens
   subsystem is firstly optimized using an optical measure of performance
   and the image processing subsystem is optimized subsequently, resulting
   in the failures in efficient cooperation between the optical and digital
   elements and missing of the optimal solution. Therefore, an innovative
   approach is presented to combine optical system design and image
   processing together to obtain high resolution images from the final
   system. In this paper, the theoretical foundations for this computing
   optical design method is analyzed by considering the modulation transfer
   functions (MTF) and aberrations. According to the wave aberration theory
   and Zernicke formula, the relationship between the point spread function
   (PSF) and a certain monochromatic aberration can be obtained. Fourier
   transformation is taken on these PSFs and then modulus value calculation
   is adopted to get the MTFs. By analyzing the MTFs of idealized optical
   systems, the influence of each monochromatic aberration on the image can
   be concluded. Note that some of the MTFs values have zeros and others do
   not. Considering that imaging processing algorithm cannot recover the
   information lost at such zeros, thus some aberrations can be easily
   corrected through imaging processing algorithm, while others not. Aimed
   at a single monochromatic aberrations respectively, the optical system
   with single lens is designed in ZEMAX software and the relevant imaging
   processing algorithm is adopted. From the comparison among the final
   images, the theoretical foundations for the computing optical design
   method considering the MTF and aberrations can be verified. The
   compensation for aberration of imaging processing can be utilized to
   reduce the pressure of optical system design. The computing optical
   design method provides a new approach to simplify structure and reduce
   cost, as well as to gain high resolution images simultaneously,
   especially for designing certain complex optical system, which shows
   promising perspective of industrial application.}},

Abstract = {{Inadequate internal communication and insufficient information transfer
   is already recognized as a non-value-adding waste. To achieve a higher
   value creation, an identification and categorization of information
   transfer is necessary. Common methods are unsuitable especially for
   visualizing information media disruptions and lead to errors in the
   added value. Moreover, media disruptions mostly cause redundancy and
   additional effort, which are reflected in non-value added activities.
   The Value Added Heat Map is a visualization tool that categorizes and
   visualize the information flow different from other visualization tools
   e.g. the value stream analysis. The first step in categorizing the
   information flow using the Value Added Heat Map is the value analysis of
   the information transmission. In a second step, the information flow is
   visualized in the factory layout depending on the value. The innovative
   method Value Added Heat Map is described and exemplarily applied to an
   information flow of a production shop floor. The results show that the
   Value Added Heat Map method can contribute to a better transparency of
   the often not fully documented internal information flows. This
   innovative approach enables the visualization of media disruptions via
   colour transitions and thus helps value added processes by identifying
   and eliminating possible sources of waste.}},

Abstract = {{A profound change is happening in the world of scholarly communication,
   where the object of scientific communication is no longer a linear text,

   actual transferred skills with attendant avalanche of youth
   unemployment. As it is, unemployment triggers and drives a number of
   issues especially in rural underserved communities. Using internet
   research tools and employing our long professional experiences working
   in the sector, this action research studies the various vectors
   contributing to the problem of unemployment, skill mismatch, ICT demand
   and supply vis-a-viz emerging knowledge economy and crafted the Cyber
   Rebel Fellowship Program that innovatively encapsulates identified
   success factors of existing schemes and accommodates new thinking and
   strategies perpendicular to unresolved vectors. We sought a paradigm
   shift in tackling the ICT supply and demand conundrum using the
   Social-Private Partnership -a variation of the Public-Private
   Partnership, as a chamber to convert each problem (ICT supply and
   demand) to the solution of the other through mobilizing inputs and
   resources from a wide range of stakeholders and applying same, to
   provide inclusive skill supply catalysis and demand uptakes especially
   in rural underserved communities.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread introduction of lightweight IT-smartphones, tablets, the
   Internet of Things, and the growth of third-party app developers-has
   become a challenge for many organizations. Local units and end-users
   increasingly are acquiring and implementing lightweight IT outside the
   realm of the IT function. The trend is driven by competent users' need
   for innovative IT services, enabled by the consumerization of digital
   technologies. Lightweight IT entails exciting business opportunities;
   however, guidance for managers on how to deal with this development has
   been very limited. In this paper, we investigate which IT governance
   models organizations can apply to manage lightweight IT. The managerial
   challenge is to balance the innovative potential of lightweight IT with
   the requirements of good governance. Building on the particular
   challenges of lightweight IT and the extant literature on end-user
   computing, we present a framework with four alternative governance
   models. We evaluate the framework through four e-health case studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative architecture of photonics-based RF
   scanning receiver that exploits a digital feed-forward noise
   cancellation method for removing the beat noise between the lasers used
   in the scheme, instead of a complex laser locking mechanism as in a
   previous implementation. Moreover, compared with conventional
   channelized implementations, it reaches wide operating frequency range
   and reduced encumbrance, avoiding the need for bulky RF components such
   as RF filter banks and synthesizers. An experimental validation shows an
   RF input range of 0 divided by 27.5 GHz and instantaneous bandwidth of 2
   GHz. Further developments will increase the range over 40 GHz.
   Implementing the scheme through integrated photonics technologies will
   reach high environmental stability and reduced size weight and power
   consumption, meeting the increasing requirements of wideband real-time
   RF signal analysis.}},

   database, and then the paper-cut symbols are summarized. Now we put them
   into computer aided design software of CDDataBase, and we can use
   CorelDRAW for graphic expression and artistic design. Secondly, the
   virtual digital museum display system is constructed by using the 3D
   model database. At the same time we can create a digital platform for
   Mangshi Dai paper-cut art, in order to maximize the utilization of
   resources and sharing. Finally, using WeChat, weibo, community sites and
   other mediums of the Web platform to connect digital Dai paper-cut art
   with social docking platform can make public deeply understand Dai
   paper-cut arts. So the VR technology can achieve wide protection and
   inheritance of Dai paper-cut art.}},

Abstract = {{Economists believe that we are entering the Post-Information Age, which
   is expected to succeed the current Information Age as the principal
   engine of economic activity. In this paper the authors assess this
   statement and how this approach to meeting the needs of the digital
   transformation in business and society. The demands of systems such as
   1) the Internet of Things (IoT), especially sensor networks and their
   deployment 2) ``Industry 4.0{''} and its competitiveness 3) the
   application of intelligent technologies to the major infrastructures
   (big cities, ports, airports, energy grids, etc.), will not be delivered
   through small projects but rather will be built around complex
   partnerships and ecosystems. Moving from this assessment, the authors
   look more closely also at the means of constructing a business case for
   new communications solutions, noting that the Post-Information Age will
   create new opportunities for Network Service Providers (NSPs). In doing
   this, they will examine key differences in the way offerings are
   constructed for the whole market sector, from consumer to major
   corporate / central Government solutions. According to the results
   found, it looks as if the same techniques apply to all segments, but
   with different weights and different approaches to the construction of
   key parameters for the specific value-proposition. The authors are
   strongly convinced that modelling the business case, partnership options
   and ecosystems remain the most powerful tools in assessing digital
   service viability.}},

Abstract = {{Telecom engineering students should face important challenges in their
   careers regarding next-generation networks. In fact, in the last few
   years optical access networks are leading an important revolution in the
   network sector. Passive Optical Networks (PONs) based on the Ethernet
   (EPON) and the Gigabit (GPON) protocols are the most deployed optical
   access networks around the world. Therefore, Universities should join to
   this revolution permitting their students to train and to learn these
   innovative and recent technologies so that they have the chance to
   develop and to improve some required skills for their future.
   Consequently, we deployed a real GPON testbed in a laboratory where
   students can research. In the first approach students have to analyze
   issues regarding the physical layer of the GPON testbed. In fact, they
   have to test eye diagrams, Q factors, rise/fall times of transmitters
   and extinction ratios. Furthermore, they have to discover and analyze
   the events (connectors, fusion splices, attenuation) at the optical
   links of the access network using an Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer
   (OTDR). Besides, the GPON is being prepared so that students can deal in
   other lab sessions with its configuration and management.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of the sub-array phases for multi-beams scanning
   applications is here addressed. A hybrid analog/digital architecture is
   considered in which analog element excitations are used to generate a
   reference beam, while a digital sub-arrayed beam-forming network (BFN)
   is used for steering a secondary beam within a limited scan cone. The
   digital phases are obtained through an innovative analytic method,
   jointly optimized with the sub-arrays configuration. A simple numerical
   assessment has been reported to validate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of the digital/time converter (DTC) circuit has improved
   the performance of Delta Sigma fractional-N phase-locked loops (PLLs).
   Accurate cancellation of Delta Sigma quantization error via the DTC
   requires an automatic calibration made by an LMS loop. A high-order
   Delta Sigma speeds up calibration convergence and improves PLL spectral
   purity, though at the price of larger quantization error and wider DTC
   range. To overcome this problem, we propose an innovative parallel
   segmentation scheme which reduces the range of quantization error
   without compromising spectral purity and convergence speed. The
   effectiveness of the proposed segmentation scheme is demonstrated via
   behavioral-level simulations of a digital PLL and compared to the
   conventional cascaded segmentation scheme.}},

   small frequency granularity and fast frequency switching. These features
   make TAF-DPS an ideal on-chip frequency generator. In this paper, a
   TAF-DPS circuit is constructed using digital approach of HDL coding and
   synthesis. It is then mapped to FPGA. Using this full digital TAF-DPS as
   a tool, several innovative examples in application level are
   demonstrated. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that this low

Abstract = {{Schlieren imaging has been an essential method for studying aerodynamic
   effects, particularly thermal convection, shock waves, and turbulent
   flows. This paper describes a compact portable digital focusing
   schlieren system that can be used to visualize relatively large fields
   for applications in ventilation design and aerodynamics research.
   Visualizing large fields is difficult using classical schlieren systems
   that employ collimated light because their field of view is limited by
   the size of the mirrors or lenses. Background-oriented schlieren systems
   are well-suited for visualizing large fields, but their sensitivity is
   limited by the need to simultaneously maintain focus on the background
   pattern and the test area. Lens and grid-based focusing schlieren
   systems are essentially hybrids between classical and
   background-oriented systems. They can visualize fields that are much
   larger than possible with classical schlieren systems, while providing
   more sensitivity than background-oriented schlieren systems. Using
   commercially available camera lenses and optics, fields up to several
   square meters can be visualized. A key innovation in the system
   presented here is that digital display devices are used to display the
   background pattern, which simplifies the optical system and reduces its
   size. To calibrate the system, proprietary software is used to analyze
   images acquired by the system's digital camera, and then a background
   pattern is computed that is complementary to the cutoff grid. The
   calibration software also provides real-time background subtraction and
   contrast enhancement. The schlieren system is portable enough that it
   can be set up quickly in industrial facilities.}},

Abstract = {{EMG is the detection of the electrical activity associated with muscle
   contraction. It is obtained by measurement of the electrical activity of
   a muscle during contraction. EMG signals are directly linked to the
   desire of movement of the person. Robot arms are versatile tools found
   in a wide range of applications. While the user moves his arm, (EMG)
   activity is recorded from selected muscles, using surface EMG
   electrodes. By a decoding procedure the muscular activity is transformed
   to kinematic variables that are used to control the robot arm. This
   patent is the innovative design of a new low-cost series elastic robotic
   arm. The arm is unique in that it achieves reasonable performance for
   the envisioned tasks with high DOF. There are numerous dimensions over
   which robotic arms can be evaluated, such as backlash, payload, speed,
   bandwidth, repeatability, compliance, human safety, and cost, to name a
   few. In robotics research, some of these dimensions are more important
   than others: for grasping and object manipulation, high repeatability
   and low backlash are important. To develop the articulated innovative
   arm design of the robot with high DOF equations were developed for both
   forward and inverse kinematics. Forward kinematics gives the location of
   the end effector in the ``universe{''} frame. The inverse kinematics
   gives the joint angles needed in order for the to the robot arm reach
   the goal frame. This high DOF based prosthetic arm operates according to
   EMG database. The EMG signal is obtained for different users for
   different arm movements using signal acquisition system. The EMG signals
   are used as input to the Microcontroller and converted to digital ones
   in the comparator. According to these signals the program built in the
   microcontroller make decisions to control the motors to drive the
   prosthesis arm.}},

Abstract = {{The Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that integrates a digital
   information with the user's environment in the real-time or the view of
   the physical real-world environment whose elements are augmented by
   computer-generated sensory input e.g. image/graphics, GPS data, sound or
   video. The AR technology uses the existing real environment and overlays
   a new digital information on top of it.
   There are many AR application developed in many aspects of life e.g.
   health, education, military, industry, entertainment, etc. This research
   explores the location-based AR technology to develop a game named
   Monster Buster. This game is an Android platform. This game uses the
   information of latitude and longitude used to generate the position of
   the monster. This research is expected to develop an innovative game
   application that can give another user's experience by using the
   locationbased AR technology. The Unity 3D is the game engine that is

Abstract = {{Nowadays, many organisations are involved in, and affected by, the
   global world, with its ICT developments, digitalisation, financial
   integration and environmental issues. High competition among
   organisations worldwide forces them to be creative and innovative in
   order to survive and gain competitive advantage. If an organisation is
   ready to accept this complex world and to change traditional thinking,
   knowledge sharing among employees should be fostered as the driver for
   complex answers to a fast-changing environment. The question is, how can
   knowledge sharing be made effective and how does it take place?
   Different kinds of variables can potentially be defined. In this
   article, the main focus is on the personalities of the knowledge workers
   involved in intra-organisational knowledge sharing processes, i.e.
   degree of trust, shared vision, etc. Apparently, only little attention
   in existing literature is given to this aspect of knowledge management.
   In more detail, the aim of this research is to measure personality
   characteristics of knowledge workers in order to redeploy them within
   the knowledge sharing network and support effective knowledge sharing.
   Furthermore, the profile of a `star' knowledge worker within certain
   networks can be determined, to provide the leadership and Human
   Resources Management of an organisation, along with guidelines for
   attracting new knowledge workers.
   Factor- and cluster-analysis research methods are used as the basis for
   the discovery of `star' knowledge workers within a knowledge sharing
   network. A case study among the financial departments of an
   international firm was conducted. Empirical data was collected with the
   help of a recognised self-report questionnaire which measures
   personality characteristics and knowledge sharing based on employees'
   opinions.}},

Abstract = {{There are different research communities in Kenyan universities and
   research institutes that required advanced research infrastructures and
   access to high-performance computing and grid-computing. Examples are
   research communities in computational modelling and materials science,
   bioinformatics, computational biology and chemistry, and engineering and
   computer science. Research infrastructures allow researchers to access
   resources available in the global research and education networks. In
   order to access such resources, KENET has setup the identity provider
   and certification authority infrastructures.
   The Certification Authority (CA) developed by KENET in collaboration
   with European partners is accredited by the European Grid Policy
   Management Authority (EUGridPMA) {[}1]. The KENET CA is a low-cost CA
   built to serve the research community of Kenya as is the practice in
   various research communities across the world. The certificates that are
   issued cannot be used for commercial purposes as seen with the other
   providers like Verisign, COMODO or even the community inspired Let's
   Encrypt. The KENET CA issues digital certificates to researchers who
   need access to High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures
   available outside Kenya mainly in Europe and the rest of the world
   {[}2]. The key advantage is that Kenyan researchers are no longer
   limited by the computing resources available at their campuses or in
   Kenya.
   This paper will describe the innovative methodology, architecture and
   tools used by KENET to develop the KENET CA, the two-year accreditation
   process by EUGridPMA, and the usage by the research communities in
   Kenya.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet disruption has resulted in an exponential increase in the
   growth of new technologies {[}1] and resultant technology disruptions
   within the workplace {[}2]. With the rapid changes in the technology
   landscape, Chief Information Officers (CIO's) and key decision makers
   need to learn to maneuver though the plethora of emerging technologies
   that can result in business model innovation {[}3] and give companies
   the ability to compete in a digital world. Disruptive technologies are
   changing the rules of competition {[}4], however the rate of change in
   technology in the traditional enterprise space has been slow. Most CIO's
   agree that there could be significant value in utilizing new
   technologies in creating competitive advantage in an agile world {[}5,
   6], however in practice the adoption and implementation of newer
   technology is relatively slow. Various interpretive studies on IT
   decision making focused predominately on user acceptance of technology
   in a stable technology and business context {[}7]; however, this paper
   investigates critical success factors which guides technology decision
   making in an agile business environment. The focus of this paper is to
   provide a preliminary framework for CIO's to help them decide on
   technology strategies to support business transformation that will
   enable their organizations to compete in a disruptive technology

Abstract = {{Using inland waterway transport is economically justified in any region
   of the world, however to this day inland waterway freight and passenger
   transportation in Southern Africa constitutes only a small fraction of
   the total amount of traffic. One of the major reasons for this situation
   is a lack of quality nautical charts covering navigable sections of
   inland waterways. Providing the region with valid electronic, as well as
   traditional cartographic resources over a short period of time is
   possible only by introducing innovative technologies. To resolve this
   issue, we suggest using automated hydrographic survey systems, allowing
   for prompt conduction of inland surveys at rather low operating costs.
   Additionally, it will provide an opportunity for partial automation of
   the chart manufacturing process, which in turn will lead to a wider use
   of the region's inland waterways by cargo and passenger vessels in the
   future. This paper describes issues that can be solved by means of
   automated hydrographic survey systems, equipment used by the systems,
   and basic algorithms for calculating and correcting measured parameter
   values (level, antenna lowering, calibration, vessel subsidence in
   shallow waters, distance between the satellite navigation system and the
   echo sounder antennae), as well as techniques for the evaluation of the
   accuracy of depth values received by an echo sounder.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is an innovation that will change our
   vision of road traffic, it will improve the safety and the efficiently
   of transport. VANET represent a target for attacks that can cause human
   and material losses. This, highlights the need for a robust security
   system, who must secure effectively communications between vehicles and
   the different network's entities, but also, it must guarantee
   availability and fluidity in the transmission.
   Specifically, in transmission of messages from Road Side Unit (RSU) to
   vehicle (R2V), our security aims to ensure identification,
   authentication, non-repudiation and integrity for the RSU. An
   aggregation of identification will be achieved by multiples RSU and
   without asking for the intervention of a trusted third party.
   In this paper, we proposed a security schema to firstly ensure
   identification for RSU by an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
   algorithm where the vehicle confirms that the two neighbours RSU have
   the same shared secret, then secondly the vehicle authenticates the
   message beforehand signing, using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA). To simulate the vehicle scenario, we used the
   OMNET++, SUMO and VEINS combined environment, and we integrated on it
   the Crypto++ library to achieve the security requirement. Our proposed
   model ensures stronger security.}},

Abstract = {{Display-camera data links can be regarded as a massive MIMO visible
   light communication. They are a research topic since several years.
   Imperceptible data transmission while simultaneously presenting video
   sequences for human viewers on the display is an innovative approach
   allowing for many new applications. Several groups work on this concept.
   This paper describes a new approach with specific modulation schemes and
   proposes a system, which combines concepts from digital data
   transmission and real time video processing while carefully taking the
   characteristics of the human visual system into account. The modulation
   parameters are selected as a compromise between picture quality
   deterioration and decoding performance in terms of data rate and bit
   error probability. Characterizing a video representation by luminance Y
   and chrominance U and V as usual in electronic media distribution and
   video source coding, subjective tests show that data modulation of the
   chrominance signals is a promising option. An early experimental setup
   applying modulation of U and V video components already provided data
   rates of 4.5 Mbit/s at acceptable error rates without significant
   degradation of perceived video quality.}},

Abstract = {{Internet-native audio-visual services are witnessing rapid development.
   Among these services, object-based audiovisual services are gaining
   importance. In 2014, we established the Software Defined Media (SDM)
   consortium to target new research areas and markets involving
   object-based digital media and Internet-by-design audio-visual
   environments. In this paper, we introduce the SDM architecture that
   virtualizes networked audio-visual services along with the development
   of smart buildings and smart cities using Internet of Things (IoT)
   devices and smart building facilities. Moreover, we design the SDM
   architecture as a layered architecture to promote the development of
   innovative applications on the basis of rapid advancements in
   software-defined networking (SDN). Then, we implement a prototype system
   based on the architecture, present the system at an exhibition, and
   provide it as an SDM API to application developers at hackathons.
   Various types of applications are developed using the API at these
   events. An evaluation of SDM API access shows that the prototype SDM
   platform effectively provides 3D audio reproducibility and
   interactiveness for SDM applications.}},

Title = {{DIGITALIZATION PROCESS IN UKRAINE AS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE SMART CITY
   CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT}},

Abstract = {{The paper aims to review Smart city building process in Ukraine, its
   successful examples, and possible drawbacks on the way and based on this
   suggests the steps country should undertake for the future development
   of this concept. Taking into account that spreading of ICTs
   (digitalization) plays an important role in laying the foundation for
   smart solutions' development and usage, we have also provided an
   overview of this process in Ukraine and compared Ukraine's positions on
   the global arena. To do this, we have used a number of international
   indexes (ICT Development Index, Networked Readiness Index, Global
   Innovation Index, E-Government Development Index, E-Participation Index)
   to show an objective picture and to cover as many aspects as possible
   (ICT readiness, ICT usage, ICT skills, and other features build on top
   of these). Lack of the required infrastructure and equal proper access
   to ICTs within the country is one of the major issues Ukraine has to
   deal with right now. We have also compared current positions of Ukraine
   against the target values specified in the Strategy of Information
   Society Development of Ukraine-2020. The research is based on the method
   of theoretical, logical, and systematic analysis of the literature
   (articles, strategies and agendas, international indexes etc.) along
   with the methods of comparative analysis that allow comparing smart
   solutions among the selected cities. We have composed a comparison table
   for successful smart solutions available currently in Ukraine for the
   selected cities (Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Vinnytsia,
   Dnipro) within different areas. We have also conducted a SWOT-analysis
   to reveal strong and weak points for the further concept development, as
   well as the possible consequences and risks. The article suggests the
   steps for further successful development of smart city concept in
   Ukraine. These steps should encourage the dialogue on the topic within
   our country. We believe that cooperation of all stakeholders on the
   national level is necessary to 1) Establish a common platform for
   sharing best practices and spreading successful solutions faster; 2)
   Develop a measurement tool to compare both the progress among different
   cities and the progress for the specific city within some time period.
   While locally each city should work on its own Smart City Agenda and
   Roadmap, ensuring the interests of all groups is taken into account. But
   of course, active dialogue on both city and national levels, as well as
   within the axis Government Industry - University - Civil Society is a
   core component of smart city building process.}},

Abstract = {{Artist's sketchbooks may provide important insights into the genesis of
   the finished works and may also contain artworks that are at least as
   interesting and sometimes even more fascinating and fresh. However,
   sketchbooks are delicate and problematic exhibits; displaying them in a
   showcase leaves at most two pages visible, and allowing visitors to
   handle the books does not make sense. This paper describes an
   interactive, virtual sketchbook technology intended for the display of
   books which, at the same time, is faithful to the original book and
   provides an enhanced spatial experience, a gigantic pocketbook which you
   may seem to enter spatially and bodily. The installation has been shown
   at The Italian Culture Institute in Copenhagen (2011), two public
   libraries (2012-13), two Danish art museums (2014), and the Book Fair in
   Bella Center, Copenhagen (2015).}},

Abstract = {{Organizations today report the need to grapple with changes and varying
   demands and needs that develop in the organization's environment.
   Studies argue that knowledge workers in an organization can contribute
   to the organization ability to cope with a complex environment. Other
   studies show that due to managerial need for supervision and control of
   the work processes, knowledge workers do not succeed in exploiting their
   creativity and providing effective solutions. The ``CAS{''} (Complex
   Adaptive Systems) model is a model that based on the principle of the
   survival of individuals in nature. In CAS, a distributed array of
   subsystems, termed ``fractals{''}, act autonomously according to
   environmental demands while maintaining constant connection with other
   fractals in the system. The main purpose of the article is to
   characterize the internal organizational environment as CAS that is
   appropriate for the growth of knowledge workers. In such an
   organization, number of processes occur simultaneously in a continuous
   manner: The main process begins with continuous and consistent
   transparency of managers towards employees. A process of updating all
   employees in changes occur in the organization's environment. This
   continuous process enables the employee to combine his/her needs as a
   knowledge worker with the organizational goals. Another process that
   characterizes the organizational environment as CAS is the process of
   information integration among employees. CAS implies intensive retrieval
   and distribution of knowledge among employee using information systems
   and social communication technology. Thus, the worker as a fractal can
   quickly locate relevant documents, experts or other employees dealing
   with relevant subjects his/her work. Another essential process is to
   perform a social networking - a diverse social activity of exchange of
   ideas and feedback by each worker. This interaction process enables the
   employee to promote and brand himself/herself as an expert to
   disseminate ideas and receive feedback from others. These capabilities
   make it possible for managers to be exposed to the employee's abilities,
   focusing on managing and synchronizing work processes, yet, contribute
   motivation to the workers to implement innovative solutions and to
   respond autonomously but immediately to changes and varying demands and
   needs that develop in the organizational environment.
   A conversion into a CAS organization is becoming necessary for
   organizations that wish to survive and advance in the digital world.
   Hence, the final part of the article portrays the road to introduce CAS
   characteristics into an organization, in order to better utilize the
   skills and potency of the knowledge workers.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have been done on relationships between knowledge
   management and collaborative innovation. Roles of knowledge management
   in collaborative innovation community capacity building (CICCB) in
   organizations have been identified as vital to success of collaborative
   innovation. However, few empirical studies have been taken to
   investigate this issue, there is a need to find practical evidence to
   support or adopt the theoretical framework. The objective of this
   article is to explore specific ways of knowledge management methods in
   collaborative innovation building process by analysing the current state
   of Chinese smart cities' building process. Based on the case study
   method this study chooses four Chinese cities, including Beijing,
   Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou, and uses an extended CICCB framework to
   analyze the current states of the four cities. From the results of cases
   analysis, we found the ways of collaborative innovation for improving
   commitment, communication and connectivity in four cities. The research
   findings show that local governments play a leader role in shared
   collaborative commitment construction by designing policies, setting up
   experts' team, holding the joint knowledge sharing inner conference and
   other measurements. The four smart cities establish more and more
   information systems and smart communities to provide opportunities for
   digital services and products development and to promote communication
   building. In addition, Internets of things, cloud-computing and big data
   play an enabler role in connectivity building process in Chinese smart
   city infrastructure construction process. This paper justifies KM
   approaches to CICCB as effective ways of collaborative innovation.
   However, findings generated in this study are limited to four Chinese
   smart cities, and future research will extend to a variety of urban
   management systems, further in depth discussion on reflections of CICCB
   framework will be written in another paper.}},

Abstract = {{In many respects, farming and food processing have lagged other
   industries when it comes to adoption of innovative technology. Whilst
   bioengineering has brought about seeds with much higher yield and less
   need for water and nutrients, it is only now with IoT that farmers can
   work on the intensive use of natural resources to increase the
   sustainability of their operations.
   In the last ten years, high-end machinery has evolved primarily to the
   benefit of larger corporations, with the introduction of satellite
   driven machines, sensors and all components of precision farming. The
   most recent IoT advances bring about a level of simplification and cost
   reduction that enable all farmers to benefit and a true adoption of
   prescription agriculture.
   In this conference presentation, we will examine a practical case of a
   Malthouse, where careful modeling of how CO2, Temperature, Humidity and
   PH vary in the three steps of the malting process, enabled an artificial
   intelligence system to prescribe different setting and schedules. The
   end result is malt with higher content of starch and proteins, which in
   turn means higher alcohol in the downstream process.
   A second example on the cultivation of Medical Marijuana, where
   similarly but in a more complex fashion (138 variables) the artificial
   intelligence supported the tuning of many settings and schedules, is
   presented only in the conference}},

Abstract = {{The present article has as objective to describe the process of digital
   literacy directed at the parents of family in the recognition and use of
   social networks, in the educational institution Coopteboy O.C of the
   city of Tunja, Colombia. The study was a qualitative approach, type
   supported action research in the ecological model of Urie Bronfenbrenner
   (1987), the collection of information was carried out through the use of
   focus groups, participant observation described in the respective
   records and the stories as a technique of inquiry and reflection. The
   intervention process was based on the psychosocial approach of
   empowerment (Banda y Morales, 2015), using as an innovative strategy,
   the provision of the social service of teenagers of secondary of the
   educational institution, who digitally literate to their parents, under
   the accompaniment of the researchers. The preliminary results allowed to
   evidence the lack of awareness among the parents with respect to the
   use, risks and benefits of social networks that use teenagers, therefore
   the parents have no control and surveillance strategies in regard to the
   use of these, validating the importance of literacy for parents in the

Abstract = {{The AGIRE project, under the Edulab concept, aims to promote the
   adoption of innovative teaching practices. This paper reports the
   support strategies used to evaluate the teacher practices at the end of
   a teacher training course (TTC) and analyse its impact on teacher
   technology integration, using a design-based methodology. Teachers'
   initial perception was gathered using an online questionnaire comprising
   ICT personal and professional competencies. The questionnaire results
   and the classroom observations showed that the majority of teachers were
   at the level of ICT adoption, before attending the TTC, reaching the
   adaptation level of integration of ICT, after the TTC. A variety of
   teaching strategies (flipped classroom, collaborative work,.) and
   technologies (interactive white boards, tablets, videos,.) were
   explored. The results sustain the thesis that, with proper support, ICT
   can be integrated in educational contexts in an innovative way and
   contribute to the development of teachers' digital literacy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and implementation of engineered
   nanoscale bonding interfaces as an effective strategy to improve
   manufacturability of Cu-Cu bonding to the level where it can, for the
   first time, be applied to chip-to-substrate (C2S) assembly. All-Cu
   interconnections are highly sought after to meet the escalating
   electrical, thermal, and reliability requirements of a wide range of
   emerging digital and analog systems. Such applications require low-cost
   processes with bonding temperatures and pressures ideally below 200
   degrees C and 20MPa, respectively, far from existing solutions
   established in wafer-level packaging. GT-PRC and its industry partners
   address this technology gap through innovative designs of bonding
   interfaces, introducing: 1) novel ultra-thin surface finish metallurgies
   applied on Cu bumps and pads to prevent oxidation and achieve
   low-temperature assembly; 2) low-cost fly-cut planarization technique to
   lower bonding pressures; and 3) low-modulus nanocopper foam caps to
   provide tolerance to non-coplanarities, and further reduce bonding
   temperatures and pressures.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to allow the test engineer great flexibility when
   developing a test program. Highly skilled test engineers desire
   flexibility and different hardware platforms to test a Unit Under Test
   (UUT). In the past, the engineer was told to use specific test equipment
   and not provided with the option to program an instrument to their
   specific test and diagnostic plans. Being stuck in a rut on our test
   technology has always been an area of concern. There are many ways to
   approach a test and sometimes circumstances dictate unique approaches to
   solve specific problems such as No-Fault-Found or diagnostic weaknesses.
   High Performance characteristics are Scalable, Full Dynamic Performance
   Configurable and have a common core Software Suite. PXI systems are
   flexible and you can add capability. PXI has become a dominant industry
   standard for measurement and automation applications. PXI is established
   with High Performance like High Data Transfer Rates, Small Rugged
   Industrial Footprint, and an Open Standard with Multiple Vendors. PXI
   has Innovative Technologies including Boundary Scan/JTAG, FPGA and high
   I/O Dynamic Digital.
   PXI based Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is quickly becoming very
   practical. Inserting non-ATLAS applications into an ATLAS test program
   can be commonplace. Developing a digital test utilizing a PXI FPGA is a
   practical approach to utilizing technology. The FPGA can be programmed
   on a step by step approach. Each step can be independent or dependent.
   Interactive diagnostics is achievable by utilizing ATLAS in conjunction
   with specific applications. Pattern failures can be passed to the
   diagnostic routine for processing and patterns failures can be tested
   for a certain state during probing. FPGA modules can adapt their
   functionality on the fly. Systems can partially reconfigure an FPGA
   while the module is running to change its behavior in response to
   incoming signals this includes altering test vectors to more extensively
   test functions that appear marginal.
   New techniques needed include test hardware performance (although this
   continues to evolve with great improvements), software test techniques,
   and the long term support. Long term support is being addressed with the
   advent of true open systems which highlight improvement in flexibility
   and scalability.
   The practical application for this approach is downsizing test
   equipment, using state-of-the-art technology and improving test time.
   Test Program Set (TPS) development is constantly under scrutiny and
   process improvement. The type of scrutiny taking place is the inclusion
   of new hardware and software techniques to improve NFF rates,
   diagnostics and test time. We need to improve the TPS development time
   and the quality of our TPSs. Also, utilizing multiple languages proves
   the open architecture is valid and practical.
   This paper discusses the development, integration and characteristics of
   state-of-the-art systems. Discussed is the wide range of flexibility or
   scalability, utilizing integration of devices and techniques, latest
   technology use, expanding your capability, true open system concepts,
   scalable system applications and how to start out small and grow to a
   greater test capability.}},

Abstract = {{ICT caused a revolution in educational models, directly influencing
   teaching practices. However, digital media lack virtual spaces that
   guide and help professionals. The development of Open Educational
   Resources (OER) and Learning Objects (LO) has been increasing. The
   objective of this research is to present a model of sharing and
   collaboration that fosters access and guides professionals to the use of
   multimedia resources as an educational offering. The methodology
   consists of an exploratory investigation followed by applied research
   based on the development of a platform where MOOCs were offered. The
   study was carried out at a Higher Education Institute at the University
   of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. As a result of this research, the Open
   Access Platform called RECIF was created, observing the collaboration
   and sharing of ideas among education professionals, thus making possible
   the verification of the proposed model. It was concluded that the
   proposed model can be applied in any educational practice that includes
   videos as a didactic resource; encourages learning that stimulates
   creativity and dynamism; and fosters the creation of motivational,
   interactive, collaborative and innovative virtual spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Internet has revolutionized many aspects in the way that political
   parties communicate. The Network has induced a complete transformation
   of the political strategies used during election campaigns to spread
   their message to the electorate. Politicians use social networks and
   digital platforms to promote their messages and to communicate with
   citizens during these periods of time. Facebook has proven to be one of
   the most effective networks in this regard. The party Podemos was born
   in 2014 in Spain, surrounded by a deep economic, institutional and
   political crisis. This political party promises to be a real hope to the
   negative situation of the country. In the recent years, Podemos has
   aroused the interest of social scientists because of the innovative way
   they use social networks. This paper explores the cybercampaign
   strategies that Podemos used during the 2015 Castile and Leon regional
   elections, a region where the population is very different from the
   party's average voter. To this end, a quantitative analysis of their
   activity on Facebook and their website was made during the regional
   election campaign. The results of this study allow us to observe an
   ordinary use of the digital tools by Podemos that highlights the
   engagement achieved with users in Facebook.}},

Abstract = {{The article attempts to identify the formal and essential features of
   the modern virtual currency, to provide a classification of virtual
   currencies, to identify the main factors influencing the demand and
   supply of virtual currencies, to analyze the key indicators of
   development of virtual currency schemes to determine their market
   prospects in payment system.
   The study determined that virtual currencies differ from traditional
   currencies and electronic money in the narrow sense. The main
   innovations related to the development of schemes of virtual currency
   are two key elements: the asset factor and payment factor. The main
   criteria for the classification of virtual currencies are: 1) the
   ability to convert virtual currency to traditional currency; 2) the
   organizational and technological features of the issue of virtual
   currencies.
   The study identified the main advantages of using virtual currencies for
   payment participants: 1) relatively short time for verification and
   settlement of payment transactions; 2) the high anonymity pf payment
   transactions; 3) relatively low transaction costs. However, currently
   only a few of decentralized schemes of virtual currencies are original
   from the point of view of a cryptographic scheme of issuing and
   accounting currency units. Among the virtual currencies with the highest
   market capitalization in the world are: Bitcoin, Litecoin and Reeple.

Abstract = {{The Ducal Castle Castromediano-Limburg was built around the sixteenth
   century in the historic centre of Cavallino, a town renowned for its
   excellence in the arts and culture, located in Salento south of Lecce
   (Italy). The Castle, also known as Ducal Palace, was the home of the
   illustrious Duke Sigismondo Castromediano, a man of great culture,
   archaeologist, writer and indomitable patriot of the Italian
   Risorgimento. The Gallery, which is one of the most important part of
   the castle, is a magnificent reception hall richly decorated and adorned
   by numerous sculptures. Today, the magnificent Gallery shows the signs
   of aging and improper use. Therefore, a restoration of the spaces has
   already been planned. The Gallery of Castromediano's Castle, classified
   as heritage of significant cultural and artistic importance, was the
   subject of a digital acquisition project, a three-dimensional
   reconstruction and virtual representation performed by CEIT
   (Euro-Mediterranean Centre for Technology Innovation for the Cultural
   and environmental Heritage and Biomedicine). The high-resolution 3D
   digital acquisition was performed using a time-of-flight 3D laser
   scanner and a campaign of photographic shooting of the frescoed
   surfaces. A 3D model, at two different levels of detail (LoD), was
   created, in full color, along with the animation of the model according
   to a predefined path that allows the user to enjoy, by various media, a
   virtual tour of the Gallery in a guided, detailed, complete and
   full-immersive way. The high-resolution 3D model will be a useful tool
   for the future conservation and restoration of the Gallery. It can be
   consulted and\textbackslash{}or updated remotely for in-depth studies of
   historical and artistic nature.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this research is to understand future teachers'
   attitudes, knowledge and needs about Massive Open Online Courses
   (MOOCs). These courses are a supplementary resource in Higher Education
   that can fill fields of knowledge in which the curriculum could not
   encompass. In addition, these types of courses can contribute
   significantly to teachers, both in initial and in-service, training. For
   this reason, the students' perspectives towards MOOCs are essential in
   these terms. In this way, fundamentally a questionnaire was administered
   to the students in the Degree in Teaching of Childhood Education, Degree
   in Teaching of Primary Education, and Masters Degree in Teacher Training
   of Secondary Education (n=145). The results indicated that a large part
   of the sample confirmed that they did not know anything about MOOCs.
   Therefore, Universities need to train competent future teachers in MOOCs
   culture. This chapter provides insights into the topic of advancing next
   generation elementary teacher education through digital tools and
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Although internet has emerged to bridge digital divides and improve how
   things are done across diverse spheres of life, its explosion has also
   brought unexpected threats, risks and loss of valuables over a decade.
   Consequently, there seems to have been plethora of cybercrime
   investigation models but the proliferation of these models has not
   substantially reduced the frequency of cyber attacks globally. Given
   that the recent development in cyberspace seems to follow same trends of
   how survivable Black Box (Flight Data Recorder) emerged, this chapter
   proposes a Black Box Forensic Cybercrime Investigation Model (BBFCIM).
   BBFCIM sets a new agenda for cybercrime investigation process by
   focusing on survivability and reliability of existing and would-be
   models rather than evolving as a distinct model of itself. It adopts
   soft innovative skills in the development of Black Box components to
   shape proactive cybercrime investigation process through sequential
   tests on each networking layers.}},

Title = {{Using Bayesian statistical modelling as a bridge between quantitative
   and qualitative analyses: illustrated via analysis of an online teaching

Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL MEDIA INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian methods provide a more general approach to statistical analysis
   that mathematically includes Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)
   and classical statistical modelling as special cases. This expanded,
   Bayesian, approach provides several benefits, which we illustrate using
   a case study about decision-making by teachers. We focus on a relatively
   unexplored topic: the way in which a Bayesian approach provides a
   ``bridge{''} between qual/quant methods. We highlight five bridges,
   illustrated using the case study: (1) visualization of the conceptual
   framework, (2) generalization via randomization and alternatives, (3)
   stories for interpretation, (4) computation that is flexible, and (5)
   continual learning, through priors. This work illustrates these bridges
   using a case study on a digital tool that wove together: a behavioural
   study to investigate decision-making, with an inbuilt perceptual
   component to probe rationale for specific decisions, and an interview
   component. A mixed method was therefore a natural choice for integrating
   learnings across these data sources, collected using a single online
   tool. Thus, the digital learning sphere provides a context for raising
   awareness of the potential that the Bayesian statistical paradigm offers
   researchers who wish to connect qual/quant methods. In conclusion,
   mixing-in Bayesian with qualitative not only innovates on methodology.
   It also reshapes the ontology, epistemiology and axiology: providing a
   common ground for qual/quant methods, as a basis for better
   communication; redefining what quantitative method is, what it can
   achieve, and how it is done - particularly within a mixed method
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a classroom experience of the use of augmented
   reality carried out with students of the Degree in Pre-primary Education
   at SAFA University Centre in Ubeda. Its main aim was to support the
   planning and development of an educational gymkhana for students in the
   third cycle of primary education. During the experience, prospect
   teachers needed to understand and employ basic concepts of augmented
   reality, experiment with digital video editing and create online quizzes
   with a later generation of QR codes that could be scanned with tablets.
   The success of the experience lies on the motivation of students to
   perform different tasks by working on key competences such as digital
   competence, linguistic and communicative competence and learning to
   learn competence.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, public confidence and trust in Government has
   declined visibly in several liberal democracies, giving way instead to
   disillusionment with current political institutions, actors, and
   practices; rendering obsolete or inappropriate much of traditional
   democratic politics. Simultaneously, digital technologies have created
   huge opportunities for public bodies and agencies. In analysing the No.
   10 Downing Street ePetitions Initiative based in the United Kingdom,
   this chapter engages with issues related to the innovative use of
   digital network technology by Government to involve citizens in policy
   processes and to buffer national security within existing democratic
   frameworks. The work examines whether the application of new digital
   platforms to participatory democracy in the Government 2.0 era leads
   eventually to radical transformations in government functioning and the
   body politic, or merely to modest, unspectacular political reform and to
   the emergence of technology-based obsessive-compulsive pathologies and
   trolling behaviours amongst individuals in society.}},

Abstract = {{High-strength steel and aluminum alloys are essential for developing
   innovative, lightly-weighted space frame concepts. The intended design
   is built from car body parts with high geometrical complexity and
   reduced material-thickness.
   Over the past few years, many complex car body parts have been produced
   using hydroforming. To increase the accuracy of hydroforming in relation
   to prospective car concepts, the virtual manufacturing of forming
   becomes more important. As a part of process digitalization, it is
   necessary to develop a simulation model for the hydroforming process
   chain. The preforming of longitudinal welded tubes is therefore
   implemented by the use of three-dimensional free-bending. This technique
   is able to reproduce complex deflection curves in combination with
   innovative low-thickness material design for hydroforming processes.
   As a first step to the complete process simulation, the content of this
   paper deals with the development of a finite element simulation model
   for the free-bending process with 6 degrees of freedom. A mandrel built
   from spherical segments connected by a steel rope is located inside of
   the tube to prevent geometrical instability. Critical parameters for the
   result of the bending process are therefore evaluated and optimized. The
   simulation model is verified by surface measurements of a
   two-dimensional bending test.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of researchers points out the importance of teachers on
   the education processes mediated by ICTs. The case of Tablets is not an
   exception. Therefore, the evaluation of its integration in the school
   should take into account teachers perceptions. This article analyzes the
   use of Tablets in the classroom from the perspective of Spanish teachers
   who work in more than 30 schools. A validated by experts and online test
   is applied, which included five dimensions paying attention to those
   critical aspects identified by the current scientific publications. Main
   results of this study show that is convenient to review the coexistence
   between analogic and digital resources and the high level of acceptance
   of Tablets on the educational community, to promote the teacher's
   creation of didactic materials and to include an objective evaluation
   system which is coherent with the teaching methods.}},

Abstract = {{Today's learners operate in digital environments which can be largely
   navigated with no human intervention. At the same time, libraries spend
   millions and millions of dollars to provide access to content which our
   users may never know is available to them. Through the Open SESMO
   (Search Engine \& Social Media Optimization) database project, Montana
   State University (MSU) Library applied search engine optimization and
   structured data with the Schema. org vocabulary, linked data models and
   practices, and social media optimization techniques to all the library's
   subscribed databases. Our research shows that Open SESMO creates
   significant return-on-investment with substantial increased traffic to
   our paid resources by our users as evidenced through analytics and
   metrics. In the core research of the article, we take a quantitative
   look at the pre/post results to assess the Open SESMO method and its
   impact on organic search referrals and use of the collection analyzing
   data from three distinct fall semesters. Returns include demonstrated
   library value through database recommendations, connecting researchers
   to subject librarians, and increased visitation to our library's paid
   databases with growth in organic search referrals, impressions, and
   click-through rates. This project offers a standard and innovative
   practice for other libraries to employ in surfacing their paid databases
   to users through the open web by applying structured and linked data
   methods.}},

   has been possible to fabricate an ostensive support, reducing object
   handling during the setting up stages and providing better protection
   during the exhibition period.
   In a second project, the trilobites of the MUSE collections were scanned
   three-dimensionally with the goal of producing physical replica for
   educational purposes.
   In a third project the osteological comparison collection was
   implemented with 3D-printed specimens from other museums, reducing the
   need of loan requests and avoiding the risks associated with their
   frequent handling.}},

Abstract = {{Geo-referencing is one of the most problematic and troublesome steps in
   digitization of occurrence data. In museum samples, spatial references
   are typically provided as textual description of localities, an
   ``informal{''} technique that requires appropriate processing in order
   to become a ``formal{''} representation. The e-Biodiversity Research
   Institute LifeWatch-Italy is proposing an innovative approach for
   processing of geographic objects. This approach, which follows the
   GeoNames ontology, considers localities as ``concepts{''}, thus
   enabling: a) to loosen their connections with names and with static
   geographic representations and b) to explicitly insert them in the
   network of spatial and semantic relationships with other entities.
   It was decided to formalize the Italian place names taken from the IGM
   plates ({''}tavolette{''}), an authoritative source of place names,
   according to these principles and in order to use these in the museum or
   biodiversity domain.}},

Pages = {{1819-1826}},
Abstract = {{One of the hottest trends among investors in 2016 is FinTech related
   ventures. Financial Technology (FinTech) is an industry where small to
   medium young companies utilize latest technologies to create innovative
   products in such a conservative sector as the financial industry. Since
   its rise in 2008, FinTech has been disrupting the banking industry,
   reshaping businesses, and transforming the way consumers manage and use
   money. FinTech is, in fact, a segment of the so-called digital
   disruption creating new financial models: the range of services offered
   by FinTech is already broad and includes payments, virtual currencies,
   wealth management, peer-to-peer ({''}P2P{''}) lending and crowd funding.
   It is a real financial revolution that sees an increasing number of
   startups disrupting the uncontested power of banks. Investment in
   FinTech skyrocketed from \$930 million in 2008 to \$12 billion in 2014;
   since then, the numbers have soared more and it is predicted to boost
   even further. While ease of use is considered as FinTech's main selling
   point, it's a lack of awareness of their existence that is the main
   impediment to its adoption - the majority of non-FinTech users claim
   they don't know such products exist. In addition to defining what
   FinTech is and what kind of services and products they provide, the
   reasons for their popularity and their relationship with banks are also
   presented in this article.}},

Abstract = {{If for traditional fashion design as clothes making or as basics for the
   creation of fashion products the concept of good design is now acquired,
   knitwear is now facing its decisive change from hobby into project; the
   enhancement of craft (Micelli S. 2011) does not refer to any nostalgia
   for the past times, and even better in Italy it is a very fertile area
   to be innovated and experimented. The ability to innovate and promote
   new points of view in design processes does not arise only from a
   thorough understanding of specific areas, but also from a lifestyle open
   to diversity, that society has to accept and recognize (Micelli S.
   2011).
   Today, the ability of designers to explore contexts in an original way,
   proposing ideas and results that are not just technical solutions of
   established problems, sees in creativity and in fashion design education
   the ability to solve problems through materials and their constant
   innovation for clothes, to experiment or to look at old problems in a
   different way with the aim of going beyond the usual ``fashion{''} idea.
   This paper is written at the end of an educational experience in the
   Knit Design Lab at the School of Design of Politecnico di Milano, where
   Missoni, the most important Italian knitwear brand, together with
   Woolmark, the most influencing certification body at an international
   level for the promotion and enhancement of Merino wool, in collaboration
   with Knitlab, a digital platform for the learning of the traditional
   knitting techniques active in the School of Design at Politecnico di
   Milano, realized a project in which the knitting techniques have been
   the first tool for the creation, design and prototyping of a clothes
   collection for the spring-summer 2017, coherent with the brand identity
   of Missoni and with at least the 70\% of merino wool as a condition
   dictated by Woolmark.
   The aim of the paper is to highlight the moments of convergence and
   differentiation regarding the methodologies and the design process into
   the different areas of design.
   In this way today we can talk about knitwear design: a specific field of
   Made in Italy completely changing: to become project, knitwear must
   produce garments and collections enhancing traditional techniques while
   expressing the spirit of time and in which the manual technique becomes
   a research tool and method to deal with all the aspects in their
   influence on the industrial production chain.}},

   everyday life, because many current Sharing Economy offers are not
   practicable. This paper asks what contributions an innovative Sharing
   Service - a library not simply lending books but a wider range of items
   - can make to close the gap between willingness to share and practice.
   Most of these innovative libraries were founded in the last few years,
   but many still fail to overcome the identified gap. As global
   environmental problems demand a change of consumer behaviour to enable
   human actions within planetary boundaries, bridging the gap could have a
   huge impact. Libraries of Things could reduce the average resource and
   energy consumption of users, maintaining quality of life. This paper
   analyses existing Libraries of Things and Tool Libraries. The outcome is
   assessed against empirically proven user expectations to detect the
   discrepancies between supply and demand of current offers commonly
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable Words is a cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary education
   adventure that investigates the human body through `wearable objects'.
   It transfers the teaching of jewellery studies to a group of learners
   from different disciplines including: Fine Art, Textiles and Graphic
   Communication and Illustration. It aims to determine whether the
   theoretical issues of jewellery and jewellery technologies can bring an
   innovative research method and new practical tools to students who are
   not familiar with the jewellery arena. In so doing, Wearable Words
   symbolises the non-verbal communications of body related objects.
   The paper examines the preliminary challenges, weaknesses and successes
   of the project, which was delivered to 19 second year BA students
   between February and June 2016 at Loughborough University. It analyses
   the extent to which a shift to the theoretical and practical approaches
   of jewellery design education enabled students of different disciplines
   to develop their research methodologies, design capabilities and making
   skills. The results are analysed through observational methods, open
   ended questions, and visual analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Built upon the definition of social innovation, the umbrella expression
   ``digital social innovation{''} was introduced to describe a wide range
   of projects that use digital technologies, community engagement and
   collaboration, co-creation strategies and bottom-up approaches to solve
   societal needs, in opposition to the centralized proprietary solutions
   owned by a few companies. Assessing how digital social innovation
   projects can scale in order to have a better impact, is crucial to
   provide a concrete European model to innovation creation that considers
   values beyond economic factors. This paper presents the results of a
   one-year training program aimed at supporting the scalability of digital
   social innovation projects in order to have a better impact. In
   particular, it describes the application of an open design approach to
   the design of a P2P mentoring model, and a sustainability toolkit that
   faces the issue of generating capacity building in emerging community of
   tech social innovators.}},

   technology, Emerging Financial Clusters, Personal Finances, and
   Financial Inclusion. The design process consists of an exploration the
   topics, executing participatory sessions, analyzing and communicating
   results, and presenting the proposals. Students developed 15 projects
   that can be classified in a 2x2 matrix (digital vs. analog and products
   vs. strategies). Among the projects, there is an app that allows friends
   to collect money for drinks and keep a drinking journal, a moody wallet
   that will persuade people to spend less, and a digital legacy to
   complement life insurances, and a tree-shaped piggy bank for children,

Abstract = {{The present paper(1) focuses on the cultural value of making,
   identifying the methods for sharing the knowledge and the technical
   skills, particularly, in the context of digital design and fabrication.
   Starting from the renewed interest in manufacturing processes directly
   linked to creativity, sustainability, mass customization, practical
   innovation and experimentation, enhanced by the so called makers'
   revolution and by the new arts and crafts movements, the paper explores
   the on going transformations in the manufacturing places focusing on the
   Fab Lab sites as new hubs for sharing knowledge and skills.
   The dissertation is supported by a practical experimentation, carried
   out by the authors, based on a co-design workshop and a proactive
   interdisciplinary activity addressed to identify the processes of social
   innovation involving both expert and not expert designers in the context
   of digital design and fabrication processes.
   As a result Bright Light, a small lamp, has been produced in order to
   finalize the co-design processes with a smart artefact.}},

Abstract = {{We are living in a moment of radical change. The environmental and
   economic crisis have been undermining the strength of democratic
   societies, causing, mainly in western communities, a widespread sense of
   alienation and insecurity. By the way, new social structures are
   emerging from bottom-up initiatives, as a response to the lack of good
   political practices. These actions often reveal themselves as strong
   creative think tanks; they play a key role in the decision-making
   process concerning commons and contribute to the definition of the
   community identity, by acting as connectors between both social and
   environmental factors. Founded in 2012 by a group of young people from
   different backgrounds, Roma Makers has been the first fab lab in Rome,
   Italy, and in the last four years, it has grown in terms of network and
   community. Started from scratch, with limited economic resources and
   during a peak of the Italian economic and political crisis, Roma Makers
   has been able to build a bridge between citizens and authorities, using
   the global innovation network as a mean to join different urban
   realities. With the direction of four public labs widespread among the
   Lazio Region, several mini-labs in public schools, the collaboration
   with trade associations, universities and high educational centers,
   together with the organisation of several technological events, Roma
   Makers has built an active infrastructure of knowledge focused on the
   empowerment of citizens in technological innovation and digital
   manufacturing. The infrastructure operates at different levels of
   society and creates a connection between professionals, students,
   hobbyists, urban associations, companies and institutions so that they
   can meet and share projects and ideas. This new layer of knowledge is
   expanding from a very local scale (the neighbourhood of Garbatella in
   Rome) to the Lazio Region area, and it allows local economies to be
   developed by giving access to innovative and advanced manufacturing
   machines and processes. In this system, a new role of design is emerging
   and changing the linear relationship client/designer/user with
   collaborative networks that generate an open knowledge repository, in
   which everyone is included and can contribute by finding the most
   suitable field to share one's skills. The knowledge ecosystem fosters
   the encounter between local know-how and innovation, creating new
   markets and encouraging new economies. In 2015 Roma Makers has expanded
   by becoming an incubator for two start-ups that connect the
   infrastructure with two important economic sectors: design firms and
   arts, introducing digital manufacturing tools and networked design into
   the industry process. This scenario leads to a new concept of
   participatory design as a tool for an active engagement of individuals
   in the development of their communities. The current paper will analyse
   how the new collaborative design and production processes emerging from
   the Roma Makers Infrastructure is contributing to building a sustainable
   and inclusive social ecosystem. The research will highlight the peculiar
   urban context in which it develops and focuses on how a self-generating
   network of knowledge based on a peer-to-peer system can be a key agent
   to enhance civic engagement for urban development.}},

Abstract = {{Design and sustainability have long been reviewed and explored by
   designers, creators and policy makers. Despite the acknowledgement of
   the importance and need for sustainable design, little is known
   regarding the process that leads to one. It is important to recognise
   that sustainability is a system property and thus a systems perspective
   (including both micro and macro level changes) is necessary to fully
   appreciate and guide sustainable and innovative designs. SYSTEMATEKS
   (SIMS) is a forward thinking design concept/process that can inform
   sustainable and regenerative designs. The present paper demonstrates an
   application of SIMS (Scalable, Interactive, Modular (able) systems) for
   designing a digital interface that allows for visualizing key
   infrastructure information (i.e. Information regarding municipality and
   key economic factors associated with it). The findings demonstrate a
   successful application of SIMS process to guide and inform a truly
   flexible and resilience digital interface that is modular and scalable.}},

Abstract = {{A proliferation of participatory spatial practices is emerging in
   cities, as citizens seek alternative forms of urban governance and land
   use. Characterised by peer-to-peer production and mediated through the
   use of digital technologies, these practices are part of a larger
   narrative about the commons, the ways in which citizens participate in
   them, and the ways in which knowledge is produced and shared. This
   case-study uses participatory mapping, group interviews and document
   analysis to explore how participants in two urban gardening projects
   make place, and probes whether their practices offer new understandings
   of community-led placemaking. Results emphasise the important role
   citizens play in creating, designing and maintaining the commons and
   demonstrate the ways in which individuals and community groups working
   outside of a professional urban design context expand placemaking into a
   vehicle for social change.}},

Abstract = {{While digital space is explained in itself by computer science,
   important questions for the humanities - such as how the Digital affects
   human behaviour, or how it impacts society and economy - are outside its
   scope. Different disciplines have provided answers, but there has been
   no integrated concept bridging these insights. This paper proposes a
   concept to explain the Digital by integrating insights from computer
   science, media studies, sociology and philosophy. The resulting
   framework suggests that the Digital consists of characteristic dynamics,
   spaces and mechanisms. After explaining the concept of Digital Machine,
   an ontological framework consisting of four main fields of analysis -
   Transformation, Territory, Frame and Use - is proposed. With
   Transformations and Territories, the processes of the Digital and its
   wider socio-political and economic dimensions are analysed. Within
   Frames, human action and interpretation happen. In the Uses of the
   Digital, consumption has become a form of production, and User's uses
   can be analysed in the differential between the intents of a Digital
   Machine and the interpretations of its users. To conclude, Anders'
   concept of Promethean slope is taken to explain the increasing problems
   of humans to distinguish the actions of algorithms from human action,
   and future implications of the evolution of the Digital are discussed.
   Finally, routes for digital innovation and recommendations for design
   practice are proposed.}},

   innovations bringing them into meaningful existence.
   Interfaces, algorithms, artificial intelligences of various types, the

Abstract = {{This paper describes a progressive shift in agile. This change is
   characterised by greater team autonomy, hybridised practices and strong
   orientation to design thinking (Cross, 1982) and flow (Csikszentmihalyi,
   1997). This conclusion is substantiated through research, a
   comprehensive literature review and theory building (Knight, 2013). The
   supporting data, elicited from a representative cohort (n=308) helps
   develop a theoretical model of agile. The model frames the shift in
   practice as an evolution toward `post-agility' (Baskerville, et al
   2011). In this future state, agile orthodoxy has been replaced by
   `co-design thinking' through a new integrated `flow methodology'. There
   are many implications for the next phase of design. Firstly, agility
   must be core curricula in design education. Secondly, design methods
   that can work with a broader set of data to support autonomous teams are
   needed. Lastly, the speed of change necessitates stronger connections
   between practice, theory and the broader context of design knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Fabrication promises to revolutionize manufacturing, bringing
   both economic, social and environmental benefits. Combined with
   Computational Co-Design it can raise the creative potential of both
   designers and users. However, today the productive use of Digital
   Fabrication and Computational Design requires significant effort and
   specialised know-how, so valorising these practices calls for the
   identification of the application fields that benefit the most from
   them. This paper presents a tool for helping the discovery of design
   opportunities across comprehensive, ramified lists of product
   categories, where designers can identify possible points of
   intervention. The web-based tool allows the rapid evaluation of numerous
   product categories according to an extendable set of factors and
   inspiring questions related to the necessity of personalization, aiming
   to stimulate designers to consider unexpected frontiers of innovation.
   Beyond the scope of the research project, this tool has the potential to
   assist designers in finding applications also for other emerging
   technologies in a structured and scalable way.}},

   framework for creative problem solving falls short in teaching core
   design and aesthetic principles. The challenge for educators becomes how
   to build shared learning environments between design and external
   domains. As an assistant professor in the New Media Design program at
   Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), I have applied core design
   curriculum in an interdisciplinary program across design, development
   and digital humanities to begin this shared design education. This paper
   explores how an undergraduate design curriculum can be leveraged across
   technology and liberal arts fields to provide actionable skills, design
   vocabulary and aesthetic appreciation to the design thinking and
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{B-to-B industrial manufacturing organisations are moving the focus from
   designing products to services. This transition challenges the
   management of innovating, which is increasingly collaborative and
   networked. Organisations need to be able to tackle the related
   uncertainty in order to prepare, secure, and plan their use of
   resources. Design concepts are known to have various beneficial roles in
   product and service development in various development contexts. In this
   article we study how design concepts were utilised within, and between,
   three development projects in a Finnish company in the context of B-to-B
   industrial manufacturing. Eight roles for design concepts are identified
   in the 11-month study, and these are presented as stories concretising
   how design concepts functioned. Design concepts were utilised in 1)
   anticipating future, 2) implementing design, 3) training, 4) engaging in
   dialogue, 5) setting goals, 6) establishing vocabulary in organisation,
   7) planning and securing resources, and 8) linking projects.}},

Abstract = {{The technological innovation of Industry4.0 opens up new possibilities
   for bespoke and unique designs all rooted in the same technology and

   Cloud Computing and Internet of Things offer a neutral platform for the

   reached by sharing the same technology across different projects and
   potentially very different domains. This vision is illustrated by the
   work done in the meSch project and its platform for the production of
   novel interactive experiences in museums. Six installations designed by
   recombining the same electronic components and the same services are
   used as a case study. They show how the meSch platform is aligned with
   Industry4.0 principles of enabling dynamic composition, supporting
   distributed production, and monitoring use for service improvement. As a
   platform it supports single-piece production and empowers designers to
   create bespoke solutions with the same technological core.}},

Abstract = {{This short paper gathers insight about learning environments in design
   and leadership in the creative industries. The production of expertise
   is often highly specialised and domain specific, however this study
   observes a learning situation that places emphasis on collaborative
   interaction and group dynamics nested within dense creative networks.
   Design learning demands complex problem solving and decision making in
   response to contingent situations. These environments defy brevity of
   explanation, yet are microcosms of radical transformations in the
   digital economy. The reciprocal relationship between learning
   environments and industry are explored. Embedding in a network of
   learners and experts, using ethnographic methods blend situated insight
   with theoretical oversight. An ethnographic investigation of a learning
   organisation is applied to generate insight that reveals a dense network
   of collaborative practices, the production of experts and complex
   reciprocal relationships between learning and professional practice.
   Intense and inevitably participatory ethnographic engagements are
   indicative the processes of transformative change and challenge our
   understanding of the nature of learning. The role of innovation and flux
   in societal structures is reflected in these radically different
   approaches to learning. The image that appears is highly
   counterintuitive but prescient, providing foundations of new approaches
   to design education at the boundary. Learning environments that are
   responsive to a world that is rapidly moving beyond a stable state.}},

Abstract = {{The Industry in the Middle East does not have a strong background of
   design-driven innovation, in fact, production follows mainly outdated
   systems. For this reason, there can be an attempt for new technologies
   like rapid prototyping that might transform fast into low manufacturing
   practices rather than only visualization of ideas. Today designs of
   products in the region are often copied and the main goal is to present
   a cheaper product. With the recent devaluation of the Egyptian pound, a
   major economy in the region has negatively affected import restrictions.
   As a result, companies tend to rely on local products and hardly invest
   in research or innovation. Hope appears in Start-ups and
   Small-Medium-Enterprises (SME), which are trying to impose themselves by
   evaluating different business models in order to grow and survive. A
   possible answer, given the situation, could be a regional network of
   small entities of innovation and production, using digital platforms and
   dislocated manufacturing anticipating a regional Industry 4.0.}},

   concentrations of specialisms and virtual firms, the way we make has
   evolved dramatically over time (Mourtzis \& Doukas 2014, Allen 2006,
   Eugene et al 2005). This research looks forwards and asks in light of
   new technological developments such as 3D printing what are the new

   explores how manufacturing developed historically. Following a summary
   of a primary research study titled Digital Makers, a feasibility study
   for rural maker centres based in the Highland and Island region of
   Scotland, the paper goes on to present a concept for a digitally enabled
   manufacturing network of the future. Concluding with a discussion on the
   implications for future research. The research connects to the authors

   looks at makers' ambition to do socially valuable things and critically
   reflects on their potential impact, whether makers' societal impact can
   be recognised on micro-, meso-or macro-level. Paraphrasing Schumpeter,
   who explained innovation as a `new combination of production factors',
   social innovation can be defined as a new combination of social
   practices. To add an empirical dimension, via qualitative research we
   have explored the expectations and values of makers. We chose to proceed
   from the concrete to the abstract by approaching 30 Makers with very
   specific issues they knew from their day-to-day work and asked them
   regarding their social ambitions in terms of inclusion, education and
   environmentalism. Eventually these questions led then to insights on the
   threads we outlined above.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of IoTs and ICT technologies, smart objects
   become a rising commodity in our life. Several innovative smart objects
   and concepts are constantly proposed to the market and to crowd-funding
   platforms. Most of these products have similar features, with added
   sensors, actuators, memory capabilities, and they can exchange
   information with a smart phone, allowing users to control them at a
   distance and to collect data in everyday life.
   There are two typologies of smart objects: traditional products updated
   by implanted digital technologies; brand new products designed to meet a
   specific demand. In this paper, we focus on the smart objects for home,
   such as smart power plugs, smart surveillance systems, smart lamps,
   etc., and on user behaviours. The user experiences associated to the two
   typologies are different: the first typology should improve an existing
   habit, while the second should provide a fresh action. The latter create
   new behaviours and the paper investigates the correlation between
   behaviours induced by the innovative products and their success/failure.
   The research is mainly based on the analysis of several smart objects
   proposed on the market and on crowdfunding platforms. The analysis
   considers usability, interactive modes and the modalities of control.
   The goal is to extract knowledge on how to design the next generation of
   ``smarter{''} home objects, i.e. not only intelligent, connected and
   controllable at a distance, but also requiring acceptable changes in
   behaviours.}},

Title = {{A Pedagogy for Computer-Assisted Literary Analysis: Introducing GALGO
   (Golden Age Literature Glossary Online)}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a digital teaching application that approaches the
   study of language and literary works from a social semiotic perspective
   and represents an innovative pedagogical model for world language and
   literature classes. The Golden Age Literature Glossary Online, known by
   the acronym GALGO, consists of an online glossary of select keywords,
   from canonical texts of Golden Age Spanish literature, whose multiple
   connotations illuminate important linguistic and social concepts of the
   16th and 17th centuries. GALGO incorporates British cultural historian
   Raymond Williams' methodology in his Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture
   and Society: namely, identifying problem-laden words or ``keywords,{''}
   charting their distinct usages across texts, and reflecting critically
   on clusters of associated words. GALGO seeks to instantiate language as
   social semiotic by linking the semantic configurations of a literary
   work simultaneously to the cultural environment, the linguistic system,
   and the social system. Applying the conceptual design of M.A.K.
   Halliday's social semiotic model, GALGO's interpretive apparatus
   provides the field of discourse or context of situation for the text in
   which a specific keyword appears. The field of discourse presents
   clusters, word groupings of semiotic affinity that describe the social
   action that is taking place in the text.
   GALGO also performs an interpretation of the tenor of discourse,
   highlighting sociological variables connected to class status, gender
   role and racial category that refine a keyword's meaning from the
   perspective of interpersonal relationships. Finally, GALGO adds
   commentary on discursive structures, such as patterns of grammar,
   syntactic nuances, and figurative language, that surround the keyword in
   the text. GALGO's strength resides in the synchronic connectivity that
   the system facilitates when identifying the constellation of meanings
   for any given keyword. From a technical perspective, the system has the
   ability to efficiently identify the absolute position of all uses of a
   keyword across multiple texts, so that large texts can be managed and
   search times minimized for both users and system administrators. GALGO
   is constructed in such a way that users can not only access existing
   analysis within the database, but also can assume, when instructed to do
   so, the role of the system administrator and contribute their own
   annotations. A team of faculty and student administrators are currently
   building the database with research previously collected in Spanish
   Golden Age literature seminars. Providence College students have
   utilized the social semiotic methodology underlying GALGO for several
   years now with successful outcomes both in terms of their growth as
   language majors and critical thinkers.}},

Title = {{The MoEML Pedagogical Partnership Program}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Since 2014, The Map of Early Modern London (MoEML) has partnered with
   professors and students around the world in a unique collaboration
   between a digital humanities (DH) project and humanities classrooms. The
   model we have developed addresses a sustainability challenge for DH
   projects, provides professors with a way of meeting administrative
   demands for engaged learning, and gives students a high-stakes
   research-based learning opportunity with the potential for an
   open-access, peer-reviewed publication. The MoEML Pedagogical
   Partnership Project emerged from a confluence of problems and
   opportunities. One longstanding problem for DH practitioners is
   project-based: how do we sustain the projects already begun? Another
   problem emerges as DH moves out of the ``big tent{''} and sets up camp
   in humanities classrooms at smaller, non-R1 institutions. Also, for
   scholars not trained in the technologies that drive many DH projects,
   crossing the analog-digital divide might be daunting and discourage them
   from contributing to DH projects. To address these challenges, the MoEML
   Pedagogical Partnership takes Research-Based Learning (RBL) models and
   turns them into high-profile publication opportunities, mobilizing
   ubiquitous social networking and communication technologies to connect
   the project with the new demographic of student contributors. This essay
   will highlight how digital projects and digi-curious professors can
   collaborate to develop innovative pedagogical practices that provide
   projects with content, enliven professors' pedagogy, and invite students
   to acquire scholarly research skills, gain digital literacy, and engage
   in an interdisciplinary and international collaboration. We argue that
   DH projects can be used innovatively and effectively in the classroom to
   promote RBL. At the same time, DH projects-open-access ones in
   particular-can provide a home both for humanities research and for the
   fruits of digital pedagogy across a wide range of institutional
   settings.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{There has been much discussion about digital humanities (DH) both as a
   discipline and as a community of practice.{[}1] Whatever the balance of
   opinion, the emergence of digital scholarship in the humanities has
   undoubtedly had considerable impact on many disciplines; one such
   discipline is Classics and the study of the ancient world more
   generally. This article uses the Digital Classicist (DC) as an example
   of a DH community in a case study which traces its development and
   growth to examine what might be learned. As a community the DC joins
   together practitioners interested in the application of innovative
   digital methods and technology to the study of the ancient world (in its
   widest sense). How has this come about and perhaps more importantly, how
   has it been sustained and indeed provided the inspiration for other
   affiliated communities? What do we understand by a community and the
   association of individual practitioners separated by distance? It is
   important that members feel that they are stakeholders, that they have a
   sense of ownership and derive value from participation and contribution.
   It is argued here that a community could be seen as a symbolic and
   intellectual construct, one of perception rather than physicality to
   facilitate the exchange of ideas and so effect growth and strengthen the
   discipline.}},

Title = {{Methods of quality, quality of methods. What does Roberto Busa have to
   communicate to digital humanists in the 21st century? From hermeneutics
   to performativity}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Despite being also known as the ``Father of Digital Humanities{''} owing
   to his pioneering contribution to the application of informatics to the
   whole ensemble of texts by the medieval philosopher and theologian
   Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), the Jesuit Italian priest Roberto Busa
   (1913-2011) has still not been fully appreciated with regard to his
   development of a ``hermeneutic informatics{''} {[}Busa 1999, 5]. Indeed
   this may represent a key concept to clarify what makes a difference
   between the common usage of computers in order to speed up procedures,
   and high-quality practices enhancing the role of informatics in shaping
   human interaction with machines. In other terms, Busa's interpretation
   of informatics may impact not only on the way in which digital resources
   and tools are developed, but also on the epistemological reflection
   about Digital Humanities. In this paper, by drawing from many of his
   texts, I will outline how this innovative ``hermeneutics{''} is
   explained by Busa in terms of language dynamisms potentially leading to
   the development of what Johanna Drucker has described as a
   ``humanistic-informed theory of the making of technology{''} {[}Drucker
   2012, 87].}},

Abstract = {{On a global scale, programmes of social protection for the poor are
   becoming increasingly computerised, and architectures of biometric
   recognition are being widely used in this respect. I research how these
   architectures, adopted in anti-poverty systems, structure ways to `see
   the state' for citizens living in poverty. To do so I study India's
   Public Distribution System (PDS) in Kerala, which is augmenting its main
   food security scheme with the computerised recognition of its users. In
   the government's narrative, biometric technology is depicted as an
   optimal solution to the illicit diversion of PDS goods on the market.
   Nevertheless, according to the multiple narratives collected across the
   state, beneficiaries dispute this view in different ways because of the
   mixed effects of the new technology on their entitlements under the PDS.
   The government's capability to reconstruct its image through digital
   innovation is thus found to be constrained by citizens' perceptions
   derived from their encounters with the new technology of governance.}},

   historical fact, which has modified the offline world. The huge amount
   of data poured into cyberspace have multiplied the actors involved in
   the construction of historical and archaeological interpretations and
   produced different discourses in competition with each other about the
   past. The ``democratization{''} of knowledge conveyed by the web has
   opened new semantic spaces and challenged the old rules about authority

Abstract = {{This study based on qualitative data aims to highlight emerging
   journalistic practices. It analyzes entrepreneurship in Brazilian
   journalism in order to determine to what extent this development can be
   regarded as a form of organizational innovation. Over 30 case studies of
   Brazilian journalistic startups are examined.
   The method adopted in this analysis consists of four complementary
   stages. In the first stage we identify Brazilian media's political and
   economic standing and the impacts of digitization on journalism. Then we
   assess journalistic startup experiences in Brazil through innovation and
   entrepreneurialism and map the cases. Finally, the fourth and final
   stage involves interviews of journalists responsible for such startups.
   In the past, startups were associated with oppositional forms of
   journalism aimed at producing alternative views. We find that these
   startups represent a hybrid of innovation and conservation in news
   production. On the one hand, they create the potential for journalism's
   independence, a crucial asset for the democratic societies utilizing
   various forms of news production. On the other hand, they remain tied to
   political and economic interests springing from the neoliberalism that
   characterize the global media industry.
   This chapter focuses on journalistic startups in Brazil and identifies
   five relevant characteristics of these entrepreneurial organizations.
   These innovative forms of news production open up spaces for a plurality
   of social actors and productive sectors. They also offer alternative
   approaches to covering many relevant issues in Brazilian society, such
   as legal and judicial topics.}},

   that private moneys generally can be qualified as social innovations but

Abstract = {{With the advent of the big-data era, massive textual information stored
   in electronic and digital documents have become valuable resources for
   knowledge discovery in the fields of design and engineering. Ontology
   technologies and semantic networks have been widely applied with text
   mining techniques including Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract
   structured knowledge associations from the large-scale unstructured
   textual data. However, most existing works mainly focus on how to
   construct the semantic networks by developing various text mining
   methods such as statistical approaches and semantic approaches, while
   few studies are found to focus on how to subsequently analyze and fully
   utilize the already well-established semantic networks. In this paper, a
   specific network analysis method is proposed to discover the implicit
   knowledge associations from the existing semantic network for improving
   knowledge discovery and design innovation. Pythagorean means are applied
   with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to discover the implicit
   knowledge associations either around a single knowledge concept or
   between two concepts. Six criteria are established to evaluate and rank
   the correlation degree of the implicit associations. Two engineering
   case studies were conducted to illustrate the proposed knowledge
   discovery process, and the results showed the effectiveness of the
   retrieved implicit knowledge associations on helping providing relevant
   knowledge from various aspects, and provoking creative ideas for
   engineering innovation.}},

Abstract = {{This study considers the impact of an experiential visual-based learning
   pedagogy on students undertaking a business start-up module. The current
   undergraduate student is different with a dependency culture on a range
   of electronic media (e.g. mobile phone, laptop, tablets) underpinning
   their existence. The term `digitally demanding' has been coined to
   describe such individuals. Such individuals think and act in a different
   way expecting immediate personal solutions to problems they encounter.
   Thus, there is a need to challenge their mindsets and thought processes
   to think in a creative and innovative manner to identify appropriate
   decisions. Educational pedagogy requires a significant mind shift to
   create enterprising and creative individuals for the modern
   organisation. The focus of this study is upon enabling students to
   develop a valid and robust business idea through use of visual learning
   methods that is described here as `rapid entrepreneurial action'.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic monitoring the behavior of a program is widely used to
   discriminate between benign program and malware. It is usually based on
   the dynamic characteristics of a program, such as API call sequence or
   API call frequency to judge. The key innovation of this paper is to
   consider the full Native API sequence and use the support vector machine
   to detect the shellcode. We also use the Markov chain to extract and
   digitize Native API sequence features. Our experimental results show
   that the method proposed in this paper has high accuracy and low
   detection rate.}},

Abstract = {{As a company that has continuously achieved business innovation, Apple
   in the United States has successfully applied strategic knowledge
   creation to produce a series of products that integrate various digital
   devices as well as diverse contents and applications, such as the iPod,
   iPhone, and iPad, based on a corporate vision of a digital hub concept.
   At the same time, the redefining of corporate boundaries that expanded
   Apple's business in a horizontal direction from the Macintosh PC
   business to the delivery of music, smartphones, and tablets is also an
   indication of the evolution of a corporate vision involving Apple's
   strategic transformation. This chapter presents the strategic and
   creative processes that enabled practitioners, including the late Steve
   Jobs, to demonstrate ``strategic innovation capability{''} by ``holistic
   leadership{''} at every level of management at Apple and successfully
   achieve a business ecosystem strategy through ``creative
   collaboration{''} across diverse boundaries within and outside the

Abstract = {{Ending-digit effects describe the presence of abnormal returns when the

   (i.e. when the ending digit is 1) but abnormal negative returns when

   exploitation of e-environment and its integration with results from
   research in mathematics education requires properly designed didactical
   interventions, based on a scientific approach, such as Didactic
   Engineering. Moreover, such exploitation should consider the centrality
   of the student, which means that the vertex-positions of the tetrahedron
   can be assumed also by the student along the learning process. We
   discuss the didactic engineering work from the perspectives of the
   tetrahedron faces and taking into account the dynamicity of the
   vertex-positions.}},

Abstract = {{The government has been allocating multi-billion Dollar budgets to STEM
   (science, technology, engineering and math) education. Several programs
   aim to educate girls about STEM and STEAM (STEM and arts). It's a
   national goal to create equal opportunities for all genders and increase
   diversity in STEM fields.
   We propose that the emerging values and social needs of middle school
   girls must be considered when creating learning experiences for them,
   and that appropriate design experiences can make engineering problems
   engaging and relatable. It has been shown that purposefulness is a
   critical factor for making engineering attractive to girls. Compared to
   boys, girls initially perceive engineering to be less socially
   impactful, yet girls place a higher value on social impact at an earlier
   age.
   This paper provides a broad review of relevant literature. It is
   proposed that creative, innovative engineering activities with perceived
   social impact may motivate middle and high school girls and build their
   confidence in the ability to impact people's lives with technology they
   create. This work tests this hypothesis using different forms of a
   design activity that enables students to collaboratively build personal
   and wearable smart devices. Examples of creations based upon this design
   toolkit include medical bracelets, physical activity monitoring, and
   other devices.
   The paper outlines the development of the toolkit and design activity
   through various stages of abstraction, and provides novel ways of
   prototyping design experiences. Three stages of development are
   implemented and tested with adolescent girls, offering new working
   methods for the human-centered, iterative process of designing such a
   toolkit. The first stage of toolkit prototypes consists of sketch models
   with a physical and digital component; focus groups were used to gain
   in-depth qualitative data. The second stage of toolkit prototypes
   consists of cardboard prototypes that allow for interaction mimicking
   the final design experience. It was used to gather data on design
   interests of different gender and age groups. The third stage of toolkit
   prototypes, consisting of computing devices with a simple interface,
   allowed for conducting experimental workshops to quantitatively
   investigate participants' self-efficacy and design and engineering
   interest both before and after the intervention.
   A fundamental change in many girls' mindset was observed in multiple
   experiments. Findings about requirements for design activities with
   similar goals are summarized and supported though responses of female
   middle-school students, who participated in the presented studies.}},

Abstract = {{Manual work is a cornerstone of manufacturing, also for factories of
   Industry 4.0 era. Use cases of manual work regard the production of
   single item, customized assemblies, small batches. Several injuries can
   be caused or aggravated by manual handling activities at work. Moreover,
   the efficiency of the whole process can benefit from correct body
   posture, parts' visibility and accessibility. Finally, manual work is
   strongly human-centered and its performance is affected by the
   expertise, the level of knowledge, attitudes and belief of workers. In
   this. complex context where multiple factors such as Efficiency, Work
   Performance, Ergonomics and Safety relate each other to achieve a
   satisfactory smart industry, the paper proposes an innovative Tangible
   Augmented Reality platform to train and assist workers during the manual
   handling and assembly tasks necessary to produce consumer goods with
   high aesthetic qualities. The proposed platform is the result of the
   application of a multipath methodology to link health and safety
   elements, typologies of injuries, ergonomics factors and relative
   qualitative and quantitative assessment methods and ergonomics analysis
   tools. The TAR platform allows the worker to consult the assembly
   instructions in a simple and user friendly way and to be informed by
   potential risk of injuries by a real-time alert. Based on video mapping
   techniques, the TAR system superimposes the necessary digital contents
   on the physical model of the product while the operator is building it.}},

Abstract = {{Failure to appropriately measure Value is one of the reasons for slow
   reform in health. Value brings together quality and cost, both defined
   around the patient. With technology we can measure value in the new
   ways: commercially developed algorithms are capable of mining large,
   connected data sets to present accurate information for patients and
   providers. But how do we align these new capabilities with clinical and
   operational realities, and further with individual privacy? The right
   amount of information, shared at the right time, can improve
   practitioners' ability to choose treatments, and patients' motivation to
   provide consent and follow the treatment. Dynamic Consent, where IT is
   used to determine just what patients are consenting to share, can
   address the inherent conflict between the demand from AI for access to
   data and patients' privacy principles. This chapter describes a
   pragmatic Commercial Development framework for building digital health
   tool. It overlays Value Model for healthcare IT investments with Patient
   Activation Measures and innovation management techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Our scientific approach addresses the issue of the economic
   collaboration of a community respectively the social economy enterprise.
   Our motivation is due to the profound transformations through which
   socio-economic activities pass over the last quarter of a century, more
   emphasized than ever by the particularities of the digital age. Social
   economy enterprises are also the subject to permanent adaptation to
   environmental conditions. Following the continuity of this process it
   was inevitable to avoid the following question, which has become the
   main objective of our paper: in an era where almost all processes and
   systems are digitized, leading to an increase in individualism, there
   still is availability for collaboration and if so, which are its
   defining factors? To answer this question we have initiated an
   exploratory analysis that allowed us to identify a number of defining
   factors of cooperation, each of them representing as many collaborative
   practices experienced in local communities. Analysis of data obtained as
   a result of the survey, conducted via questionnaire, was performed using
   IBM SPSS application. Interpretation of results is achieved by using
   optimal scaling technique known as categorical principal component
   analysis, CATPCA.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial research has been performed in recent years to determine the
   effects and feasibility of welding on highly irradiated austenitic
   materials. This research has been driven by the need to preemptively
   develop welding techniques capable of repairing highly irradiated light
   water reactor (LWR) components susceptible to detrimental corrosion and
   cracking. However, the materials used to fabricate internal LWR
   components become increasingly difficult to weld with inservice age due
   to irradiation-induced generation of helium in the material matrix over
   time. This paper introduces a patent pending technology that proactively
   manages the stresses during laser repair welding of highly irradiated
   reactor internals to avoid the occurrence of intergranular
   helium-induced cracking. The technology development relied on numerical
   simulations that made it possible to refine and optimize the innovative
   welding concept and to identify specific process conditions achieving
   significant reduction of tensile stress (or even formation of
   compressive stress) near the weld pool in the heat affected zone on
   cooling. The candidate welding process conditions identified by the
   numerical simulations were experimentally tested on stainless steel
   plates (Type 304L) with a laser welding system purposely designed and
   engineered to incorporate the proactive stress management concept.
   In-situ temperature and strain measurement technique based on digital
   image correlation were applied to validate the numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - With the increasingly collaborative nature of innovation and
   the expanding role of digital platforms on inter-firm collaboration, the
   purpose of this paper is to investigate the impacts of digital platforms
   on collaborative innovation capability (CIC) under conditions of two
   distinctive governance mechanisms. Furthermore, the competitive benefits
   of CIC at different levels of environmental uncertainty are examined to
   clarify the performance of collaborative innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research model is proposed based on
   dynamic capabilities theory, information technology (IT)-enabled
   organizational capability and governance mechanisms literature, and then
   validated by using partial least squares with data collected from 200
   Chinese firms that engage in digital collaboration with their major
   channel distributors.
   Findings - Empirical results show that the enabling effect of digital
   platforms capability on CIC is positively moderated by relational
   governance while negatively moderated by formal governance, and both
   governance mechanisms directly and positively influence CIC; the
   positive relationship between CIC and competitive performance is
   stronger for higher level of environmental uncertainty; and CIC is the
   key mediator converting digital platforms capability into competitive
   performance.
   Originality/value - This study enriches the existing literatures in
   IT-innovation relationship by not only surfacing the interplay of
   digital platforms capability with two distinctive governance mechanisms
   in building CIC, but also clarifying the competitive benefits of CIC in
   an uncertain environment. Moreover, this study helps explain the
   controversial issue of the business value of IT capability by
   discovering the mediating role of CIC.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this paper are to present the risks that may arise in
   teachers' training for improving their digital skills. The research is
   part of a DECODE project. The instruments of research are focus-groups
   and interviews. In the paper are presented the results of the research
   about the risks in implementation of ICT tools in schools. The threats
   in developing teachers' skills can be: creating of the digital
   educational content in a bad manner; implementing of the school
   management applications; misuse managing thr educational content. In
   terms of innovation in teaching, it isn't a balance between the didactic
   work and time; it depends on how much time is necessary to project the
   didactic act, because the teachers have to work at home, at school,
   beyond the norm of teaching. For a teacher, there are many teaching
   tasks, countless bureaucratic tasks and there is not enough time for the
   actual preparation of the didactic act. In fact, each course is an
   innovation adapted to the class; the teacher has to demonstrate
   creativity, empathy and adaptability. Also, it can be notated that,
   given the pace of development in this area, training should be very
   frequent, because changes sometimes occur faster than 2 years. The lack
   of a satisfactory number of school licenses is acutely felt. The threats
   revealed into interviews are: the new school curricula is misunderstood
   by the teachers; prejudices from previous teachers' experiences; some
   teachers believe that what they know at the moment is enough; ICT tools,
   both software and hardware, have the accelerated obsolescence.}},

Title = {{DEVELOPMENT OF A LASER-GUIDED, EMBEDDED-COMPUTER-CONTROLLED,

Abstract = {{An embedded computer-controlled, laser-guided, air-assisted,
   variable-rate precision sprayer was developed to automatically adjust
   spray outputs on both sides of the sprayer to match the presence, size,
   shape, and foliage density of tree crops in real time. The sprayer was
   the integration of an embedded computer, a touch screen, a 270 degrees
   radial-range laser sensor, a travel speed sensor, a unique algorithm, a
   custom-designed automatic flow rate control unit, and 40
   pulse-width-modulated (PWM) nozzles. The accuracy of the sprayer to
   detect different-sized trees and control the spray outputs of individual
   nozzles based on tree structures was tested in a commercial nursery.
   Spray deposition qualities between variable-rate and constant-rate
   operational modes of the sprayer were also compared. Test results
   demonstrated the capability of the sprayer to measure different trees
   accurately and then control the spray outputs of nozzles independently
   to match tree structure. The outline profile similarity of paired images
   taken with a digital camera and with the laser sensor for three trees
   ranged from 0.81 to 0.89. To spray trees of different sizes and shapes,
   the sprayer in variable-rate mode (VRM) consumed 12.1\% to 43.3\% of the
   spray volume that was used in constant-rate mode (CRM) with an
   application rate of 468 L ha(-1). Moreover, the sprayer had 30\% and
   55\% greater coverage areas per amount of spray deposits in VRM than in
   CRM. This innovative sprayer should have significant potential to reduce
   pesticide waste, provide sustainable crop protection to growers, and
   safeguard the environment.}},

Abstract = {{After decades of breakneck economic growth and as its media environment
   continues to evolve, China's notoriously cavalier approach to
   intellectual property rights (IPR) is also changing. In fact, it has
   recently become the most litigious country in the world when it comes to
   IPR protection in the digital domain. There is a wide range of
   interpretations on this topic given China's political, economic and
   social complexities, but empirical evidence is lacking. This study aims
   to fill that gap by investigating 351 cases involving the country's five
   biggest websites from 2003 to 2013. It analyses win rates and damages
   awarded based on the court records, as well as the factors that
   influenced the judgements. The data showed that, in that decade, the win
   rate was 24 per cent for websites being sued - but the rate jumped to 90
   per cent for websites suing others. Plaintiffs were awarded a median
   5,502 yuan in damages - representing a median 10 per cent of their
   claims. The average win rate fluctuated in the period, while the amount
   of median damages awarded decreased over time. More interesting, the
   data revealed the significant impacts of the situation of the litigants
   (the party capacity effect), the type of content in dispute (the medium
   effect) and the jurisdiction on the outcome of cases. This research adds
   an empirical footnote on the growing field of copyright on the Internet
   and sheds light on the general direction of digital IPR protection in
   China.}},

Abstract = {{US President Donald Trump and the Silicon Valley innovation ecosystem
   have ironically compatible views on subjects such as the roles of the
   private and public sectors; the value of audacious disruption; the
   importance of US supremacy in the global marketplace; and the need for
   domestic infrastructure improvements. At the beginning of Trump's
   presidency, he and Silicon Valley might have found, through these points
   of convergence, some common ground on cybersecurity. That has not
   happened. The administration's main initiative - an executive order not
   released until May 2017 - was a thoughtful interim measure, but it did
   little to address the immediate and urgent need to improve security, nor
   did it put forward a strong long-term vision for collaboration with the
   private sector. That is partly because cybersecurity issues have become
   politically precarious in the wake of a US presidential election
   compromised by digital attacks from Russia. Nevertheless, there remain
   opportunities for quick wins: The Trump administration can lead the way
   on setting new norms in nation-state cybersecurity behavior; investing
   in digital infrastructure ; creating a larger and better trained
   cybersecurity workforce; and stimulating research and innovation. These
   relatively apolitical and potentially bipartisan initiatives could make
   an important difference at a time when the cybersecurity environment is
   visibly deteriorating.}},

Journal = {{IIUM LAW JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{179-196}},
Abstract = {{Cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, is a digital currency in which encryption
   techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and
   verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.
   It is an emerging financial technology enabled by innovation,
   increasingly popular among global Internet users, and more
   interestingly, it challenges the existing financial and regulatory rules
   on the currency and payment systems of the world today. On the other
   side, certain cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, have been actively used as
   payment tools for illicit transactions. Both the ``promising{''} and
   ``challenging{''} faces of cryptocurrency trigger causes for concern for
   policy makers, not only from financial sector, but also legal and
   technological sectors. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrency
   creates unique problems for the government to regulate or impose any
   regulatory requirements. This article argues that, in order for Malaysia
   to remain at the forefront of financial and digital innovation, it is
   timely to look at the question on whether to formulate certain policy
   and regulatory framework on the use of cryptocurrency in Malaysian
   market. The answer can pave the way for Malaysian digital citizens to
   potentially grab the opportunities made possible by the cryptocurrency
   technology. For this purpose, the researchers seek to study the features
   of cryptocurrency and the experiences from policymakers in other
   jurisdictions in dealing with the matter.}},

   the promise of technology today and are well-defined as things belonging
   to the Internet aiding to the accessibility and supply of all of
   real-time data. Millions of devices are expected to be connected or
   networked into the IoT structure which requires massive dissemination of
   networks as well as the method of converting raw data into meaningful
   interpretations. The form of communication that is experienced now is
   either human-human or human-device, but Internet of Things (IoT) assures
   a promising type of communication, that is machine-machine (M2M). More
   influential smart phones, appliances, tablets and the applications that
   are similarly rich and powerful available for each, will enable buyers
   and business customers to interact seamlessly with companies altering
   the business processes. With businesses realizing that great digital
   experience to customers is no longer nice to have, but it is a
   make-or-break point for business has led to the integration and wider
   acceptance of Internet of Things. This chapter gives an idea of Internet
   of Things (IoT), the technologies that enable the implementation of IoT,
   the objectives and the future vision of IoT, the general layered
   architecture of IoT and the future growth challenges. This chapter also
   discusses the various applications of IoT and two case studies.}},

Abstract = {{A map is a communication way in which the message, related to spatial
   information, is transmitted through a visual and a written language. Far
   from being an exclusively geographic tool, it is the graphic and
   symbolic representation of a reality of which a planimetric knowledge is
   known. Therefore, nature can be mapped at all levels and the information
   on the anatomy of extant and extinct organisms is no exception.
   Along the history, anatomy has been mapped at the macroscopic and
   microscopic level. Regarding the cartography of the macroanatomy, a map
   must be express in a standardized language style. It means that
   anatomical maps, like other types of maps, have a specific reference
   language which has been reached by international consensus. This
   language was standardized in anatomical cartography after the Modern
   Age, and the research possibilities of the macroanatomy diversified.
   On the one hand, the classic sketch of the anatomy, of a more artistic
   type and reflecting in many cases the philosophical and religious
   beliefs of the time, changed to the drawing of anatomical cartography
   based on the empirical-analytical method, typical of the Natural and
   Social Sciences, and which possesses such standardized language. On the
   other hand, from the 18th century onwards, the study of living beings at
   an individual level change to an analysis that integrated organisms
   together as a whole (at the level of species and populations). That is
   to say, anatomical studies began to acquire an Evolutionary and
   taxonomic interest. Then an incipient discipline, the Comparative
   Anatomy, stablished the foundations of anatomical cartography with an
   ontogenetic and evolutionary perspective. After its apogee, at the
   beginning of the 20th century, a new phase was developed in the study of
   the organic form, in which the aim was to analyze the morphology of
   living beings and their growth processes from a mathematical perspective
   through the mapping of its structures and modeling. These ideas were
   very innovative and constituted the theoretical starting point for the
   development of another technique (one of the most recent) of surface
   anatomical mapping: geometric morphometrics.
   All these traditional methods for the study of macroscopic anatomy were
   based on direct invasive techniques (such as dissection) that allowed
   the observation of the systems and organs of the human body and other
   animals. However, at the end of the 19th century a technique emerged
   that revolutionized the study of the organisms inside, allowing their
   study noninvasively and being alive (i. e., indirectly). This turning
   point is the discovery of X-rays, which allowed the development of
   radiology and tomography.
   Concerning the microscopic anatomy or microanatomy, it is the study of
   the levels of biological organization not observable to the naked eye,
   such as the tissue, the cell and the molecule. Therefore, its origin as
   a discipline is linked directly to the invention of the microscope and
   the first works of exploration in histology. This was revealed from the
   outset as a very useful discipline in the study of the history of growth
   and evolution of species, thanks precisely to the mapping and
   quantification of tissue structures. Its main problem is that it is
   usually based on direct invasive and, therefore, pseudo-destructive
   techniques. As it was the case for macroanatomy investigations, the
   search for methods that allowed the analysis of the inside of the
   organisms (by means of techniques that did not alter the specimens),
   tools for the indirect mapping of Microanatomic structures were
   investigated. Thus, microtomography techniques arise, which are direct
   heirs of the X-rays and the tomography (based too on the properties of
   the X-rays).
   Thanks to the technological and digital revolution of the last decades,
   there has been a rise in the techniques of mapping of the macroscopic
   and microscopic anatomy. The new bi and three-dimensional imaging
   techniques have entailed a change in the concept of the anatomical map,
   from the classic illustration or sketch to the quantifiable and virtual
   image. Nowadays, the study of anatomy has become a very versatile
   analysis, using both classic research techniques, that continue to
   provide useful information (e.g., classical morphological studies of
   comparative anatomy, paleohistology), such as new tools (e.g., geometric
   morphometrics, tomography and microtomography). The results obtained
   from the mapping of macro and microstructures have important
   implications for Evolutionary and Developmental Biology, Ontogeny,
   Ecology and Paleontology.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution plan of the European Railways Train Management System
   (ERTMS) includes the GNSS localization as one of the Game Changer
   technologies to improve the competitiveness of the ERTMS. GNSS will
   allow the implementation of cost-effective solutions to reduce the
   maintenance and operational cost without reducing the safety levels
   required by railway operations. The inherent low power of satellite
   navigation signals exposes GNSS-based solution to Radio Frequency
   threats, namely intentional or unintentional interference, that can lead
   to performance degradation or denial of service, and to
   spoofing/meaconing attacks, that can lead to receiver deception and
   hence to misleading PVT (Position, Velocity and Time) estimation. The
   aim of this paper is to present an architecture for detection and
   mitigation of radio-frequency hazards in a rail operational environment.
   The investigated solution is based on a Digital Beamforming Platform
   (DBP) coupled with advanced GNSS signal processing techniques for high
   rejection of GNSS interfering and counterfeit signals. This approach
   fully exploits the characteristics of the railway context, to support
   the evolution of the Location Determination System (LDS) based on GNSS
   in ERTMS Train Control System (TCS). This paper presents the DBP
   architectural design, focusing on the most meaningful and innovative
   solution foreseen for the prototype implementation. Each subsystem of
   the DBP is described in details, and a preliminary assessment of the
   performances is provided, by means of simulative and analytic tools.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter explains the overview of human capital; human capital and
   economic growth; human capital, innovation, and knowledge management;
   human capital and research and development (R \& human capital,
   political regime, and foreign direct investment (FDI); human capital,
   employment, and labor markets; the measure of human capital; and the
   challenges and implications of human capital in the digital age. Human
   capital refers to knowledge, skills, and abilities acquired by an
   individual, traditionally through education and work experience. Human
   capital has a positive relationship with entrepreneurial success,
   business growth, and economic development. Creating an organization that
   relies on human capital for competitive advantage involves designing
   every organizational system with an essential approach to attracting,
   developing, retaining, and motivating the highly qualified people. The
   chapter argues that developing human capital has the potential to
   enhance organizational performance and gain sustainable competitive
   advantage in the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{International Business Machines (IBM) points out that academics and
   industries pay a higher attention on ``Service Science{''} since 1985.
   With the rotation of the wheel of a service era, many companies has
   driven from production to service-orientation, and focus on
   manufacturing services field. In the past, high-tech companies with
   leading technologies and unique products were ahead of other companies,
   but nowadays, this pattern is changed due to the changing market
   environment, consumption and other factors. In order to attract
   customers and to continue a leading position at the market, companies
   require to have service innovation infrastructure. This study focuses on
   enhancement of service innovation goal by professional managers'
   entrepreneurship for high-tech companies in Hsinchu Science Park and
   Silicon Valley areas.
   Initially, in accordance with the purpose of the study, relevant
   literatures integrated from domestic and international journals to
   develop the draft questionnaire. Then, a survey was conducted at Hsinchu
   Science Park and Silicon Valley by the participation of 12 experts to
   finalize the content of the questionnaire. Third, the pilot
   questionnaire survey sent out to 250 participants (200 in Hsinchu
   Science Park and 50 in Silicon Valley) through e-mail and internet
   platform. Finally, the statistical software is used analyze multivariate
   regression.
   Findings state that the personality (PersA) of Entrepreneurial
   Orientation to Service Innovation (InnV) no significant correlation. The
   personality (PersB) to InnV have significant correlation. When PersA
   integrated environment (Env) to InnV generated significant positive
   correlation; PersB integrated Env to InnV got strong positive
   correlation. Consequently, environment factor hold on intermediary
   efficient results. PersA integrated Organizational Factor (OrgV) have
   significant correlation but only increase a little coefficient value.
   PersB integrated OrgV have significant correlation but decrease the
   coefficient value. Consequently, this study demonstrates that OrgV
   doesn't have an intermediary efficient result.
   The result of the analysis is useful for decision - makings of top
   managers, when they adopt service innovation in these two Science Park.
   Moreover, results provide theoretical contribution for academicians for
   their future academic reports.}},

Abstract = {{Governments and communities increasingly rely on well-managed,
   accessible technology resources to improve their daily lives.
   Rapidly-advancing innovation and widespread use of electronics now
   require rapid adaptation of city services to meet the needs of local
   citizens. A well-known fixture in the array of city services is the
   public library. Technological advancements have transformed the needs
   and expectations of traditional library patrons and have shifted
   priorities towards effectively managing choices in technology the
   facility should offer. This study will examine the issues, attitudes,
   and trends shaping services in public government, specifically the
   public library. Using data gathered from a survey distributed to 92
   patrons of a small, suburban library, we explore the relationship
   between personal variables such as age, gender, race and level of
   education and the value library patrons place on services and
   technologies offered (digitized media, internet access, electronic
   resources, and so forth). This study will assist government and library
   professionals in achieving a fuller understanding of the technologies
   that different demographics prioritize and will assist in guiding
   decision-making processes for technology implementation and management
   at a local level.}},

Abstract = {{Demands towards sustainable choices in business operations are
   increasing and more influential solutions are required. This means
   changes and development of innovations that allow the creation of new
   markets and value networks by combining new set of sustainability -
   driven values-finding disruptive innovations for sustainability.
   Increased digitalization is seen to provide multiple value creation
   mechanisms and possibilities by enhancing the more effective use of
   resources. The emergence of IOT (Internet of Things) has connected
   objects (e.g. physical devices, buildings and vehicles) to existing
   network of information. IOT can work as a trigger for creation of new
   markets and value networks by connecting existing information, networked
   economies and societies together in a new way. Expectations towards IOT
   solutions are high and they are expected to revolutionize the business
   markets by promoting the emergence of disruptive innovations for
   sustainability e.g. in healthcare and transportation solutions, smart
   cities, intelligent energy services and circular economy. The study
   focuses on reviewing the impact of IOT in developing these innovations
   aiming to foster disruptive sustainable change.}},

Abstract = {{Technological capabilities are tied to the strategy of a company
   supported by the concepts of path dependence and absorptive capacities,
   they describe the fields that help the company to achieve its
   strategical objectives.
   This paper objective is to analyze Netflix change in technological
   fields through the time and compare these changes with two strategic
   moments, start to provide VOD service and the decision to go global. Two
   research questions are proposed 1) which are Netflix's technological
   capabilities in time, 2) How the technological capabilities change in
   the two strategical moments, Netflix start of provision of VOD service
   in 2007 and Netflix decision to provide services abroad in 2010.
   Longitudinal systematic descriptive analysis of Netflix's patents IPC
   codes is done, in order to get some insights of NETFLIX's change of
   technological capabilities in time.
   Three changes in Netflix technological capabilities were detected, 2000

Abstract = {{Data-centered and customer-oriented business models shape the
   digitalization to be the central social, economic and technological
   development of current knowledge societies. A great share of these new
   business models is enabled by smart product field data, which is
   generated during the product ` s phase of utilization. To capture the
   diluting value and commodification of mechanical products, companies
   within the manufacturing industry as the provider of smart products have
   to position themselves strategically against new competitors, e.g. from
   the IT sector, to avoid being victim to the ``digital Darwinism{''}. A
   growing number of manufacturing companies already starts to see the
   revenue and differentiation potential of smart product data as a
   competitive advantage. Similar to other intangible assets, a
   comprehensive understanding of the quality, scope and value of smart
   product field data is a basic prerequisite for its monetization.
   However, so far the majority of companies are lacking this basic
   understanding for the value of their smart product data, thus not being
   able to lever its potentials. Hence, this paper develops a model, which
   supports manufacturing companies in assessing, if a generic set of field
   data generated by a smart product is able to provide value added for the
   user. In the model itself, field data of smart products as well as
   ``digitally enabled functionalities{''} will be examined extensively.
   Subsequently, generic sets of field data as carrier of information will
   be mapped regarding their suitability for enabling functionalities,
   which represent a demand of information.}},

   caused by digitalization in an established machine-building industry. We
   demonstrate the usability of the method in detecting differences in
   future worldviews of practicing managers with results highlighting
   polarized responses with significant clustering among groups. For
   example, the respondents that were inclined to view that digital
   technologies are disruptive, i.e. change the paradigm of value creation
   in machine-building, also viewed that it is more related to service and
   business models than products and operation. Digitally enabled concepts
   like open innovation and industrial internet were perceived to be more
   disruptive drivers than the digital technologies themselves.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the manuscript is to use grounded theory building method
   to investigate three industry contexts that show disruptive innovations
   based in digital technologies that change the dynamics in industry
   competition. Specifically, we investigate the mechanisms of disruption
   in these cases and seek common features of change.
   Our analysis builds on mechanisms as detecting actors, their properties,
   and start- and end-states of the system under change and activities of
   the actors that bring about the change. Our analysis shows common themes
   that are exhibited throughout all the cases. One of these mechanisms is
   de-coupling of traditional value chain activities. These de-coupling
   mechanisms are driven by the formation of innovation ecosystems rather
   than traditional value chains. This is further accelerated by the
   emergence of platforms and digital technologies at large. We propose,
   based on our results, some fundamental mechanisms that are driving
   industry transformation due to digitalization. We also discuss
   managerial and theoretical implications of our results in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The border between tangible and digital products is getting more
   diffuse, and the design methodologies are converging to a more
   comprehensive and holistic approach in that sense. The output of these
   novel innovation processes is often a digital entity like an app or a
   physical object. For users and consumers, it is important to keep a
   fluid interface between hardware and software assuring a proper and
   effective user experience (UX) during all user interaction (UI). This
   work uses review-centric research to identify from theory, a set of
   innovation and technological capabilities used in the product design
   stage of software development, and explores onto which of them are
   common to the tangible product design. The capabilities were grouped in
   three dimensions: organizational (human and strategy), structural
   (technology and knowledge management) and relationships (partnerships
   and transfer). Agile methodologies, rapid application development (RAD),
   scrum frameworks, lean development, Unified Modeling Language (UML), and
   other software industry tools were used as examples of design capability
   resources alongside new product development (NPD) and its product design
   and strategy generation tools for project development in
   tangible/non-tangible products like QFD, Stage-Gate, TRIZ, etc. A model
   of a common product development cycle for both tangible and software
   products is displayed showing their similarity and how they connect.}},

Abstract = {{On May 21, 2015, The Guardian newspaper reported that TEDxSydney had
   designed a new national campaign to change social attitudes towards
   people living with disabilities (Davey, 2015). The campaign, announced
   at the Sydney Opera House, was due to be launched in December 2015 to
   coincide with the United Nations International Day of People with
   Disability and was framed as being in memory of Stella Young, a writer,
   comedian and disability advocate, who died in December 2014. Arguably it
   was an innovative campaign, with the potential to put disabilities on
   the social media map.
   As with many social campaigns at the time, the initiative was primarily
   built around a hashtag (\#StellasChallenge) and sought to engage with
   both the disabled and the non-disabled. While the objective of the
   exercise was framed as ``changing social attitudes{''}, the subsequent
   engagement between the organisation, TEDxSydney, and representatives of
   the disabled community was arguably not what TEDxSydney had intended.
   Ironically, the campaign was said to be inspired by Stella, who had
   proclaimed that she despised ``inspiration porn{''} related to those
   with disabilities (Davey, 2015).
   Using a case study approach methodology, this paper provides an analysis
   of \#StellasChallenge to develop an in-depth understanding of what
   innovative engagement does-and importantly does not-mean in the digital
   public sphere, through the broad lens of health at the community,
   organisational and individual levels of society. The paper highlights
   the challenges inherent in the digital world when attempting to
   innovatively engage with publics on sensitive, complex and deeply
   personal issues, such as disability and more broadly health. It draws on
   theory and practice in digital advocacy, public relations, web
   communication, health communication, issues management and stakeholder
   and community engagement. In the spirit of innovation (the theme of the
   2016 PRIA national conference and research symposium where an early
   version of this paper was presented), this paper includes first-hand
   insights and critical reflections by one of the activists who campaigned
   against the \#StellasChallenge initiative.}},

Abstract = {{PROTHEGO (PROTection of European Cultural HEritage from GeO-hazards) is
   a collaborative research project funded in the framework of the Joint
   Programming Initiative on Cultural Heritage and Global Change (JPICH) -
   Heritage Plus in 2015-2018 (www.prothego.eu). PROTHEGO aims to make an
   innovative contribution towards the analysis of geo-hazards in areas of
   cultural heritage, and uses novel space technology for the management of
   sites and world heritage monuments located throughout Europe, using
   specialized remote sensing techniques. The methodology will include the
   395 monuments of UNESCO in Europe, with case studies conducted in 4
   UNESCO sites in England, Spain, Italy and Cyprus. For the Cyprus case
   study in Choirokoitia, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used to
   monitor and assess the risk from natural hazards on the archaeological
   site to evaluate cultural heritage sites deformation. The UAVs were
   flown over the study area to produce time-series data, including
   orthoimages, 3D models and digital elevation models of the Choirokoitia
   site in order to identify changes in the area caused by natural hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Financial Re-engineering is designing of the financial instruments,
   process and policy customized to the needs of client base. This can help
   Financial Institutions to move a step ahead in bringing the economically
   marginalized populace towards prosperity by bringing them actively in
   financial system. For this financial institutions should concentrate on
   the problem faced by these clients in availing the finance facilities
   and should re-engineer the current financial instruments or should
   innovate new financial instruments to tap the available market
   efficiently. The study is based on secondary data collected from the
   recent studies in various parts in India. The research paper discusses
   the reviews of financial inclusion studies in India to identify how it
   serves the inclusive economic growth in the country. Also it attempts to
   suggest certain tools through financial re-engineering and innovations
   to advance a level in direction of financial inclusion. One such
   innovative instrument that can be developed by micro insurance companies
   is providing in kind benefits instead of cash benefits during the
   claims. Designing composite products that includes a combination of
   different micro financial instruments can also be helpful for improving
   the financial inclusion. Digitizing payments is also an important step
   forward towards financial inclusion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the most relevant findings from a study of the
   pedagogical and technological characteristics of a sample of digital
   educational content repositories and platforms currently available in
   our country for Primary Education from both commercial and public
   sources. The paper starts with some brief comments on what we consider
   to be the main aspects of evaluating didactic materials in the context
   of the digital society. The study methodology consisted of content
   analysis. A guide-tool was developed for analyzing a sample of didactic
   materials from three Autonomous Communities (Canary Islands, Galicia and
   Valencia). A total of 68 digital materials were evaluated. The research
   results reveal that the didactic materials analyzed present little
   evidence of innovative strategies and do not fully exploit the potential
   of ICTs in the design and use of materials. A number of recommendations
   are made regarding measures to be adopted by institutions and
   professionals involved in the design and use of digital materials.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2013, the Italian Minister of Education promoted the use of
   digital or mixed paper-digital texts in the classroom by means of
   legislative act (Lex 128/2013). Since then, adoption of the textbook is
   not mandatory in our country: Italian schools, according to their
   autonomy, can choose to adopt teaching materials from publishers, Open
   Educational Resources, or auto-produced texts. The law legitimates the
   experience of some Italian schools that are innovating the use of
   textbooks and are involved in a process of auto-production of content
   (textbooks or DDC, Didactic Digital Content). The article attempts to
   describe the work of these schools within a network of practice named
   ``Avanguardie Educative{''}. It intends to analyse teachers beliefs and
   attitudes upon ``studying{''}, ``textbooks{''} and ``digital texts{''},
   to capture innovative aspects, but also to look at difficulties and
   obstacles along the path of innovation, not always so clear and well
   defined.}},

Abstract = {{The precipitated changes through the information society in various
   areas of productivity and communication, requires new means of
   transmitting knowledge are adopted through communication and use of
   information remotely.
   Thus the transformation of education is a key hub for new capacities for
   creativity and innovation, which are routed together with solidarity and
   integration to different changes develop. From this reason that in
   education not only curricula are taught but a significant change in
   terms of learning processes, communication and knowledge production is
   generated.
   It is necessary to improve the quality of education so that their role
   is enforced effectively in society and to a, competitive global order
   that focuses on the knowledge society. It is also of great value the
   educational development interact with audiovisual and interactive tools,
   where more participation of the individual is ever generated.
   Therefore, it is the importance of the interaction of education, culture
   and new technologies of information and communication technologies
   (TIC). Working in TIC education is to generate new ways to produce new
   knowledge, communicating at a distance and be part of a digital era

Abstract = {{This chapter presents the opportunities offered by the ICT revolution in
   the making of digitally connected cities, which manifests in the rise of
   urban centers-towns of less than 1 million people. It presents a new
   form of urbanization, the digital urbanization, where digitally
   connected towns offer urban advantages traditionally only found in big
   cities with high densities, such as economies of scale, agglomeration of
   economies, diffusion of ideas and innovation, and participation in
   political affairs. The digital urbanization is illustrated through the
   initiative of the Government of Senegal to create new urban centers to
   decongest the agglomeration of Dakar which are trapped in frequent flood
   disasters and continuous traffic congestion among many other urban
   issues.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter emphasizes the overview of corporate social responsibility
   (CSR); the practices and disclosure of CSR; CSR and human values; CSR in
   mining operations; CSR in sports tourism industry; CSR in emerging
   economies; and the perspectives of CSR in the digital age. A strategic
   approach to CSR is crucial to a company's success. CSR can bring various
   benefits in terms of risk management, cost savings, access to capital,
   customer relationships, human resource management, and innovation
   capacity. CSR encourages more social and environmental responsibility
   from the corporate sector at a time when the crisis has damaged consumer
   confidence and the levels of trust in business. Socially responsible
   companies can improve their brand reputation, attract more customers,
   and increase stakeholder engagement. The chapter argues that promoting
   CSR has the potential to enhance organizational performance and reach
   strategic goals in the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{The Biblioteca Digital Ovidiana is based on a research project dealing
   with the illustrated editions of the works of Ovid printed from the
   fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries and preserved in Spanish
   libraries. The main innovation of the project consists in the specific
   focus on illustration. The role of the image within the illustrated
   book, the relations that it develops with the text and the value of the
   figurative apparatus in relationship with the literary work constitute
   the main fields of analysis and study of the editions and copies. Using
   as a study case the Transformaciones de Ovidio en lengua castellana
   (Antwerp, 1595), one of the only two illustrated Spanish editions of the
   Metamorphoses dating from the sixteenth century, this contribution aims
   to show how the illustrated books are approached from the viewpoint of
   the figurative corpus that accompanies the text, as well as the
   analysis, study and treatment of the illustrations as images, that is,
   as bearers and conveyors of specific meaning through a different medium.}},

Abstract = {{Progressive development of modern stomatological science involves the
   continuous improvement of the known methods of diagnosis and treatment
   of dental diseases. In the field of prosthodontics example of this trend
   is the availability of metal-free crowns in the market, which have
   appeared as an alternative to metal-ceramic. However, taking into
   account the number of factors metal constructions are still relevant.
   Basing on the analysis of the literature to optimize approach in
   odontopreparation for metal-ceramic crowns, identify morphological
   changes of dental tissues at different types of orthodontic preparation,
   and give clinic-morphological study of the proposed method of preparing
   teeth for metal-ceramic construction. Analytical method based on
   analysis of histochemical, histological features of identifying
   structural components of hard tissue in intact teeth and teeth with
   different types of odontopreparation and volumetric digital scanning to
   determine the working preparation thickness of hard tooth tissue in
   different experimental groups. The results of own research it should be
   affirmed the development of some kind of vibration disease in the
   tissues of the tooth that causes destructive changes of hard tissue and
   pulp, expressed in varying degrees in experimental groups. On the basis
   of the determined morphological changes in the tissue of teeth during
   odontopreparation for metal-ceramic construction, it is justified the
   maximum preservation of hard tissue of neck area, forming a ledge

   confirmed by a number of own laboratory research.}},

Abstract = {{In order to meet requirements by automotive industry like decreasing the
   CO2 emissions, which reflects in reducing vehicles mass in the car body,
   the chassis and the powertrain, the continuous innovation and further
   development of existing production processes are required. In sheet
   metal forming processes the process limits and components
   characteristics are defined through the process specific loads. While
   exceeding the load limits, a failure in the material occurs, which can
   be avoided by additional force transmission activated in the deep
   drawing process before the process limit is achieved. This contribution
   deals with experimental investigations of a forming process with
   additional force transmission regarding the extension of the process
   limits. Based on FEA a tool system is designed and developed by IFUM.
   For this purpose, the steel material HCT600 is analyzed numerically.
   Within the experimental investigations, the deep drawing processes, with
   and without the additional force transmission are carried out. Here, a
   comparison of the produced rectangle cups is done. Subsequently, the
   identical deep drawing processes are investigated numerically. Thereby,
   the values of the punch reaction force and displacement are estimated
   and compared with experimental results. Thus, the validation of material
   model is successfully carried out on process scale. For further
   quantitative verification of the FEA results the experimental determined
   geometry of the rectangular cup is measured optically with ATOS system
   of the company GOM mbH and digitally compared with external software
   Geomagic (R) QualifyTM. The goal of this paper is the verification of
   the transferability of the FEA model for a conventional deep drawing
   process to a deep drawing process with additional force transmission
   with a counter punch.}},

Abstract = {{The Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy is widely used for the manufacture of
   aeronautical and automotive parts (solid parts). In aeronautics, this
   alloy is employed for its excellent mechanical behavior associated with
   low density, outstanding corrosion resistance and good mechanical
   properties up to 600 degrees C. It is especially used for the
   manufacture of fuselage frames, on the pylon for carrying out the
   primary structure (machining forged blocks) and the secondary structure
   in sheet form. In this last case, the sheet metal forming can be done
   through various methods: at room temperature by drawing operation, at
   very high temperature (similar or equal to 900 degrees C) by
   superplastic forming (SPF) and at intermediate temperature (>= 750
   degrees C) by hot forming (HF). In order to reduce production costs and
   environmental troubles, the cycle times reduction associated with a
   decrease of temperature levels are relevant. This study focuses on the
   behavior modelling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy at temperatures above room
   temperature to obtained greater formability and below SPF condition to
   reduce tools workshop and energy costs. The displacement field
   measurement obtained by Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is based on
   innovative surface preparation pattern adapted to high temperature
   exposures. Different material parameters are identified to define a
   model able to predict the mechanical behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy under
   hot stamping conditions. The hardening plastic model identified is
   introduced in FEM to simulate an omega shape forming operation.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years a great database has aroused concerning the deep
   transformations triggered by the so-called ``digital revolution{''} in
   all research fields. Architecture has been highly affected by this
   phenomenon but, while it is commonplace to measure these changes in
   terms of ``science{''}, much less popular are those aspects connected
   with the Humanities integrated in any architectural work. History of
   Architecture represents from this standpoint a perfect example of how
   new digital tools and approaches can help to disclose novel research
   opportunities. The paper presents two projects regarding the Vatican
   Basilica (the Sangallo's wooden model for the New St. Peter and the
   reconstruction of St. Peter's square ``the day before{''} the moving of
   the Vatican Obelisk led by Domenico Fontana) as paradigmatic showcases.}},

   competencies and the development of media-information literacy of
   students with the ICT for education. The essence of the notion ``Working
   educational space of discipline{''} is substantiated. Examples of the
   content and functional structure of the electronic environment from
   ``Methods of teaching economics{''} are given. The models of educational
   actions of the student for self-organization of training and
   self-designing of educational results in the context of the concept of

   devices as the technological innovation to display multimedia as the
   modern language learning methods in the digital age. TELL, CALL, and
   MALL effectively improve learning motivation and develop better
   attitudes in students and language learners toward language learning.
   The chapter argues that encouraging the applications of TELL, CALL, and

Abstract = {{Computer assisted learning is an increasingly important area of
   education especially now, in digital era. The past thirty years have
   seen increasingly rapid advances in the ICT infrastructure development
   in the educational facilities. However, this is just one part of the
   aspects needed for modernisation and innovation of education. The
   chapter discusses the situation in Slovakia, its rather well-developed
   infrastructure but it also points out how important it is to focus on
   teacher, learner and interaction in any - face-to-face, technology
   assisted or virtual environment. Numerous studies provide important
   insights into the situation where teachers have the possibilities and
   facilities, however, they are not trained to use them effectively. The
   author brings the survey based on the published studies, research
   results, statistics and her own experience.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the strategy for the Digital Single Market (DSM) adopted by the
   European Commission, having in mind also the European Parliament and the
   Council directive (EU) Regulation No. 910/2014 from 23 July 2014
   regarding electronic identification and trust services for electronic
   transactions in the internal market, the European Commission emphasizes
   the need for development and understanding the digital single market's
   impact on the economy, market environment and society as a whole. The
   paper tries to examine how the development of standardization,
   interoperability, digital and data economy will affect changes in the
   level of market transparency, reduction the asymmetry of information,
   competition, pricing and benefits of products and services, the level of
   trust and entrepreneurship values in the digital market on performance
   characteristics of the market environment. The research will be based on
   data from the real environment.}},

Abstract = {{There have been analyzed reasons of the loss of technical education's
   popularity. Also, the analysis of known educational and production
   methods, oriented at the innovative model of development of society, was
   performed. It is stated that the acquisition of 21st century's skills as
   a result of competition of technical education are natural for the DIY
   ideology, which was realized in the institutions like Fab Lab. The new
   educational strategy, based on project-based learning, is proposed to be
   implemented as a special laboratory with equipment, which would be a
   center of innovative development for students at the Technical
   University. Moreover, the list of projects planned for implementation,
   that includes not only projects, specific to a particular university,
   but also projects, demanded by society as a whole, is specified. It is
   worth to implement trendy projects in the laboratory, such as toy-like,
   ecological projects; projects of the energy dependence decrease or the
   energy efficiency increase, modern digital or innovative projects etc.
   The student should gain knowledge, skills and, possibly, equipment that
   are available for immediate usage on the labor market or for the
   realization of his own projects or the community's projects in everyday
   life after the realization of the particular project at the laboratory}},

Title = {{Connective Action as the New Pattern of Protest Activism}},
Journal = {{SOCIOLOGIJA}},
Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{405-426}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to examine the organizational background of the
   protests ``Against dictatorship{''} that took place in several Serbian
   towns, in the spring of 2017. The absence of the official organizers and
   the role social networking sites played in terms of communication,
   organization and coordination of the protest events, raises the
   following question: Could the protest ``Against dictatorship{''} be
   considered as an example of a digitally enabled ``connective{''} action?
   According to the connective action{''} approach (Bennett \& Segerberg,
   2012, 2013), in the information society a new connective{''} form of
   collective action is emerging as a result of personalization of
   political action that occurs within new socio-technological environment.
   Connective action is enabled by innovative technological opportunities
   for individual participation in collective ventures and supported by the
   role that ICTs play as ``stitching{''} and organizing agents of
   collective action.
   In such circumstances, conventional social movement organizations and
   solid collective identities seem to become far less necessary.
   The analysis of the data collected in the field (N = 175) and in the
   online survey of the experiences and attitudes towards the protest
   (N=225), leads to the conclusion that the organizational background of
   the protest ``Against dictatorship{''} is closest to the ideal-type of
   ``self-organized network{''}, as one of the two basic models of
   connective action.
   In the concluding part of this paper, the authors argue that the
   connective action{''} model is adequate for the interpretation of the
   emergence of the digitally mediated protests. However, with the
   transformation of protests into more solid and stable forms of
   collective action, this model loses its explanatory power.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by globalisation, urbanisation, and virtualisation, over the past
   two decades the world has witnessed the rise of the notion of a smart
   city. The essence of a smart city is bettering local governance and
   improving collective outcomes via a complex set of inter-related
   technological and human capacities for learning, innovation and
   adaptation. The purpose of this article is to examine the emergence of
   one aspiring smart city in Canada - and the production and distribution
   of new governance processes with a specific focus in the evolving
   efforts of local government in orchestrating such processes. Our primary
   focus is to better understand the tensions between traditional
   government on the one hand and emergent Gov 2.0 capacities on the other
   hand. With the long term success of Halifax as a smart city dependent
   upon a more digital and participative form of democratic governance, we
   aim to derive from this case some important lessons learned regarding
   the opportunities and barriers confronting local governments engaged in
   this transformational endeavour.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{5-14}},
Abstract = {{This article conceptualizes acting on media in terms of different
   interplays between focal actors, users, and user communities. It is
   argued that-in times of mediated visibility, the increasing entanglement
   of social and technological change, and accelerated feedback
   loops-arenas of negotiation emerge and therewith the complexities of
   relations between producers and users increases. Using insights from the
   fields of Wii hacking, Circuit Bending, and online poker tools, three
   variants of interplay are presented and discussed: integration,
   segregation, and permanent confrontation. Whilst a process-oriented
   perspective on reciprocal action is developed the paper contributes (a)
   to a balanced perspective on what is often a one-sided discussion
   regarding the actions leading to media change, and (b) to the
   understanding of the relation between media change and reflexive
   modernity.}},

Abstract = {{Drastic and inclusive technology progress is changing the economy of
   Russia and foreign countries. This progress significantly impacts
   production forces.. This paper analyzes theoretical and applied
   approaches to the investigation of production forces development. I
   reveal the role and importance of innovations in science and technology
   as well as their impact on various segments of the economy. I analyze
   the conceptual framework used for technological shifts. The paper
   describes the indicators showing the level of scientific and
   technological potential development in various countries and regions
   including the Urals. I define growth areas in technology and assess
   their contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The
   administrations and authorities at federal and regional levels impact
   the development of science, innovations, technologies and breakthrough
   areas. The development of these spheres leads to the increase in
   productivity of social activities, production and business activity. The
   paper reveals the impact of the technological breakthrough in such
   latest fields as the alternative energy sources, drones, electric car
   industry, storage and delivery of energy. This fields transform the
   economy and society. Furthermore, they change theoretical concepts of
   functional and institutional social structure. The development paradigm
   is to be modified from fuel and raw model to the innovative and
   technological one. The economic development and scientific and
   technological potential are interrelated. I discuss the reason of close
   attention to the development of science, technologies, innovations in
   the developed countries. as well as the measures to stimulate their
   development. The article studies the mechanism and tools of science and
   education funding in various regions of the world. The results of the
   research may be used for updating the strategy of scientific and
   technological development of Russia and its regions in the current
   situation as well as for choosing necessary conceptual approaches to the

Abstract = {{Technological development allows for free access and distribution of
   knowledge, enabling teachers to freely access didactic material. In many
   cases, such a material coincides with educational objectives, but in
   other cases, it may be necessary to adapt it to a specific educational
   context. Thus, teachers who are only consumers, sometimes become
   producers of knowledge. Considering open access without registration
   requirements or payment for digital educational material turns knowledge
   into a public good for a democratic and equitable society. In this
   context, the Center of Educational Informatics of the National
   University of San Luis promotes teacher training in topics such as Open
   Educational Resources, Free Software, Creative Commons License, and the
   incidence of free access on educational practices. The aim of this
   initiative is achieving educational innovation that allows for the
   development of skills and abilities in knowledge-producing subjects, who
   are also aware of the value of knowledge to reduce social gaps. This
   work is based on the following questions: Do teachers consider Creative
   Commons licenses in the production of their own materials? Do they
   consider copyright in the materials that they download from the
   Internet?}},

Abstract = {{With the continuous development of network information technology, the
   global economy has gradually entered into the digital information age,
   and E-commerce as a new way of commercial operation is widely used in
   international trade, such as finding trade partners, facilitating
   consultation and negotiation, ordering online and payment which propel
   the transformation of international trade, innovate international trade
   modes of transport, expand the entire international trade market, and
   stimulate the development of trade in services and technology
   transactions. At present, the economic globalization is intensified and
   the prosperity of E-commerce is forcing international trade to form new
   operation modes, as well as economic exchanges based on information
   products have become a new norm in international economy and trade.
   Compared with traditional forms of international trade, E-commerce
   boasts of a strong superiority which ensures that international trade
   will achieve a multiple development momentum after breaking through
   limitations in regions and time. This paper clears about the adjustment
   of international trade modes under the mode of E-commerce, and discusses
   the importance and influence of E-commerce on international trade on the

Abstract = {{This study mainly aims to determine the stress intensity factor range
   (SIF) for a compact tension (CT) specimen under uniaxial tensile fatigue
   loading state. A 2D full-field optical technique, Digital Image
   Correlation (DIC), is used to acquire the experimental solution.
   Therefore, the deformation contour is measured for several crack growth
   lengths. In addition, SIF is experimentally characterized together with
   a numerical overdetermined algorithm for different crack lengths.
   Besides, the strain variation with respect to the notch tip is captured.
   The innovation of this study is the combination of an experimental DIC
   procedure with a numerical overdetermined algorithm. Moreover, to assess
   the performance of the proposed fracture model, the problem is resolved
   using advanced discretization techniques, such as the Finite Element
   Method (FEM) and the Meshless Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM).
   Thus, the cracked CT specimen is elasto-statically modeled using
   above-mentioned numerical approaches. Hence, the FEM model is analyzed
   with ABAQUS, allowing to compute the mode I SIF results for different
   crack lengths in addition to strain contours. Likewise, the foregoing
   procedure is repeated for the RPIM analysis and encouraging numerical
   results are achieved. The SIF is determined with a maximum energy
   release rate criterion in front of the crack tip in FEM study, while in
   RPIM study, it is calculated within the same overdetermined algorithm
   used in the DIC study. Overall, the experimental and numerical SIF
   results are compared with the reported solution (ASTM E647) exhibiting a
   reasonable agreement. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Adjustment of retention of all-ceramic double-crown attachments}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERIZED DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{409-421}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Double-crown attachments, such as conical crowns (CCs), can
   retain removable partial prostheses. Digital manufacturing enables the
   use of innovative materials such as zirconia, and new workflows. The aim
   of this study was to investigate options for the adjustment of retention
   forces of all-zirconia CCs.
   Materials and methods: Single zirconia primary crowns were produced with
   convergence angles (alpha) of 3 and 4 degrees, together with monolithic
   zirconia secondary crowns (n = 8 for alpha = 3 degrees; n = 8 for alpha
   = 4 degrees). Retention was measured by fitting the crowns with forces F
   = 12.5 to 100 N, and evaluating the magnitudes of the forces required
   for loosening (L). L/F ratios were recorded, and the coefficient of
   friction (mu 0) was calculated. To limit the maximum force required for
   loosening, and to prevent high tensile stresses within the crowns, the
   width of the occlusal gap between the primary and secondary crowns was
   limited by the implementation of occlusal stops.
   Results: True convergence angles were more conical than expected, by
   approximately 0.3 degrees. For alpha = 3 degrees and alpha = 4 degrees,
   L/F ratios were 0.308 (SD 0.04) and 0.208 (SD 0.068), respectively. The
   overall coefficient of static friction was mu 0 = 0.113. Maximum
   retention forces were successfully controlled; the average values were
   12.1 N (SD 4.5 N) for zirconia occlusal stops, and 12.8 N (SD 3.3 N) for
   composite occlusal stops.
   Conclusion: The clinically desired L/F ratio of 1/3 was achieved by
   selecting 3-degree burs for fabrication of all-zirconia CCs. It is
   possible to limit retention, thereby reducing tensile stress in the
   circumferential direction in secondary crowns.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years serious games (either digital games or board
   games) started to be used extensively in several developed universities
   due to the safe environment in which the future specialists could
   exercise different scenarios specific to their field of study. Teachers
   included them into their classes not only because serious games can
   provide the students with the necessary knowledge and skills for their
   future jobs, but also because the games could also contribute to the
   improvement of other skills related to communication, critical thinking,
   problem solving, creativity and innovation that are so much requested
   today on the labour market. The present study has in view the
   opportunity and attractiveness of introducing the serious games in the
   toolbox of the English teachers when introducing and practicing English
   for specific purposes. The study is based on the application of a
   questionnaire that measures the attractiveness among students to learn
   English for Environmental Sciences by playing a board serious game named
   Simplycycle. The game has been played by more than 100 students
   organized in teams of five students with different levels of knowledge
   (beginners, intermediates and advanced). The data provided by the
   questionnaires showed that the students presented a high degree of
   involvement while playing the game, a high interest in playing other
   serious games and that the tested serious game was used successfully
   even in multi-level teams.}},

Abstract = {{Steel plate-concrete composite structures are a new innovative design
   concept in which a thin steel plate is attached to the reinforced
   concrete beam by means of welded headed studs. The comparison between
   experimental studies and theoretical analysis of this type of structures
   shows that their behaviour is dependent on the load-slip relationship of
   the shear connectors used to ensure sufficient bond between the concrete
   and steel parts of the structure. The aim of this paper is to describe
   an experimental study on headed studs used in steel plateconcrete
   composite structures. Push-out tests were carried out to investigate the
   behaviour of shear connectors. The test specimens were prepared
   according to standard push-out tests, however, instead of I-beam, a
   steel plate 16 mm thick was used to better reflect the conditions in the
   real structure. The test specimens were produced in two batches using
   concrete with significantly different compressive strength. The
   experimental study was carried out on twelve specimens. Besides the
   traditional measurements based on LVDT sensors, optical measurements
   based on the digital image correlation method (DIC) and pattern tracking
   methods were used. DIC is a full-field contactless optical method for
   measuring displacements in experimental testing, based on the
   correlation of the digital images taken during test execution. With
   respect to conventional methods, optical measurements offer a wider
   scope of results and can give more information about the material or
   construction behaviour during the test. The ultimate load capacity and
   load-slip curves obtained from the experiments were compared with the
   values calculated based on Eurocodes, American and Chinese design
   specifications. It was observed that the use of the relationships
   developed for the traditional steel-concrete composite structures is
   justified in the case of ultimate load capacity of shear connectors in
   steel plate-concrete composite structures.}},

Abstract = {{Global accessibility to the Internet and the exponential growth of
   compute capacity have caused the spread of business models collecting
   and generating big data. Reliable intellectual analysis of data and
   computer-assisted teaching allows companies to offer tailor-made special
   solutions. The current algorithms of self-education enable to find
   accurate information online within seconds. However, the advantages may
   be neutralized by serious disadvantages. The recent high-profile M\&A
   transactions in digital Internet markets raised the question on the
   potential influence on the competition merger and acquiring control over
   big data. Indeed, companies can involve advanced computer technologies
   to coordinate business practices, impose abusive conditions for
   consumers, applying compelling market power to set higher prices or even
   possible closing the market for new market-players. Net effects based on
   the data tend to become stable promoting to the efficiency of the
   current market-players allowing them to strengthen their positions as
   soon as the critical mass of users is reached. Compensating the
   advantages of big data by potential costs for society depends on the
   ability of antimonopoly bodies and regulators respond to the new
   challenges of digital economy. It is possible to shape new more
   competitive adversary and dynamically developing markets with efficient
   and permanent innovations or a sharp growth of economic concentration
   leading to the abuse of market power and stagnation. The paper proposes
   the definition of big data and describes the main types of the
   influential factors and topology of market big data ecosystem. The paper
   reveals possible problems for competition due to big data and examines
   their potential influence on the efficiency of the current instruments
   of competition and the main activities of antimonopoly bodies,
   struggling against cartels, evaluation of abuse by domination and
   control of mergers.}},

   The emergence of new platforms over the Internet and the multi-platform

   models to satisfy customer demands. In this paper the authors will
   analyze this dynamic market and its strategies for the future from a
   regulatory and political perspective, as there are key changes in the
   sectorial regulation that need to be evaluated as they are impacting the
   status-quo of the actors of this market and the relationships among
   them. At first, the regulatory framework will be analyzed: this research
   will include the changes in the European regulations for broadcast
   telecommunications focusing on the spectrum and the digital dividend.
   After that, main current business models and strategies will be
   reviewed. Finally, some conclusions about the future of the sector and

Abstract = {{Under the background of the development of the cultural industry, the
   author of this paper carries out the analysis of the mode of cultivating
   the compound musical talents in the teachers' colleges in our country.
   Under the background of our country to vigorously develop the cultural
   industry, the teachers' colleges and universities, as an important base
   to cultivate the musical talents, should accelerate the adjustment and
   transformation of the concepts and models of the personnel training in
   the traditional normal education. According to their actual needs and
   the requirements of the development of the local cultural industry, we
   should innovate the means of cultivating the talents, and gradually
   improve the quality of the personnel training, to create the
   high-quality compound music talents, so as to serve the economic
   development of the local cultural industry. This paper starts from the
   analysis of the specific situations of the development of the Internet
   music, combined with the value requirements of the cultivation of the
   music talents, through the integration of the specific ideas of the
   cultivation of the musical compound management personnel in the
   background of the internet music, in order to explore the values and
   roles of the system of the music compound management personnel on the
   development of the Internet music.
   The decline of the traditional records is not unique to China, but a
   universal phenomenon in the world. In our country, the consumers have
   become accustomed to downloading the free music from the Internet, but
   now it is impossible for them to pay to download them. Many Chinese
   music companies have accepted such a situation. The current copyright
   law of China has no specific provisions on the works of the search
   engine communication. The download with the mobile payment has become
   the main channel of the Chinese digital music. However, because the
   channels are in the hands of several major telecom operators, although
   there are many record companies, they cannot be twisted into a rope, but
   become weak.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the entity retail enterprises are more impacted by
   e-commerce, but the Convenient Store market is surging forward, and has
   maintained a strong momentum of development. The amount of investment is
   continuously increasing, the speed of opening a shop is not reduced, and
   the store is constantly upgrading. As the last mile service terminal of
   retail, under the impetus of internet plus, Convenient Stores continue
   to innovate their service models, and become a good helper and a good
   neighbor for consumer's life.
   The format of Convenient Store is undoubtedly the top leader in the
   development of retail trade in recent years. China Chain Store
   \&Franchise Association and Boston consulting company jointly issued the
   ``report of development of Convenient Store of China in 2017{''}, which
   shows that since 2014 the sales volume of Convenient Store has increased
   by 17.7\%, a little higher than that of chain top 100, which is 12.6\%,
   the range of growth is the highest in all formats, and in 2015 and 2016,
   the range of growth of sales volume of chain top 100 continued to
   decline, but still maintained double-digit high-speed growth({[}1]).
   Behind the rapid development of Convenient Stores, the technology of
   ``Internet plus{''} is undoubtedly the important driving force. In the
   future, how to play the technology of ``Internet{''} better, plus more
   service mode of ``Internet{''}, will be the key for it to make greater
   leaps.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing digitalisation and the growth of big data promises to
   foster more responsive supply chains and to close gaps between
   manufacturers and consumers, leading to highly-connected manufacturing
   operations, mass customisation and more sustainable production. There is
   widespread recognition that manufacturing in broad terms is entering a
   new period of transition and change, aided by new technologies and
   business models and with multiple predictions that there will be
   significant reconfigurations in the geographical and inclusive
   distribution of manufacturing operations. A concept that can be used to
   describe this process of transformation is called redistributed
   manufacturing. This concept encompasses the empowerment of
   consumer-inclusive co-creation. In this paper, we investigate whether
   and how big data can facilitate redistributed manufacturing in consumer
   goods industries. The research sheds light on how businesses are
   starting to redistribute their functions among various stakeholders
   including consumers and co-creating value. The paper proposes a
   conceptual framework to stimulate and organise thinking about emerging
   interrelationships between big data, co-creation and redistributed
   manufacturing, built upon an extensive literature review and qualitative
   analysis of 15 cases from the consumer goods industry using primary and
   secondary data. Through these cases, we analyse existing co-creation
   practices in consumer goods industries, and how they are evolving their
   manufacturing configurations, their underlying drivers, the role of big
   data applications, and their impacts on the redistribution of
   manufacturing. Our analysis finds that big data applications are
   supporting and prompting redistributed manufacturing approaches in these
   consumer goods industries. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Young teachers under take the main teaching tasks at colleges and
   universities, so their teaching ability and teaching effect affect the
   overall level and quality of college teaching work to a large extent.
   Starting from the theory of knowledge management and aiming at features
   of college teachers, this paper analyzes the contents and process of
   teachers' knowledge management, and establishes knowledge management
   based young teacher cultivation mechanism according to such contents and
   process.
   Young teachers under take the main teaching tasks at colleges and
   universities, so their teaching ability and teaching effect affect the
   overall level and quality of college teaching work to a large extent.
   Therefore, how to rapidly improve young teachers' quality and establish
   an excellent team of young teachers is a long-run plan affecting the
   future development of higher education.
   The thought and practice of knowledge management first originates from
   corporate management with digital technology as the background. It is
   generally believed that knowledge management refers to the theory and
   technology used by enterprises or organizations to obtain, create,
   store, share or apply knowledge to improve performance on the premise of
   insisting on people first. It is not only the response to the knowledge
   society and information explosion in theory and practice, but also
   increasingly becomes the realistic response and core motivation for an
   organization to achieve success. Knowledge management emphasizes the
   identification of knowledge within an organization, the formulation of
   incentive programs based on knowledge and promoting the implementation
   of knowledge sharing strategy, etc. Schools are important place to
   select, organize and disseminate knowledge. Teachers not only undertake
   the above functions, but also are the main body of innovating knowledge,
   and their own professional development is realized through internalizing
   and externalizing knowledge. Therefore, to use knowledge management
   technology and concept to promote rapid growth of teachers and construct
   a mechanism to cultivate young teachers has become a new path for the
   development of colleges and universities and teachers' teaching ability
   is improved through young teachers' knowledge management.}},

Abstract = {{In telemedicine videoconferencing technologies using internet becomes
   crucial due to the extensive reach of wireless technologies. In this
   scenario encoding an decoding plays a very crucial role to save
   bandwidth. Motion estimation is a significant component in digital video
   compression/transmission. Conversely, it is found to be difficult to
   implement real-time codec due to its natural computational complexity.
   The past years have witnessed investigations on rapid block-matching
   protocols to considerably decrease the computation complexity in motion
   estimations. These algorithms had created a massive awareness and led to
   many more promising algorithms for VLSI systems to reduce computational
   intricacy. Despite, block matching algorithms having easy implementation
   process, it leads to suboptimal solutions if there is no full search
   being carried out. The computational cost for full search Block Matching
   Algorithm is so high, thereby preventing it from being used in VLSI
   systems. This work suggests innovative fast motion estimation derived
   from stochastic diffused search protocol for motion estimation.}},

Abstract = {{With military education transformation moving towards information-based
   teaching, it is a pressing task to build information-based teaching
   environment. Based on the component factors land basic principles on the
   construction of information-based teaching environment construction in
   military academies, and with the aims at meeting the new requirements of
   information-based teaching environment construction in military
   academies, this paper puts forward to strengthen hardware facility
   construction, develop simulation training systems development, improve
   teaching information resources and realize information technology and
   courses integration. The purpose of which is to promote
   information-based teaching levels and talents cultivation quality in
   military academies.
   With the deepening development of military academy education towards
   information technology, the traditional educational idea and teaching
   mode are facing severe challenges. A new teaching model called
   information-based teaching model has been basically formed.
   Information-based teaching is a profound change in vocational education,
   which must be based on constructing information-based teaching
   environment. Information-based teaching environment based on the
   development and application of modern educational technology is a
   three-dimensional dynamic, virtual intuitive, open and shared teaching
   environment, whose characteristics are digital, multimedia, network and
   intelligent. Accelerating the construction of information-based teaching
   environment is the objective demand of modernization of military
   education and the inevitable choice to promote the development of
   educational innovation in military academy. The construction of
   information-based teaching environment is an overall and strategic
   project, which requires us to strengthen the research of
   information-based and take the initiative. According to the new
   requirements of information education teaching environment, the
   construction of information-based teaching environment need to be
   high-starting-point planned, high-quality constructed and
   high-efficiency advanced.}},

   decision support to facility management and maintenance. The results of
   the implementation of digital techniques for the purpose of smart
   Facility Management were discussed on the basis of a case study of The

Abstract = {{This special commentary for Mobile Media \& Communication seeks to put
   these divisive debates in context. Through the lens of Pokemon GO, we
   can understand and critically interpret a variety of issues involved in
   the politics and practice of playful mobile media. These issues move
   across debates around location-aware technologies in constructions of
   privacy (Coldewey, 2016; Cunningham, 2016), risk and surveillance
   (Machkovech, 2016; Mishra, 2016) to the role of mobile media in
   commodifying (Evangelho, 2016) and expanding the social, cultural, and
   creative dimensions of play (Isbister, 2016; Mayra, 2012). As the mobile
   media and game theorists in this commentary highlight, the game sits at
   the nexus of several technological and cultural trajectories: the
   playful turn; the ubiquity of location-based and haptic mobile media
   (and apps and games); innovative game design; the effects of digital
   mapping technologies; the intertwining of performative media games and
   art; our individual and collective memories of playworlds and transmedia
   universes; the increasing importance of issues concerning privacy and
   risk in public spaces; the ongoing augmentation of place and space; and
   the politics embedded in this hybrid experience of the lifeworld.}},

   Workshops}},
Journal = {{SPREADSHEETS IN EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Proper documentation of spreadsheets and other forms of digital analysis
   is a common problem for business students entering professional
   practices. For example, when a spreadsheet is constructed and poorly
   documented as to assumptions and related descriptions the ability of
   others to effectively use the spreadsheet is eroded. This is
   particularly true when spreadsheets are prepared at the staff level,
   where such staff may subsequently leave the organization and others are
   left to rely on the document for important purposes (e.g., audits). Part
   of this problem could be alleviated by helping students first develop
   awareness of why poor documentation is a problem and then to develop
   habits and skills thereby enabling proper levels of documentation. This
   note describes an innovative approach used in an undergraduate
   accounting classroom. The innovation involves the use of workshops
   relying on certain types of co-presenters to facilitate student
   awareness to aid students in their preparation of Excel based analyses.
   While a short review of the relevant literature helps frame the issue,
   there is little published on best practices in teaching the
   documentation topic. The author explains the structure of the workshop
   (within the context of the class assignment) and provides the specific
   documentation elements emphasized. Evidence is provided as to the
   effectiveness of the approach. Thoughts and resources to enable
   replication are also supplied}},

Abstract = {{Interconnection of digital real-time simulators over wide-area
   communication networks is an innovative approach to extend local
   real-time simulation capabilities to enable large-scale simulations.
   Furthermore, it allows the integration of geographically distributed
   assets as Power Hardware-in-the-Loop and Controller
   Hardware-in-the-Loop, thus providing a flexible framework for performing
   unique research experiments. In most cases, it is not possible to
   perform large scale real-time simulations and comprehensive experiments
   locally due to lack of simulation capacity and unavailability of unique
   assets. Main challenge associated with geographically distributed
   real-time simulation is to ensure simulation fidelity of the same degree
   as in the case when the entire simulation is performed at the same
   location. Simulation fidelity in geographically distributed real-time
   simulation is investigated and an empirical characterization is provided
   in this paper. Fidelity degradation caused by different values of time
   delay and sending rate of data exchange between two digital real-time
   simulators is presented. Two methods for representation of interface
   quantities in co-simulation interface algorithms are considered for
   performing simulations. The first method is based on representation of
   interface quantities as root mean square of magnitude, frequency, and
   phase angle of the current and voltage waveforms. The second method
   utilizes representation of interface quantities in form of time-varying
   Fourier coefficients, known as dynamic phasors. The empirical study is
   performed for transmission-distribution co-simulation using two racks of
   Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS (R)).}},

Abstract = {{Purpose-The purpose of the study is to analyse the perception of
   students toward a computer-based exam on a custom-made digital device
   and their willingness to adopt the same for high-stake summative
   assessment.
   Design/methodology/approach-This study followed an analytical
   methodology using survey design. A modified version of students'
   perception of e-assessment questionnaire (SPEAQ) was used to elicit
   information from the subjects, who were drawn from a first-year
   post-graduate course in management and commerce, soliciting voluntary
   participation in the survey. SmartPLS 2.0 was the major analytical tool
   used to understand the theoretical robustness of observed and latent
   variables through structural equation modelling. The final model was
   retained based on the structural significance of the path coefficients.
   Findings-The results of the study offer ample evidence to establish the
   proposed theoretical relationship. It was found that the subjects of the
   study maintained a positive attitude toward e-assessment. Hence, the
   introduction of e-exams for high-stake assessment is suitable to current
   generation students.
   Research limitations/implications-Findings of the study may be
   irrelevant to students who are not subject to e-learning processes, as
   an e-assessment can only be effective when students have ample exposure
   to working on computers.
   Practical/implications-A major practical implication of the study is
   that e-exams will positively influence the outcome of education and
   effectiveness of the teaching-learning process. Technology, as an
   eclectic paradigm, can amplify the educational outcome by boosting the
   competency of students to meet challenges of any emerging situations.
   Originality/value-The idea of an e-exam, using a custom-made device, is
   unprecedented. This paper offers a convincing empirical evidence to
   academic administrators to integrate e-assessment with e-learning
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{Information campaigns are key elements of elections. Past research has
   established the importance of campaigns in informing and educating
   citizens, and ultimately strengthening participatory democracy. While
   the Internet has increased the possibilities to disseminate information
   campaigns and eased access to political information, it is still debated
   whether online campaigns are effective in stimulating political interest
   and participation among the general public. The issue is not only one of
   access, but also of use of information. The investigation of main
   effects of campaigns obscures the fact that citizens may not use
   information in the same way and reap the same political benefits. In
   this study, I examine the conditional effects of a new type of Web
   information campaign, Voting Advice Applications (VAAs), on the
   political engagement and electoral participation of citizens with
   varying levels of education. By investigating who benefits most from
   using these apps, I evaluate whether VAAs reinforce patterns of
   participation or mobilize new people in politics. Building on political
   behavior research, communication theory, and social psychology, I study
   the differential effects of VAAs with an innovative randomized field
   experiment design. The results confirm that VAAs can stimulate the
   political engagement of the public. However, there is no significant
   impact on electoral participation. In addition, the evidence shows that
   VAAs work differently for more or less educated citizens, and that the
   lower educated users benefit the most from VAAs as they become more
   interested in the election and more motivated to vote.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the concepts of building smart cities have come up which
   enforces urban development to build intelligent and digital cities.
   Smart cities are also known as digital cities that use ICT practices.
   This framework offers a linkage between Information and Communication
   Technology and Urban planning and development (Wolfram, 2012). The
   linkage has surged for the development of innovative practices and
   capacity building. Smart cities have been defined in various forms from
   digital cities to wireless cities and now to smart cities.
   This research brief mainly concentrate of administration, people and
   knowledge creation for developing organization's e-training platform
   helping in building smart cities with digital enterprise, administration
   and people or smart citizens. The paper tries to put forward the concept
   and designing of e-learning platform to provide instant training and
   education for shaping the new generation citizens. (c) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This paper deals with experimental testing of adhesive joints, whose
   characterization under static loadings drove a large number of studies
   and techniques. However, few studies deal with dynamic loadings and most
   of them are limited to the characterization of the shear strength of the
   bonded assembly. Indeed, dynamic tests often rely on single or
   double-lap joint specimens that do not enable to investigate multiaxial
   loadings. This paper is dedicated to the development of an innovative
   experimental technique for the characterization of adhesive joints under
   dynamic multiaxial loadings. The experimental apparatus consists in a
   conventional Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB), a newly designed
   specimen named DODECA and local measurements performed by Digital Image
   Correlation (DIC). The specimen conception and sizing are detailed with
   numerical computations as well as preparation procedures. One of the
   advantages of the proposed specimen is the possibility of testing three
   distinct multiaxial loadings with the same methodology. This new
   technique enables to measure strains in adhesive joints accurately with
   a dynamic loading. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable mobility is one of the most emerging challenges in the
   contemporary car-oriented city, where congestion and lawlessness grow,
   while funds continue to decline. Greece, so far, remains far behind the
   European and international innovative channels for transportation and
   mobility technology-assisted applications, having indeed a considerable
   increase in recent research and business projects. This paper aims at
   showcasing a collection of practices that focuses on enabling
   sustainable mobility policies and measures as well as hard
   infrastructure projects, both ICT and non ICT-enabled, in order to reach
   the smart city in mobility terms. The concept of a smart city does not
   always require the support of web technology tools, but rather
   integrates their use in a holistic approach to cope with the growing
   pressure of traffic situation and the existing travel behavior patterns.
   The study presents five (5) grouped sets of policy interventions and
   measures consisting of more than twenty five (25) indicative actions to
   be applied in cities and/or regions, ranging from common traffic calming
   solutions to smart traffic lights, car-sharing, and innovative parking
   schemes. The suggested sets of actions focus at the regional level,
   exploring at first the case of Athens and Attica Prefecture, however
   they can be applied in several other cases in urban and regional scale
   accordingly. Actions aim to tackle traffic safety, travel behavior
   dynamics and patterns, local mobility cultures and mobility and
   environmental awareness issues, considering the widespread use of
   information and communication technologies.}},

   thermochemical heat treatment used for metallic workpieces in order to
   improve their mechanical characteristics like hardness and resistance to

   Systems (PNS). A programmable hardware was integrated into an existing
   PNS to optimize the control signals and its flexibility for the high
   voltage switch (IGBT). Furthermore, comprehensive R\&D work as well as
   according practical implementations were done to set up a
   microcontroller based feedback control, measurement and monitoring of
   the current flowing in the load circuit during the treatment process
   with the objective of completely preventing over currents caused by arc
   discharge and so leading to a significant improvement of power quality.}},

Abstract = {{The paper objective is to propose an innovative power converter topology
   combining the advantages of capacitor discharge and switch-mode
   converters to generate half sinusoidal fast current pulses with high
   precision. The capacitor discharge operation mode of the converter
   allows the generation of current pulses with fast transient response and
   the switch-mode operation enables the control of the pulse shape with
   high precision. The Energetic Macroscopic Representation permits to
   address these two aspects using a unified formalism and to deduce the
   control laws for the regulation of the hybrid converter voltage and
   current. In this paper, the converter requirements are presented and the
   proposed topology is described. The converter is then modelled using EMR
   and its control loops are defined. Finally, simulations results are
   given.}},

Title = {{A novel iloprost administration method with portable syringe pump for
   the treatment of acral ulcers and Raynaud's phenomenon in systemic

Abstract = {{Objective. The objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility,
   safety and efficacy of home infusion of iloprost with the new portable
   syringe pump Infonde (R), for the treatment of scleroderma-related
   Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers.
   Methods. 12 scleroderma patients were treated with iloprost at home,
   using the pump, with infusion cycles of 2 days per month (24 hours a
   day), for 6 months.
   Results. The home treatment proved feasible since ten patients (83\%)
   completed the entire infusion cycle, thus satisfying the feasibility
   target imposed by the protocol (75\%). Side effects related to the
   device or venous access occurred in 3 out of 65 total 48-hour infusions
   (4.6\%). They mostly consisted in phlebitis. No adverse events related
   to the device management were reported. Among the ten patients who
   completed the infusions, three showed a reduction in the number of
   ulcers, three maintained the same number, and four had no ulcers
   throughout the observation period. Patient's perception of their quality
   of life and wellness during home infusions, expressed with the Visual
   Analogue Scale (VAS) improved from 79/100 at the first infusion to
   91/100 at the end of the study. All patients expressed a positive global
   judgment regarding this innovative method of iloprost infusion.
   Conclusion. The infusion of iloprost at home with Infonde (R) is
   feasible, safe and effective. Moreover, this approach presents potential
   advantages from the economic and organisational point of view. Because
   of the pilot design of our study, these results need to be confirmed in
   larger randomised trials.}},

Abstract = {{Over two decades ago, Barbie Zelizer argued that journalists should be
   approached as an ``interpretive community{''} in order to understand the
   processes through which journalists generate shared meanings around
   major political events. This article refocuses Zelizer's concept in
   order to analyse the consequences of rapid technological transformation,
   fraught industry conditions, and disparate audience formations in the
   context of contemporary news media and journalism. Focusing on the
   challenges faced by professional sport journalists, we invoke the
   concept of ``community of practice{''} to make sense of this fluid and
   commercially volatile context, using it to analyse empirically the
   experiences of journalists in Australia and Scotland. Informed by the
   interrelationship that exists between formats of news and the practices
   that produce it, this paper presents evidence drawn from in-depth
   semi-structured interviews with journalists, editors, news presenters
   and commentators who specialise in and/or work across newspapers, radio,
   television, online and mobile media. Understood as a community of
   practice, sport journalists are shown to be under pressure because of
   mutually reinforcing changes in mobile and digital media technologies,
   journalistic routines and institutional relations.}},

Abstract = {{Although technological innovations in journalism have recently received
   growing scholarly attention, studies have hardly questioned or explored
   the naturalised dominance of technology over newswork. By drawing on
   critical scholarship, the study aims to explore how articulations
   between technology and journalism are negotiated by actors engineering
   technological innovations for and implementing them as part of newswork.
   Adopting the qualitative methods of interviews and document analysis,
   the study explores the XLike project (Seventh Framework Programme)
   co-ordinated by the Jozef Stefan Institute, a Slovenian public research
   institution for natural sciences and, among others, partnered with the
   New York Times, Bloomberg Media and the Slovenian Press Agency. One of
   its main results is a technology that is able to extract formal
   knowledge from texts in different languages scattered online in a
   structured way. While the study indicates journalists and editors are
   seen as conservative and hesitant to adopt what is understood as
   progressive technology, the project chiefly focuses on journalism as a
   business by pursuing a better understanding of audience behaviour,
   tracking online traffic and customised advertising. Additionally,
   newsrooms played at best a marginal role in defining the project's goals
   and implementing the technology, and that these were driven foremost by
   business concerns.}},

Title = {{Smart cities A literature review and business network approach
   discussion on the management of organisations}},
Journal = {{IMP JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{468-484}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The smart city idea refers to new ways of organising city
   functions and urban life, which are believed to move production and
   consumption from global to local, manufacturing from competitive to
   collaborative, and business from a shareholder to a multiple-stakeholder
   point of view. Most previous research has focussed on the societal level
   of smart cities, while less seems to be known about the management of
   business as part of smart cities. The purpose of this paper is to
   present a literature review on the state of the art of management
   research on smart cities. The following research question is addressed:
   How has previous research captured the management of organisations in
   smart cities?
   Design/methodology/approach - A literature review using the search term
   ``smart city/cities{''} in research on business, management, and
   operational management was conducted for the purpose of capturing
   previous research. Findings were coded based on main ideas, central
   concepts, and theories, thematic content of the articles related to the
   main ideas underpinning smart cities (digitalization, urbanisation, and
   sustainability as antecedents, and local, collaborative and
   multiple-stakeholder manufacturing as indicators), and units of
   analysis.
   Findings - The paper points to how most studies on the management of
   organisations as part of smart cities focus on sustainability and how
   digitalisation enables new businesses. Collaborative efforts are
   emphasised and the theoretical framing is fragmented. Issues related to
   the organising of business is also not problematised and the business
   network approach could, as discussed in the paper, provide valuable
   insights related to the collaborative efforts of organisations and the
   multiple-stakeholder perspective.
   Originality/value - The paper is the first to capture and present an
   overview of previous research on the management of business as part of
   smart cities. Research on smart cities has focussed on the policy and
   societal levels, and so far there is a lack of problematisation on how
   organisations may act, and potentially change their way of acting,
   should smart cities become a reality.}},

Abstract = {{While the term `climate change' is firmly anchored in the global
   discourse, its visibility is often vague and subliminal. Education's key
   task, therefore, is not only to provide knowledge on causes and impacts,
   but also to build a nexus between scientific knowledge and what is
   called `lived experience of climate change' in this article. Over the
   course of a two-year international publicly funded project, the use of
   digital storytelling was tested as a method to teach students in higher
   education in innovative ways. Starting from a natural science point of
   view, interdisciplinary groups of students produced a digital story in
   the form of a 3-5 minutes video presenting the effects of climate change
   in their home countries. Our evaluation shows that digital storytelling
   as a teaching method did not only enhance our students' knowledge, but
   also visualises how vastly different the effects of climate change are
   perceived.}},

   Design/methodology/approach - China's policy on digital trade is

   period from 1985 to 2016 that have an impact on digital trade.
   Findings - It was found that there are more than 70 measures imposed

Title = {{Knowledge collaboration between organizations and online communities:
   the role of open innovation intermediaries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1293-1318}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This research paper aims to examine how open innovation (OI)
   intermediaries facilitate knowledge collaboration between organizations
   and online user communities. Drawing on a Community of Practice (CoP)
   perspective on knowledge, the study lays out a framework of the
   knowledge boundary management mechanisms (and associated practices) that
   intermediaries deploy in enabling client organizations to engage in
   online community-based OI.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research is based on an exploratory
   case study of an OI intermediary and 18 client organizations that engage
   with online user communities on the intermediary's platform. Results
   incorporate both the intermediary and clients' perspective, based on
   analysis of intermediary and client interviews, clients' online
   community projects and other archival data.
   Findings - Results reveal that OI intermediaries deploy three knowledge
   boundary management mechanisms - syntactic, semantic and pragmatic -
   each underpinned by a set of practices. Together, these mechanisms
   enable knowledge transfer, translation and transformation, respectively,
   and thus lead to cumulatively richer knowledge collaboration outcomes at
   the organization-community boundary. The findings show that the
   pragmatic mechanism reinforces both semantic and syntactic mechanisms,
   and is hence the most critical to achieving effective knowledge
   collaboration in community-based OI settings.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest that OI intermediaries
   have to implement all three boundary management mechanisms to
   successfully enable knowledge collaboration for community-based OI. More
   specifically, intermediaries need to expand their focus beyond the
   development of digital platforms, to include nuanced efforts at building
   organizational commitment to community engagement.
   Originality/value - Drawing on the CoP view, this study integrates the
   knowledge management literature into the OI literature to conceptualize
   the role of OI intermediaries in shaping knowledge collaboration between
   organizations and communities. In engaging with the interactive nature
   of knowledge exchange in such multi-actor settings, this research
   extends the firm-centric theorization of knowledge that currently
   dominates the existing OI research.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of digital media to plane advertisement design
   talent cultivation put forward the new requirements, print advertising
   design education must be timely adjust teaching ideas, curriculum design
   innovation. The author first analyzes the digital media talent demand
   changes, under the background of print ads should resume is presented in
   this era of digital media plane advertisement design teaching system,
   and probes into the reform of the teaching contents and forms of plane
   advertisement design of the new plan.
   Rapid progress in the development of digital media, species and quantity
   increasing. Yin yungong, editor at the Chinese academy of social
   sciences of the China digital media development report (2012) pointed
   out that our country has the world's most extensive digital media user
   base and one of the most abundant digital media application. Digital
   collection of radio, television, print media, network, electronic
   publishing, mobile communications and other information medium into an
   organic whole, on video, text, images, data and other comprehensive
   treatment, provide consumers with comprehensive, diversified information
   service, makes the plane advertisement publishing platform, release way,
   communication strategy and so on are the effective and continuous
   extension, make print advertising visual communication become
   diversified and more influential. According to the forecast carat media,
   digital print ads in 2014 of the world's share of print advertising
   spending will rise to 20\%. As the Internet, mobile phones, digital TV

   advertisement increasing demand, traditional forms of print ads and
   making means constantly replaced by digital media and new technologies,
   static graphic print ads increasingly being dynamic, the challenges of
   the new media print ads, demand also quietly changed, then the plane
   advertisement design talent cultivation put forward higher requirements.
   Digital media era in print advertising design and production is not just
   a technical level, it requires that the creator has the comprehensive
   science and the humanities accomplishment, improve the reasonable
   knowledge structure, a new way of cognition and judgment of plane
   advertisement design talented person's raise more in need of new
   thinking, new ideas, new methods. Plane advertisement design is visual
   communication design and plane advertising communication specialized
   core curriculum, it to printing, communication, network, video, and
   other forms as the carrier, research at home and abroad the latest plane
   advertisement design art form, is an innovative form of course. However,
   most existing print advertising design is still in the traditional plane
   advertisement design processes in the teaching design, media such as
   newspapers, magazines, radio, television and other plane advertisement
   design content, the various forms of digital media print ads, new
   features and design methods in plane advertisement design course more
   just mentioned without specification as the teaching content, make it
   hard for students to quickly master the law of digital media plane
   advertisement design and the method. Media form the rapid changes gave
   us many new problems and new tasks, the plane advertisement design
   teaching model has not completely adapt to new requirements, knowledge

Abstract = {{Innovations in digital technology have provided consumers with a variety
   of screens and portals through which they can access motion picture
   entertainment. This study sought to understand what factors motivate
   consumers to experience a film in the theater versus waiting to see the
   film at home, using home-viewing technology. Using the uses and
   gratifications framework coupled with the theories of reasoned action
   and planned behavior, this study employed a survey (N - 331) designed to
   measure gratification expectations and viewing intentions for five films
   that had not yet been released in theaters. The study found that while
   behavioral control and satisfaction with a consumer's theatrical and
   home viewing environment may play roles in determining the consumer's
   decision to see a movie in the theater, it is affective gratification
   expectations that exert the biggest influence on theatrical attendance
   across different types of films. In addition, subjective norms did not
   influence viewing intentions for any films employed in the study. The
   findings of this study suggest that audiences are increasingly selective
   about the types of films they choose to view in the theater, favoring
   exciting, visually enticing films.}},

Pages = {{204-215}},
Abstract = {{Urgency of the research. Globalization of the economy and social
   development needs the ensuring the effective functioning of enterprises
   on innovative principles.
   Target setting. Today the issues of quality, effective and efficient
   business management and evaluation of innovation activities are very
   important for the building industry.
   Actual scientific researches and issues analysis. Proceedings of leading
   scientists, such as: Vytvytsky Y., Verkhoglyadova N. and Demchuk N.,
   Kandyeyeva V., Mykytyuk P., Stelmashchuk A., Shkromyda V. and others
   were dedicated to the research of innovation efficiency and innovation
   enterprises.
   Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. We note that this
   issue is not explored enough in their works, so the problems require
   researches on forming a system of indicators for the level of innovation
   activity of the construction industry evaluation and justification of
   methodological approaches on it's base.
   The research objective. The article is devoted to development of
   theoretical and methodological framework, practical guidelines and
   methodological approaches to the evaluation of construction enterprise
   innovation activity and their probation.
   The statement of basic materials. In order to study the innovative level
   of business, was proposed methodical approach which involves five
   blocks: 1) methodological; 2) digital data /informational; 3)
   calculation; 4) evaluation; 5) interpretation (reasonable assessment
   scale integrated parameter values). The system of indicators built on
   sustainable development conception allows it to introduce and detail the
   division them into three levels. The proposed approach was used to
   analyze the innovation activities of construction enterprises Carpathian
   and range them at the base of the integral indicator of innovation and
   indicator of economic growth that were proposed.
   Conclusions. Methodical approach to evaluation of innovation activity
   and approach to ranking companies in terms of innovation and economic
   growth was proposed, which revealed the crisis, adverse and favorable

Abstract = {{Smith College is one of a handful of liberal arts colleges to offer a
   master's degree in social work. The Smith College School for Social Work
   (SCSSW)'s thesis requirement has had a major impact on the Smith College
   Libraries over the years, as the library role shifted from simply
   collecting books and journals in support of SCSSWand warehousing the
   SCSSW thesis outputto developing a large array of services and teaching
   practices in support of the program. This reflection piece will detail
   the evolution of these services, practices, and support; it will also
   illustrate several ways the libraries used SCSSW as the proverbial
   guinea pig to test new services, new forms of access and authentication,
   new kinds of digital collections, new technologies, etc. In many ways,
   the master's thesis has been a major driver of change for the
   Librarieswhile at the same time it has provided an opportunity for
   collaborations in teaching and learning.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of digital music research, the comparatively young
   disciplines of Transcultural Music Studies and Historical
   Ethnomusicology are confronted with a specific set of conditions and
   challenges. Both represent innovative constellations of method and area
   in which fieldwork and philology are not diametrically opposed but
   united. The present article addresses opportunities, risks and
   methodical implications of digitization along the division between
   written and oral sources. The topic of digital source editions it
   represented from a transcultura I perspective by the project CMO (Corpus
   Music ae Ottomanic ae), which combines machine- and human-readable
   editions of Ottoman music, critical reports and a detailed database. On
   the side of oral tradition, an evaluation of the ethnomusicological
   practice of reimporting historical recordings >> back to the field << in
   the light of restitution and repatriation of intangible cultural
   heritage is attempted. A survey of >> e-fieldwork << sheds light on a
   new and promising research method which is not without dangers and
   drawbacks.}},

   of resituating the original positions around MOOC, as well as
   reconsidering them as disruptive technology that would radically
   transform educational institutions. This is why issues such as the
   theory of disruptive innovations are addressed, as well as the
   possibility of a more in-depth review of the original and current
   characteristics of the same. This is why, as a result, a more realistic
   analysis of its possibilities and, above all, its educational uses can
   now be carried out, and a great part of this article of reflection is
   devoted to it. To finish with the analysis of the variables to
   reconsider once approached and analyzed different studies and
   investigations in this respect, which offers an imaginary and potential
   of variables to reconsider for a greater significant development of the
   same ones in the educative scope.}},

Abstract = {{The use and management of digital three-dimensional models is not
   conceived within the digital competence of secondary and high school
   curricula. However many authors relate the digital competence to the
   handling of 3D models, 3D modeling and three-dimensional virtual
   environments (augmented reality, virtual,.). This article presents an
   educational resource to facilitate access to three- dimensional digital
   and tangible educational content. Some subjects require understanding
   and interpretation of volumetric concepts: innovative teaching resources
   such as editing, viewing and printing 3D offer an alternative to 2D
   representationsin the teaching and learning. A sculptural catalogue that
   provides digital and tangible versions of three- dimensional models
   through innovative low-cost technologies like 3d printing and
   visualisation is described. The experience carried out with 15 high
   school students shows a high consideration of the participants on the
   technologies used.}},

Abstract = {{The object of this study is to learn about the role of the digital press
   on schools where Mandatory Education is taught, through the perception
   of teachers. Additionally, this study will research the way some
   personal, academic, institutional and contextual variables might
   influence on these perceptions. This research, in which 733 teachers
   from 76 schools have participated, is a non-experimental and a
   descriptive study. Moreover, the data used in this study has been
   collected through a specifically designed survey, which contains 55
   items that led to a quantitative analysis. The conclusions revealed that
   teachers feel moderately prepared to implement the use of digital media
   in a classroom setting, being the teachers from Elementary schools who
   were the worst rated in their technological skills. In general terms,
   teachers have positively claimed its educational value. However,
   teachers admits to use it scarcely in class as an educational tool.
   Regarding the implications of this study, it is strongly believed that
   the conclusions drawn from this research might be a useful start which
   may help in the design and implement of innovative training programs in
   schools, through which the digital media could be used as an educational
   tool.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This chapter addresses the issue of value creation in the
   retail banking sector, focusing on France. The author shows that since
   the 2007 financial crisis, banking organizations have used a disruptive
   innovative approach to regain the trust of retail banking customers.
   This innovative hybrid design is not only driven by efficiency and fully
   dematerialized solutions, but also considers human, social, and
   territorial development aspects.
   Methodology/approach - This chapter is based on an EU statistical
   analysis (2009 - 2013) of two strategies used by French, Italian, and
   German national banks to manage the 2007 financial crisis: closing
   retail bank branches and lay-offs. Interestingly, in France, bank units
   and employee numbers fell the least. A complementary qualitative
   analysis of the principal banking innovations promoted by R\&D directors
   helps to explain the main features of the French strategy to cope with
   the mistrust of clients and employees.
   Findings - Though low-cost models are promoted as major innovations
   today ({''}banking is necessary, bankers are not{''}), and result in
   massive offshoring and restructuring levels to face new global
   competitors such as Google, Amazon, and PCCW-HKT, the French retail
   banking sector, previously state regulated but progressively
   deregulated, has adopted an original strategy to regain trust and
   loyalty. Rather than adopting these low-cost models strictly, with full
   dematerialization, it focuses on balanced innovation - such as the
   ``neighbourhood bank format,{''} which improves knowledge of the
   expectations and needs of local clients and environments. These
   solutions are not only global or local, but a mix of both dimensions.
   Research implications - Global industries like finance are embedded in
   both territorial and historical relationships and governance. This means
   that they can only be observed from this dual perspective, which is a
   dilemma that characterizes today's economy. Innovation decisions and
   design particularly illustrate the banking sector's embeddedness, with
   the dichotomy between fully digitalized options and fully
   territorialized services. Therefore, innovation is neither a
   ``Champion{''} or leadership question, nor a mere ICT option. It is a
   hybrid combination to restore trust and relations.
   Practical/social implications - The implications of such a balanced
   approach to innovation are highly important in terms of offshoring,
   layoffs, and outsourcing practices, which are adopted as essential, and
   taken for granted by owners and CEOs in global value chains such as
   finance. The given data and analysis give concrete means to integrate
   local cultural and institutional habits, so that innovation make sense
   to stakeholders.
   Originality/value - This chapter suggests a critical approach to
   innovation strategies and trends in the finance sector.}},

Abstract = {{By means of ``going greener{''}, ``getting smarter{''} and ``converging
   smart-green{''}, an innovation-driven smart city could address the steps
   toward more sustainability and aim toward improved human well-being. A
   vertical greening means a vertical triumph of greenery in a high density
   urban area, in some ways it displays the level of smartness and
   greenness in a city. Researchers have suggested the use of vertical
   greening in urban areas to improve sustainability of the environment.
   However, conventional vertical greening is in open fields, unprotected,
   threatened by climate disasters, lacking in better controlled climate
   conditions and plant response-based circumstances. In addition are
   always the challenges of energy saving, reduction of CO2 emissions,
   reduction in water use and in pesticide use. A greenhouse system could
   instead solve different facets of these problems in conventional
   vertical greening to achieve an optimal balance between an efficient
   environmental control and efficient plant use of available resources.
   The greenhouse solution appears to be intellectually justifiable,
   adaptable and innovative, and appears beneficial to a smart-green and
   sustainable smart city. Through the literature review and foresighted
   design point of view, the paper first summarizes the major concepts and
   trends of smart cities, vertical greening usage and new greenhouse
   technologies, and approaches an introduction to the relationship and
   development between vertical greening and greenhouse systems, and is
   followed by a presentation of a proposed novel prototype of a
   green-energy, water-autonomous greenhouse system. The sophisticated and
   multidisciplinary greenhouse system reveals its innovations and
   advantages by using water resources and solar energy in a rational way,
   fit for an alternativetechnology approach towards sustainable
   smart-green vertical greening in smart cities. Aimed at improving
   responsiveness, efficiency and performance for environmental and
   resource sustainability, and also aimed at improving well-being, the
   system is expected to be a foresight with simplicity in evolutionary
   vertical greening. By means of Industry Foundation Classes file format,
   with a true BIM model consisting of a digital prototype of the physical
   elements, further design of the system will allow us to simulate an
   ideal greenhouse type of vertical greening and understand its behavior
   in both the computer environment and actual on-site construction, as
   well as allow the building of a smart-green point cloud with BIM
   workflow on any network in a smart city.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, many studies have focused on the role that
   incremental innovations play in cluster contexts. However, few authors
   have analysed the impact of disruptive innovations on these entities.
   The present research analyses the emergence, development and
   dissemination of a disruptive technological innovation in an industrial
   cluster. In particular, we study the case of the introduction of inkjet
   printing technology in the Spanish ceramic cluster as a paradigm of how
   a disruptive innovation can impact the industry's value chain. This
   technological change ended up revolutionizing what was considered a
   mature and stable sector. In short, we will describe how a disruptive
   technological innovation is capable of renewing the life cycle of a
   cluster favouring the recovery of competitiveness and, even, creating
   new opportunities for diversification.}},

Title = {{Leading entrepreneurial e-learning development in legal education A
   longitudinal case study of ``universities as learning organisations{''}}},
Journal = {{LEARNING ORGANIZATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{298-311}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The study aims to review the entrepreneurial and educational
   innovations in technology-enabled distance education in practical legal
   education (PLE) accomplished by a unit ``on the periphery{''} of a
   strong research-led university. It also aims to examine the learning
   organisation (LO) attributes associated with this initiative.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a longitudinal case study based on
   interviews and reflective analysis, and reviewed using three
   ``models{''} drawn from the literature: breaking the ``iron triangle{''}
   (containing costs; widening access; enhancing quality); a tailored
   version of distance education appropriate for research-intensive
   universities; a strategy for successful adoption of disruptive
   technologies in higher education.
   Findings - Entrepreneurialism yielded growth (PLE student numbers went
   from 150 to 2,000 in 15 years) and diversification (two new programmes
   established). The PLE programme advanced in two ``waves{''}: the first
   centred on widening access and the second, on enhancing quality. Costs
   were contained. Both the presence and absence of LO attributes are
   identified at three different organisational levels.
   Research limitations/implications - Challenges to academic identity may
   act to inhibit educational change, especially in research-strong
   settings.
   Practical/implications - Business logic, and the creation and
   institutionalisation of educational development support - an ``internal
   networking{''} group, were keys to success. ``Organisational
   learning{''} in complex institutional environments such as universities
   involves understandably lengthy timescales (e.g. decades ormore).
   Practical/implications - Technology-enabled disruption in higher
   education appears relentless. While institutional and individual
   performance metrics favour research, proven cases of ``how to do things
   differently{''} in education may well not get exploited, thus opening
   the market to alternative providers.}},

Abstract = {{The transition of the society to a more progressive techno-economic
   paradigm (technological wave) is impossible without a sound long-term
   strategy for innovative development of the tax system. From the point of
   view of the systemic approach, it must be treated as a complex system
   which is open, dynamic, and non-reflex. Therefore, the authors first
   used the Networked Readiness Index to discover the pressure points and
   proposed some measures to address the challenges involved in bridging
   the gap between the Russian tax system and the global standards and
   scientific and technological development in this sphere in the situation
   when the resources are limited. Thereafter, the current state of
   taxation and tax administration in Russia is analyzed from the point of
   view of digital economy. The article gives special consideration to the
   development of creative personnel as the basis for the transition of the
   Russian economy and its tax system to a new and progressive
   technological environment. The authors suggest that the core triad for
   the development is personnel-information-technology, and the tool to be
   used for the implementation of the concept of lifelong learning is the
   Personal Learning Environment. In general, the findings of the study
   lead to the conclusion that in the context of an ever-growing arsenal of
   Internet applications and social services, a specialist's personal
   learning environment should evolve together with the specialist's
   development, both professional and personal, in order to comply with the
   realities of the complicated and constantly changing world. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{For the development of niche products like smart textiles and other
   functional high-end products, resource-saving production processes are
   needed. Niche products only require small batches, which makes their
   production with traditional textile production techniques time-consuming
   and costly. To achieve a profitable production, as well as to further
   foster innovation, flexible and integrated production techniques are a
   requirement. Both digital inkjet printing and UV-light curing contribute
   to a flexible, resource-efficient, energy-saving and therewith economic
   production of smart textiles. In this article, a smart textile UV-sensor
   is printed using a piezoelectric drop-on-demand printhead and cured with
   a UV-LED lamp. The UV-curable ink system is based on free radical
   polymerization and the integrated UV-sensing material is a photochromic
   dye, Reversacol Ruby Red. The combination of two photoactive compounds,
   for which UV-light is both the curer and the activator, challenges two
   processes: polymer crosslinking of the resin and color performance of
   the photochromic dye.
   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to characterize the
   curing efficiency of the prints. Color measurements are made to
   determine the influence of degree of polymer crosslinking on the
   developed color intensities, as well as coloration and decoloration
   rates of the photochromic prints. Optimized functionality of the textile
   UV-sensor is found using different belt speeds and lamp intensities
   during the curing process.}},

Abstract = {{Over the next 20 years there will be demographic shift from
   predominantly younger populations to older ones. Current models of care
   and pathways require transforming to become more citizen focused and
   support greater community resilience and sustainability. This will
   require different approaches to innovation to improve quality of life
   for people as they age, reduce onset of frailty as well as support those
   better with long term conditions around self-management and prevention
   strategies. Health and social care providers are looking at how they
   augment traditional clinical health related services with the use of IoT
   technologies and smart city services. This paper describes the on-going
   work of the Birmingham City4Age pilot, managed by the local authority,
   Birmingham City Council and funded by the Horizon 2020 Programme of the
   European Commission focused on the unobtrusive collection of data via
   wearable devices, outdoor sensors and other smart city systems that aims
   to help reduce the onset of frailty of older people. Locality and
   contextual data is being captured on individuals' behaviours with
   increased frequency that aims to help in detecting early changes in
   daily living - physical activity and social patterns and develop
   technology based interventions to help reduce the risk of frailty. The
   proposed systems architecture is being validated in two distinct
   neighbourhoods with contrasting demographics in Birmingham, UK adopting
   an iterative user design approach designed to support independence.}},

   processing, that have been. used to quantify velocity fields and
   particles size distribution in flat-tank reactors, a typical design used
   in the nuclear industry to mitigate criticality issues, more innovating
   techniques are currently developed. The latter open the way to the

Abstract = {{China took over the G20 2016 presidency from Turkey during a period of
   subdued economic activity and diminished global growth. Growth in China
   was expected to slow to 6.3\% in 2016 and 6.0\% in 2017, primarily
   reflecting weaker investment growth as the economy continued to
   rebalance. Acknowledging that lower growth rates have become the ``new
   normal,{''} the Chinese leadership set the annual target growth rate for
   China at no less than 6.5\% in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). The
   Plan redefined China's development paradigm, de-emphasizing speed in
   favour of quality based on innovation, coordination, green development,
   openness and sharing. This vision constituted the foundation of China's
   concept and priorities for the G20 presidency. The article reviews the
   main outcomes of the Chinese G20 presidency, focusing on major results
   which reflect China's priorities for domestic development and
   international cooperation. Using qualitative and quantitative analysis
   of the G20 2016 documents and the documents of international
   organizations, the author highlights the key decisions made at the
   Hangzhou summit and trends in G20 engagement with international
   institutions.
   The findings indicate that the Chinese presidency's priorities of
   development, innovation and trade received unprecedented attention, with
   development reaching an almost 43\% share in the discourse (compared to
   the average of 15\% for the eleven summits), innovation rising tenfold
   to about 7\% (compared to 0.75\% for the eleven summits) and trade
   peaking to 7.3\% (compared to the average rate of 2.8\%). At 2.2\%, the
   share of the G20 discourse dedicated to the environment was higher than
   the overall average (1.42\%) and higher than at any other summit except
   Cannes and Los Cabos. While energy issue-related discourse (about 4\%)
   ranked lower than for Brisbane and Antalya, the metric was comparable to
   the average for the period (3.4\%). Discussion dedicated to economic
   issues (25\%) was close to the average for the period (27\%). In line
   with the historical trend, the share of finance issues in the G20
   discourse continued to decline, reflecting the G20's role in the
   division of labour with regards to the regulation of financial markets.
   The intensity of G20 engagement with international organizations was
   higher than the average since the Washington summit. The choice of
   organizations was defined by the presidency's priorities and established
   trends. Given the UN's role in setting Sustainable Development Goals,
   and China's commitment to the UN as the central element of a fair and
   peaceful multilateral system, it came as no surprise that the intensity
   of references to the UN was twice as high as the average for G20 summits
   and significantly higher than in any other summit. A similar trend was
   observed with respect to the WTO and UNCTAD. The G20's reliance on OECD
   expertise continued to rise. The intensity of G20 engagement with the
   IMF and the World Bank was slightly lower than during the previous
   presidencies. Last but not least, China consolidated the G20's dialogue
   with engagement groups, most notably with B20 and L20.
   Drawing on the results of qualitative and quantitative analysis, the
   author concludes that China's G20 presidency contributed to the
   country's development priorities, reflected China's role in the evolving
   world order, and consolidated the G20's status as the premier forum for
   economic cooperation and making globalization work for everyone. The
   author asserts that China managed to ensure its imprint on future G20
   cooperation. First, it did so by integrating innovation, the new
   industrial revolution and the digital economy into its core agenda,
   generating 137 commitments to innovative growth and setting up the
   relevant international mechanisms. Second, with respect to trade and
   investment, it facilitated development and the adoption of two documents
   defining guiding principles for global investment policymaking, and
   promoting inclusive trade and global value chains. Third, under China's
   stewardship, the G20 agreed to three action plans on energy cooperation,
   including Enhancing Energy Access in Asia and the Pacific: Key
   Challenges and G20 Voluntary Collaboration Action Plan, the G20
   Voluntary Action Plan on Renewable Energy, and the G20 Energy Efficiency
   Leading Program (EELP), making further progress to address energy
   access, a cleaner energy future, energy efficiency, global energy
   architecture, energy security, as well as market transparency. Fourth,
   China advanced further G20 cooperation on development based on the
   Action Plan of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Fifth, the
   presidency committed to establish three China-based G20 centres, thus
   creating opportunities to enhance its influence in the G20 process
   through an evidence base, research and the exchange of knowledge in key
   policy areas. China struck a good balance between continuity and
   innovation regarding the G20 agenda, contributed to its legitimacy and
   effectiveness through productive engagement with key international
   organizations and dialogues with the engagement groups, and consolidated
   the G20's capacity for direction setting, decision making and delivery.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, many telecom operators suffered a profits recession
   because of the rise of over-the-top (OTT) services, especially text
   messaging and voice calls. To avoid becoming dumb pipes, telecom
   operators have to launch diverse digital services to transform their
   networks from dumb pipes to smart ones. Introducing Software-Defined
   Networking (SDN) into telecom networks may boost the network
   transformation more easily. SDN could also foster the innovation of
   novel telecom services, such as Software-Defined Wide-Area Network
   (SD-WAN) and Datacenter Interconnection (DCI). However, SDN also brings
   challenges to current network provisioning systems. It is needed to
   design a new network provisioning system to fulfill the demands of
   customers from their SD-WAN applications which need network controls. To
   provide dynamic network control, we design and implement a new
   service-oriented network provisioning system to support on-demand
   self-service network services. The system has been successfully deployed
   with the managed SD-WAN services in Chunghwa Telecom.}},

   cluster analysis of the examined papers is performed depending on scope,
   landmarking method, and facial database features. The purpose is to face
   these topics by providing the reader with a comprehensive view of what
   3D facial landmarks are and what ``they have been up to{''} in 2014 and
   2015. The aim is to offer to users the very up-to-date scenario, the

Abstract = {{In recent years, the digital image recognition technology of concrete
   structure cracks and deformation of binocular vision technology
   detection of civil engineering structure have made substantial
   development. As a result, people's understanding of the road engineering
   structure cracking and surface deformation recognition gives rise to a
   new situation. For the research on digital image concrete structure
   cracking and masonry structure surface deformation recognition
   technology, the key is to break through in the method, and to improve
   the traditional recognition technology and mode. Only in this way can we
   continuously improve the security level of the highway, to adapt to the
   new requirements of the development of new urbanization and
   modernization. This thesis focuses on and systematically analyzes the
   digital image road engineering structure cracking and key technologies
   of surface deformation recognition and its engineering applications. In
   addition, we change the concrete structure cracking and masonry
   structure surface deformation recognition pattern, and realize the
   breakthrough and innovation of the road structure safety testing means
   and methods.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the impact of digital technology in order to enhance
   the academic achievement of marginalized children by exposing them to
   the latest technological advances. The use of digital autonarratives as
   social transformative pedagogy is analyzed, specifically in the case of
   a project called La Clase Magica (LCM), conducted in an educational
   institution in Texas (USA) with a high percent of Hispanic student
   population. La Clase Magica is an extracurricular technology-based
   project designed to promote the academic achievement of bilingual Latin
   elementary-aged students, particularly in the areas of bilingualism,
   biliteracy, and technology. Up to twenty Bilingual Teacher Candidates
   (BTCs) were involved in this program and each BTC was assigned to a
   young elementary student, establishing adult-child pairs called amigo/as
   and amiguitos/as. Data collection and analysis were conducted within a
   period of 18 months using a qualitative methodology based in digital
   auto-narratives, digital field notes and in-class discussions which were
   transcribed in order to identify emerging themes, patterns and
   relationships as well as the preferred type of digital artifacts used.
   Findings reveal that prospective teachers need to take in technology as
   a pedagogical tool in order to develop a practical understanding of
   technology integration. The outcomes offer an additional understanding
   of the direction for teacher preparation programs in order to be more
   efficient for BTCs, allowing them to become technologically qualified
   and effective teachers, prepared to meet the needs of culturally and
   linguistically diverse learners.}},

Abstract = {{Digital innovation (DI), Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS) offer new opportunities for enterprises but also cause new
   challenges for Enterprise Architecture Management. Based on an
   industrial case from power garden products illustrating potentials and
   challenges of DI and IoT, this paper investigates the integration of
   product-IT into enterprise architectures. Product-IT includes the
   embedded IT-systems in physical products and services, components for
   operations, maintenance or evaluation purposes. The paper investigates
   the suitability of traditional enterprise architecture layers for
   structuring product-IT, identifies problems in product-IT and
   enterprise-IT integration and challenges for the field of EAM. The main
   contributions of the paper are (1) to position the area of product-IT in
   the field of EAM, (2) to identify challenges from real-world cases
   regarding integration of product-IT into EA and (3) outline potential
   ways to approach the challenges.}},

   also related to the active use of ICTs as a factor which allows them to
   develop a higher quality of life and a closer integration in their
   environment. The work is inside the framework of the Group of
   Educational Innovation at the University of Malaga (PIE 13-095). Farther
   than surveys, two group of discussions have been carried out in this
   research and, at the same time, participant techniques assigned to the
   Center of Active Participation for Seniors in Antequera and the Elders
   Hall of the University of Malaga. Basically, the purpose of this regard
   is to have a precise idea of the lack of skills of this sector of
   population and its consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of mobile devices in the journalistic practice has added
   new possibilities to the web journalism's narrative, opening the way for
   innovative experimentations. By analyzing a relevant set of outstanding
   products within the digital environment, this article looks at a new
   media ecosystem stimulated by the insertion of mobile technologies in
   the processes of producing, distributing and consuming news. The
   research argues that these ubiquitous technologies reconfigure the
   ``fabric of the narrative{''} as they create new mechanisms that
   structure multimedia elements, with decisive consequences for how users
   interact with those contents. Through an historical outlook, the main
   objective is to discuss the current stage of web journalism using
   hypernarrative capabilities associated with mobile devices. The analysis
   focuses on five fundamental elements used in this discursive mode:
   database, contextualization, immersion, multimedia continuum,
   parallax/verticalization}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, cultural heritage including historical sites are
   reconstructed into digital heritage. Based on UNESCO, digital heritage
   defines as ``cultural, educational, scientific and administrative
   resources, as well as technical, legal, medical and other kinds of
   information created digitally, or converted into digital form from
   existing analogue resources{''}. In addition, the digital heritage is
   doubling in size every two years and expected will grow tenfold between
   2013 and 2020. In order to attract and stir the interest of younger
   generations about digital heritage, gamification has been widely
   promoted. In this research, a virtual walkthrough combine with
   gamifications are proposed for learning and exploring historical places
   in Malaysia by using mobile device. In conjunction with Visit Perak 2017
   Campaign, this virtual walkthrough is proposed for Kellie's Castle at
   Perak. The objectives of this research is two folds 1) modelling and
   design of innovative mobile game for virtual walkthrough application,
   and 2) to attract tourist to explore and learn historical places by
   using sophisticated graphics from Augmented Reality. The efficiency and
   effectiveness of the mobile virtual walkthrough will be accessed by the
   International and local tourists. In conclusion, this research is
   speculated to be pervasively improve the cultural and historical
   knowledge of the learners.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. - Hand involvement confers a substantial handicap in work
   and daily activities in patients with Systemic sclerosis (SSc).
   Autologous adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction is as an easily
   accessible source of cells with regenerative effects. We previously
   performed a phase I open-label clinical trial (NTC01813279) assessing
   the safety of subcutaneous injection of autologous adipose-derived
   stromal vascular fraction. Six and 12-month data have been reported. As
   patients were followed in our medical centre, we report their
   longer-term outcome beyond the end of the trial.
   Patients and method. - Twelve females, mean age 54.5 +/- 10.3 years,
   initially enrolled in the clinical trial were assessed during a
   scheduled medical care, which took place between 22 and 30 months after
   treatment.
   Results. - Multiple patient-reported outcomes showed sustained
   improvement, in comparison with the assessment performed just before
   surgery: 62.5\% in the Cochin Hand Function Scale, 51.1\% in the
   Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire, 33.1\% in hand pain, and
   88.3\% in the Raynaud Condition Score. A decrease in the number of
   digital ulcers number was noted. Mobility, strength and fibrosis of the
   hand also showed improvement. None of the 8 patients who had previously
   received iloprost infusion required new infusion.
   Conclusion. - Despite the limits of an open label study, the data are in
   favour of the long-term safety of the adipose-derived stromal vascular
   fraction injection. Two randomized double blind, placebo-controlled
   trials of this therapeutic agent are ongoing in the USA (NCT02396238)
   and in France (NCT02558543) and will help determine the place of this
   innovative therapy for SSc patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Digitalization is the societal change process in which new ICT-based
   solutions bring forward completely new ways of doing things, new
   businesses and new movements in the society. Digitalization also
   provides completely new ways of addressing issues related to global
   health. This paper provides an overview of the field of human-computer
   interaction (HCI) and in what way the field has contributed to
   international development in different regions of the world.
   Additionally, it outlines the United Nations' new sustainability goals
   from December 2015 and what these could contribute to the development of
   global health and its relationship to digitalization. Finally, it argues
   why and how HCI could be adopted and adapted to fit the contextual
   needs, the need for localization and for the development of new digital
   innovations. The research methodology is mostly qualitative following an
   action research paradigm in which the actual change process that the
   digitalization is evoking is equally important as the scientific
   conclusions that can be drawn. In conclusion, the paper argues that
   digitalization is fundamentally changing the society through the
   development and use of digital technologies and may have a profound
   effect on the digital development of every country in the world. But it
   needs to be developed based on local practices, it needs international
   support and to not be limited by any technological constraints.
   Particularly digitalization to support global health requires a profound
   understanding of the users and their context, arguing for user-centred
   systems design methodologies as particularly suitable.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Educators are increasingly required to develop creativity and
   entrepreneurial capabilities amongst students, yet within the fields of
   entrepreneurship and innovation these are presented as separate
   processes. We explore the theoretical and conceptual similarities and
   differences between these processes, and relate this to a range of
   experiential and digitally enhanced learning activities in formal
   education settings.
   Methodology/approach - We present a conceptual model of the iterative
   nature of creativity and entrepreneurship as separate cognitive and
   social processes leading to aesthetic or sense- making outcomes. This
   leads to a discussion of how these processes may be experienced by
   students within an educational setting.
   Findings - We propose a framework of learning activities which support
   the development of creativity through teaching entrepreneurially, at
   primary, secondary, and tertiary education levels. A range of different
   approaches is critically evaluated according to their relevance,
   including business planning, simulations, roleplay, co-creation, and
   flashmobs. Flashmobs are proposed to be most suitable and an outline
   learning activity design is mapped in detail against creative and
   entrepreneurial processes.
   Research and Practical implications - This chapter supports educational
   practice and research on learning through entrepreneurship in allowing
   educators and researchers to evaluate how learning activities may
   directly contribute to students' learning through experience and the
   development of their creative and entrepreneurial mind-set.
   Originality/value - This chapter is of value to educators as it explains
   how creative and entrepreneurial processes may be experienced by
   students through different forms of learning activity. It is of further
   value to research on entrepreneurial learning in considering how the
   creative process may inform entrepreneurial action.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This chapter demonstrates how Humanities students in a blended
   learning course become active learners, use an entrepreneurial approach,
   and reflect on the achievement of an entrepreneurial mindset. Students
   at the Master's ICT-based Educational Design, where they work with
   information-and communication technology in an educational context, were
   challenged to create value for themselves and others in their
   professional life by experimenting with ways to combine the online with
   the offline with their own students/pupils.
   Methodology/approach - We present a case study over the period of one
   semester of five entrepreneurial teams of Masters students on an
   ICT-based Educational Design. Effectuation, as a process, was combined
   with a design structure to help guide the students. Data were drawn from
   observations, written material in the form of blogs and assignments, as
   well as recorded conversations on Google Hangout with groups of
   students.
   Findings - The use of reflection, collaboration, and the effectual
   process in the open laboratory provide the vehicle to nurture and
   support the achievement of a creative and innovative ways of working
   with real life practices. We suggest that nurturing experimental
   communities of practice in open learning laboratory settings may provide
   an opportunity for establishing an entrepreneurial mindset in students
   and as such has to the potential as a method to confront future societal
   challenges.
   Originality/value - This chapter makes an important contribution to
   entrepreneurship education in general by demonstrating how the
   combination of particular online/offline strategies can support the
   enhancement of entrepreneurial mindsets that will serve learners
   throughout the life course.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This chapter examines the existing work on tangible user
   interfaces (TUIs) and focuses on tangible programming with the scope to
   enlighten the opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship in this
   particular domain.
   Methodology/approach - In the first section, we start by presenting in
   short the history of TUIs and then focus on tangible programming
   presenting the different design approaches. Then we present the
   opportunities for innovation and guidelines for future products.
   In the second section, we review the entrepreneurial activities that
   combine educational toys and TUIs.
   Findings - The main finding of this chapter is that although TUI design
   and research are still in its infancy and more design guidelines and
   research are required to further bridge the digital and the physical
   world, the first signs of entrepreneurship promise a bright future.
   Research limitations - Limitations arise from the fact that many
   companies keep many of their financial data confidential. Thus, it was
   impossible to include and validate all the information that we intended
   to present.
   Practical implications - Initially, this chapter motivates and
   challenges scientist to find novel innovative solutions in the field.
   Then, reveals the entrepreneurial opportunities and potential customers.
   Finally, shows the funding sources and how tangible products are offered
   in the market.
   Social implications - We propose a new kind of toys that might alter and
   expand science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in
   education.
   Originality/value - This chapter appears to be unique in the sense that
   is the first that reports simultaneously on TUIs, entrepreneurship, and
   innovation.}},

Abstract = {{At present, a large number of professional diesel databases and systems
   could support all kinds of unified management and retrieval applications
   based on the diesel research data, but the actual working environment
   exists three problems: (1) Data scattered in different databases and not
   conducive to business development. (2) The normalization of the diesel
   terminology is relatively low, affecting the retrieval accuracy. (3) The
   efficiency of knowledge search is low. This paper aims at the knowledge
   management and application problem in the diesel research and
   development process of digital design for vehicle diesel, analyzes the
   construction demand of the diesel domain ontology, proposed the diesel
   domain ontology construction method, constructed the diesel domain
   ontology structure, developed diesel professional ontology model
   management tool and diesel domain ontology service interface, which
   provides an organizational framework for information integration to
   facilitate the accurate and effective transfer between knowledge, data
   and model. The constraint of the ontology could ensure the accuracy and
   consistency of information, which could help enterprise improve the
   accuracy and integrity of the diesel knowledge search. The diesel domain

Abstract = {{A vapor-compression refrigeration cycle typically uses standard
   refrigerants as the working fluid. Traditional refrigerants, however,
   have been associated with Ozone level Depletion Potential (ODP) and
   significant Global Warming Potential (GWP). An innovative cooling
   technology has been investigated using sonic multi-phase flow in a
   critical-flow nozzle to create a low-pressure and low-temperature region
   for heat absorption. The strength of the new technology is its potential
   to produce cooling using water and/or other working fluids with low ODP
   and GWP. While the full potential for using water as the working fluid
   may not be fully-realized, because of property limitations still under
   investigation, water still provides a very useful media for
   investigating the underlying cavitation phenomena for the development of
   the new technology.
   As part of ongoing research into the potential cooling capacity of the
   cavitation phenomena, cavitation in a converging-diverging nozzle is
   being investigated using water as the working fluid. Cavitation in a
   fluid is the formation of the vapor phase from the liquid phase by
   reduction in the pressure of the fluid below its saturated vapor
   pressure. Due to the constricting nature of the throat of a
   converging-diverging nozzle, the liquid water velocity at the throat is
   increased and the local absolute pressure can drop to values below the
   saturated vapor pressure of water at a given temperature; thus, causing
   the fluid to cavitate.
   The effect of water temperature on both the onset of the cavitation
   within the nozzle, and the resulting length of the cavitation region
   within the nozzle, are the subject of the current paper. Flow
   Visualization using a high speed digital camera under these different
   operating conditions was aimed at investigating the region of cavitation
   onset, which also appears to be associated with the region of boundary
   layer separation just downstream of the throat of the nozzle. The length
   of the two phase region at different operating temperatures was measured
   and it was observed that as the temperature of the fluid was increased,
   the length of two-phase region before it condensed into single-phase
   liquid became longer. Experimental results and analysis are presented
   which also show that near the onset of cavitation, the flowrate can
   likely go well beyond a choking condition without cavitating, and can
   remain in this metastable state for an extended amount of time before
   nucleating (cavitating) into a stable state. In particular, analysis
   indicates that significantly negative absolute pressures can likely be
   achieved within the nozzle, suggesting the presence of tension in the
   liquid phase just prior to cavitation.}},

Abstract = {{Many roadway and highway bridges have been suffering from aging and
   deterioration problems. To inspect those bridges more efficiently and
   accurately, the Japanese government launched a series of national
   projects aiming to develop various innovative robotic inspection systems
   to support conventional visual inspections. This study is devoted to
   developing the sensing modules compatible with the robotic inspection
   system. To preliminarily investigate the feasibility of the image-type
   sensing modules, a laboratory experiment was conducted, taking a
   commercially available digital camera and a digital video camera as the
   sensors and a model vehicle moving on rails as the robot. Two concrete
   blocks were placed at a certain distance away from the sensing system
   and serving as inspection targets. On still images taken by the camera,
   it was verified that the clear identification strongly depended on the
   short object distance, bright target surface, and quick shutter speed.
   Herein, the following condition presented a successful identification:
   1-m object distance, 2300-lx illuminance, F2.8 aperture, 1/250-s shutter
   speed, 4608 3456 image resolution, and theoretical space resolution 0.09
   mm/pixel. Longer object distance, faster moving speed, darker object
   surface and poorer theoretical space resolution would decrease the
   identification level. In videos taken by the digital video camera, it
   was verified that an object distance as short as 0.17 m could provide a
   high quality video from which the crack could be successfully
   identified. Those observations provided a useful basis for further
   development of the robot sensing system. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Digital PCR (dPCR) is an innovative approach for detection and
   quantification of nucleic acid that offers an alternative method to
   conventional real-time quantitative PCR for absolute quantification.
   dPCR is a highly precise and sensitive technique that does not require a
   standard reference, making it a suitable method for the detection of
   microRNAs. The potential of these small noncoding RNA as biomarkers is
   on the rise, especially due to their presence in body fluids, making
   them easily accessible. Nevertheless, the problem of lack of consensus
   regarding an optimal method for miRNAs normalization compromises their
   use. Here, we describe an innovative method for the absolute
   quantification of miRNAs across different types of biological samples
   using a chip-based platform, the QuantStudio 3D digital PCR.}},

Abstract = {{The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will explore with unprecedented
   precision the Universe in the gamma ray domain covering an energy range
   from 50 GeV to more the 300 TeV. To cover such a broad range with a
   sensitivity which will be ten time better than actual instruments,
   different types of telescopes are needed: the Large Size Telescopes
   (LSTs), with a 24 m diameter mirror, a Medium Size Telescopes (MSTs),
   with a 12 m mirror and the small size telescopes (SSTs), with a 4 m
   diameter mirror. The single mirror small size telescope (SST-1M), one of
   the proposed solutions to become part of the small-size telescopes of
   CTA, will be equipped with an innovative camera. The SST-1M has a
   Davies-Cotton optical design with a mirror dish of 4 m diameter and
   focal ratio 1.4 focussing the Cherenkov light produced in atmospheric
   showers onto a 90 cm wide hexagonal camera providing a FoV of 9 degrees.
   The camera is an innovative design based on silicon photonuiltipliers
   (SiPM) and adopting a fully digital trigger and readout architecture.
   The catitera features 1296 custom designed large arca hexagonal coupled
   to hollow optical concentrators to achieve a pixel size of almost 2.4
   ern. The Si PM is a custom design developed With I Ituiu ian iatau and
   with its active area of almost 1 ern is one Or the largest tiioiiolit
   hitSi PI\textbackslash{}I existing. Also the. optical concentratot{''}s
   are innovative being light funnels leis made of a polycarboliate
   substrate coated with a costom designed UV-enhancing coating. The analog
   signals Conning from tlIC Si PM are fed into the fully digital readout
   electronics, where digital data are processed by high-speed UPGAs both
   lOr trigger and readout. The trigger logic, implemented into an Virtex 7
   FPGA, uses the digital data to elaborate a trigger decision by matching
   data against predefined patterns. This approach is extremely flexible
   and allows improvements and continued evolutions of the system. The
   prototype camera is being tested in laboratory pro tr to its
   installation expected in fall 2017 on the telescope prototype in Krakow
   (Poland). In this contribution, we will describe the design of the
   camera and show the performance measured in lalii-Jratory.}},

Abstract = {{Technologies for mapping the ``digital twin{''} have been under
   development for approximately 20 years. Nowadays increasingly
   intelligent, individualized products encourages companies to respond
   innovatively to customer requirements and to handle the rising product
   variations quickly.
   An integrated engineering network, spanning across the entire value
   chain, is operated to intelligently connect various company divisions,
   and to generate a business ecosystem for products, services and
   communities. The conditions for the digital twin are thereby determined
   in which the digital world can be fed into the real, and the real world
   back into the digital to deal such intelligent products with rising
   variations.
   The term digital twin can be described as a digital copy of a real
   factory, machine, worker etc., that is created and can be independently
   expanded, automatically updated as well as being globally available in
   real time. Every real product and production site is permanently
   accompanied by a digital twin. First prototypes of such digital twins
   already exist in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory on a cloud- and
   app-based software that builds on a dynamic, multidimensional data and
   information model. A standardized language of the robot control systems
   via software agents and positioning systems has to be integrated. The
   aspect of the continuity of the real factory in the digital factory as
   an economical means of ensuring continuous actuality of digital models
   looks as the basis of changeability.
   For the indoor localization sensor combinations that in addition to the
   hardware already contain the software required for the sensor data
   fusion should be used. Processing systems, scenario-live-simulations and
   digital shop floor management results in a mandatory procedural
   combination. Essential to the digital twin is the ability to
   consistently provide all subsystems with the latest state of all
   required information, methods and algorithms. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The goal of this chapter is to present a theoretical and practical frame
   for PD of teachers at the digital age. The main question we ask is how
   to develop life competencies and skills of teachers in order to change
   their learning and teaching in a way that enables school graduates to
   acquire relevant skills for life. The chapter inquires this issue by a
   qualitative methodology case study. The case is an online course for
   teachers' professional development. The chapter presents evidence from
   reflective diaries, interviews and scripts of students' and teachers'
   discussions, focusing on identification of the effects of the course's
   learning environments on the development of the teachers' self
   determination learning and skills. The findings indicate the useful
   effects of the combination between LMS environments and social media,
   such as Web 2.0 tools. The conclusions suggest new directions for
   teachers' professional development that encourage the design of a
   flexible fractal net which enable fostering teachers' leadership and
   innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Visual Art teachers of K-6 students are required to look at innovative
   ways to deliver and explore the elements of arts through creating and
   responding learning activities. They are also required to consider how
   digital technology can support these areas. This chapter presents an
   Australian project that invited 10 primary school visual art teachers to
   consider how they could integrate digital technology such as an
   interactive whiteboard and mobile devices while exploring an inquiry
   topic of public art. Narrative case studies are presented that highlight
   the teacher voice. Each narrative focuses on the building of capacity to
   meaningfully engage with digital technology while exploring visual art.
   The narratives provide insight into gaps in how some primary teachers
   engage with digital technology in the classroom, that is focusing more
   on the tuning in and evaluation stages of an inquiry unit.}},

Abstract = {{Global open online, and distance learning call for innovation and new
   strategies at all levels because of current paradigm shifts and global
   trends towards increased digitization in all sectors in society. Thus,
   the educational sector must focus on new trends in executive leadership,
   shifting paradigms, innovative approaches to distributed leadership, and
   management practice. The sections in this chapter consider why we have
   to re-think leadership and why the demands of leadership in global open,
   online, and distance learning have to innovate, change and be rethought.
   The main topics elaborated in this chapter are increased digitization
   and societal issues, global open online and distance learning, and
   finally leadership in global open online learning arenas. In conclusion,
   leaders must embrace and be in the forefront in the areas of teaching,
   research, governance and society for the transitions to personal global
   open online learning.}},

Abstract = {{This essay is the first to historicise and give a comprehensive
   assessment of literary responses to cognitive overstimulation. A wave of
   post-war writing responded playfully to informatics in a pre-digital
   period through an engagement with physics, entropy and
   post-structuralist theory. In an era dominated by neuroscientific
   revolutions, fiction written in the digital age addresses the pressing
   information overload debate with a new seriousness, often stressing
   concerns about the impact on the human mind. Contemporary fictional
   writing depicts an increasingly immersive online experience that
   accelerates information processing by human minds under technostress.
   New phenomena such Big Data and `infobesity' affect not only writing
   practice but stretch the mainstream novel form to its representational
   limits. Mainstream literature is critical of the changing the shape of
   our lives and minds at the level of content, yet fails to find new forms
   of storytelling. This essay ends by identifying new writing that unites
   form and content in innovative ways through storytelling modes that
   represent the processes we are living through more accurately. We are
   experiencing a major epistemological shift, and are witnessing the
   emergence of exciting, new kinds of subjectivity.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, we first provide a circumscribed review of the creative
   sector as a potential employment-creating sector, specifically in the
   digitised creative segment in Iran, Saudi Arabia and United Arab
   Emirates. Whilst acknowledging the previous work on the Technical
   Vocational Education and Training (TVET) systems and the increased
   entrepreneurship education efforts in these countries, we focus on the
   learning and upskilling required for innovating in the nascent creative
   sub-sectors, such as digital marketing and advertising (e.g. mobile
   value-added services (VAS)); media and entertainment (e.g. television
   and film, and gaming); and digital commerce (e.g. start-ups and new
   technology based firms (NTBFs)). Our geographical focus remains on the
   context of Tehran, Jeddah (and Khobar), and Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
   Secondly, exploring the in-situ learning episodes within a conceptual
   model, created via primary and secondary data sources, we point to the
   prominent use of skill webs as means of in-project upskilling and a
   resource for development of inter-professional learning and judgement
   capability which forms a core ingredient for innovation. Lastly, the
   final section briefly points to recent policy vistas and concludes.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental protocol is presented aiming to monitor the mechanical
   response of restored structural elements of marble monuments. An
   accurate copy of a typical epistyle of the Athens Parthenon Temple was
   constructed by experienced technicians of the Parthenon's worksite under
   a 1:3 scale. It was composed by two asymmetric fragments and it was
   restored with the aid of three pairs of titanium bars. It was subjected
   to ten-point bending, in an attempt to simulate uniform loading
   conditions. Various techniques, both innovative and traditional ones,
   were used to monitor strains and displacements: Acoustic Emission (AE),
   Pressure Stimulated Currents (PSC), Digital Image Correlation (DIC),
   Optical Fibers, clip gauges, dial gauges and LVDTs. The data recorded
   from all techniques were in very good mutual agreement. What is more
   important, however, is that the AE and PSC techniques provided clear and
   mutually compatible data which can be safely considered as indicators of
   upcoming failures. Copyright (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mechanical response and fracture of Double Edged Notched Tensile
   (DENT) specimens, made of Dionysos marble, is studied in an effort to
   enlighten the mechanisms activated before and during catastrophic crack
   initiation and propagation in pre-cracked structures. The innovation of
   the study is that four modem sensing techniques, both contact and
   non-contact, are used simultaneously to monitor the response of the
   specimens, in the direction of pumping real-time data from both the
   surface and the interior of them. The analysis of these data, permitted
   comparative assessment of the efficiency of the techniques used and
   indicated that they provide clear and in mutual agreement signs, which
   precede the onset of crack initiation and can be considered as
   pre-failure indicators. Copyright (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The architectural design stages in architectural practices or in
   architectural design studio consist of many aspects. One of them is
   during the early phases of the design process, where the architects or
   designers try to interpret the project brief into the design concept.
   This paper is a report of the procedure of digital tools in the early
   design process in an architectural practice in Jakarta. It targets
   principally the use of BIM and digital modeling to generate information
   and transform them into conceptual forms, which is not very common in
   Indonesian architectural practices. Traditionally, the project brief is
   transformed into conceptual forms by using sketches, drawings, and
   physical model. The new method using digital tools shows that it is
   possible to do the same thing during the initial stage of the design
   process to create early architectural design forms. Architect's
   traditional tools and methods begin to be replaced effectively by
   digital tools, which would drive bigger opportunities for innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Industry is one of the pillars of the European economy - the
   manufacturing sector in the European Union accounts for 2 million
   enterprises, 33 million jobs and 60\% of productivity growth. The new
   industrial revolution is driven by new-generation information
   technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big
   data and data analytics, robotics and 3D printing. These technologies
   open new horizons for industry to become more adventurous, more
   efficient, to improve processes and to develop innovative products and
   services. Recent studies estimate that digitisation of products and
   services can add more than (sic)110 billions of annual revenues in
   Europe in the next five years. In this context, Digitizing European
   Industry (DEI) initiative aims to establish, together with all Member
   States, and industry and other stakeholders, and building upon existing
   multi-stakeholder dialogues, a framework for facilitating coordination
   and cooperation of European, national and regional initiatives on
   digitising European industry, as well as to mobilise stakeholders across
   the value chains.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) is about connecting objects, things and devices
   and combining them with a set of novel services. IoT market is
   unstoppably progressing, introducing a lot of changes across industries,
   both from the technological and business perspectives. Optimization of
   the whole value chain is providing many opportunities for improvements
   leveraging IoT technologies, in particular if information about the
   products is available and shareable.
   TagItSmart project is creating an open, interoperable set of components
   that can be integrated into any cloud-based platform to address the
   challenges related to the lifecycle management of new innovative
   services. TagItSmart is a three years project (2016-2018), consisting of
   15 consortium partners from Europe. The project is funded under the
   Horizon 2020 program.
   A main target of the TagItSmart are everyday mass-market objects not
   normally considered as part of an IoT ecosystem. These new smarter
   objects will dynamically change their status in response to a variety of
   factors and be seamlessly tracked during their lifecycle. This will
   change the way users-to-things interactions are viewed. Combining the
   power of functional inks with the pervasiveness of digital and
   electronic markers, a huge number of objects will be equipped with cheap
   sensing capabilities thus being able to capture new contextual
   information. Beside this, the ubiquitous presence of smartphones with
   their cameras and NFC readers will create the perfect bridge between
   everyday users and their objects. This will create a completely new flow
   of crowdsourced information that can be exploited by new services.}},

Abstract = {{The number of refugees arriving in Europe increased dramatically in
   2015. Following arrival at the host country, refugees need access to
   information on various topics such as applying for asylum, medical care,
   educational offerings, jobs, or social activities. As many different
   parties using different channels provide this information, refugees
   struggle to access relevant information at the right time. Our goal in
   addressing this information deficit is to support a digital information
   platform for refugees by developing a governance strategy for the
   ecosystem of information providers. Within an action research study
   based on a nonprofit project, we evaluate the implementation of
   governance mechanisms derived from platform and community governance
   literature. Our results show that governance mechanisms are implemented
   differently for nonprofit platform ecosystems than for commercial
   platform ecosystems. These results enhance the societal impact of the
   information platform developed in the project. The study contributes to
   theory on governance of platform ecosystems and IT-enabled collaboration
   by evaluating established governance mechanisms in the context of
   nonprofit platforms.}},

   only for project management or organisational development but for any
   attempt to govern the Anthropocene and bring about successful systemic
   change to meet climate change, poverty and political conflict to name
   but a few.
   Social systems research seems to be unnecessarily underrated since it
   developed into a discipline which has more to offer than metaphors of
   swarm intelligence and self-organisation. On the contrary,
   constructivism facilitated the epistemological turn shifting from
   objectivity to functional adequacy as the central research criterion,
   and the digital transformation as well as gamification paved the path
   for a convincing new generation of systems analytics enlightening the
   political and cultural aspects of social complexity in an amazing
   fashion.
   Systemic inquiry based on a praxeological understanding of action
   research opens new possibilities for social design impact evaluation and
   social innovation assessment. The next society needs to be systems
   savvy. Social systems research already shows how the next society could
   successfully meet its own social complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The development of ablative pulsed plasma thrusters (APPT) continues at
   RIAME MAI. In 2014 one of them, APPT-45-2, was mounted on board the
   small spacecraft MKA-FKI PN2 developed by the S.A. Lavochkin Scientific
   and Production Association. Now in cooperation with the Scientific
   Technical Innovation Center ``TECHCOM{''} the electric propulsion system
   (EPS) APPT-250 of the next generation is being developed, that is
   intended for the orbit maintanance of the constellation of small
   communication satellites. Power consumption of EPS is from 60 to 120 W,
   the total thrust impulse is 15.6 kN.s. APPT-250 differs from the earlier
   APPTbased propulsion systems by substantially lower mass. A digital
   power processing unit (PPU), developed by ``TECHCOM{''}, and power
   capacitors with high specific energy intensity are used for the first
   time. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation, a complex concept, underpinned a four-year pan-European
   research project designed to increase the effective use of technology in
   school classrooms. This article revisits evaluation data collected
   during the project and explores the challenges of conceptualising,
   realising and researching `innovation'. The authors describe how
   innovation was conceptualised, highlighting key issues, not all of which
   could be resolved in the project. The development of an approach to
   support teachers to change their practices facilitated the realisation
   of innovation in the classroom. This approach, through which researchers
   and national pedagogical coordinators worked with teachers to develop
   their teaching and learning practices with technology in potentially
   innovative ways, is outlined. Case study data are then used to exemplify
   how teachers and other stakeholders applied this approach and how they
   perceived innovation in practice within their own countries. Through a
   discussion of these cases, the article highlights the challenge of
   defining innovation in different country settings and, in turn, the
   complexity of identifying its occurrence. It concludes by proposing the
   next steps for similar research endeavours.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years there has been a widespread use of wireless sensor
   networks that found their application in complex systems where a lot of
   physical quantities have to be monitored. This nodes must deal with
   different physical quantities and must operate in different
   environments. In many applications the most critical aspect is the power
   supply, because frequently is possible to provide power supply by wires
   and sometimes the use of batteries is not an acceptable solution. This
   latter limitation occurs when the number of nodes is very high and/or
   the operation of battery substitution is very complex. Moreover,
   environmental requests for pollutant reduction and for renewable
   materials represents another limitation for the use power supply
   generation based on battery. For these reasons it can be useful to
   develop power sensor nodes which use energy harvested directly on the
   operation site, making the sensors energetically autonomous. In this
   paper we present an innovative sensor node based on Microbial Fuel Cells
   (MFCs). The implemented node proves the viability of MFC for the energy
   harvesting in sensor networks. This system uses the electric energy
   provided by the bacteria present in the soil as power supply for an
   ultra low power electronic system, based on a micro-controller equipped
   with a digital transceiver. The designed system is able to acquire data
   from a sensor and transmit them wirelessly. The scarcity of available
   energy and the limited voltages of the MFC require to design new schemes
   for the energy harvesting and the power supply, as well as new working
   modes which must satisfy the strong energy constraints.}},

Abstract = {{This paper seeks to provide an initial theoretical grounding to assess a
   practical project: a new software application that attempts to be a
   beneficial resource in the field of Indigenous representation. As a
   starting point, we are concerned to provide a theoretical ground for
   considering the inherited and shifting spaces of Indigenous media
   representation. To this end, this paper reconsiders the strengths and
   weaknesses of debates surrounding the `Indigenous public sphere'. This
   is used as grounds for critically understanding the relations that
   constitute this field. Following this, we consider how a more
   materialist approach to publics might enable a productive
   reconceptualization, and in particular how digital media initiatives and
   shifting news markets may be contributing to change. Finally, drawing on
   this model, we outline both the `Wakul app' project, and how this
   framework might inform an assessment of its impact.}},

Title = {{Applications of collaborative annotation system in digital curation,
   crowdsourcing, and digital humanities}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1122-1140}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Collaboratively annotating digital texts allow users to add
   valued information, share ideas and create knowledge. Most importantly,
   annotated content can help users obtain a deeper and broader
   understanding of a text compared to digital content without annotations.
   This work proposes a novel collaborative annotation system (CAS) with
   four types of multimedia annotations including text annotation, picture
   annotation, voice annotation and video annotation which can embedded
   into any HTML Web pages to enable users to collaboratively add and
   manage annotations on these pages and provide a shared mechanism for
   discussing shared annotations among multiple users. By applying the CAS
   in a mashup on static HTML Web pages, this study aims to discuss the
   applications of CAS in digital curation, crowdsourcing and digital
   humanities to encourage existing strong relations among them.
   Design/methodology/approach - This work adopted asynchronous JavaScript
   (Ajax) and a model-view-controller framework to implement a CAS with
   reading annotation tools for knowledge creating, archiving and sharing
   services, as well as applying the implemented CAS to support digital
   curation, crowdsourcing and digital humanities. A questionnaire survey
   method was used to investigate the ideas and satisfaction of visitors
   who attended a digital curation with CAS support in the item dimensions
   of the interactivity with displayed products, the attraction and the
   content absorption effect. Also, to collect qualitative data that may
   not be revealed by the questionnaire survey, semi-structured interviews
   were performed at the end of the digital curation exhibition activity.
   Additionally, the effects of the crowdsourcing and digital humanities
   with CAS support on collecting and organizing ideas and opinions for
   historical events and promoting humanity research outcomes were
   considered as future works because they all need to take a long time to
   investigate.
   Findings - Based on the questionnaire survey, this work found that the
   digital curation with CAS support revealed the highest rating score in
   terms of the item dimension of attraction effect. The result shows
   applying CAS to support digital curation is practicable, novel and
   interesting to visitors. Additionally, this work also successfully
   applied the developed CAS to crowdsourcing and digital humanities so
   that the two research fields may be brought into a new ground.
   Originality/value - Based on the CAS, this work developed a novel
   digital curation approach which has a high degree of satisfaction on
   attraction effect to visitors, an innovative crowdsourcing platform that
   combined with a digital archive system to efficiently gather collective
   intelligence to solve the difficult problems of identifying digital
   archive contents and a high potential digital humanity research mode
   that can assist humanities scholars to annotate the texts with distinct
   interpretation and viewpoints on an ancient map, as well as discuss with
   other humanities scholars to stimulate discussion onmore issues.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to explore the factors affecting the adoption
   of digital reference services (DRS) among the university librarians in
   Pakistan.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on the adapted unified theory of
   acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model, the proposed study
   tested 12 hypothetical relationships through structural equation
   modelling (SEM) techniques. The study approach was quantitative based on
   a questionnaire distributed online to a sample of Pakistani university
   librarians and completed by 289 respondents. The questionnaire used in
   this study was developed from other validated instruments used in past
   empirical studies. Descriptive and inferential data analyses were
   performed through SPSS and AMOS for SEM.
   Findings - The results revealed usefulness, ease of use and information
   and communication technology (ICT) skills as the significant predictors
   of the adoption of DRS. However, moderating influence of the demographic
   factors (age, gender and type of library) on the relationship of
   predictors with outcome variable was found insignificant. The findings
   of this study imply that individuals' readiness for the adoption of DRS
   is present in the university libraries of Pakistan.
   Originality/value - In the context of Pakistan, this study was the first
   attempt that investigated factors of the adoption of DRS at individual
   level. In addition, two new factors - namely, ICT skills and library
   type were incorporated into the UTAUT model and were then evaluated in
   the Pakistani context. However, these two factors were found
   insignificant in influencing librarians towards the adoption of DRS. The
   intended study is equally useful for librarians in other countries in
   terms of understanding the factors that impact the effective adoption of
   DRS.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) is a rapidly growing field that has got innovative
   applications. Two main forms of VR content can be identified in the
   current applications --computer generated 3D models and adaptations of
   real world scenarios using digital imagery and video. However, real
   world adaptations are quite restrictive when it comes to interaction.
   These restrictions are due either to large storage needs, or to high
   computational needs, required to generate dynamic intermediate views.
   Thus, solutions through which real world simulation could be achieved in
   immersive and interactive VR environments are not available.
   The research presented in this paper is intended to provide a high
   degree of interaction to users who engage in immersive VR experiences
   related to real world adaptations. The solution offered is a navigable
   grid map of spherical panoramas, which uses a three stage approach.
   Firstly, intermediate views among spheres are approximated using novel
   mechanisms. Secondly, an optimization strategy is introduced based on
   visual locality in which the areas with a higher probability of
   immediate interaction are given more prominence for quality during
   rendering. Thirdly, smooth segue transition is achieved through a
   machine learning backed gesture input system. The three approaches when
   combined together allow for an intuitive virtual experience while
   ensuring optimal resource utilization.}},

Title = {{Expert profiling for collaborative innovation: big data perspective}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION DISCOVERY AND DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{169-180}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Expert profiling plays an important role in expert finding for
   collaborative innovation in research social networking platforms.
   Dynamic changes in scientific knowledge have posed significant
   challenges on expert profiling. Current approaches mostly rely on
   knowledge of other experts, contents of static web pages or their
   behavior and thus overlook the insight of big social data generated
   through crowdsourcing in research social networks and scientific data
   sources. In light of this deficiency, this research proposes a big
   data-based approach that harnesses collective intelligence of crowd in
   (research) social networking platforms and scientific databases for
   expert profiling.
   Design/methodology/approach - A big data analytics approach which uses
   crowdsourcing is designed and developed for expert profiling. The
   proposed approach interconnects big data sources covering publication
   data, project data and data from social networks (i.e. posts, updates
   and endorsements collected through the crowdsourcing). Large volume of
   structured data representing scientific knowledge is available in Web of
   Science, Scopus, CNKI and ACM digital library; they are considered as
   publication data in this research context. Project data are located at
   the databases hosted by funding agencies. The authors follow the
   Map-Reduce strategy to extract real-time data from all these sources.
   Two main steps, features mining and profile consolidation (the details
   of which are outlined in the manuscript), are followed to generate
   comprehensive user profiles. The major tasks included in features mining
   are processing of big data sources to extract representational features
   of profiles, entity-profile generation and social-profile generation
   through crowd-opinion mining. At the profile consolidation, two
   profiles, namely, entity-profile and social-profile, are conflated.
   Findings -(1) The integration of crowdsourcing techniques with big
   research data analytics has improved high graded relevance of the
   constructed profiles. (2) A system to construct experts' profiles based
   on proposed methods has been incorporated into an operational system
   called ScholarMate (www.scholarmate.com).
   Research limitations - One shortcoming is currently we have conducted
   experiments using sampling strategy. In the future we will perform
   controlled experiments of large scale and field tests to validate and
   comprehensively evaluate our design artifacts.
   Practical implications - The business implication of this research work
   is that the developed methods and the system can be applied to
   streamline human capital management in organizations.
   Originality/value - The proposed approach interconnects opinions of
   crowds on one's expertise with corresponding expertise demonstrated in
   scientific knowledge bases to construct comprehensive profiles. This is
   a novel approach which alleviates problems associated with existing
   methods. The authors' team has developed an expert profiling system
   operational in ScholarMate research social network
   (www.scholarmate.com), which is a professional research social network
   that connects people to research with the aim of ``innovating
   smarter{''} and was launched in 2007.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the Open Government (Parliament) initiatives and notions of a
   `democratic parliament', the relationship between legislatures and
   citizens remains seriously under-researched. This article introduces a
   comprehensive analytical framework, combining the normative principles
   of visibility, accessibility, and permeability with practical indicators
   (parliament as public space, sharing of information, contact with MPs,
   media and digital engagement, transparency of legislative process, and
   actual participation in legislative decision-making) for assessing the
   public engagement of parliaments. Applying this framework to the Finnish
   Eduskunta, the authors show that despite recent reforms that have
   partially `opened up' parliamentary proceedings and attempted to connect
   citizens to democratic process, there remains scope for reforms and
   innovations. The Eduskunta should embrace a more positive approach
   towards new forms of civic participation, particularly regarding how its
   influential committees operate. The findings reflect the tensions
   between, or the difficulties in reconciling, traditional forms of
   representative democracy with alternative and more direct channels of
   political participation.}},

Abstract = {{The article looks at the literature as relates to technology-driven
   shifts in employment with a specific emphasis on digital technologies.
   The article looks at both the arguments for a positive outcome and for a
   negative outcome.
   The article concludes that there are probably more jobs going to be
   created than is presented in popular media but that this will be taking
   place simultaneously with a sharp polarisation of the work-force and an
   increased uneven global distribution of the jobs created.
   The key contribution of this paper is that whether the future becomes
   one of job scarcity and precariasation or one of job abundance and
   multi-dimensional wealth (economic, environmental, quality of life)
   cannot be left to the market but is instead a function of the
   socio-political choices we and our policy-makers make.}},

Abstract = {{Information, as a science, is regarded as one of the four major sciences
   (life science, material science, information science and Environmental
   Science) in the world. Combining with the characteristics of information
   technology, this paper considers the current situation of sports science
   development, and discusses the development model of sports on the road
   of being used. From 3 aspects (perceptual to rational, irregular to
   rule, shallow to deep), this paper discusses the optimization of sports
   by information technology. The eventual aim is to address competitive
   sports, guide mass sports, practice school physical education and expand
   the sports industry by creating unique means of information technology

Abstract = {{Program guidance and task driven are the teaching methods that are based
   on cognitive learning theory, constructive learning theory and action
   learning theory, which have a positive effect on the cultivation of
   innovative consciousness, engineering application consciousness and the
   habit of autonomous learning. To solve the problem of the boring
   teaching process, the learning difficulty process and the lack of the
   students' application ability in the course of `digital signal
   processing' which is the electronic information related professional
   courses, this paper integrates these two methods, combining the
   engineering program `the analysis of the vibration signal for rotated
   machine' with the reasonable task design to apply to the course
   teaching. On these processes, it is based on the research project to
   guide to cultivate the ability to solve engineering problems by using
   the theory, principle and method of digital signal processing, and it is
   based on multiple tasks of reasonable division and design to drive to
   cultivate innovative consciousness and exercise the ability to solve the
   problems so that it can promote to forming the research learning
   quality. Through practice, curriculum teaching mode which is based on
   program guidance and multitask driven achieved good results, improved
   the teaching quality of the course `digital signal processing', which
   played a positive role in cultivating practical personnel and the
   research talents in the relevant professional.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of an exploratory multiple-case qualitative longitudinal
   study in the fashion industry, this article describes how digital
   technologies enabled choices among different types of supply chain
   governance. In doing so, this study responds to calls for
   governance-oriented longitudinal explorations and suggests an
   alternative path of governance choices in which the digital technologies
   become the platform that allows a dynamic discourse between outsourcer
   and outsourcee. Our results show that, when firms decide to leverage
   their performances through the adoption of information technology, they
   need to define their knowledge transfer capacities in order to adopt the
   appropriate type of governance model. With this article, we contribute
   to the global value chain literature adding to the knowledge transfer
   dimension.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing digital transformation on industry has so far mostly been
   studied from the perspective of cyber-physical systems solutions as
   drivers of change. In this paper, we turn the focus to the changes in
   data management resulting from the introduction of new digital
   technologies in industry. So far, data processing activities in
   operations management have usually been organised according to the
   existing business structures inside and in-between companies. With
   increasing importance of Big Data in the context of the digital
   transformation, the opposite will be the case: business structures will
   evolve based on the potential to develop value streams offered on the
   basis of new data processing solutions. Based on a review of the extant
   literature, we identify the general different fields of action for
   operations management related to data processing. In particular, we
   explore the impact of Big Data on industrial operations and its
   organisational implications.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses contract theory to analyse the relationship between open
   collaborative innovation strategies and digital platforms. We argue that
   a collaborative mechanism and governance of the platform affect how
   operations are run and impact firm ambidexterity. We also explain how
   the twofold revealing strategy, both selective and free occurs via the
   platform and how governance positively impacts the coordination
   mechanism. A case study analysis on TIM OPEN draws a ground-breaking
   framework for future investigations. The analysis suggests that the
   combination of digital platform and collaborative innovation can
   facilitate the creative process and be a driver of operational
   synergies. Results confirm that the adoption of digital platforms for
   collaborative innovations reduces transaction costs.}},

Abstract = {{By underlining the relevance of the use of ICTs, knowledge sharing and
   electronic markets for SMEs, it emerges the need for stimulating a
   debate on digitisation process of supply chain management (SCM).
   Electronic infrastructure in the service sector are reducing each kind
   of cost and improving multiply buyer-supplier relationships,
   facilitating negotiations and transactions. However, since the
   coordination costs are still high, the use of ICTs is limited. This
   phenomenon thus attracts the interests of scholars and practitioners.
   Although it still needs to further investigate. Especially, the optimal
   use of ICTs within SMEs' SCM have not been studied yet. Therefore, by
   leveraging on four proxies: ICTs specialised human resources, knowledge
   sharing activities, buyer-supplier relationships, adoption of electronic
   markets this optimal was analysed via structural equation modelling
   based on a sample of 1254 SMEs operating in the service sector in Italy.}},

Abstract = {{By clicks, likes, tweets, photos, blog posts, online transactions, we (
   people and businesses) allow for creating Big Data. Our digital traces
   tell the story about our professions, preferences, choices,
   transactions, traveling, habits etc. They permit to get information
   about who we are and what we do as individuals and organisations. This
   process is associated with a threat but also an opportunity for the
   social and economic development. The key question is how to ensure that
   the data we create continue to improve our lives, innovation, and
   sustainable development. A majority of Big Data is no longer housed in
   statistical agencies, but housed by businesses including Online Services
   Providers ( OSPs). We state that regulators should consider this data as
   a public good and build the platforms for public and private
   partnerships to ensure advantage of digital technology, improved
   connectivity, and data revolution.}},

   examines the relationships, points of inspirations and contradictory
   dynamics that characterize the current epoch of social movement politics

   neoliberal capitalism and the explosion of new technologies, a shared
   logic of social movement politics has emerged. This logic spans from the
   Zapatistas and the Global Justice Movement to the uprisings in North
   Africa and the Middle East, the Occupy struggles and the most recent
   wave characterized by Podemos. While each of these waves of contention
   has a particular character, together they make up a broader epoch of
   struggle that thrives on multiplicity, emphasized radical participatory
   democracy, the innovative use of media and the heterogeneity of

Abstract = {{Purpose - The Regional Government of Madeira has developed a
   re-qualification plan for the tourism sector to guide implementation of
   the recently launched tourism strategy for the destination.
   Design/methodology/approach - The plan identifies the areas for
   intervention and the respective measures and actions to implement.
   Findings - Human relations, resource management and training are among
   the main components that contribute to the success of a tourism value
   chain. It is also true that innovation and modernization in all aspects
   of energy efficiency, the digital economy, the environment and
   internationalization, should be a priority.
   Originality/value - Any experience that stands because it is authentic
   is likely to attract tourists and affirm the destination. The
   implication is that it is essential that destinations know how to assert
   its uniqueness locally, via a strategy for innovation and creativity,
   without losing sight of its history and its essence.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the past centuries, the enlightenment concept of progress has
   ended an optimism as to the future of the Human species: the belief that
   the advances of science, technique and reason would not only improve the
   objective conditions of mens lives, but it would also respond to the
   aspirations for subjective well-being, happiness and emancipation.
   Currently, a time is lived in which the digital world has reached
   exponential levels of growth, producing a compression of time and space
   which enables labor automation and the accomplishment of human tasks in
   a simultaneous and borderless ways. However, the ``technological
   progress{''} has not been converted into ``humanitarian progress{''}
   (MARCUSE, 1980). In this context, this paper proposes a reflection about
   the new temporalities in the digital culture context through a critical
   theory perspective, questioning the current experience of time
   acceleration in individuals' life pace and its implications to
   emancipation. It also privileges a reflection about the repercussions of
   current psychosocial free time regulation as a form of social domination
   from two perspectives: the consumerism culture which has transformed
   free time into a fetishized consuming object integrating it to the labor
   production logic and the development of miniaturized digital
   technologies converted in human prosthetics that transform men into a
   receptacle without mediations from all social, economic and cultural
   demands. Considering that the facilities conquered with the
   technological resources should subsidize individuals emancipation and
   free them from labor, the current paradox between continuous
   technological innovation and the frequent scarcity of TIME UNDER THE
   ENTREPRENEURSHIP NEOLIBERAL IDEOLOGY IS QUESTIONED.}},

Abstract = {{This article revisits concepts and authors that deal with contemporary
   transformations promoted by ICT and new media convergence prospects in
   education. Observing the contemporary communication processes by authors
   of cyberculture, seeks to indicate concepts that point to new trends in
   education that are emerging, including the hybrid school. New
   communication technologies associated with innovative educational
   practices have allowed the development of digital platforms widely used
   by teaching institutions for courses in various educational levels. They
   allow interaction between teacher, student and content mediated tools
   and processes that have transformed the traditional teaching and
   learning practices. In addition, the innovations arising from this new
   contemporary scenario have developed and improved multiple
   intelligences, resulting into a new cognitive ecology that shapes the
   human and artificial intelligences. This requires an educational system
   that is committed to the learning environment of the 21st century -
   characterized by multiplicity of places (be they virtual and physical),
   ideas, people and professional profiles that are more interdisciplinary,
   plural, and adapted to technologies.}},

Title = {{The Canadian Copyright Story How Canada Improbably Became the World
   Leader on Users' Rights in Copyright Law}},

Pages = {{169-205}},
Abstract = {{Given the long history of copyright reform battles in Canada that date
   back to the 1880s, there was little reason to think that when the
   Canadian government launched a public consultation on digital copyright
   issues in the spring of 2001 that the effort would mark the beginning of
   a dramatic shift in approach in which thousands of people would become
   politically engaged in copyright policy and pressure the government to
   rethink how it struck the copyright balance. Yet a decade of public
   debate culminated in copyright reforms that were among the most
   user-friendly in the world, emphasizing user rights and featuring an
   expansion of fair dealing, a host of new consumer exceptions, innovative
   new technology focused exceptions, limitations on liability for
   noncommercial infringement, and notable safeguards for user privacy in
   Internet service provider liability rules.
   This paper explores the stunning evolution of Canadian copyright law,
   highlighting how technology, the Internet, and a growing awareness of
   the wider implications of copyright policy for education, commerce,
   creativity, and everyday consumer uses sparked a users' rights movement
   that helped shape copyright policy long before the better-known digital
   rights successes involving SOPA/PIPA in the United States and the
   Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Europe. The Canadian copyright
   story demonstrates how individuals were able to leverage social media
   and a strong scholarly foundation to not only stop legislative
   proposals, but to proactively forge a positive copyright agenda that
   placed users at the center of policy development.}},

Abstract = {{The ``designated exceptions{''} approach in the European Union and
   elsewhere becomes obsolete when faced with the needs of digital science
   to scrutinize and analyze all relevant research results pertinent to any
   scientific inquiry. Even the fair use exception rooted in U.S. law,
   while more agile on a case by case approach, is challenged by the
   scientific communities' need to reproduce and analyze all available
   material relevant to any given research project and by the ability of
   automated knowledge discovery tools to do just that. A more promising
   model for reform is the ``some rights reserved{''} concept of private
   ordering that has recently afforded scholars and scientists alternative
   standard deals that better serve both their private interests and those
   of the public at large. This article explores the possibility of
   legislatively encouraging authors and artists in general to consider a
   more nuanced set of standard legal options than the one size fits all
   model inherited from the eighteenth century.}},

Abstract = {{Conducting research with children and youth has become increasingly
   challenging in recent years. At times these difficulties come in the
   form of restrictions by Institutional Review Boards, funding agencies,
   and parents. Additionally, changes in youth culture and behavior,
   specifically regarding online activities and digitally mediated
   communications, impact the access that researchers have to children and
   youth communities in significant ways. In this chapter, I propose that
   the use of an emerging methodological technique, digital ethnography,
   may provide researchers with new data sources on children and youth
   culture. Digital ethnography combines ethnographic techniques of
   observation, participation, and interview with content analysis to
   collect rich data about online behavior, norms, expectations, and
   interactions. This technique not only provides researchers with sources
   of data that allow insight into youth culture by acknowledging the
   increasing importance of online and digital interactions in youth
   culture but may also address some of the concerns raised by IRBs and
   other interested parties about conducting research with children and
   teens. This chapter provides practical and ethical considerations of
   this method, as well as a discussion of limitations of data collection
   and access as it highlights new ways of studying youth culture, using
   emerging data collection techniques in innovative research projects.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the debates on participatory methods and drawing from
   research on ``digital childhoods{''} in Portugal, this chapter aims to
   address the methodological innovations and challenges in collecting
   visual and digital data with children at their homes. As one of the
   stages of a research project on internet use, children were asked to
   take photos of their favorite objects at home and to collect screenshots
   of their most used webpages, followed by a conversation with the
   researcher. The use of photography allowed children greater expression
   and autonomy and gave researchers access to the children's own
   perspectives on their home environment. It also provided unique
   information about the arrangement of digital objects at home and their
   different appropriations by girls and boys. Screenshots showed creative
   uses of the internet by children and gender differences. Ethical
   concerns were raised, due to the specific nature of working with
   children and with visual material (anonymization and dissemination).
   Entering the domestic setting provided a privileged access to children's
   private sphere and to the in situ observation of their use of
   technology. However, the home is not a neutral place for a researcher
   and crossing the border into the private domain involves risks. These
   findings, illustrated by empirical examples from the research field,
   stress the importance of reflecting on and discussing the potentials,
   limitations, and ethical considerations of different methodologies, as
   well as their suitability to specific research objects, subjects, and
   contexts.}},

Abstract = {{We are witnessing a need for a quick and intelligent reaction from
   organizations to the level and speed of change in business processes.
   New information technologies and systems (IT/IS) are challenging
   business models and products. One of the great shakes comes from the
   online and/or mobile apps and platforms. These are having a tremendous
   impact in launching innovative and competitive services through the
   combination of digital and physical features. This leads to actively
   rethink enterprise information systems' portfolio, its management and
   suitability. One relevant way for enterprises to manage their IT/IS in
   order to cope with those challenges is enterprise and process
   architecture. A decision-making culture based on processes helps to
   understand and define the different elements that shape an organization
   and how those elements inter-relate inside and outside it. IT/IS
   portfolio management requires an increasing need of modeling data and
   process flows for better discerning and acting at its selection and
   alignment with business goals. The new generation of enterprise
   architecture (NGEA) helps to design intelligent processes that answer

Abstract = {{This article seeks to demonstrate the impact three economic concepts
   that gained traction in the last decades of neoliberalism - experience,
   attention and ubiquity - have caused in the current role of digital arts
   and artists in society, both on and off-line, as well as how they have
   changed the arts ecosystem, namely by altering the relationships between
   artists, audience, curating, public spaces - material and virtual,
   academia and companies. It addresses the commoditisation of creativity
   and innovation, which are now organised and consumed like products. It
   also offers insights on how the concept of art ownership has been
   replaced by experience, how mass-individualization of the selfie
   generation artists in a globally aestheticised and exposure-addicted
   world has contributed to the dismantling of community and association
   mind-sets and how the architecture of participation, presented as a
   vector of globalisation, inclusion, and democratisation of access to
   creation and enjoyment, actually revealed itself as a vector of
   inequality. It concludes by showing how hacktivism and artivism rise as
   new vanguards in an environment that is written and reads itself,
   bridging materiality and virtuality, in a multiplicity of blended
   spaces.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative method of tool wear assessment, based on the digitization
   of the cutting tool performed by a piezoelectric 3D scanner and on the
   analysis of the surfaces of a 3D model generated using the Reverse
   Engineering technique, has been developed. To this purpose, face milling
   experiments were carried out under dry cutting condition on AISI 420 B
   stainless steel using inserts in cemented carbide, with a two-layers
   coating (TiN and TiAlN). The time dependence of the insert wear was
   analysed by interrupting milling at predetermined time values. The
   proposed approach has been validated by comparing the output provided by
   the reverse engineering method to that measured experimentally by
   analysing the worn insert images obtained using a stereo microscope. An
   excellent agreement between the results given by the two different
   methodologies has been found. The worn tools have also been analysed
   using the scanning electron microscopy technique in order to understand
   the wear mechanisms operating during dry milling. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This chapter focuses on co-creation as a key business model for Bespoke
   and Semi-Bespoke menswear tailoring and women's swimwear brands that use
   innovative concepts and processes to create premium products for a
   younger and more demanding consumer segment. The Millennials, Generation
   Z and Generation C all like to co-create products for their own
   body-shape fit and product design preferences. The discussion commences
   with a review of key texts on digital fashion technology and practices
   enabling `co-creation' strategies. The research methodology is mixed
   method including consumer questionnaires, online survey observation with
   analysis of companies utilizing new digital practices to meet consumer's
   demands. The latest developments in digital fashion scanning, sizing,
   product design and customization of new and existing ranges will
   evidence how co-creation strategies can brand-stretch and add value
   creation. Includes best practice process steps for visualization,
   professional style advice and co-creator recommendations via the
   e-commerce website or social media.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter aims to address the need for a deeper understanding of the
   issues and challenges facing fashion retailers in our current digital
   climate. This will be explored through the lens of the happiness
   construct, as we examine fashion consumption and the role of
   experiential and atmospheric techniques in facilitating happy fashion
   retail consumer experiences. This chapter takes a conceptual,
   exploratory approach by interrogating literature on the happiness
   construct; experiential retail, atmospherics and flagships in the
   pursuit of understanding how these concepts enhance happy shopping
   experiences in physical and virtual environments. It will identify the
   multi-sensory techniques that retailers are employing to enhance the
   user's experience and ultimately, their state of happiness. The adoption
   of a consumer psychological approach to explore the notion of happiness
   within fashion retail experiences is a first within the fashion and
   consumption domain. Examples are used throughout the chapter, as
   illustrations of innovative and novel retail approaches that exemplify
   the application of happy, immersive fashion strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The various digital interactions and contributions, which can be grouped
   under the umbrella term User Generated Content (UGC), can take the form
   of product reviews, blogs, demonstration of product usage or even
   ``homemade advertising{''} (Berthon, Pitt, \& Campbell, 2008; Fader \&
   Winer, 2012). While current studies on UGC have mainly focused on the
   motivations that drive consumers to engage and contribute in various
   forms online, this research aims to explore how are organisations
   operating within the fashion industry are listening to, and taking
   advantage of, the various consumers contributions defined as UGC in
   order to innovate and create value for customers and other stakeholders.
   The findings of the semi-structured interviews conducted show that
   managers are still struggling in balancing the level of control and in
   managing a new generation of empowered consumers (Pires, Stanton, \&
   Rita, 2006). Social media and UGC call for a more strategic approach by
   organisations wishing to succeed. The relationship between UGC and
   co-innovation was also identified.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The present paper analyzes the implementation of Open Digital
   Television (Television Digital Abierta or TDA) in Argentina. It takes up
   a sociotechnical standpoint and considers TDA as a public policy
   designed to foster social inclusion.
   Methodology/approach - The ideas presented in this paper are derived
   from a sociotechnical perspective, both at a theoretical and at a
   methodological level. The main postulates of this perspective are based
   on constructivist criteria; they explain outcomes as a result of the
   constant interplay of technical and social realities. Thus, this
   relation is intrinsic and continuous. We work with the concept of
   technology in its broadest sense. That is to say, TDA is not seen as
   just a mass communication infrastructure, but as a technology which
   involves knowledge, production practices, and content broadcasting, as a
   result of the interrelation of cultural, political, social, economic,
   scientific, and technological factors. The study of TDA in Argentina as
   a public policy for social inclusion shows how the constant
   sociotechnical interrelations have to be taken into account (technical
   standard, antenna features, social actors involved, produced content,
   etc.) throughout the whole process, from the conception and design of
   public policies to their implementation, but mainly at the stage of
   results analysis.
   Findings - We concluded that throughout the implementation of the TDA
   public policy, a determinist view of technology prevailed. This can be
   seen in relation to both the role of television as a medium for social
   inclusion and the actions regarding the role of the user. The idea of
   viewer in the traditional sense prevailed over the idea of an active
   user. This stage provides significant data to assess the range and the
   limitations of the current public policy, and to think of improvements
   to implement in the future. These observations suggest a new challenge
   lying on the horizon: to construct a new concept of television; that is,
   to analyze TV as a social actor that is crucial for social inclusion
   rather than simply a medium of mass communication.
   Practical implications - The sociotechnical perspective sheds light on
   the actors involved in the development, implementation, and production
   of a public policy designed for social inclusion. It focuses both on the
   government plan and the usage practices of the users themselves. The
   approach we propose for the study of the relation between technology and
   public policy is consistent with the notion of an active government.
   Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in its theoretical and
   methodological approach, since a sociotechnical analysis grounded on
   relativism is a different view to the one that is dominant in studies in
   the field of communication and public policies. This view offers
   innovative insights into the problems regarding TDA by exploring the
   interrelations between actors and the power relations embedded in the
   public policy.}},

Abstract = {{The ancient Chinese flat gong, the chao gong or tam-tam has been used by
   twentieth-century composers including Messiaen, Stockhausen, Tenney, and
   Luther Adams. What is it about this instrument that has attracted
   Western composers? I have always been drawn to the gongs and singing
   bowls that are still hand made in small factories and workshops in
   China, Nepal, and throughout South East Asia using centuries old
   formulas and techniques. I present here my research into the unique
   resonant and harmonic characteristics of these instruments and discuss
   their central role in many of my recent compositions, while exploring
   Ton de Leeuw's notion that genuine innovation in music can no longer be
   based primarily on aesthetic and/or technical principles, but must be of
   a spiritual nature in the broad sense of the word, as the only possible
   counterpart to our materialistically oriented society' ({[}2005]. Music

Abstract = {{Digital transformation in the public sector is an inevitable requirement
   for governments due to the growing complexity and interconnections of
   information systems, and to the demands of citizens, who are becoming
   better informed and are increasingly looking to more agile and
   innovative services. However, despite the willingness of many
   governments and public institutions, the results do not always tally
   with the original objectives. In the case of public procurement in
   Portugal, it could be said that digital transformation experience had an
   unexpected success in the European context, through a business model
   that is still quite unique in Europe. This result is much owed to the
   strong political determination, the experience gained from pilot
   projects, and to the involvement of many stakeholders, who contributed,
   in a consistent and innovative way, to the definition of the system. The
   system is not perfect: there are many challenges that need to be
   addressed in the coming years. Yet, it has enabled the Portuguese public
   administration to significantly grow in the digital era, so that today
   the State has a database containing structure information about public
   procurement, which is a unique case in many countries.}},

Abstract = {{Digitalization can be regarded as a megatrend which results that both
   brand building and brand management must adapt to new challenges. The
   growing role of digitizing points to both challenges and risks, as well
   as to opportunities. This chapter conceptualizes digitizing as a
   resource for brand development with the help of two tourism
   destinations. It focuses on the role Web-based platforms play in
   destination brand development, using the examples of two seemingly
   nearly similar Christmas tourism destinations as case studies: Santa
   Claus, Indiana, and Santa Claus Village, Rovaniemi. The chapter
   highlights the contribution of a customer-oriented digitalization to
   creating a competitive advantage, even a sustainable one, for tourism
   destinations with theoretical connections to a resource-based view (RBV)
   and discusses its potential for incremental and radical innovative brand
   development processes.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Communication and Signal Processing have become areas of
   flourishing research and innovation. Mathematical Modeling and
   Computational Simulations emerge as powerful ways to describe, analyze
   and control situations, solve problems and then interpret the results.
   The aim of this paper is to analyze the optimal sensing time made by
   cognitive radio secondary users during cooperative spectrum sensing in
   the Distributed Spectrum Utilization. The optimal time made by each
   cognitive radio user participating in cooperative spectrum sensing is
   modelled as a stochastic differential equation. The combination of all
   these sensing of the spectrum leads to a system of stochastic
   differential equations which is solved using a Runge-Kutta method.
   Computational simulations are provided to show that the total spectrum
   sensing time made by cognitive radios in the cooperative spectrum
   sensing is less than the total time they made in the spectrum sensing
   without cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{FinTech, the phenomenon which spans over the areas of information
   technologies and financial innovation, is currently on the rise and is
   gaining more and more attention from practitioners, investors and
   researchers. FinTech is broadly discussed by the media, which
   constitutes its understanding and represents social opinion, however,
   this perception of FinTech should be supported by empirical evidences.
   Therefore, we examine five Swiss FinTech companies through the lens of
   the conceptual framework of understanding of FinTech and its dimensions
   and, by doing so, analyze the nature of FinTech innovations. Thereby, we
   extend the understanding of FinTech and provide a fruitful soil for
   further research in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Digital and mobile device technology in healthcare is a
   growing market. The introduction of the endoscope-i, the world's first
   endoscopic mobile imaging system, allows the acquisition of high
   definition images of the ear, nose and throat (ENT). The system combines
   the e-i Pro camera app with a bespoke engineered endoscope-i adaptor
   which fits securely onto the iPhone or iPod touch. Endoscopic
   examination forms a salient aspect of the ENT work-up. The endoscope-i
   therefore provides a mobile and compact alternative to the existing
   bulky endoscopic systems currently in use which often restrict the
   clinician to the clinic setting.Areas covered: This article gives a
   detailed overview of the endoscope-i system together with its
   applications. A review and comparison of alternative devices on the
   market offering smartphone adapted endoscopic viewing systems is also
   presented.Expert commentary: The endoscope-i fulfils unmet needs by
   providing a compact, highly portable, simple to use endoscopic viewing
   system which is cost-effective and which makes use of smartphone
   technology most clinicians have in their pocket. The system allows
   real-time feedback to the patient and has the potential to transform the
   way that healthcare is delivered in ENT as well as having applications
   further afield.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - To provide an in-depth survey and review of innovation in
   library and information services (LIS) and to identify future trends in
   innovative research and its practical application in the field.
   Methodology/approach - An in-depth review and summation of relevant
   literature over the last twenty years, along with an analysis and
   summary of the other papers in the volume.
   Findings - Innovation in library and information work varies between the
   evolutionary and the discontinuous. A taxonomy of innovatory approaches
   to development and provision in the sector is provided, along with a
   detailed listing of the key elements of successful and not-so-successful
   innovative practice.
   Research limitations/implications - The work is dependent on existing
   literature rather than direct empirical work. However, because it draws
   together all major aspects of the topic, it has the potential to be used
   as a springboard for further generic studies and also specific
   programmes of work.
   Practical implications - The need for innovation in LIS will be ever
   more pressing. The present chapter provides a necessary and rigorous
   overview of the necessary elements required for success in this area. It
   will be useful as a reference tool for intending researchers in library
   and information provision in a wide range of environments.
   Originality/value - Because the chapter brings together a substantial
   body of information on the topic of innovation, it provides a
   comprehensive study of major developments and likely future trends in
   the field.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - To investigate how the United Kingdom's public museums,
   libraries and archives (collecting institutions) might, in the future,
   take strategic advantage of the dramatic changes in individual and
   social behaviours and expectations driven by the socio-technical
   determinism of the Internet since 2000.
   Methodology/approach - The chapter summarises the evidence and outcomes
   of PhD research completed in 2015 that used the tools of hermeneutic
   phenomenology and systems theory to examine the current state of digital
   strategy within the United Kingdom's collecting institutions and to
   compare this with the Internet's fundamental drivers of change and
   innovation. The research sought not to predict the future, but to define
   the key opportunities and challenges facing collecting institutions in
   face of sustained socio-technical change to maintain strategic fit,
   delivering maximum value in the digital space.
   Findings - The outcomes of the research demonstrated that libraries,
   like museums and archives, are ill-prepared to face continued
   socio-technical determinism. The key drivers of the Internet are single
   channel convergence, rapid innovation, instant two-way communication
   driving social interaction and dramatic change in the relationship
   between the supplier and the user. Collecting institutions, on the other
   hand, operate within vertically integrated silos restricting horizontal
   collaboration that has led to fragmentation of developments and
   constraints on strategy across and within the various institutional
   sectors. The major challenges that libraries must consider are
   summarised.
   Originality/value - The research takes an approach that has never before
   been attempted, either in scope or depth of analysis. The conclusions
   may not make comfortable reading for practitioners, but they offer an
   agenda for new ways of thinking about how public institutions must
   change to sustain their strategic fit in a digital future.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive innovation has shaped and transformed our cognitive capacities
   throughout history. Until recently, cognitive innovation has not
   received much attention by empirical and conceptual research in the
   cognitive sciences. This paper is a first attempt to help close this
   gap. It will be argued that cognitive innovation is best understood in
   connection with cumulative cultural evolution and enculturation.
   Cumulative cultural evolution plays a vital role for the
   inter-generational transmission of the products of cognitive innovation.
   Furthermore, there are at least two important functions of enculturation
   for cognitive innovation. First, enculturation is responsible for the
   ontogenetic acquisition of cognitive practices governing the interaction
   with innovative products. Second, successful processes of enculturation
   provide opportunities for subsequent innovative processes. The
   trans-generational trajectory of calculation from mathematical symbol
   systems to the first digital computers will serve as a paradigm example
   of the delicate interplay of cognitive innovation, cumulative cultural
   evolution, and enculturation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Although the digital era has given rise to major
   transformations in many industries, health care has been remarkably
   resistant to radical innovations coming outside the field. The purpose
   of this paper is to explore and explain how new ventures aim to break
   institutional arrangements (i.e. regulations, normative rules, and
   cultural-cognitive beliefs) protecting the field by introducing
   digitally enabled service innovations into health care markets.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is qualitative and
   interpretative in nature and utilizes case study as a research strategy.
   The paper is based on data that were collected through narrative
   interviews and document analysis from seven new ventures participating
   in a start-up accelerator program.
   Findings - Results indicate that service innovations that require a
   change in the institutional structures of the health care system are
   enacted through three highly iterative key processes: institutional
   sensemaking that creates an understanding of prevailing institutional
   arrangements and that constructs meaning for institutional change
   efforts, theorization of change through linguistic device, and
   modifications of institutions by building legitimacy and mobilizing
   external constituencies.
   Practical implications - The findings provide practical insights into
   how new ventures struggle, navigate, and negotiate on specific
   alternatives related to institutional change while pursuing the
   introduction of innovations to market.
   Originality/value - This research extends the institutional perspective
   on service innovation by zooming into micro-level processes of
   institutional change driven by new ventures. The study develops the
   theory of institutional entrepreneurship by highlighting cognitive
   processes of change, and suggests incorporating ``institutional
   thinking{''} more tightly into the study and management of service
   innovation.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing technological advancements, manufacturing intelligence
   has become a crucial issue for maintaining competitive advantages.
   Industry 4.0, proposed by Germany, is one of the large-scale projects to
   achieve manufacturing intelligence and smart production. Others include
   the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership 2.0 (AMP2.0) from the United
   States, Industry 4.1J of Japan and Made in China 2025. On the other
   hand, most of the emerging countries may not be ready for the migration
   of Industry 4.0 directly since their industrial infrastructures are
   different with the leading countries. This study aims to propose
   Industry 3.5 as a hybrid strategy between existing Industry 3.0 and
   to-be Industry 4.0, in which digital decisionmaking, big data analytics,
   and manufacturing intelligence are integrated to empower smart
   production with disruptive innovations that can be realized in existing
   industrial infrastructure. To estimate the validity of the proposed
   Industry 3.5, an empirical study was conducted in a thin film transistor
   liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) manufacturing factory in Taiwan. A
   smart daily planning and scheduling (DPS) system is developed to enhance
   manufacturing intelligence for smart production without a fully
   automation facility as the Cyber-Physical System proposed in Industry
   4.0. This study concludes with discussions of development directions for
   industrial revolution.}},

Title = {{A Usability Evaluation of the Prototype Afrikaanse idiome-woordeboek}},
Journal = {{LEXIKOS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{78-106}},
Abstract = {{The Afrikaanse idiome-woordeboek is a prototype e-dictionary of
   Afrikaans fixed expressions developed with the intention to test the
   functionalities of the e-dictionary. This dictionary is based on the
   function theory of lexicography. The e-dictionary makes use of various
   technologies. When digital tools are developed it is important to
   consider the usability of the tool. Usability evaluation was done on the
   Afrikaanse idiome-woordeboek to determine with what success it can be
   used. Discount usability methods, viz. heuristic evaluation and
   usability testing were used. This article reports on the findings from
   the usability tests which are discussed under the categories of content,
   information architecture, navigation, access (searching and browsing),
   help, customisation and the use of innovative technologies to manage
   data in e-dictionaries for search and display. The usability evaluation
   showed that the users did not always use the e-dictionary as the
   designers intended. Various recommendations are made to the designers of
   the Afrikaanse idiome-woordeboek, as well as for the design of
   e-dictionaries in general. Recommendations appropriate to e-dictionaries
   in general are made regarding usability evaluation, information
   architecture, searching in e-dictionaries, the data that can be included
   in e-dictionaries and training of users of e-dictionaries.}},

Title = {{Promoting innovation and application of internet of things in academic
   and research information organizations}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{8-9}},
Pages = {{655-678}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of the study was to investigate factors promoting
   innovation and application of internet of things in academic and
   research information organizations.
   Design/methodology/approach - Quantitative research design involved
   survey of selected academic and research information organizations in
   public and private chartered institutions. Information professionals,
   digital content managers, information systems and technologists that
   normally consume big data and technological resources were involved in
   the process of data collection using structured questionnaire and
   content analysis. Information organizations and information
   practitioners were selected from public and private academic and
   research institutions.
   Findings - Innovation of internet of things has increasingly transformed
   and changed academic and research information organizations as the
   source of knowledge in addition to expanding access to education, data,
   information and communication anywhere anytime through hyperconnectivity
   and networking. Internet of things technologies such as mobile of
   things, web of things, digital information systems and personal devices
   are widely applied by digital natives in academic and research
   information organizations. Mobilization platform and devices is the
   single biggest provider of data, information and knowledge in academic
   and research organizations. Modern trends in education and knowledge
   practices in academic institutions and information organizations depends
   upon internet of things, digital repositories, electronic books and
   journals, social media interfaces, multimedia applications, information
   portal hubs and interactive websites, although challenges regarding
   inadequate information communication technology infrastructure and
   social computing facilities still persist.
   Research limitations/implications - Information organizations in public
   and private chartered academic and research institutions were adopted in
   the study. Respondents handling and supporting information management,
   planning and decision-making provided the necessary data. Information
   professionals, digital content managers, information systems and
   technologists are proactively involved in data and information
   analytics.
   Practical implications - Academic and research information organizations
   are powerhouses that provide knowledge to support research, teaching and
   learning for sustainable development and the betterment of humanity and
   society. Innovation of internet of things and associated technologies
   provides practical aspects of attaining sustainable information
   development practices in the contemporary knowledge society. Internet of
   things technologies, principles of economies of scale and investment and
   customer needs entail that information organizations and practitioners
   should provide appropriate and smart systems and solutions.
   Social implications - Modern academic and research information
   organizations have the social corporate responsibility to offer
   technological innovations to heighten access to knowledge and learning
   in academic and research institutions. Economically, innovation and
   application of internet of things provide unlimited access to big data
   and information in organizations all the time anywhere anytime.
   Originality/value - Data management is a growing phenomenon that
   information practitioners need to fully understand in the digital
   economies. Information professionals need to embrace and
   appreciateinnovation and application of internet of things technologies
   whose role in sustainable development practices is critical in academic
   and research organizations.}},

   the product, put forward the concept of product digital ecosystem and
   established the corresponding model, designed to draw lessons from
   ecological system, and apply the mechanism of self-organization and
   adaptive, when design demand change, product system can carry on the
   corresponding structural changes independently, implement the
   evolutionary design of the product, to meet the needs of people for the
   product function, improve efficiency, promote the development of product
   design. This article first has carried on the modeling of product
   digital ecosystem, defines the factors of the model such as individual,
   population, community and ecosystem in detail. At the same time,
   combining with the infectious disease model, the paper puts forward the
   evolution model of the ecological system complex network, and introduce
   products ecosystem evolution with specific instances of process. And,
   the concept of entropy is introduced into the product digital ecosystem,
   puts forward digital ecosystem evolutionary algorithm based on assembly
   relation network, implement product evolutionary design process
   independently. Finally, apply the theory of this article to engine
   products, and has obtained the expected effect.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling implementation of early detection and treatment of breast
   cancer is exigent as the disease is the most widespread type of cancer
   in the world. Mammography screening is one of the dominant technologies
   applied to achieve this purpose. It detects breast cancer through
   prevention route and symptomatic route.
   This research focuses on service innovation perspective in developed and
   developing countries, which are the cases of the United Kingdom and
   Indonesia respectively. The United Kingdom implements both prevention
   and symptomatic routes to control the disease, while Indonesia as this
   research was written implements the symptomatic route. Furthermore, it
   investigates the evolution of mammography service in both countries and
   how they comply with path dependency and lock-in theory.
   There are two significant roles of innovation discovered: process
   innovation in digital mammography and service innovation in mobile
   mammography. Service blueprinting is used as a framework to investigate
   the possible methods to improve the service as well as to determine the
   possible failure points in the two cases. Furthermore, this research
   found out that blueprint could be used as a quality mechanism. In
   addition, it is discovered that the difference in organization size from
   both cases produces a significant impact on the number of service
   actions delivered, such as Quality Assurance implementation, cultural
   barrier, and financial challenge. Although this research does not
   introduce a comprehensive assessment of mammography service in the UK
   and Indonesia, it offers empirical evidence which will enrich the study
   of mammography service.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental, economic and social changes of any significant
   proportions cannot take place without a major shift in the manufacturing
   sector. In today's manufacturing processes, economic efficiency is
   realised through high volumes with the use of specialised machine tools.
   Change in society, such as in the form of mobility and digitisation,
   requires a complete overhaul in terms of thinking in the manufacturing
   industry. Moreover, the manufacturing industry contributes over 19 \% to
   the world's greenhouse gas emissions. As a consequence of these issues,
   a demand for sustainable solutions in the production industry is
   increasing. In particular, the concept of ``cost{''} in manufacturing
   processes and thus the ``system boundaries{''} within the production of
   the future has to be changed. That is, a great number of aspects to the
   machine tool and production technology industries can be improved upon
   in order to achieve a more sustainable production environment. Within
   this chapter, the focus lies on microsystem technology enhanced modular
   machine tool frames, adaptive mechatronic components, as well as on
   internally-cooled cutting tools. An innovative machine tool concept has
   been developed recently, featuring a modular machine tool frame using
   microsystem technology for communication within the frame, which allows
   for a high level of flexibility. Furthermore, add-on upgrading systems
   for outdated machine tools-which are particularly relevant for
   developing and emerging countries-are poised to gain in importance in
   the upcoming years. The system described here enables the accuracy of
   outdated machine tools to be increased, thus making these machine tools
   comparable to modern machine tool systems. Finally, the cutting process
   requires solutions for dry machining, as the use of cooling lubricants
   is environmentally damaging and a significant cost contributor in
   machining processes. One such solution is the use of internally cooled
   cutting tools.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter covers a brief overview of the ancient trails of knowledge
   through the centers of learning. These trails have become genetic
   pathways for contemplation over many centuries in Kyoto, Japan; in
   Nalanda, India; in the Jewish kibotos in Apamea, Phrygia; and in Giza,
   Egypt. More recently (eighth to thirteenth centuries), astronomy,
   mathematics, and methodology have been introduced in shrines of learning
   for the disciples and inmates of these knowledge centers. These seeds of
   knowledge along the venues of meditation are still based on Aristotle's
   notions of universal truisms, beauty and virtue in the minds of saints,
   gurus, and clergy. In the distant past, these seeds germinated into full
   blossoms of wisdom through the generations that have followed. Knowledge
   is many times compared to pristine water in the clouds, rain, and
   streams, and wisdom is likened to dew drops in the gardens of Eden.
   Refined thought, art, and generosity blossomed together. Wisdom deeply
   founded in social justice and fairness evolved much slowly in the prior
   generations.
   The very recent pragmatism in sciences has started to demand immediate
   wealth and ready cash from knowledge. The pathways to progress have
   become optical fibers in the modern age of digital switches and
   information highways. Unfortunately, human reflection and refinement of
   notions have become subservient to the artificial wisdom of machines.
   The dramatic use of machines and their abuse have replaced the
   contemplations of the scholars of the past. Historical data bring home
   the ironic fact that hand-held PDAs (personal digital assistants) are
   becoming more affable than the spirituality laden scripture of the monks
   and gurus. Digits have become their beads; micro-programs have become
   their mantras; and keypads have become the sitars for the Internet-based
   transformed Vedic scholars. The monuments of technology have become
   barriers to the vision that unify the pursuit of science with human
   betterment. Marxist's concepts of scientific innovation are not slanted
   toward raw greed for power and wealth.
   The current uses of machines in the routine activities of individuals,
   societies, and communities are examined from the perspective of both
   progress and retreat of social change that machines can catalyze. Much
   as computers have hastened the financial swings in the stock market, the
   new wave of social machines is likely to hasten the social swings, as
   they are already evident by the Internet. Dishonest marketers and
   spammer quickly take most people into deception-lands. Both the positive
   and negative implications of the impending social machines are
   presented. The underlying object to direct the machines to social
   enhancement rather than its decay is emphasized in this part. As much as
   traditional computers have hastened the business and commercial
   activities in the modern societies, the well-primed social machines are
   poised to hasten the routine of peoples, both intellectually and
   culturally, and to enrich lives of the world community. Information and
   knowledge society has further hastened such cycles and accelerated the
   changes. The knowledge culture of this decade is no longer based on the
   social laws of the last decade!}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present article is to evaluate the factors which are
   considered to be important for the agribusiness development of a local
   economy, with data derived from the entrepreneurs' perspective. For this
   purpose, an appropriate methodology was designed, in order to include
   the most of the aforementioned factors. Emphasis was given to questions
   which can illustrate the level of technological innovation with actions
   and initiatives like digital marketing, innovative ability and others.
   Therefore, a questionnaire was created and was then applied to many
   regions in northern Greece. In respect of data analysis, the
   contribution of Correspondence Analysis (CA), a method from the
   multidimensional statistics field, was crucial because it easily
   revealed the characteristics that intensively differentiated themselves.
   The above methodologies and their special characteristics facilitated
   also the implementation of SWOT analysis. In the case of the Regional
   Units examined in the current research, the positive and negative
   factors-points were easily revealed and presented.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to measure the Arab States'
   innovation and imitation levels to understand the factors affecting
   their diffusion processes. The authors argue that sampling Arab States
   provides the literature on international diffusion with the ability to
   contrast between developing and developed countries regarding the
   diffusion process and to represent a different region with different
   characteristics both economic and cultural. As such, the authors
   investigated the diffusion patterns of seven Arab States, namely,
   Kuwait, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates,
   Lebanon, Iraq, Libya and Egypt.
   Design/methodology/approach - The present study mapped the respective
   Arab States' diffusion patterns by applying the Bass model on their
   mobile cellular subscriptions data.
   Findings - The paper's contributions include estimating the Arab States
   diffusion patterns and distinguishing them according to their innovation
   and imitation coefficients. Findings indicate Kuwait and Libya as the
   most innovative countries, whereas Egypt and Lebanon ranked as laggards.
   The present study also reviewed each Arab State's telecommunication
   sector which provided a theoretical interpretation for the differences
   found in their diffusion patterns.
   Originality/value - The paper extends diffusion theory to encompass a
   region otherwise excluded from the literature's generalizable findings.
   The present study's sampling of countries from the Middle East and North
   African region and subsequent findings provide a stronger basis to draw
   empirical generalizations about international product diffusion process
   than previously suggested by the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Video watermarking is relatively an innovative tool that has been
   proposed to solve the problem of illegal manipulation and sharing of
   digital video. It is the process of embedding copyright information into
   video watermarking. In this paper, artificial bee colony algorithm is
   utilised for finding the frame and location for embedding the grey-scale
   image into video watermarking and then searches a scene and location
   into which a particular part of watermarking is best to embed. The
   number of shot frames and locations is identified using ABC algorithm.
   Once the best frame and locations are identified, the embedding and
   extraction procedure is carried out. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm is analysed with the existing technique using PSNR and NC.
   This technique is tested against different attacks and the results
   obtained are encouraging.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explain how ecosystems and
   platforms have evolved to manage customer information and to identify
   the management, research and teaching implications of this evolution.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on research and
   industrial experience of two of the co-authors in customer relationship
   management, further developed with other co-authors in the field of
   business models, the research and teaching experience of the university
   authors and cross-functional literature reviews in the areas of
   strategy, marketing, economics, organizational behaviour and information
   management.
   Findings - This paper shows that digitalization, cloud computing and new
   information-based platforms are beginning to change how customer
   information is being managed, creating new opportunities for improving
   marketing, customer relationship management and business strategy.
   Research limitations/implications - The impact of platforms on the
   management of customer information needs to be confirmed by primary
   empirical research.
   Practical implications - This paper identifies the need for senior
   marketing management to examine closely how internal and external/public
   customer information platforms may enhance their capability for managing
   customers and setting new strategic directions.
   Social implications - The emergence of giant multi-sided platforms has
   clear implications for data protection and privacy, which need to be
   explored more in research.
   Originality/value - This paper highlights the move to customer
   information platforms and identifies how senior managers should consider
   them as an option for better customer information management and as a
   basis for new business strategies.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},

Abstract = {{The growing adoption of platforms such as Uber and Airbnb has
   contributed to the emergence of an access economy, which has disrupted a
   number of incumbent industries in the process. In this study, we examine
   goCatch, one of Australia's largest e-hailing and ride-sharing
   multi-sided platforms. From our investigations, we find that the
   technology affordances of multi-sided digital platforms can help to
   deliver new commercial services and offerings to consumers of the
   platform, which enables new forms of consumption and, subsequently,
   disrupts the incumbent industry. Our findings provide the empirical
   premise for a model that illustrates the role of technology in enabling
   consumer recognition, consumer engagement, and consumer transposition in
   the e-hailing context. For theory, we build on extant literature to
   identify the forms of motivational affordances leveraged in disruptive
   platforms and technologies. For practice, we conceptualize the function
   of technology-enabled gamification as an emergent strategy that one can
   use to induce consumers to change their behaviors, develop their
   technical skills and drive innovation that plays a central role in
   enabling digital disruption. This study also clarifies the relationship
   between technology affordances and value creation against the backdrop
   of the emergent access economy.}},

Abstract = {{With the demand for an increasing diversification of the product
   spectrum along with the decreasing unit quantities of each production
   lot, the upcoming innovative production concepts of a flexible and
   digitized production ({''}fourth industrial revolution{''}) tend to
   substitute more and more the traditional product development and
   production processes, which are already reaching their limits or fail to
   address these trends. At the same time, new technologies like additive
   manufacturing basically create new opportunities regarding extensive
   potentials in product development and manufacturing, but mostly with
   just insufficient strength regarding structural components. Therefore,
   this contribution presents an innovative technological and procedural
   conception of a hybrid additive manufacturing process fiber reinforced
   sandwich structures based on selective laser sintering technology. In
   this way, the concept supports the design of complex lightweight
   components, in particular through the application of a ``hybrid additive
   lightweight engineering{''} (HALE) methodology. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Journal = {{EUROPEAN INTEGRATION STUDIES}},
Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{160-172}},
Abstract = {{Decentralization, on one hand, brings more transparency and trust to the
   parties involved in transactions, but on the other hand, it narrows
   possibilities for central control. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
   is a recent decentralized innovation in the field of information and
   communication technology (ICT) that acts as self-sustainable ledger for
   documenting transactions self-protected against counterfeiting and
   hacker attacks. The aim of the current research paper is to reveal
   opportunities and barriers for utilization of distributed ledgers in the
   context of EU digital single market strategy. The main tasks are (1) to
   analyze functionality dynamics of existing distributed ledgers, (2) to
   analyze utilization areas of distributed ledgers, (3) to analyze digital
   trends related to utilization of distributed ledgers within the EU. The
   current research paper utilizes methods of content analysis, grounded
   theory, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and regression
   analysis. The research has revealed that half of EU Digital Single
   Market priorities can be facilitated through distributed ledgers.}},

Abstract = {{Educators, and business, and political leaders are increasingly
   recognizing that computing is a new basic skill necessary for economic
   opportunity and social mobility U.S. President Obama has announced a new
   initiative, ``Computer Science For All{''} to empower a generation of
   American students with the computer science skills they need to thrive
   in a digital economy (2016). Employers seek technical computer
   specialists who can write software and invent new applications, but
   American universities are only training enough students to fill about
   40\% of the projected 1.1 million technology and computing jobs expected
   by 2024 (National Center for Women and Information Technology, 2016).
   Moreover, a lack of gender parity within the U.S. technology industry
   has long been viewed as a critical problem, detracting from innovation
   and prosperity. Pursuit of information technology (IT) majors depends,
   to a great extent, on students' attitudes toward IT. This study
   developed an Attitude toward IT Scale with a gender subtext to measure
   certain attitudes toward IT, held by college students. The norm group
   consisted of mostly freshmen enrolled in 2011 (N = 373), at a large
   four-year public university in Illinois. Reliability and validity of the
   30-item Scale were examined by using Cronbach's alpha and a principal
   components factor analysis with orthogonal rotation using varimax with
   Kaiser normalization; the rotation converged in seven iterations.
   Results of data analyses showed that overall reliability is high (0.85),
   and factor analyses revealed five orthogonal factors with high
   coefficient alphas-factors that represented relevant attitude
   constructs. This Scale may be used by educators at the senior high
   school and college levels to evaluate the effectiveness of different
   teaching/learning strategies in promoting positive student attitudes
   toward IT, and in improving learning among students. The Scale is unique
   in that it includes attitudes toward gender equality of opportunity in
   IT.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the South Korean government is in the process of transforming
   school textbooks from a paper-based platform to a computer-based digital
   platform. Along with this effort, interactive online educational games
   (edu-games) have been examined as a potential component of the digital
   textbooks. Based on the theory of diffusion of innovations, this study
   examined how 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students perceive an interactive
   online edu-game and whether or not their communication attributes
   predict their willingness to diffuse the game. A hierarchical regression
   analysis revealed that four perceptions of the innovation - relevant
   advantage, complexity, compatibility, and observability - were
   statistically significant predictors of students' willingness to diffuse
   an online edu-game as indicated by the theory of diffusion of
   innovations, while only trialability was not. Based on these results,
   this study provides some implications for the diffusion of interactive
   online educational games as a potential component of the digital
   textbook.}},

Abstract = {{In the University it is necessary to establish a relationship between
   academic field and business. In the classroom the objective is to
   introduce technological advances, to coach students facing the
   professional challenges. The feedback between the Internet and
   television has led the industry sector to the creation of HbbTV
   relatively recent television standard that focuses on interactivity.
   This closer relationship with the user shines monetization options, of
   which the main beneficiary is the advertising sector, audiovisual and
   technological. In this research, we explain a methodology used to show
   the students the benefits of a new technology. The research methodology
   is quantitative and qualitative (triangulation). Some enterprises
   collaborate with the Research Group GRECC (URL), the Research Group on
   Digital Journalism, Marketing and Broadband (CECABLE, URL, UPF, Escola
   Universitaria Mediterrani of UdG, and UAB) and the Research Group on
   Innovative Monetization System of Digital Journalism, Marketing and
   Tourism (CECABLE, URL, UPF, Escola Universitaria Mediterrani of UdG, and
   UAB), to collect data in an introduction of HbbTV interactive
   advertising on tests. That formula tries to relate to the audience
   brings new business opportunities, especially in the advertising sector.
   In this study we analyzed the results of a synchronous series of
   interactive advertising campaigns conducted in 2016 by Henkel on a
   television channel in Spain. The campaigns were four different proposals
   in panels measuring CTR. It was supplied to the television a sample with
   four ads of a beauty product of Henkel. There were four skirts with
   various proposals, from which the viewer must click the yellow button
   (for a video) and/or green (legal notice). We observed the relevance of
   button legal notice, the relationship between the average video playback
   in seconds and the will to participate, the relationship between the
   probability of clicking on both yellow and green button, and between
   this fact and time average viewing the video, the balance between the
   various campaigns to promote viewer and click a quantity of viewings
   limit from which it is counterproductive that more impressions are
   created.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this document is to share information on the process of
   developing an innovative new course on navigating digital cultures. The
   design of the course is in direct response to salient issues in new and
   social media. The course is aimed primarily at undergraduate students
   with various cultural and linguistic backgrounds. One main purpose of
   the course is to encourage innovation in the classroom through
   consultation with primary and secondary sources of literature and to
   apply these to the three major areas of thematic focus in the course.
   The first such area concerns remix culture. Often discussed in terms of
   remixing music to make new forms, the application of remix culture to
   the course specifically explores it in terms of the manner by which new,
   creative works are produced. Namely, by incorporating elements of
   pre-existing material, either in terms of styles, characters, and genres
   expressed in film, literature, video games, etc. new material is
   produced through the process of remix. A second component of the course
   is viral media, which is understood as online content which usually
   achieves a vast number of views (in the case of videos on YouTube) or
   similar reactions (such as shares on Facebook or retweets on Twitter).
   The purpose of including viral media is for students to understand the
   characteristics of media that go viral but also to understand what
   factors may or may not lead to viral spread. The final component is
   largely connected to viral media but differs in terms of discursive
   intent. Internet memes are a genre of online communication whereby text
   and/or image (and also video, GIFs, and more) are remixed with aspects
   of popular culture to begin or continue a discussion and may also be
   used as a form of socio-cultural or political critique or protest.}},

Abstract = {{The high level of technology development and commercialization, while
   the instructional platform was not technologically prepared, has
   paradoxically impacted math education, resulting that math education has
   slipped backwards. Finding innovative solutions to escalating problems
   was a compromised position when realizing this work. Obtained results
   revealed a great provision to overcome the problem and the importance of
   curricula improvement in today digital revolution to stop its
   paradoxical effect. This investigation is a continuation of the
   previously developed with College Algebra students, but in this case,
   the investigation was directed to the business calculus students.
   Learning materials include computer software, smart apps, and a Business
   Calculus Notebook specially prepared for technologically featured class.
   In addition to traditional calculus topics, a group of challenging
   computer aided exercises were incorporated, including a group of
   unpublished before real business case examples, to stimulate learning of
   medium and high level mathematics using technology. Obtained results
   confirm the suitability of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a four-year project in the U.S., funded by the
   National Science Foundation, to design, develop, and evaluate Transition
   to College Mathematics and Statistics (TCMS), a high school senior-level
   course to help meet the diverse quantitative needs of students in a
   technological, information-laden, and data-driven global society whose
   intended undergraduate programs do not require calculus. For students
   intending to enroll in non-calculus-based undergraduate programs, many
   schools in the U.S. have little to offer as a transition to
   college-level mathematics and statistics other than precalculus or
   narrow Advanced Placement courses. Consequently, many students opt out
   of mathematics their senior year or study mathematics that is
   inappropriate for their undergraduate and career aspirations.
   TCMS focuses on broadly useful topics, including mathematical modeling,
   data analysis and inference, informatics, financial mathematics,
   decision-making under constraints, enumeration, and mathematical
   visualization and representations. Development and use of important
   mathematical habits of mind, including visual thinking, recursive
   thinking, reasoning abstractly, searching for and explaining patterns,
   making and checking conjectures, exploiting use of multiple
   representations and connections among them, providing convincing
   explanations and valid arguments and evaluating those of others, and a
   disposition toward strategic use of technological tools are integrated
   throughout the eight units comprising the course.
   Transition to College Mathematics and Statistics is a problem-based,
   inquiry-oriented, and technology-rich fourth-year high school
   mathematics course designed for students who have successfully completed
   a conventional single-subject sequence of algebra, geometry, and
   advanced algebra or a three-year unified (international-like)
   mathematics sequence. The course has been carefully field tested in a
   wide range of high schools with students using conventional mathematics
   curricula and with students using a unified mathematics program. Both
   print and interactive digital versions of the TCMS text have been
   developed.
   Key mathematical themes and content, innovative design features of the
   print and digital versions of the text, and the accompanying suite of
   curriculum-embedded software tools, including a spreadsheet, a computer
   algebra system (CAS), data analysis and discrete modeling tools, and
   dynamic geometry are described and illustrated. A summary of key
   evaluation findings regarding the use and efficacy of TCMS is discussed.
   In the case of classroom use of the interactive digital version, how
   students engaged with other students and the teacher while synchronously
   interacting with the accessibility features, open-ended problems linked
   to learner-controlled scaffolding, embedded audio and video clips,
   embedded mathematical and statistical software tools, and digital
   collaborative notebooks are highlighted.}},
