Abstract = {{Introduction and objective. Hearing disorders among school-age children
   are a current concern. Continuing studies have been performed in Poland
   since 2008, and on 2 December 2011 the EU Council adopted Conclusions on
   the Early Detection and Treatment of Communication Disorders in
   Children, Including the Use of e-Health Tools and innovative Solutions.
   The discussion now focuses not only on the efficacy of hearing screening
   programmes in schoolchildren, but what should be its general aim and
   what tests it should include? This paper makes the case that it is
   important to include central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) tests.
   One such test is the dichotic digits test (DDT). The aim of the
   presented study was to evaluate the usefulness of the DDT in detecting
   central hearing disorders in school-age children.
   Materials and methods. During hearing screening programmes conducted in
   Poland in 2008-2010, exactly 235,664 children (7-12-years-old) were
   screened in 9,325 schools. Of this number, 7,642 were examined using the
   DDT test for CAPD. Screening programmes were conducted using the Sense
   Examination Platform.
   Results. With the cut-off criterion set at the 5th percentile, results
   for the DDT applied in a divided attention mode were 11.4\% positive for
   7-year-olds and 11.3\% for 12-year-olds. In the focused attention mode,
   the comparable result for 12-year-olds was 9.7\%. There was a clear
   right ear advantage. In children with positive DDT results, a higher
   incidence of other disorders, such as dyslexia, was observed.
   Conclusions. A test for CAPD should be included in the hearing screening
   of school-age children. The results of this study form the basis for
   developing Polish standards in this area.}},

   factors and variables that condition and favor the use of digital mobile
   devices in university studies. The factor-based structure enabled a
   holistic view of ICT innovation in universities across three key areas:
   Teaching model (face-to-face/distance), area of study, and generic

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of the polyolefin
   type and the blow-up ratio (BUR) on the thermal physical properties of
   films produced in a blown film extrusion process. It was used low
   density polyethylene (LDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE)
   processed in a blown film extrusion line at three BUR of: 1.5:1; 2.5:1
   and 3.5:1. The results of physical characterization on these films
   demonstrated that the increase in the BUR shows a higher thickness
   variation in the perimeter of tubular films and, therefore, optical
   properties variation. The coefficient of friction (COF) of the films was
   smaller for HDPE and did not have significant variation with the
   increase in the BUR applied. Regarding mechanical properties, HDPE films
   showed higher tensile strength and lower strain values in the yield
   point, in both directions. The largest BUR showed higher similarity of
   the tensions and strains between the machine direction (MD) and
   transverse direction (TD). The ideal BUR observed for films processed
   with LDPE is 2.5:1, for HDPE this number is higher and close to 3.5:1.
   The HDPE films showed more opacities and less brightness when compared
   to LDPE films. The results prove well known values in the literature,
   however, there was an innovation introduced in this study which is the
   use of the portable digital thermo graphic technique that allows the
   instantaneous visualization (on-line) of the temperature variation in
   the bubble perimeter in the frost line (crystallization or
   solidification area of the film).}},

Title = {{Conceptualizing the integration of digital humanities in instructional
   services Possibilities to enhance digital literacy in the 21st century}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{134-142}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize how digital
   humanities (DH) projects can be integrated into instructional services
   programs in libraries. The paper draws on three digital projects from
   the New York Public Library (NYPL) and explores how librarians can
   creatively utilize these resources to teach new digital literacy skills
   such as data analysis and data management. For patrons, they can learn
   about the content of these crowd-sourcing projects as well. By
   integrating DH projects into library instruction, the possibilities and
   opportunities to expand and explore new research and teaching areas are
   timely and relevant.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach of this paper is to explore
   NYPL's three digital projects and underscore how they can be integrated
   into instructional services: ``What's On the Menu,{''} ``Direct Me
   NYC{''} and ``Map Warper{''} all offer strengths and limitations but
   they serve as paradigms to explore how digital resources can serve
   multipurpose use: they are databases, digital repositories and digital
   libraries but they can also serve as instructional service tools.
   Findings - The paper conceptualizes how three DH projects can serve as
   teaching opportunities for instructional services, particularly teaching
   digital literacy skills. By exploring the content of each digital
   project, the paper suggests that users can develop traditional
   information literacy skills but also digital literacy skills. In
   addition, as crowdsourcing projects, the Library also benefits from this
   engagement since users are adding transcriptions or rectified maps to
   the Library's site. Patrons develop visual literacy skills as well. The
   paper addresses how librarians can meet the needs of the scholarly
   community through these new digital resources. While the paper only
   addresses the possibilities of these integrations, these ideas can be
   considered and implemented in any library.
   Practical implications - The paper addresses positive outcomes with
   these digital resources to be used for library instructional services.
   Based on these projects, the paper recommends that DH projects can be
   integrated into such instructions to introduce new content and digital
   skills if appropriate. Although, there are limitations with these
   digital resources, it is possible to maximize their usage if they are
   used in a different and creative way. It is possible for DH projects to
   be more than just digital projects but to act as a tool of digital
   literacy instruction. Librarians must play a creative role to address
   this gap. However, another limitation is that librarians themselves are
   ``new{''} to these resources and may find it challenging to understand
   the importance of DH projects in scholarly research.
   Originality/value - This paper introduces DH projects produced in a
   public research library and explores how librarians can use these
   digital projects to teach patrons on how to analyze data, maps and other
   content to develop digital literacy skills. The paper conceptualizes the
   significant roles that these DH projects and librarians can play as
   critical mediators to introducing and fostering digital literacy in the
   twenty-first century. The paper can serve as an interest to academic and
   public libraries with large research collections and digital projects.
   By offering new innovative ideas of integrating DH into instructional
   services, the paper addresses how DH projects teaching tools can support
   specific digital skills such as visual literacy and data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the numerous benefits of digital scholarly
   communication made visible through institutional repositories (IRs) that
   have become trendy in institutions of higher learning in developed
   countries of the world. In line with its vision to be a leading centre
   of academic excellence in Africa and the world, the University of
   Botswana (UB) established its own IR known as the UB Research,
   Innovation and Scholarship Archive (UBRISA). This paper discusses the
   challenges of profiling digital scholarly communication on UBRISA, a
   technology brimming with potential but which UB staff has largely
   ignored. The consequences of this neglect are seen in the paltry
   submissions to it during its four years of existence. The paper explains
   the implementation policy, and the involvement and functions of a
   tripartite team that drives UBRISA. The paper notes that the problem of
   tardiness experienced in populating the digital repositories of other
   institutions is also deeply rooted in UB. It shares some failed efforts
   made to populate UBRISA through the instrument of the performance
   management system - an annual contract which the academic staff members
   sign at the beginning of the year. The paper then analyses the efforts
   of the Scholarly Communication in Africa Programme (SCAP) that worked
   with UB in training its staff regarding the operation of the IR, and
   also established a workflow process for vetting, describing and
   uploading content to the IR so that UB scholarship could become more
   visible to the world. Some recommendations are also offered.}},

Abstract = {{As Brazil's interactive Digital TV System (iDTV) is getting impulse,
   with a strong belief of government and industry that this new system
   will bring together new economic opportunities, several proposals for
   extending the potential of TV interactivity to provide innovative
   services have being proposed nowadays. In this context, the Healthcare
   is one of the concepts being studied. Healthcare relates to caring about
   health, preventing diseases, improving the quality o life, and its
   applications may support hospitals, elderly care centers and similar
   institutions. Integrating Healthcare technology with home devices is a
   new trend. Indeed this work aims to investigate new ways for
   communicating medical devices with the Brazilian iDTV. The solution here
   proposed is a software platform based on the so called home gateway,
   which is in charge of interconnecting all medical devices with the iDTV
   set. As proof of concept two implementation scenarios for measuring the
   heart beat frequency and the blood pressure were built. All the
   procedures related to the integration are detailed. We believe this work
   will be useful in this new field, bringing alternative ways for using
   common devices and the iDTV to improve the quality of life to the home
   user.}},

Abstract = {{Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has evolved tremendously from the early
   days when candlelight was used to illuminate scopes to the extent that
   it has now become an integral part of the practice of modern
   gastroenterology. The first gastroscope was a rigid scope first
   introduced by Adolf Kussmaul in 1868. However this scope suffered from
   the 2 drawbacks of poor illumination and high risk of instrumental
   perforation. Rudolf Schindler improved on this by inventing the
   semiflexible gastroscope in 1932. But it was Basil Hirschowitz, using
   the principle of light conduction in fibreoptics, who allowed us to
   ``see well{''} for the first time when he invented the flexible
   gastroscopy in 1958. With amazing speed and innovation, instrument
   companies, chiefly Japanese, had improved on the Hirschowitz gastroscope
   and invented a flexible colonoscope. Walter McCune introduced the
   technique of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in
   1968 which has now evolved into a sophisticated procedure. The advent of
   the digital age in the 1980s saw the invention of the videoendoscope.
   Videoendoscopes have allowed us to start seeing the gastrointestinal
   tract (GIT) ``better{''} with high magnification and resolution and
   optical/digital enhancements. Fusing confocal and light microscopy with
   endoscopy has allowed us to perform an ``optical biopsy{''} of the GI
   mucosa. Development of endoscopic ultrasonography has allowed us to see
   ``beyond{''} the GIT lumen. Seeing better has allowed us to do better.
   Endoscopists have ventured into newer procedures such as the resection
   of mucosal and submucosal tumours and the field of therapeutic GI
   endoscopy sees no end in sight.}},

Abstract = {{Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) has been explored in order to
   restore the capabilities of the nervous system in patients that suffer
   from paralysis. This area of research and of clinical practice greatly
   benefits from any technological improvement yielding miniaturization. In
   this regard, we recently proposed and demonstrated an innovative
   electrical stimulation method based on implanted microstimulators that
   operate as rectifiers of bursts of innocuous high frequency current
   supplied by skin electrodes, generating low frequency currents that are
   capable of stimulating excitable tissues. We envision flexible ultrathin
   implants (diameters < 300 mu m) containing ASICs that have advanced
   capabilities, such as addressability and current control. As
   miniaturization is the main aim of this method, the use of bulky
   DC-blocking capacitors (e.g. 10 mu F) to accomplish zero net charge
   injection and avoid electrochemical tissue and electrode damage is
   highly inconvenient. As an alternative, here we present an active
   charge-balance method based on the use of a digital charge quantifier,
   whose operation is inspired in the functioning of the tipping bucket
   rain gauge. The system monitors the charge injection, matching the
   charge injected in the cathodal phase, with the charge injected in the
   anodal phase, generating a biphasic current waveform that adapts itself
   to possible current source mismatches. We have implemented a prototype
   built with discrete components which uses a capacitor of only 100 pF for
   the charge counter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of our team's research efforts over the
   past eight years focusing on providing innovative solutions for
   actionable and unobtrusive home health monitoring using a common
   household device: the weighing scale. By interfacing the mechanical and
   electrical sensors available in modern digital weighing scales to
   dedicated analog front end circuits, developing a customized toolkit of
   algorithms for processing and analyzing measured signals, and conducting
   targeted human subjects studies to elucidate relationships between
   underlying physiological changes and features of the signals, we have
   opened up a combination of new potential solutions to important health
   monitoring needs; additionally, we have uncovered new scientific
   questions to address in further studies. In particular, we have focused
   on better understanding longitudinal measurements of the
   ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal - representing the cardiogenic
   reactionary forces of the body - and how the BCG can complement other
   more well-known measures of cardiovascular performance. The key
   technological challenges and barriers we have attempted to address in
   this work, as well as the scientific questions that are currently at the
   forefront of our research, are outlined and discussed here.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses a variety of ways that digital technology can
   enhance innovation by facilitating the conditions necessary for the
   development of employees' creative ideas and the implementation of these
   ideas in organizations. We begin by arguing that three conditions are
   necessary if employees are to generate creative ideas: access and
   exposure to new and diverse information, full engagement in the work
   role, and the experience of socioemotional or instrumental support. We
   posit that the implementation of employees' creative ideas requires the
   mobilization of support and sponsorship of the ideas from credible
   allies. We then discuss the possibility that digital technology shapes
   the creativity of ideas generated by employees and the implementation of
   these ideas by influencing each of these conditions. We conclude with a
   discussion of some possible risks of digital technology use and some
   suggestions for several new directions for future research. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The present research aimed to examine how social comparison and
   individual differences in creativity might influence creative
   performance and attention paid to ideas generated by a partner during an
   electronic brainstorming session. After completing a creativity scale,
   forty-one psychology undergraduates generated ideas by computer with a
   remote partner/confederate presented as a student in either Arts (upward
   comparison) or Sciences (downward comparison) and who was instructed to
   give a list of pretested ideas. During the idea-generation task, the eye
   movements of each participant were tracked to measure the attention they
   paid to the ideas of their partner. As predicted, results showed that
   the quality (but not the quantity) of ideas was greater in upward than
   downward comparison, but only for high creative participants. Similar
   patterns were found for attention allocated to the partner's ideas. We
   discuss the role of motivational and attentional processes for
   electronic brainstorming research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study explores the interaction of the essential components of
   creativity and collaboration in a digital environment in the design
   process. The framework is based on Amabile's componential theory of
   creativity, which is composed of three intra-individual components of
   creativity and the social environment. The digital environment as the
   social component of creativity provides the technical infrastructure for
   the analysis of data related to creativity and collaboration. Protocol
   coding method is used for the analysis of the qualitative and
   quantitative data stored in The Modular Object Oriented Developmental
   Learning Environment (MOODLE) forum posts that were formed by the
   comments or critiques given during the collaboration process by the team
   members, instructors or jury members. Findings indicate that the social
   environment component named as the reactivity to proposals is closely
   related to idea generation as the creative relevant process component
   and group interaction as the task motivation component. Furthermore, it
   is found that the number of sketches and design ideas produced through
   critiques are the main design issues that enhance creativity in
   collaborative digital environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This article places the 2013 European audience survey in the wider
   historical context of the ongoing societal appropriation of digital
   media. To better understand longitudinal changes in the patterns of
   media use, the article compares the technological, industrial, and
   cultural factors that, together, shape the observable patterns of media
   use. Because Internet diffusion does not occur at exactly the same time
   in all countries, comparisons of audiences across the nine countries of
   the survey can be interpreted in terms of changes over time. The
   article, further, reports longitudinal evidence from Belgium, Denmark,
   and Germany, which sheds additional light on current changes at the
   country level. Building on these findings, the article finally addresses
   key challenges for future longitudinal research on media use across
   cultures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of an innovative procedure that
   allows the estimation of longitudinal and transverse dispersivities in
   an experimental plume devised in a laboratory sandbox. The phenomenon of
   transport in porous media is studied using sodium fluorescein as tracer.
   The fluorescent excitation was achieved by using blue light and the
   concentration data were obtained through the processing of side wall
   images collected with a high resolution color digital camera. After a
   calibration process, the relationship between the luminosity of the
   emitted fluorescence and the fluorescein concentration was determined at
   each point of the sandbox. The relationships were used to describe the
   evolution of the transport process quantitatively throughout the entire
   domain. Some check tests were performed in order to verify the
   reliability of the experimental device. Numerical flow and transport
   models of the sandbox were developed and calibrated comparing computed
   and observed flow rates and breakthrough curves. The estimation of the
   dispersivity coefficients was carried out by analyzing the concentration
   field deduced from the images collected during the experiments; the
   dispersivity coefficients were evaluated in the domain zones where the
   tracer affected the porous medium under the hypothesis that the
   transport phenomenon is described by advection-dispersion equation (ADE)
   and by computing the differential components of the concentration by
   means of a numerical leap-frog scheme. The values determined agree with
   the ones referred in literature for similar media and with the
   coefficients obtained by calibrating the numerical model. Very
   interesting considerations have been made from the analysis of the
   performance of the methodology at different locations in the flow domain
   and phases of the plume evolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Optical full field techniques, like digital image correlation (DIC)
   become more and more standard tools for the determination of material
   parameters. Especially for anisotropic materials the multidimensional
   information is important. For example, up to now this is limited to 2D
   strain information. The use of the innovative cluster approach for DIC
   and a multi camera setup in a standard tensile test allows the access to
   the third dimension and measure not just the strain on one surface but
   on both surfaces and in thickness direction.
   With the cluster approach the points to be evaluated are not defined by
   an image of one camera, like in conventional DIC systems, but on the
   object. In this case every object point seen by two or more cameras can
   be measured, independently of the arrangement of the cameras. In a front
   back side arrangement e.g. during a tensile test, both sides of the
   sample are measured simultaneously. As all cameras are calibrated in a
   common coordinate system the thickness of sample and any changes are
   measured directly. In this way the strain in thickness direction is
   measureable directly.
   As an example we present the measurement on a simple aluminium sample up
   to failure. The difference in the strain in direction of thickness and
   on the surface indicates anisotropic material properties caused by the
   process of manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of digital convergence and the explosive growth of
   wireless communication, together with experiences gained in providing
   Internet services in different parts of the world, make it necessary to
   reassess the strategies and methods employed by governments, development
   agencies and private enterprises to spark off socio-economic development
   through the use of Information and Communication Technologies in rural
   communities. This paper stems from the authors' experience in diverse
   projects of social inclusion in various rural settlements in Latin
   America and more recently in the town of San Miguel Tlacotepec, Oaxaca,
   Mexico, and from the analysis of reported results indicating that the
   availability of wideband infrastructure and of convergent devices for
   access to Internet and their associated contents, although necessary, is
   not sufficient to achieve sustainable socio-economic development in
   rural communities. We thus suggest exploring new approaches that
   integrate, together with the cyber-infrastructure, two complementary
   programs: a social action program that incorporates community
   participation, technological adoption and usability, and capacity
   building strategies; accompanied by another social innovation program to
   stimulate entrepreneurship and learning by the actors in the rural
   context. Our proposal considers that the cyber-infrastructure and the
   proposed associated programs defines a socio-technical system that acts
   upon the rural context, which in turn can be characterized as a
   socio-environmental system.}},

Title = {{QoS-Optimized Adaptive Multi-layer (OQAM) architecture of wireless

Abstract = {{Quality of Service (QoS) optimization is an important design goal in
   wireless video transmission. The application (APP) layer 802.11e medium
   access control (MAC) layer, and physical (PHY) layer of the wireless
   protocol stack can be jointly designed for the exchange of information.
   This will optimize the performance of wireless network for real-time
   digital video transmission. This paper proposes an innovative
   `QoS-Optimized Adaptive Multi-layer (OQAM)' architecture. It ensures
   reliable and high-quality video transmission over communication
   channels. The channel exhibits wide variability in throughput, delay,
   and packet loss. The simulation is performed using EvalVid and Network
   Simulator-2. Enhanced Intra Prediction (EnIP) algorithm with H.264/MPEG4
   Advanced Video Coding (AVC) is proposed at the APP layer. This
   H.264/MPEG4 AVC is a non-scalable video enCOder/DECoder (CODEC).
   Improved MAC Adaptive Retry Limit (IMAL(r)) is proposed as smart-packet
   drop mechanism at the 802.11e MAC layer. It uses packet overflow drop
   (P-ov,) and expired-time packet discard (P-ex) algorithm. Enhanced
   Adaptive Forward Error Correction (EnAFEC) is proposed at the PHY layer.
   The aforementioned algorithms are jointly considered in the proposed
   OQAM architecture, which increases the coding efficiency, reduces
   end-to-end delay and increases reliability of wireless network for
   real-time Video over Wireless (VoW) transmission. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{As digital services increasingly deal with commodity offerings (i.e.,
   digital content and features that are similar between service
   providers), service providers are seeking to differentiate themselves
   with variations in their digital service business models. Research,
   though, has yet to consider the association of consumer perceived value
   with digital service business models underlying technological
   innovations. We seek to demonstrate that consumer value for digital
   service business models may be quite different even when consumers have
   similar preferences for standard technology characteristics. In the
   context of this paper, we specifically consider consumer perceived value
   associated with Personal Health Records (PHRs) and PHR digital business
   models, through the use of an integrated latent variable and choice
   empirical model. We find that although consumer perceived value for PHRs
   is generally high, when offered a choice between three competing PHR
   business models, consumers state high value for only two of the business
   models in the choice set: PHRs offered directly by groups of medical
   providers and Integrated PHRs. These findings suggest that while
   perceived value may be high for generally considered digital services,
   variations in the underlying digital service business models are likely
   to have significant impacts on consumer valuations of digital services.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel digital predistortion (DPD) solution
   based on a direct learning approach, which is capable of reducing the
   unwanted emissions resulting from the power amplifier (PA) at any
   prespecified frequency located in the transmitter's out-of-band or
   spurious domain. The proposed scheme is based on evaluating the power
   spectral density (PSD) of the PA output signal and optimizing the DPD
   coefficients iteratively in order tominimize the output PSD around the
   prespecified frequency. To highlight the feasibility of the proposed
   implementation, the predistortion processing is kept as simple as
   possible, deploying quasi-memoryless polynomial models. Efficient
   mitigation of unwanted emissions around the target frequency is
   demonstrated via simulations and actual RF measurements, in both
   single-and dual-carrier waveform scenarios, using memoryless and
   memory-based PAs. The proposed DPD solution could be potentially
   employed in applications such as mobile devices utilizing non-contiguous
   multicarrier transmission, where the intermodulation spursmay overlap
   with the device's own receiver band, or could be potentially violating
   the spurious emission limits. Another target application is cognitive
   radio, where the PA may produce unwanted emissions that are interfering
   with primary-user transmissions. To the best of the authors' knowledge,
   there does not exist a similar technique in the open literature, and
   thus, the purpose of this paper is to encourage scientific discussions
   and technological innovations toward the creation of relatively
   low-complexity frequency-optimized predistortion techniques employed
   against selected unwanted emissions produced by the transmitter.}},

Abstract = {{Existing social-aware routing protocols for pocket switched networks
   make use of the information about the social structure of the network
   deduced by state information of nodes (e.g., history of past encounters)
   to optimize routing. Although these approaches are shown to have
   superior performance to social-oblivious, stateless routing protocols
   (BinarySW, Epidemic), the improvement comes at the cost of considerable
   storage overhead required on the nodes. In this paper we present SANE,
   the first routing mechanism that combines the advantages of both
   social-aware and stateless approaches. SANE is based on the
   observation-that we validate on a real-world trace-that individuals with
   similar interests tend to meet more often. In SANE, individuals (network
   members) are characterized by their interest profile, a compact
   representation of their interests. By implementing a simple routing rule
   based on interest profile similarity, SANE is free of network state
   information, thus overcoming the storage capacity problem with existing
   social-aware approaches. Through thorough experiments, we show the
   superiority of SANE over existing approaches, both stateful,
   social-aware and stateless, social-oblivious. We discuss the
   statelessness of our approach in the supplementary file, which can be
   found on the Computer Society Digital Library at
   http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2307857, of this
   manuscript. Our interest-based approach easily enables innovative
   networking services, such as interest-casting. An interest-casting
   protocol is also introduced in this paper, and evaluated through
   experiments based on both real-world and synthetic mobility traces.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technology is increasingly important in achieving business
   goals, and its pervasive effects have resulted in the radical
   restructuring of entire industries. Consequently, managers' extensive
   interest in handling digital innovation is not surprising. Recent
   research has illustrated how digital technologies give rise to a vast
   potential for product and service innovation that is difficult to
   control and predict. Therefore, firms need dynamic tools to support
   themselves in managing the new types of digital innovation processes
   that emerge. The nature of these processes forces firms to challenge
   prior assumptions about their product and service portfolio, their
   digital environment, and ways of organizing innovation work. In this
   article, we present a managerial framework that supports firms in this
   undertaking. The framework, geared at supporting ongoing improvements in
   digital innovation management, covers five key areas: user experience,
   value proposition, digital evolution scanning, skills, and
   improvisation. We also present a diagnostic tool that can be utilized as
   firms begin the process of implementing the framework. Finally, we
   conclude with our thoughts on the managerial implications of the
   framework when going forward in a rapidly changing digital innovation
   landscape. (C) 2014 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

Abstract = {{Drawing on multi-sited ethnography and qualitative research, I argue
   that the visual register in particular modes of communication technology
   like Skype and Facebook ushers in a different quality of relationships
   for transnational families. Most participants in this study are
   undocumented immigrants unable to return to their families for long
   periods of time because of legal consequences that will ban them from
   coming back and working in the USA. On the other hand, their families in
   the Philippines cannot visit the USA without proper documentation. The
   economic necessity of working abroad and legal conditions deter family
   reunification. Consequently, since these families are separated their
   only means of sustaining their relationships is through communication
   technology. The new mediums of communication, given their innovations in
   visuality, frequency and access to one another's digital lives, present
   complicated issues as well as different forms of intimacy for members in
   a transnational family.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of newspapers from print to digital is not taking place
   in a simple and direct way. In Norway at least, digital news
   distribution is still developing on the basis of the print media order.
   But at the same time, it is increasingly becoming a diversified and
   strategically nuanced logic of online news distribution. What is
   remarkable in the Norwegian situation is the stability in the high
   number of outlets and annual sales. It is argued that the Norwegian
   subsidy system is the most important cause for the high and stable
   number of newspapers. Indirectly, it also seems to support the
   development of a competitive market for the development of digital
   strategies. There is a high rate of innovation in the Norwegian media
   system, and this article looks into the different digital strategies in
   different types of newspapers and shows the emergence of a complex
   pattern of digital news distribution in the Norwegian media order.}},

Abstract = {{Research supports the central role of parents in the sexual health
   behaviors and outcomes of their adolescent children. Too often, parents
   and adolescents with the greatest sexual health disparities are
   difficult to reach and engage in preventative interventions. Online and
   mobile technologies (OMTs) represent an innovative opportunity to reach
   large numbers of youth and their parents. However, there is a dearth of
   information related to the feasibility and acceptability of
   OMT-delivered family interventions for reaching vulnerable
   youths-particularly, ethnic minority youths. The current manuscript
   addresses this gap in the empirical literature by examining the
   feasibility and acceptability of OMT-based parent-adolescent sexual
   health interventions for African American and Latino families. Focus
   groups were conducted with convenience samples of Latino and African
   Americans from six US cities. Fourteen focus groups (six parents and
   eight adolescents) with an average of 10-12 participants each provided
   data for the study. Researchers used inductive thematic analysis to
   evaluate data. The findings suggest that parents and adolescents were
   motivated to obtain sexual health information through OMTs due to their
   accessibility, widespread use, and ability to deliver large quantities
   of information. However, personalized and trustworthy information was
   viewed as less attainable through the Internet or similar digital means,
   presenting a potential barrier to delivering an adolescent sexual health
   intervention via OMTs. Sexual health interventions delivered through
   online and mobile mechanisms present a novel opportunity for reaching
   potentially at-risk ethnic minority adolescents and their parents.
   Feelings of discomfort surrounding OMT use with parents, generational
   differences, and parent-adolescent relationship quality must be
   considered when developing technology-based sexual health interventions
   for Latino and African American families.}},

Abstract = {{The digital information revolution has brought about changes in our
   society and our lives. The many advantages of digital information have
   also generated new challenges and new opportunities for innovation. The
   strength of the information hiding science is due to the nonexistence of
   standard algorithms to be used in hiding secret message. Also, there is
   randomness in hiding method such as combining several media (covers)
   with different methods to pass secret message. Information hiding
   represents a class of process used to embed data into various forms of
   media such as image, audio, or text. The proposed text in image
   cryptography and steganography system (TICSS) is an approach used to
   embed text into gray image (BMP). TICSS is easily applied by any end
   user.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the automated detection of a closed curve's
   dominant points. We treat a curve as a 1-D function of the arc length.
   The problem of detecting dominant points is translated into seeking the
   extrema of the corresponding 1-D function. Three approaches for
   automated dominant points detection are presented: (1) an approach based
   on fitting polynomial, (2) an approach using 1-D computer registration
   and (3) an innovative approach based on a multi-resolution scheme,
   zero-crossing and hierarchical clustering. Afterwards, two methods are
   introduced based on the linearly and non-linearly mixing the results
   from the three approaches. We then mix the results in a mean-square
   error sense by using the linear and non-linear fittings, respectively.
   We experimentally demonstrate the problem of detecting 21 landmarks on
   38 vole-teeth that by mixing, the detection accuracy is improved by up
   to 41.47 \% with respect to the results for individual approaches, as
   applied within the mixture.}},

Abstract = {{The worldwide boom in digital video may be one of the reasons behind the
   exponential growth of MOOCs. The evaluation of a MOOC requires a great
   degree of multimedia and collaborative interaction. Given that videos
   are one of the main elements in these courses, it would be interesting
   to work on innovations that would allow users to interact with
   multimedia and collaborative activities within the videos. This paper is
   part of a collaboration project whose main objective is ``to design and
   develop multimedia annotation tools to improve user interaction with
   contents{''}. This paper will discuss the assessment of two tools:
   Collaborative Annotation Tool (CaTool) and Open Video Annotation (OVA).
   The latter was developed by the aforementioned project and integrated
   into the edX MOOC. The project spanned two academic years (2012-2014)
   and the assessment tools were tested on different groups in the Faculty
   of Education, with responses from a total of 180 students. Data obtained
   from both tools were compared by using average contrasts. Results showed
   significant differences in favour of the second tool (OVA). The project
   concludes with a useful video annotation tool, whose design was approved
   by users, and which is also a quick and user-friendly instrument to
   evaluate any software or MOOC. A comprehensive review of video
   annotation tools was also carried out at the end of the project.}},

Abstract = {{The use of video as a teaching resource stimulates the construction of
   new knowledge. Although this resource exists in several genres and
   media, the experience of professionals that use this resource in class
   is not appreciated. Furthermore, online spaces guiding and supporting
   the appropriate use of this practice are unavailable. In the online
   learning field, a proposal has emerged for a repository of short videos
   aimed at instructing how to use them as a teaching resource in order to
   stimulate the exchange of ideas and experience (fostering and creating
   knowledge) in the teaching-learning process, which serves as a resource
   for professionals in the construction of MOOCs (Massive Open Online
   Courses). A three-stage architecture is methodologically proposed:
   identification/recognition, dissemination and collaboration in the use
   of videos as a teaching resource supported by an extensive exploratory
   research, based on existing educational technologies and technological
   trends for higher education. And this leads to the creation of a
   repository of Informational Content Recovery in Videos (RECIF), a
   virtual space for the exchange of experience through videos. We conclude
   that through methodologies that facilitate the development of innovative
   processes and products, it is possible to create spaces for virtual or
   face-to-face motivational classes (MOOCs) thereby completing an
   interactive and collaborative learning toward stimulation of creativity
   and dynamism.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop and assess an innovative educational video package
   for improving HIV knowledge, attitudes and practices among company
   workers in Ecuador.
   Methods: The design and development of the HIV prevention educational
   video was based on the results of a large-scale survey conducted in 115
   companies (commerce, manufacturing and real estate) and among 1,732
   workers in the three most populous provinces of Ecuador (Pichincha,
   Guayas and Azuay). Two focus groups (workers of different job categories
   and HIV experts from various domains) evaluated the video by means of an
   11-item questionnaire scoring the concept, script, technical aspects,
   potential impact, content and quality of the digital production.
   Results: The video produced was 16-minutes long. The two focus groups
   indicated their overall satisfaction with the initial version of the
   video and their scores were high. They felt the video kept their
   interest, was easy to understand, and evidenced the good use of
   graphics, voice audio and narrative to impact on the audience. The
   experts were, however, slightly more critical than workers and made some
   minor suggestions about the content and the need to test the video's
   cultural appropriateness and degree of comprehension, both of which
   improved the video prior to its final release.
   Conclusion: Video-based HIV intervention programmes targeting company
   workers may have value in improving knowledge and reducing the risk of
   HIV transmission in Ecuador.}},

Abstract = {{Research on digital' journalism has focused largely on online news, with
   comparatively less interest in the longer-term implications of software
   and computational technologies. Drawing upon a 6-year study of the
   Toronto Star, this article provides an account of TOPS, an in-house web
   content management system which served as the backbone of thestar.com
   for 6 years. For some, TOPS was a successful software innovation, while
   for others, a strategic digital property'. But for most journalists, it
   was slow, deficient in functionality, aesthetically unappealing and
   cumbersome. Although several organizational factors can explain TOPS'
   obstinacy, I argue for particular attention to the complex ontology of
   software. Based on an outline of this ontology, I suggest software be
   taken seriously as an object of journalism, which implies acknowledging
   its partial autonomy from human use or authorization, accounting for its
   ability to mutate indefinitely and analysing its capacity to encourage
   forms of computational thinking'.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an innovative method for lossless compression
   of discrete-color images, such as map images, graphics, GIS, as well as
   binary images. This method comprises two main components. The first is a
   fixed-size codebook encompassing 8 x 8 bit blocks of two-tone data along
   with their corresponding Huffman codes and their relative probabilities
   of occurrence. The probabilities were obtained from a very large set of
   discrete color images which are also used for arithmetic coding. The
   second component is the row-column reduction coding, which will encode
   those blocks that are not in the codebook. The proposed method has been
   successfully applied on two major image categories: 1) images with a
   predetermined number of discrete colors, such as digital maps, graphs,
   and GIS images and 2) binary images. The results show that our method
   compresses images from both categories (discrete color and binary
   images) with 90\% in most case and higher than the JBIG-2 by 5\%-20\%
   for binary images, and by 2\%-6.3\% for discrete color images on
   average.}},

Abstract = {{The convergence of digital and multimodal cognitive technologies offers
   the possibility to interact in an on-line' cultural process mediated by
   new ways of representing our thoughts, emotions, ideas, beliefs,
   opinions and behaviours. Such technological integration not only alters
   and introduces innovations in the interactive and representational modes
   of networked media, perhaps inducing changes in our cognitive functions,
   but also conditions the global cultural dynamics by potentially
   organizing, funnelling, tagging and semantically' predigesting knowledge
   through the intelligent' digital technosphere. The ecology of ideas in
   such complex and accelerating semiotic space will present highly
   contradictory and dissonant tendencies in cultural processes. This may
   pose great difficulties for individuals, communities and whole cultural
   layers when trying to reconcile such tendencies with a sustainable
   direction that does not disrupt the life-support systems and the

Title = {{Using Augmented Reality to Facilitate Piping Assembly: An
   Experiment-Based Evaluation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Current practice utilizes two-dimensional (2D) drawings as the main
   visualization means to guide assembly. As an emerging technology,
   augmented reality (AR) integrates three-dimensional (3D) images of
   virtual objects into a real-world workspace. The insertion of
   digitalized information into the real-world workspace using AR can
   provide workers with the means to implement correct assembly procedures
   with improved accuracy and reduced errors. The limited available
   research concerning the applications of AR visualization means in
   assembly highlights the need for a structured methodology of addressing
   cognitive and usability issues for the application potentials of AR
   technology to be fully realized. Thus, the focus of the study presented
   in this paper is to investigate how much improvement in assembly
   productivity and performance can be achieved by lowering cognitive
   workload via AR. The AR system was developed in collaboration with
   Woodside Energy Ltd. following research project ECHO. Evaluation of the
   prototyped construction piping scenario revealed that the AR
   visualization yielded shorter task completion time (50\% reduction),
   fewer assembly errors (50\% reduction), and lower total task load. More
   specific findings also indicated that the animated AR visualization
   significantly shortened the original time (55\% reduction) and rework
   time (46\% reduction), payment to assemblers (50\% reduction), and cost
   of correcting erroneous assembly (66\% reduction). Questionnaire
   feedback revealed that the animated AR visualization better aided
   assembly comprehension and better facilitated information retrieval and
   collaboration between human and guidance medium. From a technology
   innovation perspective, by providing a higher level of immersion and
   interaction with spatial awareness, the dynamic AR guidance can be
   integrated with building information model (BIM) technology in helping
   and training practitioners, because all of the models and assembly
   sequences are designed in BIM and visualized in AR. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Nowadays companies are rapidly moving towards transforming their
   business into digital businesses. Being digital often means exploiting
   emerging technologies to enable new ways of serving customers.. This
   paper presents two digital tools that have been designed to drive
   innovation in maintenance operations. A remote assistance collaboration
   tool combining wearable technologies and augmented reality is presented
   to allow a specialist from an engineering services company to remotely
   assist in real time a maintenance operator located at an operation site.
   A visible and open collaborative business model built to model the B2B
   process between the engineering services and the operation companies is

Abstract = {{Modern digital technologies bring various means for didactic adaptation
   of educational content and for new forms of dialogue and interaction
   between students and learning environment. Different data
   representations can be easily used and combined in digital learning
   environment. Forming of the correct ideas and better understanding of
   the educational content is enabled mainly by graphic representation in
   the form of inspectional dynamic models. As an illustration the article
   presents examples of the models created with dynamic geometric system
   Geogebra, that are usable in teaching probability and planimetry in high
   schools. Interactive digital learning materials including active
   components with a feedback can stimulate students' activity and interest
   in learning. The feedback can have multiple didactic functions. Besides
   the main purpose of checking the answers' correctness it can provide
   contextual learning aid for the student and perhaps even can guide the
   stages of the learning process. While creating the digital content it is
   possible to differentiate between local and global feedback. In our
   research we focus on the application of inquiry approaches to teaching
   of mathematics. An important part of the preparation of innovative
   methodical and educational materials is the development of interactive
   learning activities. The article describes multiple interactive
   mathematical learning activities which illustrate various types of local

Abstract = {{Personal wireless communication and digital multimedia information
   devices become widely available and extensively used. These devices
   require more and more developed video codecs. Hence, several video

   block of Motion Estimation (ME) is an important module in all recent
   video coders. This paper presents REGIM Video Coding (REGIMVC) as a new
   video coding technique. REGIM-VC proposes an efficient motion estimation
   algorithm based on block matching. The proposed algorithm purpose is to
   improve the compression performance by applying new Motion Estimation

Abstract = {{Signal conditioning and transmission for sensor systems and networks
   within the containment of nuclear power plants (NPPs) still poses a
   challenge to engineers, particularly in the case of equipment upgrades
   for existing plants, temporary measurements, decommissioning of plants,
   but also for new builds. This paper presents an innovative method for
   efficient and cost-effective instrumentation within high dose rate areas
   inside the containment. A transmitter-receiver topology is proposed that
   allows simultaneous, unidirectional point-to-point transmission of
   multiple sensor signals by superimposing them on existing AC or DC power
   supply cables using power line communication (PLC) technology. Thereby
   the need for costly installation of additional cables and containment
   penetrations is eliminated. Based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
   electronic parts, a radiation hard transmitter is designed to operate in
   harsh environment within the containment during full plant operation.
   Hardware modularity of the transmitter allows application specific
   tradeoffs between redundancy and channel bandwidth. At receiver side in
   non-radiated areas, signals are extracted from the power line,
   demodulated, and provided either in analog or digital output format.
   Laboratory qualification tests and field test results within a boiling
   water reactor (BWR) are validating the proof of concept of the proposed
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of mechanical and chemical changes in conventional sensors
   such as thermocouples and resistance thermometers can be avoided by
   instead using temperature sensors based on fundamental thermometry. A
   prime example of this is Johnson noise thermometry, which is based on
   measurement of the fluctuations in the voltage of a resistor arising
   from thermal motion of charge carriers - i.e. the `Johnson noise'. A
   Johnson noise thermometer never needs calibration and is insensitive to
   the condition of the sensor material. It is therefore ideally suited to
   long-term temperature measurements in harsh environments, such as
   nuclear reactor coolant circuits, in-pile measurements, nuclear waste
   management and storage, and severe accident monitoring.
   There have been a number of previous attempts to develop a Johnson noise
   thermometer for the nuclear industry, but none have reached commercial
   exploitation because of technical problems in practical implementation.
   The main challenge is to extract the tiny Johnson noise signal from
   ambient electrical noise influences, both from the internal
   amplification electronics, and from external electrical noise sources.
   Recent advances in electronics technology and digital signal processing
   techniques have opened up new possibilities for developing a viable,
   practical Johnson noise thermometer.
   We describe a project funded by the UK Technology Strategy Board (now
   Innovate UK) ``Developing the nuclear supply chain{''} call, currently
   underway, to develop a practical Johnson noise thermometer that makes
   use of innovative electronics for ultra low noise amplification and
   signal processing. The new electronics technology has the potential to
   help overcome the problems encountered with previous attempts at
   constructing a practical Johnson noise thermometer. An outline of the
   new developments is presented, together with an overview of the current
   status of the project.}},

Abstract = {{Handwriting analysis and rehabilitation is an actively explored area in
   the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease, which is usually
   performed in an ambulatory setting under direct supervision of a
   clinician. Technology can play an important role to reduce the need of
   therapist assistance and to enhance diagnostic precision through the
   computation of non-subjective handwriting quality metrics.
   This paper introduces an innovative handwriting rehabilitation system
   for PD patients, which ensures a natural writing experience as it is
   based on pen, ink and paper (as opposed to tablet and stylus). The
   system is designed for human-in-the loop operation and it can analyze
   handwriting in real-time and provide vocal feedback to guide the patient
   during the execution of exercises. We present a detailed comparative
   characterization of the key components of the system, namely wireless
   digital pens; in addition, in-field test assessed the system usability
   regarding its ease of use, calibration precision and vocal feedback
   effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound imagers suffer from a large data rate between their analog to
   digital converter (ADC) front-end and digital beamforming backend. This
   becomes a limiting factor when the number of elements is increased, such
   as in modern 2D transducers. To address this issue, prior work
   considered sub-Nyquist sampling techniques that exploit the disparity
   between the signal's physical bandwidth and innovation rate. In this
   work, we extend this framework using an analog-domain subarray
   beamforming technique that is feasible due to the narrowband nature of
   the sub-Nyquist signal acquisition. When applied to waveforms taken from
   a commercial ultrasound machine, this method reduces both the low-rate
   ADC count by a factor of eight and the total data rate by a factor of 54
   with minimal image degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Blood cell segmentation is a critical innovation for automatic
   differential blood counting, classification and analysis in clinical
   examination. In color blood cell images segmentation and recognition are
   two essential issues in the field of biomedical cell morphology. This
   paper approaches methods to segment the blood cells from microscopic
   thin blood images. This data is the premise to perform higher level
   tasks for example, automatic differential blood counting, detection of
   different diseases such as Malaria, Babesia, Chagas disease, Anemia,
   Leukemia etc. A noteworthy necessity of an automated, real-time,
   computer vision-based cell segmentation system is an efficient method
   for segmenting different blood component such as Red Blood Cells (RBCs),
   White Blood Cells (WBCs), Platelets from input images for blood count as
   well as to detect the parasites present in blood cells. Input images are
   captured by connecting digital camera to microscope. Captured images are
   enhanced and segmented using K-mean clustering as well as global

Abstract = {{Among the acoustic methods used in ocean and marine geography
   investigations, the multibeam echo sounder was the product most affected
   by technological developments in the recent decades. With computers
   increasing their capabilities of processing, and new complex beam
   forming algorithms the acoustic signals returned now have excellent
   ranges and spatial resolutions. The possibility to digitally process
   these acoustic signals have allowed several other innovations such as
   the integration of various research methodologies into a single product
   and expanded the marine environment research possibilities by using the
   same mechanical and electronic sensor construction. The signals
   collected by multibeam echo sounders now allow identifying the facies
   analysis of the seabed, oceanographic features in the water column and
   even improvements in the sub-bottom profiler's performance. The
   hydrographic survey vessel FSSV Fugro Brasilis, provides a great case
   study of these echo sounders capabilities. With modern sensors, mounted
   in a ``gondola{''}, 1 meter below the keel, away from the turbulence,
   aeration and laminar flow, minimizing noise and allowing the processing
   of low intensity return signals, this vessel exemplifies the
   installation of a complete system for technological hydrographic surveys
   down to 7.000m. The arrangement includes two multibeam echo sounders, a
   Kongsberg EM2040 for shallow water and an EM302 for deep waters, and
   also a sub-bottom profiler SBP300 sharing the multibeam reception
   transducers in order to observe the seabed sediment layers with maximum
   contrast and reflectivity. Part of the development and results evolution
   obtained passes through the data processing techniques applied to
   digital signals, which in this case use the processing software Fugro
   Starfix and Caris. Commercial programs like Caris HIPS \& SIPS, make a
   more pragmatic approach. Naturally, they are in constant contact with
   the manufacturers from the most commercial relevant equipment and stay
   up to date in the digital signal processing techniques. Due to this
   monitoring of the new technologies, Caris HIPS \& SIPS are the most
   suitable software for processing the water column and backscatter data.
   With the advance of technology, the number of products increases, not
   only restricted to the accurate achievement of bathymetry, but also
   enabling the integration of different techniques in order to provide
   more information in a single product. One of the ways found to increase
   the investigations quality at sea is processing of the water column data
   integrated with the bathymetry. This technique enables the research of
   outline structures in the ocean environment, such as hot springs and gas
   exudation. The combination of these bathymetric, facies analysis and
   seabed characterization information through the backscatter and high}},

Abstract = {{The generic theory of social innovation appeared in early 2000.
   Therefore, the role of social innovation was been increased in last
   decades in the light of macroeconomic transformation of World economy
   and the great development of social networks. Under social networking
   new business activites appear in the globalized market, even known as
   social business.
   Most programmes of the European Commision have orientation on a high
   speed of knowledge transfering from scientific research system to
   business or public life. New organization models of business use a
   tremendous amount of social information and usually social networks
   serve for the greater impact on improving structure of business
   environment and implementation of digital managerial solutions. Social
   networking serves for production of new knowledge and creation of the
   new ecosystems for social innovation.
   The authors of this article are presenting the new aspects of social
   innovation performance by using the content analysis for identification
   the role and functions of social innovation under digitalization of
   business environment. The research is focused on the clarification of
   social networking effects and better understanding why social innovation
   is becoming so powerful tool for business start-ups and social
   communication. The content analysis is used in case to highlight the
   comparative aspects of social innovation in different economical
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{The paper outlines the main challenges for leaders to 2020 based on
   results of the combined research in the Czech Republic in 2014.
   Leaders and organizations haveto adapt to the new world. The research
   fully confirmed Kotler's statement (2009) that the most difficult
   challenges for leaders are turbulent environment and standing changes.
   Together with turbulence and change is closely connected innovation and
   flexibility. Hamel (2008) stated that the changes in management style
   are not as quick as the changes in the environment. Digital knowledge,
   increasing number of information and standing innovations put more and
   more stress on leaders and their capabilities. Turbulent environment,
   changes and new challenges create a new generation of employees, so
   called generation Y. The different approach to work, the different
   communication style and more emphasis on the balance between work and
   family life are the main characteristics of generation Y. Competencies
   and behaviour of future leaders needs to be changed.
   The paper suggests methods for leadership development based on the
   challenges mentioned above.}},

Title = {{Reform plan of the Administration of the Government of Catalonia and its
   public sector, with special emphasis on transparency}},
Journal = {{ACTIVITAT PARLAMENTARIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{72-85}},
Abstract = {{In June 2014 the Catalan Government approved the reform Plan of the
   Administration of the Government and its public sector based on studies
   and contributions made by outside experts and characterised by the
   effect of the Europe 2020 programme (included in the Catalonia 2020
   strategy), which aims to reform the administrations of all of the member
   states, striving for intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth.
   In Catalonia, this reform seeks to respond to new citizen needs and
   emerging challenges, and aims to guarantee the provision of quality
   public services in an environment that is complex, changing and
   resource-constrained, lay the foundations for new governance and firmly
   focus on innovation. Beginning with consensus, the reform seeks to
   gradually consolidate the institutional model, which hinges on three
   inspirational, cross-cutting principles: transparency, ethics and
   innovation, all while putting emphasis on the pillars that underpin any
   great organisation: human capital, organisation, procedures and
   technology, and the provision of goods and services.
   The reform revolves around the following nine inherently interconnected
   thematic main lines of action: MLA 1, transparency; MLA 2, ethics; MLA
   3, human resources; MLA 4, professional public management; MLA 5,
   digital Government and simplifying administrative procedures; MLA 6,
   innovation and talent; MLA 7, the organisation of the Administration;
   MLA 8, organisation of the public sector; and lastly, MLA 9, which deals
   with public-private partnerships.
   Although specifically included in the first MLA, transparency inspires
   and steers the entire reform, together with ethics and innovation. It is
   a principle and a value that permeates the whole Plan and works as an
   driver for cultural and organisational change for the Administration and
   its public sector, and centres on two ideas: on one hand, it empowers
   the public to know, make demands, evaluate and hold public authorities
   accountable; and on the other, it requires public authorities to
   introduce new ways of working to legitimise and generate trust in its
   performance.
   In closing, the article highlights the fact that transparency requires
   reviewing the role of the Administration in public resource management
   to generate a new working culture and relation with the public. In this
   sense, it provides a new perspective on public affairs, based on trust,
   both on the part of the Administration as well as of the public.}},

   Positioning System (GPS) and cell phones and tablet PC technologies, in
   higher education and professional development; offers creative
   strategies and possibilities for integrating GPS and mobile technologies

   multicultural and multilingual curriculum that promotes inclusive and
   differentiated instruction; the ways in which participants integrated
   math, maps, and media into their learning; and how they gained
   alternative points of view on global education and renewed interest and
   commitment to community service and socially responsible teaching. This

Abstract = {{Scholarship on the impact specific digital technologies have on the
   practice of journalism from the different media contexts in Africa
   paints many interesting, yet varied pictures. It is evident that the
   specific levels of impact are subject to contextual nuances. Public
   broadcasting remains a crucial media player in many parts of the
   continent, and that is most often subject to significant influences from
   the local political, technological and sociocultural environment. This
   article explores how online newsmaking practices and formats at the SABC
   (South African Broadcasting Corporation) -one of Africa's foremost
   public broadcasters - are shaped by the identified local factors.
   Employing a mix of key informant interviews and content analyses, the
   findings reveal that there is quite a strong traditional element to the
   online news production process, shaped by dominant old broadcasting
   routines and structures. That said, the online news team is increasingly
   being challenged to work with converged skillsets, innovative tools, and
   evolving mindsets that are shaped by distinctive digital influences. The
   study suggests that such an arrangement, while allowing newsmakers in
   this domain to meet the demands of the local media environment, does
   limit their ability to harness the full potentials of the digital
   platform.}},

Abstract = {{A project of language learning digital platform for Lansad (Languages
   for Specialists of Other Disciplines) learners and teachers is under
   development at the University of Lorraine (UL) (Chateau \& Bailly,
   2013). The objective is to disseminate several autonomizing schemes
   developed over the last years (Bailly et al., 2008; Chateau \& Zumbihl,
   2012; Carette, Guely \& Pereiro, 2011).
   Our article will use a few examples to show how these experimental
   schemes used digital tools to favor the empowerment of learners. The
   positive feedback of teachers and learners involved in these schemes
   naturally produced the necessity to go beyond the experimental phase and
   to reach progressive institutionalization, via a digital platform
   project. But this institutionalization has proved problematic. Obstacles
   and incentives that occurred during the development of the platform will
   be identified, through the answers to two questionnaires sent to all
   university language teachers. It is often said that technical innovation
   does not necessarily lead to educational innovation. This study tries to
   clarify the relationships between these two types of innovation.}},

Journal = {{ANTHROPOLOGY \& AGING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{112+}},
Abstract = {{Digital games have become an important part of the technoscape, not only
   for youngsters, but for players of all ages. Older adults are a large,
   currently still largely untapped market for innovative game research and
   development. However, the current discourse on games and aging can
   largely be categorized into two themes. The first theme refers to
   digital games framed as a way for older adults to improve certain
   skills. The useful, pragmatic qualities, rather than the fun, hedonic
   aspects of games are emphasized. The second theme identifies the various
   age-related constraints that prevent older adults from playing. It
   focuses on the cognitive and physical limitations of older adults.
   Underlying both themes is a reductionist perspective on aging as merely
   a process of decline and debilitation. In this article, we present a
   ``gerontoludic{''} manifesto. Firstly, games should not be marketed
   solely as having the purpose of dealing with or mitigating agerelated
   decline and focus on positive aspects of older age (adagio 1: growth
   over decline). Secondly, agerelated adjustments should never interfere
   with the actual gameplay of the game (adagio 2: playfulness over
   usefulness). Finally, game researchers and game industry should put more
   efforts in understanding what differentiates elderly players, rather
   than seeing them as united in their age-related impairments (adagio 3:
   heterogeneity over unification). As this manifesto is a first step that
   needs further abutment by a wider community, we welcome debate and
   additions from game designers and researchers to further this manifesto
   and to move beyond agism in games.}},

Title = {{Exploring luxury brand country of origin impact on purchasing behaviors
   in India A conceptual framework}},
Journal = {{ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{216-236}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Luxury brands' marketing efforts have traditionally focussed
   on developed nations since that has comprised the majority of consumer
   demand. However, double-digit growth in developing nations such as India
   and China, have attracted the attention of most luxury brand managers.
   Using cue utilization theory, the authors conducted a qualitative study
   in two phases comprised of first, focus group discussions (FGD),
   structured observations (SO) and second, In-Depth Interviews (IDI) to
   understand the effects of country of origin (COO) on Indian consumers'
   current day purchasing behaviors with luxury products. The paper aims to
   discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using cue utilization theory, the authors
   conducted a qualitative study in two phases comprised of first, FGD, SO
   and second, IDI to understand the effects of COO on Indian consumers'
   current day purchasing behaviors with luxury products. A conceptual
   framework has been developed that should help luxury brands formulate
   marketing strategies for this booming market.
   Findings - Further, this study found that COO affects the exploration of
   luxury brands and this process is carried out digitally and primarily
   with friends. Luxury brand managers can insert detailed information
   about COO on web sites and can understand the keywords used in the
   search engines to facilitate consumers using appropriate consideration
   data. This research also found that COO is compared on the basis of
   quality, features and innovation.
   Research limitations/implications - The results of this study are only
   from one emerging country, i.e., India. Similar studies should be
   carried out in other emerging nations. Additionally, developed countries
   can also carry out comprehensive research in this domain as their
   behavior is also changing for COO and luxury brands.
   Originality/value - This insight can be used by the brand managers and
   they can develop apps and web sites that would help the consumers to
   compare the COO for their products. Additionally, this research found
   that COO helps the luxury consumers to evaluate the brands and how they
   associate it with consumer images. Luxury brand managers need to be
   conscious when their countries products/ brands have been rated low by
   the consumers as it could result in consumers simply discarding them
   from their consideration set.}},

Abstract = {{Modern digital technologies are paving the path to a revolutionary new
   concept of health and wellness care. Nowadays, many new solutions are
   being released and put at the reach of most consumers for promoting
   their health and wellness self-management. However, most of these
   applications are of very limited use, arguable accuracy and scarce
   interoperability with other similar systems. Accordingly, frameworks
   that may orchestrate, and intelligently leverage, all the data,
   information and knowledge generated through these systems are
   particularly required. This work introduces Mining Minds, an innovative
   framework that builds on some of the most prominent modern digital
   technologies, such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Internet of Things,
   to enable the provision of personalized healthcare and wellness support.
   This paper aims at describing the efficient and rational combination and
   interoperation of these technologies, as well as their integration with
   current and future personalized health and wellness services and
   business.}},

Abstract = {{Makers participate in remixing culture by drawing inspiration from,
   combining, and adapting designs for physical objects. To examine how
   makers remix each others' designs on a community scale, we analyzed
   metadata from over 175,000 digital designs from Thingiverse, the largest
   online design community for digital fabrication. Remixed designs on
   Thingiverse are predominantly generated designs from Customizer-a
   builtin web app for adjusting parametric designs. However, we find that
   these designs do not elicit subsequent user activity and the authors who
   generate them tend not to contribute additional content to Thingiverse.
   Outside of Customizer, influential sources of remixing include complex
   assemblies and design primitives, as well as non-physical resources
   posing as physical designs. Building on our findings, we discuss ways in
   which online maker communities could become more than just design
   repositories and better support collaborative remixing.}},

   indigenous knowledge. We first outline a view of indigenous knowledge,
   and then apply it to a study of Kenyan diasporans living in Australia.
   The findings are framed as nine techniques for sustaining displaced
   practising of indigenous knowledge. These appropriations suggest
   directions for technology innovation, providing design considerations
   for technologies that translate, formulate and support indigenous
   knowledge in transnational contexts.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a volunteer-driven, globally distributed
   organization whose members work to create a common digital map of the
   world. OSM embraces ideals of open data, and to that end innovates both
   socially and technically to develop practices and processes for
   coordinated operation. This paper provides a brief history of OSM and
   then, through quantitative and qualitative examination of the OSM
   database and other sites of articulation work, examines organizational
   growth through the lens of two catastrophes that spurred enormous
   humanitarian relief responses-the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and the 2013
   Typhoon Yolanda. The temporally- and geographically-constrained events
   scope analysis for what is a rapidly maturing, whole-planet operation.
   The first disaster identified how OSM could support other organizations
   responding to the event. However, to achieve this, OSM has had to refine
   mechanisms of collaboration around map creation, which were tested again
   in Typhoon Yolanda. The transformation of work between these two events
   yields insights into the organizational development of large,
   data-producing online organizations.}},

Abstract = {{The innovation of the Internet and the proliferation of new digital
   technologies in everyday life have unfortunately created more
   opportunities for the sexual abuse of children and especially the global
   distribution of child sexual abuse images online (CSAIO). Most of the
   current therapeutic interventions being used were designed to treat
   `conventional' sexual abuse trauma. Victims of CSAIO may experience
   ongoing trauma because the recordings of their abuse have the potential
   to be endlessly viewed and shared by those with a sexual interest in
   children some of whom may be known to them. However, little is known
   about the potential psychological harm to victims, the extent to which
   existing trauma treatment modalities are applicable to them, or what
   modifications of these treatments may be required for effective
   treatment. This paper explores current ways of understanding the harms
   done to the victims of CSAIO and presents cautions and recommendations
   for moving forward.}},

Abstract = {{As Korean, Japanese, and Australian universities see declining
   birthrates and a tapering off of the percentage of national age cohorts
   heading to universities, increased enrollments of international students
   are being pursued. As demographic changes force these universities to
   attract students from abroad, the globalization trend is also an
   incentive to modify their educational paradigms to prepare students to
   become global citizens. This paradigm shift is needed given that peace
   and prosperity depend on increasing the capacity of people to think and
   work on a global and intercultural basis. Furthermore, with digital
   advances in information and communication technologies (ICT), student
   learning will be integrated through ICT confluence to bring about
   innovations in products, services, contents, and processes. Thus, the
   educational environment is changing fast and the challenges are mounting
   for higher educational institutions, especially for Christian

Abstract = {{Libraries all over the world suffer from common problems like
   flexibility associated with digital data, lower levels of efficiency,
   and costs involved in managing the entire IT infrastructure. Few options
   are available in collaborating with other libraries, which is the prime
   reason for subordinate levels of efficiency. For the past 20 years the
   use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) has fundamentally
   changed the practices and procedures of nearly all forms of endeavor
   within business and governance. Within education, ICT has begun to have
   a presence, but the cost of ICT is not affordable. The basic principle
   of cloud computing entails the reduction of in-house data centres and
   the delegation of a portion or all of the information technology
   infrastructure capability to a third party. Universities and colleges
   are the core of innovation through their advanced research and
   development. Subsequently, higher institutions may benefit greatly by
   harnessing the power of cloud computing. Cloud computing would help in
   bridging the gap between academic libraries and ICT. Sharing of data
   among the libraries will in principle reduce the overall cost and
   increase efficiency. Capital expenditure done on infrastructure will
   chiefly be converted into operational expenditure. It will also enhance
   the user's experience and will help in making the libraries a lot more
   scalable. In this chapter the authors discuss problems faced with
   academic libraries and development efforts to overcome that problem.
   Then they propose to improve current user service model with cloud
   computing.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter introduces the basics of the digital library, including
   needs, benefits, and requirements, and briefly describes the

   characteristics, types, and how it works. The application of cloud
   computing in libraries is described with an example of the cloud in the
   academic library in Orissa. The advantages and disadvantages of cloud
   computing in libraries or in organizations are also covered here. The
   future prospects of the digital library using cloud computing technology
   is like an innovative application in libraries.}},

Pages = {{128-133}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The ``build it and they will come approach{''} is a largely
   accepted proposition in the library community, particularly in the area
   of special collections. There is, at times, little critical analysis
   given to collection development, digitization efforts or information
   literacy instruction in regard to how these hard-to-serve but
   research-rich materials might be used in the classroom. Instead, there
   exists a benevolent know-it-all expert determining which collections
   warrant preservation, digitization, acquisition and, ultimately,
   attention. At California State University (CSU) Channel Islands (CI),
   the user - teachers and students - is the focus of all special
   collection activities, and we have devised innovative ways to both
   encourage students and faculty to engage these materials as well as
   foster their appreciation, awareness and use on campus.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper explores three ways that
   librarians at the John Spoor Broome Library encourage and facilitate the
   use of primary documents housed in unique collections to support
   undergraduate student research.
   Findings - The use of high-impact teaching practices, like undergraduate
   research, is an important tool in promoting retention and increasing
   graduation rates, particularly for underrepresented minorities. At CSU
   CI and the John Spoor Broome Library, engaging students with primary
   documents is a focus of unique collections work that benefits both
   students and the Library alike.
   Originality/value - Digitization is a key component of most special
   collections work in the library world today, but perhaps efforts focused
   on promoting use are lacking. At CI, use is the primary focus of all
   unique collections work and, thus, could be a model for other libraries
   and archive departments.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter will examine the rapidly expanding role of libraries in an
   unprecedented time of change driven by digital information,
   communication technologies and linked knowledge infrastructures. The
   focus will be on academic libraries, although many of the topics
   discussed will apply to public libraries and memory institutions more
   generally. Digital scholarship, characterized by computation and
   data-intensive tasks, has sparked transformative inquiry into new topic
   domains and altered the intellectual boundaries of many disciplines. As
   a result, scholarly workflows are becoming more complex and yet more
   distinctive. Comprehensive reporting of digital scholarship requires new
   models of scholarly communication that cannot be based on print media.
   Open access to publications and datasets is now a common condition for
   funded research. Libraries as knowledge institutions are at a unique and
   opportune time for examining new services and resources that support
   digital scholarship across the disciplinary spectrum, while also
   developing innovative practices that serve patrons from the broader
   population. The future of many libraries is likely to be defined by
   decisions made and actions taken in the very near term. The wisdom
   informing these decisions can best be acquired by continuing to
   participate in a rich global dialog and moving forward in a spirit of
   collaboration and cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares two institutions of storytelling, mainstream
   national narratives and self-represented digital storytelling. It
   considers the centenary of World War 1, especially the Gallipoli
   campaign (1915) and its role in forming Australian `national character'.
   Using the new approach of cultural science, it investigates storytelling
   as a means by which cultures make and bind groups or `demes'. It finds
   that that demic (group-made) knowledge trumps individual experience, and
   that self-representation (digital storytelling) tends to copy the
   national narrative, even when the latter is known not to be true. The
   paper discusses the importance of culture in the creation of knowledge,
   arguing that if the radical potential of digital storytelling is to be
   understood - and realised - then a systems (as opposed to behavioural)
   approach to communication is necessary. Without a new model of
   knowledge, it seems we are stuck with repetition of the same old story.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the research reported in this article was to analyse
   and quantify the narrative techniques employed in videos embedded in the
   home pages of five Spanish online newspapers. For the purpose of tracing
   the evolution of the approaches taken by these digital dailies away from
   the traditional narrative models used in television production, two
   separate study samples representing video reporting published online in
   2011 and 2014 were examined. Findings show that material outsourced from
   agencies largely comprised short videos with voiceovers that conformed
   to the narrative structures of traditional journalism whereas those
   produced in-house by the five online dailies studied offered an
   innovative model that borrowed freely from other genres, involved longer
   stories supported by sound bites rather than voiceovers and were
   structured along lines other than those of the classic inverted pyramid.}},

Abstract = {{Service innovations, enabled by the confluence of big data, mobile
   solutions, cloud, social, and cognitive computing, and the Internet of
   Things, have gained a lot of attention among many enterprises in the
   past few years because they represent promising ways for companies to
   effectively and rapidly deliver new services. But one of today's most
   pervasive and bedeviling challenges is how to start this journey and
   stay on course. In this paper, we review some of the important
   developments in this area and reports the views voiced by five industry
   leaders from IBM, Cisco, HP, and ISSIP at a panel session at the 24th
   Annual Compete through Service Symposium in 2013. Panelists provided an
   extensive list of recommendations to academicians and professionals. The
   biggest conclusion is that all of the information and communications
   technology (ICT)-enabled service innovations need to be human-centered
   and focused on co-creating value.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a design-based intervention in urban primary and
   secondary schools serving culturally diverse students from low
   socio-economic status (SES) communities. The intervention capitalises on
   a partially implemented programme in seven schools which use digital
   devices (netbooks) and applications to raise literacy levels. Learning
   and teaching measures have been used to identify effective components
   which can be more systematically implemented. Classroom observations
   were employed to provide a profile of the use and quality of the
   literacy instruction and to identify effective instructional practices,
   thereby contributing to the redesign of instruction for cluster wide
   implementation. The study adds to a growing number of interventions
   which use a design-based approach to tackle problems associated with
   school effectiveness. It contributes to the identification of promising
   new practices and to the design of more effective instruction in the
   context of a national system (New Zealand) that is already generally of
   high quality in literacy teaching but with low equity. A specific
   outcome is further evidence about how new technologies and digital
   learning are being implemented in low SES classrooms and the
   relationships with valued student outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on the data from 26 interviews with different subject teachers
   in two countries, Estonia and Latvia, this study aimed to reveal how
   pedagogical beliefs and subject cultures shape the ways primary and
   secondary school teachers mediate students' use of digital technology.
   Teachers are acknowledged to be important socializing agents, affecting
   young people's experiences with digital technology, but it is still
   unclear how the mediation practices of teachers are related to such
   intrinsic factors as teachers' beliefs about the nature of learning,
   nature of technology, self-efficacy beliefs, and subject cultures. Our
   study indicates that teachers mainly act as guides or coaches to help
   students make sense of the various opportunities that digital technology
   provide. Teachers also use a variety of restrictions related to
   technology use according to their dominant pedagogical beliefs and
   subject domains. These two roles are not mutually exclusive, combining
   according to what teachers believe will best support learning. A small
   group of teachers in our sample also strive to broaden students'
   understanding and adopt new skills for using technology in innovative
   ways. Implications for teacher training and peer-to-peer learning are
   discussed based on our findings.}},

Abstract = {{This review of Jessica Pressman's Digital Modernism: Making It New in
   New Media (2014) emphasizes the field-building significance of
   Pressman's innovative approach to analyzing electronic literature, an
   approach that reinvigorates the dated methods of New Criticism for use
   in the digital humanities. Pressman identifies a genre of contemporary
   electronic literature, ``digital modernism,{''} and uncovers
   continuities linking it with early twentieth-century modernism. In spite
   of an uneven style that oscillates between belabored scholasticism and
   brilliant description, Digital Modernism rigorously wrangles a wide
   array of data points - historical, literary, and technological - to
   create an account of contemporary electronic literature relevant for
   digital humanists, literary scholars, and New Media scholars. This
   review contextualizes the work within new currents in modernist
   scholarship, reflects on the modernism and digital modernist ``canon{''}
   Pressman assembles, and then provides chapter summaries, with an
   emphasis on Digital Modernism's reinvention of close reading for the
   twenty-first century.}},

Abstract = {{Big data is a social, cultural, and technological phenomenon-a complex
   amalgamation of digital data abundance, emerging analytic techniques,
   mythology about data-driven insights, and growing critique about the
   overall consequences of big-data practices for democracy and society.
   While media and communication scholars have begun to examine and
   theorize about big data in the context of media and public life broadly,
   what are the particular implications for journalism? This article
   introduces and applies four conceptual lenses-epistemology, expertise,
   economics, and ethics-to explore both contemporary and potential
   applications of big data for the professional logic and industrial
   production of journalism. These distinct yet inter-related conceptual
   approaches reveal how journalists and news media organizations are
   seeking to make sense of, act upon, and derive value from big data
   during a time of exploration in algorithms, computation, and
   quantification. In all, the developments of big data potentially have
   great meaning for journalism's ways of knowing (epistemology) and doing
   (expertise), as well as its negotiation of value (economics) and values
   (ethics). Ultimately, this article outlines future directions for
   journalism studies research in the context of big data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the place of amateur imagery and citizen
   photojournalism in Time magazine's photoblog, Lightbox. If
   user-generated content has been seen as a threat by professional
   photojournalists in the last decade, Lightbox offers a paradigmatic
   example to understand if the visual elite still has a dominant status in
   the decision-making processes of news production. This paper, therefore,
   explores how citizen imagery is shaping and challenging a
   photojournalistic culture still influenced by criteria of excellence,
   legitimacy, and authority. Managed by professional photo editors,
   Lightbox has included a variety of sections which emphasize new,
   original work by professional photographers as well as weekly news
   reviews that sometimes incorporate amateur photography. Through a visual
   analysis of amateur imagery in Lightbox's sections and a textual
   examination of the editors' discussions on citizen photojournalism, this
   paper analyzes how the photoblog is adapting to the shift towards a
   digital age of innovation and hybridity. The results show that photo
   editors apply strategies to delimit citizen productions by very rarely
   selecting them and avoiding specific mention of the amateur nature of
   such images. Moreover, they underline that hybridity is understood not
   as multimodal content and co-creative processes between professional and
   amateur incorporations, but rather as professional and creative
   practices, for example by highlighting innovative photographers who use
   cell phone imagery and photo-sharing websites. While this paper
   interrogates the new careers in photography of amateurs turned
   professionals, it also shows how digital platforms emphasize the
   photographers' personal initiatives over usual gatekeeping processes.}},

Abstract = {{This study of digital competence in newspapers finds a strong
   relationship between ownership and the prioritization of digital
   competences. Newspaper executives in newspapers owned by media groups
   rated most digital competences significantly higher than executives from
   other newspapers, and ownership explained the relative importance of
   digital competences necessary in process innovation. There are also
   indications of a conflict between the product innovation of online news
   features and the process innovation of efficient multi-platform news
   production. The low priority of computer-assisted journalism skills will
   have consequences for the priority of the development of advanced
   digital methods in investigative journalism.}},

Abstract = {{E-Governance or Smart Government is buzzword across Europe to improve
   interaction between government and stakeholders. Governments both at
   national and local level are making efforts to transform themselves into
   a well-connected entity that responds efficiently to the needs of its
   citizens by developing an integrated back-office infrastructure. Cities
   are implementing smart and innovative means to improve quality of life
   and enhance competitiveness. Various measures are being taken to provide
   transparent, efficient, innovative and responsive government through
   adoption of various Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
   tools. Stuttgart, located in south-west of Germany is no exception which
   started its E-Government initiative a decade ago, has today crossed
   significant milestones. Various e-services platforms are created to
   inform and assist citizens and e-transaction platforms are created to
   reduce the burden on existing staff in various departments. These
   services have shown remarkable results in management of some areas such
   as waste, mobility, human resource, etc. These platforms are still
   evolving and being created and developed after a thorough research,
   planning and consultative process with various stakeholders. Stuttgart
   has been successful in extending the reach of services digitally to its
   citizens and promoting a sense of sustainability. This city takes care
   of wide spectrum of administrative, political and social services
   through diverse ICT and Geographic Information System (GIS) platforms.
   Stuttgart is hub of high-tech auto industry and also known for its
   advanced ICT industry and highly innovative green technologies. This
   sense of sustainability is also reflected in adoption of environmental
   friendly practices which are being supported by befitting e-democracy
   and E-Governance measures. The objective of this paper is to review
   process of formation of E-Government services in Germany and the key
   milestone related to development of E-governance in Stuttgart. An case
   of best practices in mobility is presented to ascertain if Stuttgart
   leads its way to be a smart city.}},

Abstract = {{How are defined Internet art practices contextualized in free culture?
   This is the question to respond on these pages. The correlation between
   art Internet and proposals developed from environments of free culture
   can be taken into account as an inexcusably very close relationship.
   Both lines of cultural development have been intertwined since its
   origins and its nexus is an effort to disengage from the current
   institutional cultural paradigm legitimized by cultural industries,
   seeking a more open and plural intellectual framework in which the
   democratizing actions prescribed strategies singular characteristics.
   The results shown here are part of an investigation focused on the
   analysis of the relation between free culture and Internet art, which
   defines its essential characteristics. The characteristics deduced from
   this study of secondary sources and from interviews with four experts
   linked to relevant contexts: Remedios Zafra, writer and anthropologist,
   university Associate Professor of Art, Innovation and Digital Culture;
   Juan Martin Prada, university Associate Professor and specialist in
   contemporary art esthete; And finally, Pedro Jimenez and Felipe G. Gil,

   provide excellent structures to study the way that learners act within

   gamers information that helps them in game play. We refer to this
   process of walkthrough creation as digital maker culture. This study
   explored the phenomena of digital maker culture through a multiple case

   created walkthrough repositories on YouTube. Findings suggest multiple
   levels of experience are needed when players are involved in digital
   maker communities. These multiple levels of experience are (a) to engage
   in creating designs for immediate prototypes, (b) to belong to cultural
   environments that foster collaboration and sharing, and (c) use common
   design standards. This has implications that could inform innovative
   instructional practices with digital tools in school environments, in
   order to foster a more collaborative, participatory classroom experience}},

Abstract = {{This explanatory analysis of the relevant literature seeks to identify
   factors affecting quality in massive open online courses (MOOCs). The
   paper highlights sub-dimensions of quality in MOOCs using the ladder of
   analytical abstraction. Communication, trust, collaboration,
   inclusiveness, innovation, and commitment are identified as key elements
   in developing a quality culture in online education. In seeking to merge
   the organizational and pedagogical aspects of online education, MOOCs
   raise new questions concerning personalization, widening recruitment,
   internationalization or globalization, and lifelong learning. However,
   the pedagogical aspects of MOOCs remain insufficiently described and
   explored. As MOOCs are now a significant presence in digital education,
   it is essential to understand learners' experiences and participation in
   such courses}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence of the new technologies, twenty-first-century

   traditional storytelling with new technologies. This study was designed
   to compare the conceptual understanding of preschool students in DST
   classrooms with children in traditional storytelling classrooms. A
   pre-test, post-test control group design was used. Data were collected
   from 149 preschool children using pre-and post-test surveys and
   students' drawings. The findings indicate that DST improved the

Abstract = {{The digital economy is currently perceived as the industry having the
   potential to unleash impulses to restart economic growth and to
   modernize the structure of the EU GDP. The aim of the paper is to
   present a simplified analysis of selected factors identified as
   positively influecing the innovation potential of the Visegrad region as
   well as create favorable conditions for the development of the digital
   economy. Methodology of the analysis consists in creating a radar chart
   which projects the average state of 10 sub-indicators for the V4
   countries. Among the selected sub-indicators, we analyzed the number of
   people with average or high rates of digital skills, the number of
   persons who created computer program or web page, public spending on
   research and development in the field of ICT, companies employing ICT
   specialists and others. We consider these factors to be relevant for the
   development of the digital economy and we graphically compare their
   actual state in the V4 and EU.}},

   media. Drawing on an archive of videos posted to YouTube during the
   programme's first two seasons, I show how young video makers re-imagine
   the programme's post-feminist aesthetics. Gossip Girl fan videos
   frequently seek to create emotional intensity through repetition of
   close-ups on the female face. They also use innovative digital editing
   techniques to alter television's realist aesthetic and portray split,
   fragmented, or contradictory subjects. This focus on the face and
   amplification of affect cuts out the source text's emphasis on the
   teenage body as a vehicle for product placement, and challenges the
   neoliberal privileging of economic success and independence. At the same
   time, the videos also contain their own limitations, reproducing the
   young female body as a site of spectacle.}},

Title = {{Alternative futures of global governance: scenarios and perspectives
   from the Global South}},
Journal = {{FORESIGHT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{125-142}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical and
   informative exploration of the emerging roles and rising influence of
   the Global South in shaping the future of global governance.
   Specifically, it inquires into the following questions: How is the
   Global South impacting the way we govern globally? What are the pushers,
   pulls and weights to the futures of global governance? Using Jim Dator's
   alternative futures archetype, what is the future of global governance?
   What are the emerging issues and trends?
   Design/methodology/approach - It uses Sohail Inayatullah's futures
   triangle to map the drivers - the pushes, pulls and weights of global
   governance and Jim Dator's archetypes - continued economic growth,
   collapse, conserver and transformation - to imagine and construct
   alternative futures of global governance.
   Findings - The futures triangle analysis maps and reveals three diverse
   but causally linked Global South narratives of global governance. The
   pulls of the future include the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
   Africa leading the way, and emerging economies reinforcing the
   pluralization of global governance discourses and systems. New
   governance regimes create new global governance dynamics and North -
   South relations. Their increasing social, political and economic clout
   leads to new governance structures. The Global South's rising human
   development index, economic growth, decreasing financial reliance, the
   rise of minilateralism and South - South cooperation is a push of the
   present. Weights are recurring financial constraints, their lack of
   technical capacity, existing international laws, stagnating bureaucracy,
   poverty, domestic issues and state centrism (among others). Four
   alternative global governance scenarios emerge: a harmonious world is
   everybody's business - a state-centric and economic growth global
   governance future. Here, the dynamics of global governance remain the
   same as zero-sum thinking informs the rules of the game. In dangerous
   transitions and the rise of the rest, however, the status quo is
   disrupted as power shifts rapidly and detrimentally. Then, in mosaic of
   the old structure, the South embraces protectionism, and the old
   vanguards return. Finally, in all boats rise substantially, power is
   redistributed as emerging states gain larger, formal (and informal)
   leadership roles in global governance. The global world order is
   re-designed for the Global South. A world parliament is created and
   stronger regional confederation or unions emerge.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper extensively utilizes
   existing and emerging literature, official reports, blogs,interviews,
   books and other digital texts on global governance. The sources
   relevance is analyzed using the futures triangle tool and dissected to
   present four detailed scenarios using Dator's alternative futures
   archetype. This study seeks to initially explore alternative futures of
   global governance from the perspective of the Global South. While some
   studies have approached the topic, only a few authors have addressed
   global governance using futures tools and methods. The goal of this
   research is to map and explore some alternative futures of global
   governance. The paper is less useful in predicting what lies ahead. Its
   intention is to highlight the ``rise of the different{''} and to create
   a space for more meaningful conversations on global governance.
   Practical implications - This research could provide futurists,
   policy-makers, international relations scholars and global governance
   advocates some alternative narratives, frameworks and images of global
   governance. While it does not offer any specific structures and
   solutions, it offers a number of emerging issues and perspectives from
   the Global South that decision- makers and institutions might want to
   consider as they rethink global governance.
   Social implications - This paper highlights the emerging roles and
   perspectives of the Global South in global governance. It identifies
   some ``trading zones{''} and ``emerging issues{''} that may inspire
   actors to create new global governance spaces, innovate alternative
   narratives and design new frameworks of global governance.
   Originality/value - It maps and constructs some plausible scenarios of
   global governance that emphasize Global South perspectives while using
   futures tools and methods.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter explores the possible role of microfoundations (social,
   cultural, and institutional factors) as a determinant of electronic
   government. While earlier research has implied that microfoundations
   might be critical to e-government, this research presents an approach to
   assessing how technology interacts with societal factors in creating (or
   not creating) e-government success. The findings suggest that
   e-government development depends not only on strict technological and
   economic capacity but also on fertile social and institutional
   environment that facilitate the development of e-government. These
   findings support the basic premise that e-government does not exist in a
   vacuum and these soft factors and attributes create an environment that
   directs the outcomes of e-government. This enriches previous research on
   e-government acceptance such as Diffusion of Innovation Theory (Rogers,
   1983) and the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989) and extends it
   to national and international realms.}},

Abstract = {{Malaysia was one of the early adopters of Internet technology to steer
   innovation policy in a direction that is making the country become a
   knowledge-based economy. This notion of knowledge-based economy driven
   by ICT is best exemplified by the borderless connectivity,
   interactivity, and networking. Since the middle of 1990s, there have
   been gradual but systematic public and private sector initiatives
   towards ICT agenda with the prominent role of the state. This chapter
   aims to unpack ICT developments and examine the implications of the
   post-MSC formation for Malaysia and its associated issues and
   challenges. Second, the discussion provides an overview of MSC
   performance and its importance for enhancing growth, trade, and
   investment; reducing the digital gap; nurturing innovation; and
   achieving more inclusive societies. Third, some issues and challenges in
   MSC development are also highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{This a commonly headache issue in our life, that is before dinners,
   meetings, movies, visits, or even only a walk, we all hesitate or
   finally annoyed on question ``What am I gonna wear today?{''} Imaging
   such a scenario, a fashionable lady is called to meet her boyfriend when
   she is working in the office. Right after, she is going back home to
   well prepare for the date. After several try-ons and comparisons, she
   picks a simple but elegant shirt. She is standing in front of a
   full-length mirror, and trying clothes one by one for hours. Meanwhile,
   her boyfriend is urging her to come over. But still, there are no
   trousers to match it. Finally, both of them may get a bad mood or even
   worth, they quarrel with each other for not coming on time. This is a
   common problem for almost everyone, especially for lady, that they have
   serious difficulties to make decision on which clothes to wear, or match
   their clothes, every time, every day. But now, a gospel, named the Smart
   Dressing Mirror, designed by the Lab of Intelligent Computing at Beijing
   Institute of Technology, China, appears for you, with some of fantastic
   functionalities that you need. This is also what we introduced today, a
   future ideas of your life in the new era of smart. Generally, this Smart
   Dressing Mirror is nearly the same as the traditional full-length mirror
   in every home in appearance, and the only difference is that the smart
   dressing mirror has some smart functions, which can interactive with you
   or be friend with you. Given that all your clothes are digitalized
   firstly after you bought it, and the digitalized image can be captured
   from the homepage of the clothes shop or pictured and normalized by the
   camera hidden in the top of the smart mirror. After that, with simple
   gestures, you can interactive with the smart mirror, and picking those
   digitalized clothes as you wish. You can see whether it fits or not.
   Furthermore, with its equipped machine learning and computer vision
   technologies, the Smart Mirror will recommend you a bunch of fashionable
   and suitable upper/lower clothes for you. For example: 1) when you
   choose an upper/lower clothes, the system will recommend you a bunch of
   matched lower/upper ones; 2) when you tell the mirror which scenario you
   will go for, it will also suggest you a series of clothes. At the same
   time, clothes from e-Shopping stores will also be recommended. You can
   buy it immediately, and it will be delivered to you as soon as possible.
   This is what we offer, a fantastic smart dressing mirror, to replace the
   traditional mirror in every home, in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless LANs using Wi-Fi technology are now very common in indoor
   environments, making it unprecedentedly convenient and low-cost for
   users accessing digital services on the Internet. Wi-Fi signals are
   typically information carriers between a transmitter and a receiver,
   lots of signal features can be extracted from measurements of the
   transmitted signals to develop numerous innovative applications.
   Focusing on devicefree passive detection using Wi-Fi technology, in this
   paper, we provide a review of existing works that were done for
   detecting human motion indoor by classifying these research efforts into
   three categories according to the used wireless signal features.
   Specifically, we first describe the Wi-Fi signal features that are
   frequently used for device-free detection of human mobility in indoor
   environments, including RSSI, CSI and TOF. We then separate existing
   work into three categories according to these wireless signal features.
   A set of potential applications that can be developed within this new
   open research area of device-free passive human mobility detection will
   be proposed. Finally, we will discuss existing research challenges and
   point out possible research directions.}},

   the changes that are currently taking place in the traditional model of
   the Design Studio as a result of the integration of new forms of
   professional practice and the implementation of various pedagogical
   approaches (Distance Learning, Blended Learning and Problem-Based
   Learning) in the training of architects.
   This paper focuses on some of the driving factors that are currently
   present in the professional practice and their impact on the teaching of
   architecture. Especially it analyzes the evolution of the traditional
   model of the Design Studio to new types of learning spaces that are more
   interdisciplinary, interdependent and interconnected. Finally, some

   construction of web spaces for shared funeral rituals and their
   partecipation by those same communities that move across the network. It
   can be assumed a new resacralization process of rituals referring to an
   individual system of meanings. The web may be capable of reappropriating
   the experience of pain through new ways that allow flexible access and
   fruition without spatial or temporal limits. They are interactive
   rituals that build an elective sociality, as practiced by the inclusion
   decisions under emotionally meaningful groups. The search for a digital
   alter ego that will survive the earthly physicality threatens to tarnish
   the very identity of the dead}},

Abstract = {{Is it possible to combine the teaching of Classics with Information and
   Communication Technologies? The following work tends to demonstrate how
   ICT can be effective and innovative tool for the teaching/learning of
   disciplines that, generally, are relegated to a static and myth-filled
   past, away from the dynamism of contemporary frenzy. Nowadays, teachers'
   challenge is to integrate two worlds, two tools, paper make book and
   computer, to uncover the potential and the characteristics of the
   digital. Salmar Kahn (2013), founder of the Kahn Academy a free
   world-class education for anyone anywhere, emphasises that the aim is
   not to replace traditional lectures but, rather, mix the virtual with
   the physical. ICT at school can serve to enhance collaborative
   experiences and critical thinking. The web does not guarantee a more
   effective learning; the web is a tool that has to be integrated with
   effective pedagogical approaches to promote language learning (Reeves,
   1998). ICTs when used as support for the teaching of classical
   languages, make the learning experience smoother, wide, expandable,
   versatile and customized.}},

Abstract = {{The increase of visualisation tools gives us the opportunity to improve
   students understanding of the concept of time. There are many
   applications online for timelines. Images, texts, videos and other
   multimedia material can be integrated to them in order to explain the
   notion of time in a particular space or place studying any fact, place,
   characteristic or institution background. Thus, our students can manage
   useful materials of formal and informal learning using different
   learning collaborative strategies and crowd sourcing data using
   timelines. This paper explores the possibilities of Dipity timeline in
   the framework of the work on the cloud as part of the reflection on the
   ``School on the Cloud: connecting education to the cloud for digital
   citizenship{''} project (543221-LLP-1-2013-1-GRKA3-KA3NW) financed by

   It demonstrates how an interactive visual chronology on Dipity helps the
   understanding of the concept of time and promotes active methodology
   from different strategies. The adequacy of the work results were
   satisfactory, considered in a survey done on students and in-depth

Abstract = {{In an era of MOOCs and flipped classrooms, lecture capture (though a
   popular choice with an increasing number of institutions) can often be a
   dull and passive experience for students who are required to watch
   lengthy films, often showing a static view of a lecturer speaking at a
   lectern, in their own time. There is no opportunity for interaction, and
   the length of the lecture is often detrimental to the student experience
   as the human brain cannot retain more than a small percentage of
   information relayed over such a long time span.
   Cardiff University's School of Healthcare Sciences (HCARE) has developed
   a number of online lecture capture resources for students, but using an
   interactive approach. Footage is broken into a series of fifteen to
   twenty minute chunks, with interactive elements such as quizzes, drag
   and drop activities and text input areas (where students can record
   thoughts and feedback) placed between each `chunk'. Once students have
   worked through a film clip and its associated activities (thereby
   self-assessing what they have learnt) they can move on to the next clip,
   and so on.
   At the start of the activity students can download any presentation
   slides used in the lecture and at the end students are given links to
   relevant websites and to a lecture-based discussion forum where students
   can comment, ask and even answer peers' questions. Fora such as this
   also assist in eradicating any sense of isolation an online student may
   feel, as it becomes the digital backbone of an asynchronous community.}},

Abstract = {{As a passionate educator, I am interested in using art, design and
   technology to create innovative and engaging learning environments. I
   believe school classrooms and environments need to be aesthetically
   designed, to trigger positive emotional attachments to educational
   spaces. This will allow for understanding, recall and recognition,
   engagement, problem solving, and communication.
   The classroom environment has a powerful influence on learning, and
   student's perceptions of that environment can \textbackslash{}influence
   their behaviour. If an environment is limited in opportunities for
   exploration and involvement, the potential for learning is also limited.
   Classroom's need to be spaces that are interdisciplinary learning
   resources used to inspire and relate to curriculum through engaging
   graphics.
   It is necessary for all educators to understand the link between
   learning environment and learning experience. A student's perception of
   a learning environment can affect their ability to absorb information.
   Transforming classrooms into interdisciplinary resources for learning
   will provide opportunities for interactivity and promote high levels of
   engagement. Incorporating writable surfaces and digital displays in
   classroom design, will create stimulating environments. Students will be
   encouraged to become actively involved in the learning process as
   diverse experiences of all students will be brought into play during
   problem solving, increasing the richness of ideas explored.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an innovative methodology based on the so-called community
   reporting (Barron Hernandez, Smith and Wilson, 2012 Muooz and
   Bartoletti, 2012) is described. This methodology use social technologies
   that allow students to become reporters of the science and technology
   inputs in Secondary Education. The potential is based on how
   students-reporters are transmitting to their context the major advances
   in scientific research and technological innovation developed in the
   research centers of their immediate community.
   A group of Master Degree (Preservice teachers-in Seconday Education)
   students participated in the experiment, by developing training
   proposals, teaching units that include community reporters methodology.
   Finally the ``Scienc@ Reporters{''} website designed from this
   innovative project is described. This virtual platform aims to be a
   connecting link between Secondary Schools and research centers, where
   resources and innovative experiments are collected and presented based
   on investigative reporting, so that they can inspire new training
   practices in STEM education, especially in the areas of science and
   technology.
   The degree of innovation of the project and its scientific and technical
   relevance goes beyond school impacts, by including the dissemination of
   knowledge and interest in science to the broad segment of the public.
   The Web platform provide visibility to the interviews that the high
   school students carry out to different scientists, researchers and
   technicians in their local community. In the short term, this online
   platform, with its various communication channels and social networks
   exchange will allow the creation and promotion of opportunities for
   collaboration and digital learning.}},

Abstract = {{The Clinical-Basic Sessions (CBS) are a compulsory practical activity of
   the new Degree in Medicine course curriculum of the Complutense
   University of Madrid. They are integrated in the strategy of transversal
   competences improvement. Students can participate in a team work
   studying and presenting a clinical case as speakers or, if they are
   students of the sixth course, as tutors, or can act as listener
   assessors of the public presentation of the cases and the speakers.
   Teachers can participate tutoring a case and evaluating the students
   participating in it, or can act as speakers' assessors in a classroom
   where other clinical cases are presented.
   In 2013/2014, important changes in the evaluation process and the
   evaluation criteria were introduced. First of all, objective tools were
   used so that students knew which aspects will be evaluated and
   evaluators had a guide for assessment. Two rubrics were created, one for
   the continuous evaluation of the students in each clinical case (rubric
   A), and the other one for listener assessors to evaluate the speakers'
   presentation (rubric B). Also, the continuous evaluation was made not
   only by tutor teachers but also by the team students (peer evaluation).
   Secondly, the evaluation became telematic. Rubrics A and B were
   transferred into forms A and B using Google Drive. This way, evaluators
   have to complete the forms to do their assessment. The attendance
   control system need to be implemented in order to prove the listener
   assessor's participation. For this purpose, a double code system was set
   up, one for each case and a second one for each case's assessor. Both
   codes were needed to complete the on line forms.
   A new figure was created to inform participants correctly, the Tutor
   Students for the Evaluation Control, a sixth course student who was
   assigned to no clinical case. Its role was very important: giving
   information properly to the working teams, explaining what the rubrics
   are and the student assessor role, informing the listener evaluators in
   the classrooms, managing the attendance control and explaining how to
   digitalize the assessments. Also, assessors were asked to complete the
   satisfaction surveys included in the forms. Several documents were
   prepared and uploaded to a Virtual Campus space to make their tasks
   easier.
   39 students worked as Tutor Students for the Evaluation Control,
   explaining the new system to 104 teams of teachers and students and
   managing the 26 classrooms where 52 cases were presented. Positive
   results were achieved. There were no incidents even though the massive
   participation. Actually, 33\% of the enrolled students in the degree
   participated in the clinical cases and 70\% took part as listener
   assessors. The electronic forms were sent promptly, collecting 50\% of
   the shipments between the 4th and 7th day. Also, participation in the
   surveys surpassed 90\%. Finally, 70\% of the survey's respondents,
   declared to recommend maintaining the evaluation system. We can conclude
   that the new figure has achieved its aims, contributing definitely to
   the implementation of CBS evaluation implementation. In spite of its
   success, it is necessary to continue working to implement the rubrics
   and to drive forward into learning by assessing.}},

Abstract = {{The Division of Foreign Languages at Tel Aviv University offers courses
   for academic purposes in approximately fifteen languages. Over the past
   six years, most English instructors in the division have incorporated
   blended learning principles in their courses, using Moodle as the
   exclusive LMS (learning management system), while teachers of other
   languages have been slow to follow suit. Since 2011, however, Spanish
   and Turkish instructors have taken the initiative to adapt Moodle in
   innovative ways, hoping to encourage teachers of other languages to do
   the same in their courses.
   In this digital age where Kindle is more popular than printed literature
   and course websites have replaced traditional textbooks, the question
   arises as to what is the ideal format for such a website. What
   parameters should be considered when designing a course for blended
   language learning and how should its contents be formatted? How can
   course design help enhance reading and writing and engender meaningful
   communication in the target language?
   The aim of this paper is to illustrate an effective, user-friendly way
   of organizing materials (readings, videos, grammar and vocabulary
   lessons as well as forums and custom made on-line tests) for language
   teaching using the Moodle platform. A university Turkish course will be
   presented as a model for blended language learning and the advantages of
   the proposed layout will be discussed. The guidelines given here will
   help language teachers design an aesthetically appealing course website.
   Ideally, this website will be both engaging and enriching, and students
   will be eager to explore its contents, in which educational materials
   will be easy to locate. Thus, teachers will gain confidence and will be
   inspired to develop their own uniquely tailored websites, meant to cater
   to the specific needs of their classroom populations.}},

Abstract = {{E-books have been garnering fans at a rapid pace since they were
   designed in 1971. Their convenience is enormously attractive to today's
   busy students and to technologically-savvy millennialage learners. Once
   primarily used for pleasure reading, E-books have additionally become a
   strong emerging tool for learning and reading in modern contemporary
   classrooms as well as school libraries. School leaders strive to employ
   the most successful communication and teaching strategies possible using
   generational and cultural demographic characteristics. Therefore, the
   E-book is attractive as a means to appeal to elementary and secondary
   school students. With the increased usage of the Ebook, one might assume
   that the role of the librarian is diminishing; however, the role of the
   librarian is actually becoming more significant as the librarian
   connects users with E-Books and other emerging technologies.
   Yesteryear's school librarian was regarded primarily as the custodian of
   the books. However, today's school librarian is a vital member of the
   literacy team in today's instructional climate, making decisions
   regarding the purchase and usage of reading materials and tools to
   support literacy instruction as well as to satisfy patron demand. Due to
   budgetary constraints, all literacy and reading materials must be
   evaluated carefully and assessed with the needs of learners. This paper
   explores the school librarian's role in accessing, using, and promoting
   E-books in innovative ways with the purpose of engaging
   technologically-oriented learners. When purchasing any curricular
   materials designed to enhance literacy, it is reasonable to analyze the
   potential gains and challenges.
   This paper will examine how E-books apply the Five Areas of Focus
   (recommended by the National Reading Panel) which benefit reading
   instruction and learning in today's modern classrooms and school
   libraries. E-Books support reading instruction by assisting with
   phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.
   Specifically, this discourse explores how E-Books bolster reading
   education for the digital generation through this framework.
   Nevertheless, with the implementation of any educational media, there
   are factors and limitations to consider. This paper will additionally
   discuss the points for consideration when integrating E-Books into the
   curriculum and the school library.}},

Abstract = {{The digital divide refers to socio-economic inequalities between people
   who have access to information technology (e.g., computers and Internet
   access) and those who lack such resources. A growing need for technology
   education necessitates curricula for breaking down the digital divide,
   particularly in areas in which such education has been scarce. Recent
   efforts have focused on programmatic solutions that bring technology
   education to regions that are lacking. For example, a mobile computer
   lab called the Brilliant Bus provides under-privileged communities
   access to digital resources. In addition, Computers for Families has
   provided refurbished desktop computers and computer-skills training to
   low-income families in an effort to improve digital literacy. Other
   programs have focused on providing technology resources to schools in
   under-developed countries (e.g., Kano and One Laptop Per Child). This
   paper presents a cooperative project between Spanish and Computer
   Science undergraduate university students completing a service-learning
   course in the Dominican Republic. Students and faculty collaborated to
   a) develop and facilitate a Spanish-language curriculum for junior-high
   and high-school students at a summer technology camp and b) collect pre
   and post-test data about the effectiveness of the program. Following the
   self-organized learning environment (SOLE) method, Dominican students
   collaborated in small groups on technology-related activities alongside
   university mentors from the United States specializing in either Spanish
   language or Computer Science. Spanish students served as camp
   facilitators while Computer Science students designed and supported
   underlying technologies for the program. This collaborative effort
   between populations of disparate interests and backgrounds set out to
   change perceptions of technology among the Dominican participants. Low
   cost devices, including the Raspberry Pi and the Android XO tablet, were
   used to introduce basic concepts of computing to camp attendees.
   Applications such as Scratch were used to introduce programming through
   the creation of interactive stories and games, while the introduction of
   HTML allowed participants to build and edit content for their school
   website. Pre and post-test data were collected from a questionnaire
   aimed at examining the effectiveness of this two week program.
   Paired-sample t-tests revealed significant differences in the Dominican
   students' perceptions about the usefulness of technology in school and
   the workplace after participating in this technology education program.
   Findings also suggested differences in gender and the importance of
   using technology in more personally meaningful ways when encouraging
   STEM initiatives. Spanish students gained valuable contact hours as
   interlocutors in this immersive program, and Computer Science students
   were afforded the opportunity to apply their technical knowledge while
   giving back to an economically repressed community with limited access
   to technology resources and education. All students benefited from this
   innovative approach to interdisciplinary service-learning, and gained
   valuable skills in critical thinking and problem solving. This paper
   will provide an overview of an empirically-based case study, identifying
   successful teaching methods and curricula for promoting technology
   education in areas with limited access to digital technologies and
   Internet connectivity in an effort to break down the digital divide.}},

Abstract = {{``We must do more to ensure that young people in particular have digital
   skills which they need for their future. Opening up education is about
   opening minds to new ways of learning, so that our young people have a
   better chance of finding a job, to be more creative, more innovative and
   to have entrepreneurial skills{''} said Androulla Vassiliou, European
   Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, on
   September 25, 2013.
   Engineering design is based on three coordinates (quality, cost,
   delivery time) expressing, ultimately, the essential requirements for a
   rapid processing capacity and interaction which are facilitated by
   computers. Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Manufacturing
   (CAM) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) are common technologies and
   without their use the ambitions set out above remain utopian.
   Computer aided design is interactivity, modelling, scientific
   visualization, which get the picture and provide study models of various
   processes or phenomena inaccessible to direct observation. Engineering
   design belongs to fundamental engineering knowledge and use of
   CAD-CAM-CAE techniques with the concept of Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
   provides the designer a complete freedom of imagination, of products'
   representation regardless their complexity. It appears, therefore, the
   opportunity to apply analytical methods that provide information on
   product behaviour in different operating conditions, enabling
   anticipation and correction of errors that can occur in the production
   process. The designer is thus able to propose solutions to improve the
   technology of the production process and optimization of functional
   parameters of the product.
   This paper aims at highlighting the manner the curriculum of bachelor
   degree specialization ``Marine Equipment and Systems{''} from
   ``Ovidius{''} University of Constanta integrates in his content, for all
   years of study, the fundamental and specialized disciplines designed to
   develop the skills and to deliver the professional competence on using
   CAD-CAM-CAE techniques. It will present an analysis of curriculum
   content also from the perspective of compliance with the mandatory norms
   and performance indicators that Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in
   Higher Education requires by imposing specific standards. Successful
   students' projects, best practice examples of collaborations with the
   economic environment in this direction will be presented and opinions of
   employers on skills, competencies and performance of graduates who were
   employed and integrated in engineering design activities will be
   expressed.}},

Abstract = {{As a result of the accelerated technological development that occurs all
   around us in the digital age, we are required to adapt to frequent
   changes in our environment. The majority of teaching staff in teacher
   training programs was not born into the digital-informational
   revolution, and so must undergo training themselves to prepare for
   digital proficiency. The education system must therefore modify its
   teaching methods for the oncoming wave of digitally-proficient students,
   their skills, experiences and needs. This study aims to explore the way
   lecturers cope with technological-pedagogical change processes during
   their teaching and tutoring and adapt the teaching methods to the
   present age.
   86 educators and 186 students filled an online questionnaire, with
   questions tailored to each group. The questionnaire included
   quantitative as well as qualitative, open questions. In addition, 11
   interviews were conducted. Data analysis was performed with both
   quantitative and qualitative tools.
   The study results indicate that about 10\% of the students and 30\% of
   the lecturers report difficulties in adapting to new technologies. While
   both students and educators agree that experiencing new technological
   environments is an important step toward a different educational future,
   lecturers and students do not have enough knowledge about essential
   pedagogical changes which are part of the technological revolution of
   the 21st century and about the skills they will require in order to cope
   with the new reality.}},

Abstract = {{Language acquisition is a process which is influenced by cognitive,
   attitudinal, demographic, linguistic and experiential factors.
   At the time of globalization, structural change occurred with the advent
   of the technological revolution, the subsequent introduction of
   innovative tools in teaching, have transformed the concept of learning.
   At the web's century youngers, ``digital natives{''}, are creating a
   kind of ``parallel school{''} not only to access to knowledge, to
   collaborate with users and discuss, but also to teach and learn
   languages through social networks, blogs, fora and communities, as if
   they were in a virtual classroom.
   As to the acquisition of Spanish as a L2, analysing the most recent web
   platforms dedicated to teaching and learning of Spanish online (Palabea,
   Livemocha, Youtube, ConversationExchange. com, Mango, Skype), we focused
   on the most famous social network of our time: Facebook, to underline
   that the teaching and learning process of foreign languages, in our case
   Spanish, has become a ``social activity{''} based on support and mutual
   cooperation.
   The aim of this paper is to investigate those Facebook's pages that are
   designed to teach and learn Spanish; among them the largest and most
   active community of Italian students of Spanish has allowed us to deepen
   our investigation through the publication of an online test giving us
   the opportunity to have a clearer picture about the users, their
   relationship with the fan page and their level of language.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years the usage and dependency on Internet has
   drastically increased, as well as applications based on it, and this
   fact has had an immediate impact in the field of education. Moreover,
   the transition from the Web 1.0 to the Web 2.0 has involved an important
   change in the way in which applications are used; both students and
   teachers become editors and are able to develop their own contents.
   Current students live in a permanent digital environment, using
   smartphones, digital cameras and Internet. These students use blogs,
   play video games in 3D environments, listen to their podcasts, keep in
   touch with his friends continuously, use modern instant communication
   media and take information up quickly from images, videos and text of
   multiple sources. All this current technology revolution is a very
   interesting tool that can help teachers to create enriched and
   collaborative working environments taking into account the different
   learning necessities.
   Learning in the current context is much more than the comprehension of
   knowledge transmitted by books and teachers which requires the student
   to assume personal responsibility for building and communicating
   knowledge with others.
   There are a large number of applications and innovative services based
   on the Web 2.0 concept which can be used in the educational field. In
   this paper, some of the most interesting examples are going to be
   presented: blogs, wikis, podcasting, social networks, multimedia
   sharing, digital whiteboards and learning platforms based on virtual
   sites. For each of them, their possible uses in education will be
   discussed.
   Finally, a number of requirements are listed in order to use Web 2.0
   applications. The use of these applications in an educational system
   involves to incorporate technological resources to educational centers
   as well as to train teachers in their usage. However, this is not enough
   and an important change in the way of teaching is necessary. To create,
   share, participate and collaborate are very positive aspect which may
   allow the education community to adapt to the new knowledge society.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative learning methods as well as research projects dissemination
   can be achieved by digital technology. AR (Augmented Reality) can play a
   key role in the education field in order to transmit knowledge to young
   generations. AR is used to develop a playing cards game for children
   based on energy saving topics within the DIMMER (District Information
   Modelling and Management for Energy Reduction) European Project, where
   energy consumption awareness is one of its main aims. The DIMMER system
   enables the integration of BIM (Building Information Modelling),
   distribution network models, real-time data from sensors and user
   feedback through QR Codes and web portals. The energy performance of
   buildings is analysed from their actual utilization and especially from
   users' feedback. Despite pervasive sensors implementation is a necessary
   tool to monitor buildings, the more effective way to reach real energy
   saving is to pursue user awareness and promote good practices in energy
   using. In fact, energy information sharing has been intended as the main
   focus in the DIMMER game, since children can adopt good habits that will
   be reflected on adults behaviour. The game conception has been reached
   by the collaboration between Politecnico di Torino and Primo Liceo
   Artistico Statale, as well as the staging of a theatrical show about
   these issues. In this way a connection between University and High
   School has been established about current research topics and the uses
   of new technologies for pedagogical purposes. AR is investigated in
   order to promote an interactive game for children in which the
   differences between good and bad practices in terms of sustainability
   and energy efficiency are discussed. It indeed turns out to be an
   effective means of communication with immediate impact on children
   learning. Cards are characterized by markers which are linked to 3D
   models through a specific software that enables their visualization on
   personal devices in AR. In the game, natural elements that are capable
   to generate energy (sun, fire, earth, water and wind) define the seed of
   every card. Attractive and colourful figures are used to represent
   renewable energy sources and their applications, while dark images
   represent the most polluting solutions. The DIMMER game purpose is not
   to pick up the higher number of cards, but saving energy through
   positive figures, avoiding those that involve pollution generation. This
   kind of approach establishes an interaction between children and the
   energy problem by encouraging active learning through the game and
   raising their awareness. Children are stimulated by AR multimedia
   elements that make learning more interesting and entertaining.}},

Abstract = {{Although there are many policies for OER in individual HE institutions,
   both across Europe and worldwide, there are relatively few national or
   international policies related to open education which specifically
   identify OER. Many of the policies listed in the Creative Commons
   registry are either merely declarations of intent, or policy statements
   that lack clear strategies for implementation. Where national policies
   do exist their scope is often limited to open access to publicly funded
   HE research. There is a general dearth of policies related to either the
   schools or VET (college) sectors.
   Whilst OER policies may be in relatively short supply, open education
   initiatives - often referring specifically to OER - are not. The POERUP
   (Policies for OER Uptake) research(1) has identified, catalogued and
   mapped over 500 OER and MOOC initiatives, almost all of them active. The
   EU initiative Opening Up Education {[}1] identifies OER as a driver of
   open education and lists a broad range of Key Transformative Actions for
   delivering this.
   In the years following the 2002 UNESCO Forum on Open Courseware, a small
   number of European national governments funded initiatives to promote
   the uptake of OER - notably the Netherlands with Wikiwijs(2), the UK
   with the Jisc OER programme(3) and Poland with the Digital book
   programme for schools(4). However, when the economic recession affected
   Europe in 2008 state funding started to dry up and has not started to
   flow significantly again. The UNESCO policy guidelines for the
   development of open access {[}2] have yet to bear much fruit in Europe.
   Even so, the POERUP research indicates that although state funding is
   limited or non-existent, many regional and institutional OER initiatives
   have continued to develop `under the radar'.
   This paper draws on this POERUP research and the POERUP overview of OER

Abstract = {{In a logic of inclusive education, equal opportunities to all students
   should be guaranteed and the accessibility of ICT educational tools is
   then to be considered a major issue.
   This paper presents a case study conducted in the context of MAGICAL
   (Making Games in Collaboration for Learning) a research project aimed at
   introducing game-making in formal education as an innovative educational
   approach. Actually, MAGICAL is a multilateral European project that
   investigates the viability and potential added value of Collaborative
   Digital Game Making (CDGM) for learning, especially for supporting
   learners' transversal skills such as collaboration, creativity, problem
   solving and ICT literacy. In the framework of this project, a specific
   game-making environment called MAGOS was designed, developed and
   deployed in different educational contexts with a variety of learners.
   The case study proposed in this paper deals with one of the learners
   involved in these experiments; in particular it discusses around the
   suitability of the interface of the adopted game-making environment in
   respect to the ``special needs{''} of a student with visual impairments.
   G. is an eleven years old boy with albinism. His pathology affects, in
   particular, the visual apparatus, with reduced visual acuity,
   sensitivity to light and nystagmus. As well as all sight-impaired
   students, he has particular and unique visual needs and in order to
   adopt educational tools (and fully benefit from them) he requires
   specific adaptations (as an instance, G. usually adopts the magnifier).
   Within the MAGICAL Project, a game making activity was proposed to G. in
   individual sessions and his responses were monitored. The experimental
   setting was situated at a regular session room of Chiossone
   Rehabilitation Centre, with a desk and PC equipped with specific
   hardware devices. The individual sessions were mainly guided by the
   rehab professional, assisted by a researcher observing and providing
   support, if and when needed.
   In this paper, the usability of the MAGOS educational game-making
   interface is discussed in respect to the needs of this specific child.
   Some general considerations are also drawn about the features that make
   an ICT environment more or less appropriate to students with sight
   impairments and about the general suitability of game-making activities
   for students with this kind of disability.}},

Abstract = {{The Virtual Soil Science Learning Resources (VSSLR) group (soilweb. ca)
   developed an innovative, location-based tool called SOILx that connects
   educational soil science content to specific geographical locations
   through mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. SOILx was
   created by integrating open technologies such as Google Fusion Tables,
   Wikitude Augmented Reality browser and Wordpress content management
   system. SOILx itself is an open education resource (OER) freely
   available under ``Creative Commons{''} (CC) licence for non-profit
   educational and research institutions to utilize or incorporate into
   their own teaching and learning resources. It is an engaging resource
   that supports meaningful learning opportunities, accommodates flexible
   teaching and learning approaches and allows for user-generated content
   to be added to the dynamic database.
   The expanding use of smartphone and tablet usage in Canada and around
   the world opens opportunities to create mobile open learning resources.
   Whereas computers can be expensive, cell phones are readily available,
   affordable and via the internet can provide access to high quality
   educational content that is interactive, engaging and user-generated.
   The design and development of online learning resources for mobile
   devices requires special consideration regarding user experience (UX)
   and usability issues for different platforms and devices. Using
   Wordpress, a responsive website, that is viewable on smartphones,
   tablets and desktops, was created to provide online access to the
   content. Users may also access the content via the augmented reality
   interface, which is free to download on their mobile devices, to find
   and navigate towards the study sites while on-location and access the
   information about each site.
   SOILx allows learners to undertake self-guided field trips and take
   advantage of experiential, hands-on learning at a real life field
   location combined with access to virtual content about that specific
   location. Learners stay connected to the physical world via their
   natural senses (e.g., touch, vision, smell) while at the same time
   having access to, and interacting with, digital information specific to
   their field location.
   A number of target audiences including students, soil scientists and
   professionals, land managers and even avid gardeners can input
   information for more geographical sites that can expand this network
   across the Canada and the world, connecting people interested in soils.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to propose a protocol, a special set
   of rules, which aims to facilitate the task for other teachers who would
   like to incorporate their own multimedia contents into their teaching.
   In today's world, exploring new ideas in teaching is a challenge for
   university faculties. Innovative methods of teaching are a reality in
   most of the institutions of the educational system, not only for
   universities but also at lower levels. This means that every year,
   students enrolling on degree courses are more familiar with new teaching
   methodologies, such as collaborative work, self-regulated learning,
   problem-based learning, on-line learning, MOOCs (massive open online
   courses) or blearning. This situation is a motivator for teachers to
   continue innovating and incorporating new learning and teaching tools.
   This paper presents the experience of creating multimedia academic
   contents to be used as an instrument in b-learning methodology,
   especially in marketing courses. The steps towards achieving quality
   content material as well as the pros and cons of this instrument are
   described. The experience has been very rewarding for the authors who
   belong to the Network-IDOi (Teaching and Research Innovation, University
   of Alicante, Spain) and we encourage fellow faculty members to consider
   technology options for their courses. By incorporating digital media
   elements into the project, students will able to learn more effectively
   since they use multiple sensory modalities, which in the end will
   motivate them to pay more attention to the information presented and
   thus retain the contents better.}},

Abstract = {{M-learning, or mobile learning, is a phenomenon linked to the
   application of mobile digital touch screen devices in the educational
   sphere. Currently portable tablet PC devices provide one means of the
   realisation of mobile learning in the educational context. Schools which
   adopt tablet PC's as a tool for both instruction and learning are not
   only responding to the portable touch screen revolution but are aiming
   to provide their students and teachers with a new innovative experience
   of education which may be more closely aligned with their personal and
   social uses of technology. However, incorporating such a device into the
   daily eco-system of a school comes with its challenges as well as its
   potential benefits and limitations.
   This case study focuses on the teacher and student experiences of using
   tablet PC's (in this case the iPad) as an educational tool in an Irish
   post-primary school. In total there were one hundred and ten
   participants comprising sixteen teachers and ninety four students. The
   research data was collected by means of teacher and student
   questionnaires, teacher and student interviews, as well as a number of
   classroom observations. Key areas of interest from a teaching and
   learning perspective were: perceived benefits and limitations arising
   from the adoption of these devices, experiences in respect of
   student-teacher relationships, as well as classroom management,
   logistical and IT related issues.
   The findings indicate the positivity of participants (both teachers and
   students) based on the benefits perceived as accruing from the adoption
   of these devices. From the teacher perspective the main benefits
   experienced were in respect of personal productivity and efficiency of
   planning and resource management. Student positivity was based on the
   provision of easy and always on access to the Internet with related
   perceived benefits in respect of more varied and more interesting
   approaches to learning encompassing the use of educational apps, games
   and websites as well as more learner centered activities such as the
   creation of presentations and digital media content. Enhanced
   teacherstudent communication via an increased variety of modes was
   viewed by some as having a positive effect on the teacher-student
   relationship. However this relationship was viewed as subject to
   compromise due to the ready availability of distractions from school
   work particularly in the form of social network notifications.
   Overcoming the potential for distraction was viewed as a challenge by
   both teachers and students, with teachers experiencing this as the
   modern incarnation of classroom management issues. A lack of resources
   and limited funding for ancillary hardware and equipment was cited as
   being a significant implementation issue for some teachers.
   Overall this case study reflects the perceived benefits and challenges
   of adopting iPads in the school context and provides some evidence that
   the device can facilitate changes in teacher and student practices
   albeit in the context of existing norms and priorities within the wider
   national system of education. The findings and related recommendations
   provide a small-scale evidence base to inform the perspectives of both
   policy makers and practitioners alike.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is a study based on the Grankit project funded by the European
   Commission (under KA3 ICT/GRUNDTVIG Multilateral) as it has been
   implemented by Euroed Foundation, Iasi, Romania. The Grundtvig
   Multilateral Project helps address one of the world's greatest
   challenges: the ageing of the population, which brings about changes in
   society and family structures. The project raises the issue of `being an
   active citizen' regardless of the age or the role in society by
   exploring the relationships between generations (grandparents and
   grandchildren), encouraging solidarity between these groups and
   promoting strategies for ensuring that the ageing can be positive and
   dynamic. The article analyses the implementation of these generous ideas
   by presenting the innovative courses and products that provide
   accessibility to learning for a group of adults, who otherwise would not
   engage in lifelong learning (senior citizens-grandparents). The article
   highlights the intergenerational learning opportunities and exchanges
   provided by the project. Grandparents have been trained to acquire basic
   ICT skills and use social network groups (such as Facebook) by their
   grandchildren. In their turn grandparents are supported to set up a
   ``Grands Help Desk{''} on the internet, which provides online support to
   children and teenagers (help with homework, personal or family problems,
   bullying etc.).}},

Abstract = {{Globally there is a huge campaign for promoting the Green Economy
   through different ways. But why can't this be through formal education?
   This is a question which arises in order to check how its specific
   procedure was designed. In the frame of formal education there are many
   tools and different methods for learning. ICT's in education gives the
   advantage of the information promoting the knowledge of learners. Social
   media spreads the knowledge and digital tools contribute to skill
   development. Problem Based learning (PBL) is a learning method where the
   learners try to find the solution by themselves, through a collaborative
   problem solving process but with a strong selfmotivated way.
   This paper presents an innovative approach of increasing the awareness
   of Green Economy and provides a viewpoint with regard to the use of
   digital tools to assist learning and qualifications. A workshop where
   digital tools, social media, and PBL methodology has been applied in 5
   different European countries. 136 Vocational Educational Training (VET)
   teachers have participated. The workshops took place during June
   2013-September 2014. The workshops had as a main subject, Green Economy
   using digital tools. For this purpose, the workshops took place in
   organized computer laboratories. All participants had at their
   convenience, a PC with digital tools for making videos. At the beginning
   of the workshops, videos with instructions on how to create a video were
   presented. These videos were available on each PC so that each
   participant had access when it was needed. Subsequently, and using the
   PBL method, each participant was asked to make their own video with a
   theme of something relevant with Green Economy.
   When the workshop ended the participants were asked to evaluate their
   experience. For this purpose a structured questionnaire was given. The
   questionnaire included five parts. The first part was about
   demographics. The second part was closed questions where the
   participants had to score using the scale from 1 to 5 about the
   familiarity with specific concepts and tools. The third part referred to
   the specific workshop experience. The fourth part was the level of
   understanding and familiarity after the workshops were completed, and
   the last part included three further open questions, where the
   participants could express freely their opinions about the procedure. At
   this point we have to notice that the questionnaires were anonymous.
   From the results of the evaluation we can conclude that the participants
   improved their qualification using digital tools and became more
   familiar with Green Economy in a higher level. The encouraging result is
   that after their experience they have revised their opinion about how
   they can promote Green Economy in their classroom and in formal
   education.}},

Abstract = {{In this technological era, many new digital innovations are available to
   us. The aim of this paper is to bring out the effectiveness of an
   application that helps in reducing mental stress and strain of students
   studying in colleges and schools. Nowadays mental illnesses such as
   depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, substance abuse
   etc. are identified as major problems for several students. So, creating
   an app which will either reduce or cure this illness is the need of the
   time
   In the present world there are many websites that provide tips for
   stress management but, these websites are effective or limited for a
   certain level of stress undergone by the students. A student is known as
   the pillar of the society but, we are losing an average of 6 per
   semester in a college. We all know that this suicidal tendency will be
   at a peaks when the feeling to share is minimum Some people may feel shy
   in expressing their problems so, there is a need for an application to
   share our feelings like to a friend and to also help us like a father.
   There should be an app for every college/school with a confidential,
   unique database as well. This app will act as a bridge that conveys the
   problem faced by the students to the right destination that is a
   psychiatrist in case if it is stress related. So, students will be able
   to solve their problems during their academic life.}},

Abstract = {{Several reasons could be given to discuss about the importance of
   evaluating the potential of new digital technologies to incorporate
   visualization for the learning of mathematics. Several reasons also make
   this intention a difficult undertaking. In this work we aim to share the
   experience creating a multidisciplinary team able to give alternatives
   to transform mathematics curriculum to foster the development of
   visualization skills. The presence of emergent technologies - like
   Augmented Reality - is expected when the emphasis in visual aspects to
   trigger processes of mathematical thinking is assumed in these
   visualization skills.
   We focus on the development of certain skills that have not been
   explicit in the curriculum but nevertheless are important when you deal
   with mathematics. We want to make something about this issue and took on
   the task of designing an educational resource improving the development
   of these skills. The experience we share here considers the production
   of an Augmented Reality Application which purpose is to promote the
   spatial visualization skill.
   The necessity of gathering experts using graphical design software,
   programmer specialists and mathematicians skilled in Mathematics
   Education appeared since the beginning. All of them participating
   collaboratively in a creative process for the construction of a
   didactical resource today we're able to share. The application considers
   three levels that could be identified with content in the three first
   calculus courses in college; from 2D to 3D, solids of revolution and 3D
   surfaces.
   Two experiences with students have been conducted in order to appreciate
   the impact of the application's use in the first level, both inside and
   outside classroom. These experiences allowed the improvement of the
   application and the design of a didactical activity using it. Beside the
   motivational aspects that stand out, the usefulness of the integration
   of visualization within the learning process is what motivates us to
   develop qualitative inquiry that could provide feedback about the
   cognitive event promoted by the interaction with this kind of didactical
   resources.
   To transform the learning of Mathematics, to make it an interesting and
   attractive experience in addition to being useful for the development of
   mathematical skills, is the target that keeps us together as a TEAM:

Abstract = {{We present an innovative approach that has been developed by two
   universities; one located within Europe (University of Sevilla) and the
   other in the Latin American context (University Mar del Plata) whose
   purposes: (1) Use the social network Facebook, to develop the role of
   leader or community manager training, in decision-making, and (2) the
   creation of an academic community of internalization. The novelty is
   that we incorporate the definition of the role of community manager, as
   a training leader in online experience on two different continents. The
   sample set 12 students in Seville and 70 in Argentina. The descriptive
   analysis of the data has focused on an analytical web of closed Facebook
   group called ``Powers from the Theory of Empowerment and
   Participation{''}, from now on, we will call COMPETEP. This
   ``territory{''} packs a lot of meaningful information that has been
   analyzed from an ethnographic perspective, using the NVivo software 10.
   The results provide evidence of the role of the Community Manager in our
   learning community. Some of the skills developed are in the role of
   training, such as leader-coordinator, administrator and manager of the
   training strategy set (search for talent manager). The creation of an
   academic community of internalization through collaborative learning,
   made possible in a digital environment with strong social and
   relationship that has prioritized communication and exchange, and in
   this sense the use of social networks has facilitated the process of
   internalization. The results of this study are consistent with previous
   studies on the impact of social networks and university learning
   environments. We highlight the motivational factor as a relevant fact.
   We infer therefore that have designed a place where they have been able
   to meet training needs and, especially, where they have begun to create
   many expectations that have increased and promoted. On the other hand,
   we can not forget the drawbacks we have suffered in the dynamics of
   interaction, the results show that the support and advice of the

Abstract = {{The European/International Joint PhD in Social Representations and
   Communication is a pioneer case of the integration of the triple ``i{''}
   (international, interdisciplinary, intersectoral) transversal dimensions
   of the doctoral training and to discuss the implications of adopting the
   distinct models for the internationalisation of the doctorates and the
   international joint doctorates. Combining its long-term top
   institutional history and its capacity for innovation, this
   well-established European Joint Doctorate, recognised since 1993 within
   the triple framework of Universities, Ministries and the European
   Commission and fully operational since 1996, over the years has grown
   beyond the EU and academic boundaries, thanks to the ``unique{''}
   combination of a EC-approved Joint doctoral programme
   (http://www.europhd.eu) and a Scientific Thematic Network of excellence
   (http://www.europhd.eu/SoReComTHEmaticNETwork).
   This supra-disciplinary area of the social sciences interested in how
   scientific knowledge is transformed by lay people and the media into
   common sense and how it is related to situated practices, has activated
   a conversation among social, human and natural scientists in a wide
   range of international research programmes, concerning public
   understanding of the sciences and discoveries in various fields. The
   ``objects{''} studied have a strong societal impact and important
   applications ``within{''} and ``for{''} society in the political,
   economic and social spheres.
   Currently the European/International Joint PhD in Social Representations
   and Communication is an international, intersectoral and
   interdisciplinary networked doctoral programme led by Sapienza
   University (Italy) in 12 EU (AT, CH, CZ, FR, IT, NL, RO, ES, PT, SE, SK,
   UK) and 6 extra-EU countries from North America (U.S. and CA) and Latin
   America (AR, BR, MX) to China, including 25 universities, IFSTTAR (a
   French national research institute of science and technology for
   transport, development), 2 SME in Sweden and in Italy in diversified
   sectors (communication and marketing) and the multinational ELSEVIER in
   the strategic sector of publishing and science dissemination.
   Headquartered at the state of the art SoReCom Research Centre and
   Multimedia Lab of Sapienza University of Rome, the So. Re. Com. Joint
   Innovative Doctoral Program (http://www.europhd.eu/SoReComJointIDP) has
   been selected in 2013 People-ITN-IDP call with the highest evaluation
   (98,80/100). Its mission is aimed at ensuring: a) internationally
   well-reputed ``research excellence{''}; b) worldwide appealing
   institutional environment; c) interdisciplinary research options dealing
   with societal issues at the interface between lay and scientific
   knowledge within, with and for society; d) Innovative practices adopted
   for multiple training activities and tutoring and co-tutoring; e)
   International and Intersectoral networking; e) training in transferable
   skills; f) dedicated physical and innovative digital infrastructures,
   including the So. Re. Com. ``A.S. de Rosa{''} physical and @-Library; g)
   career prospect development in academic and professional sectors; h)
   international joint governance structure and quality assurance from the
   selection process to the joint diploma award. Seven universities in five
   EU countries (IT, FR, CZ, ES, RO) are committed to awarding the joint
   degree, on the behalf of the whole network, which co-operates on
   recruiting, training and evaluating activities as partner organisations.}},

Abstract = {{Curriculum development is a complex, iterative process with a great
   number of sub processes and activities. Managing curriculum redesign
   requires continuous review and adjustment of its numerous features with
   regional and national interests, universities' strategic documents,
   requirements set by national and international accreditation standards,
   as well as with different needs of many external and internal
   stakeholders. Business Informatics curriculum redesign process had been
   carried out more frequently over the past decade, primarily due to
   persistent major changes in information technology and expansion of its
   application in business. Contemporary innovative aspects of this process
   intensely contribute to the need for curriculum redesign. Among the most
   important ones that necessitate detailed analysis and purposeful
   modification of key competencies, as well as the content of core and
   elective courses of curricula, are digital product, process and business
   model innovations, along with the interdisciplinary approach to
   development.
   This paper proposes a modified curriculum development process based on
   ADDIE model, specifically intended to recognize the roles of different
   stakeholders and utilize their input for curriculum redesign. ADDIE
   model is a general purpose development model, generic, systematic,
   step-by-step framework for iterative design, structured into four
   phases: Analysis, Design, Development and Implementation.
   The modified curriculum redesign process presented in this paper
   implements the initial activity of identifying key curriculum
   stakeholders, followed by identification of their requirements,
   identification of curriculum key competences, curriculum evaluation and
   quality assessment. Application of the redesigned and innovated process
   based on ADDIE model, with recognition of influence that digital
   innovation and interdisciplinarity, resulted in development of a
   business informatics curriculum. In addition to aforementioned
   activities, the model encompasses content analysis of curricula in the
   same field developed and implemented at different universities
   worldwide. It also incorporates many years of authors' experience gained
   thru previously developed and implemented curricula at the Faculty of
   Economics in Subotica. Details of core and elective courses, as well as
   specific ways of their implementation, are particularly highlighted in
   the paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an educational project carried out with pupils
   studying different courses of CSE (Compulsory Secondary Education). It
   was developed along the 2013-2014 school year and its main objective was
   the reinforcement of the English as a foreign language (EFL) learning
   process through the collaboration with some pupils in a high school in
   the USA.
   A wiki was created for the project and it was used as a digital magazine
   on which the oral and written productions of the students in both
   schools were uploaded. Thus, the Spanish students had to use the English
   language to carry out their different tasks while the American pupils
   did theirs in Spanish.
   The American and Spanish teachers decided the activities the students
   should do before telling them how and when to present them. Once the
   tasks were finished, they were uploaded on the different sections of the
   wiki. The students' outcomes were varied, ranging from videos presenting
   their schools and towns to presentations of different festivities or
   their written and oral stories etc. There was also a section devoted to
   recipes and even a role play with typical dialogues in a restaurant.}},

Abstract = {{The 21st Century University Classroom will require an innovative high
   impact collaborative learning environment that promotes multiple means
   of interaction among digital natives (students) and the professor.
   Whether students are gifted or have special needs, the new wave of
   digital natives, Neo-millennials, are in your class and driving today's
   classroom -online, F2F, or hybrid. Their learning style demands to be
   part of the learning and teaching process - my model is codesigned by my
   students, a design specialist, and me, yet, personalized for individual
   preferences and differences.
   Today's students are digital natives that see teachers as catalysts and
   facilitators whose classrooms function seamlessly. They are fluent in
   multiple media and empowered by technology. Whether they have special
   needs or gifted, neo-millennials want active learning in their
   classrooms based on a collective seeking, sieving, and synthesizing
   experiences. They want expression through non-linear associations - web
   representations, as well as linear media, e.g., simulation as apposed to
   writing a paper. Unfortunately, typical online, hybrid and F2F courses
   offer students little opportunity for such collaborative high impact
   interactions.
   My presentation will showcase my highly successful High Impact
   online/hybrid/F2F introductory course to special populations that is
   offered through my version of a flipped classroom. It combines universal
   design/differentiated instruction concepts with the tools within a
   learning management system to meet the needs of all students. My
   presentation will focus on providing participants with ideas on `how to'
   transform the traditional professor directed survey course that uses
   lectures and slides, into a more 21st century high-impact technology
   driven and studentcentered interactive practice that will grab the
   imagination of the neo-millennials, activate their critical thinking,
   and promote collaboration among all students.
   By combining the virtual tools of cloud based technology with innovative
   web features such as blogs, web quests, wikis, games, surveys,
   discussions, journals, twitter feed, mashups, videos, quizzlets, and
   webinars, educators will learn how to convert their courses into an
   organic virtual world where empirically based instruction is presented
   in real time and provides authentic experiences for all learners-service
   learning, problem based learning, team based learning, web quests, and
   web presentations. Benefits for students and educators will be
   discussed.}},

   (Chiapas, Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatan). Media-labs were installed
   since 2010 with a W.K. Kellogg's foundation grant, by Union de
   Empresarios por la Tecnologia en la Educacion (UNETE), a private non -
   profit organization that provides technology to Mexico's public primary
   and secondary schools. The central research question is: What is the
   effectiveness of UNETE's intervention program in these schools? To
   answer to this inquiry, self-report questionnaires, were administered to
   a sample students registered at 128 schools benefited by the
   Kellogg/UNETE intervention program. Results were compared with those of
   433 students enrolled at 50 similar rural schools that lacked the
   support of the program. Focusing on 21st century skills such as
   collaboration, digital literacy, critical thinking and problem-solving,
   a comparison between groups rendered statistically significant findings.
   The intervention group generally had considerably higher perception of
   their skills than their counterparts in the control groups.}},

Abstract = {{This paper centers around the growing importance of learning and its
   economics for development. Yet, the parameters for such learning are
   rapidly changing and being redefined. This paper first describes these
   changing learning environments: knowledge is being redefined in a world
   of Knowledge Economics and accumulating digital knowledge; societal
   well-being is being rethought away from industrial output; networks of
   knowledge redefine the nexus of local and global knowledge; and
   collective learning expands the possibilities of innovation and
   creativity. Second, this new learning environment raises questions about
   old education assumptions which are explored: sustainability in light of
   networks and social capital, local knowledge in view of linked global
   knowledge networks, expert knowledge in view of collaborative and
   contextual knowledge and educational resources in light of networks and
   the decreased need for physical campuses. Finally, the paper describes a
   learning ecosystem which is being prototyped in Zambia which is designed
   around the new parameters and usurps many of old frameworks for a
   sustainable, locally relevant, world-class research and learning
   environment built around a local, national and international network.
   Old suppositions of how learning does and should occur are being
   substantially rethought in a world that is viewed as globally linked,
   constantly expanding in knowledge, driven by innovation, and where
   learning occurs through networks. Systems of learning that seemed
   inherently to be state-planned just a generation ago, are now giving way
   to networks of learning that are driven by the laws of social networks,
   collective-adaptive principles and collaborative knowledge building. In
   such a world, it is possible to rethink the role of ``local
   knowledge{''} and to imagine a sustainable learning system. Such a
   system would have particular importance in communities and countries
   where existing education systems are poorly funded, of little relevance
   to their communities, or where members cannot access systems that give
   them a chance to make meaningful contributions. The paper begins by
   establishing the changing parameters of learning and then presents the
   case of the Global Knowledge Institute in Zambia which is beginning to
   build a learning system based on these principles.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1990s, six veterinary schools collaborated on the creation of
   computer aided learning materials through the Computer Learning in
   Veterinary Education (CLIVE). This innovative consortium shared digital
   learning objects as open resources (OER) prior to the advent of the
   internet, distributing them on CD-ROM. Over 100 of these programs were
   produced ranging from ``ageing horses{''} to ``a description of the
   urinary system{''}.
   The use of open content is now central to the way veterinary students
   study. The majority of students state that they access open content such
   as Wikipedia, WikiVet or YouTube on a regular basis and find it
   invaluable to their studies. Faculty now have to ensure that their
   digital literacy competencies keep abreast of their students'
   information needs if they are to best prepare them for their future
   careers. As part of this increasing engagement in digital content, staff
   will be encouraged to play a more active role in sharing their own
   teaching material.
   One example of a new veterinary OER is the WikiVet project, a non-profit
   making collaborative resource which aims to support and enhance
   veterinary education worldwide using web based technologies. It provides
   an innovative and dynamic framework integrating an expanding veterinary
   encyclopaedia with related learning materials. WikiVet aims to become
   the most respected and largest online educational resource for the
   international veterinary community.
   The original vision of the institutions and individuals that created
   veterinary OERs was that their free use would help to ensure global
   access to some of the best teaching resources. Clearly this has major
   potential for the less developed countries of the world which do not
   have the resources to create material and do not want to ``reinvent the
   wheel{''}. Now, only time will tell if these exciting opportunities to
   share our global education resources will come to fruition.}},

Abstract = {{There are many real-world problems waiting for solutions and many
   students wanting to solve realworld problems. Students can harness their
   creativity, collaborative skills, and knowledge of science and
   engineering to solve many of these problems. Students from Preston
   Middle School in Colorado, U.S.A. and students from Riverview High
   School in New Brunswick, Canada are working together to engineer a
   sustainable light source. The two schools are partnering with students
   in the Dominican Republic and Uganda to understand the challenges faced
   by living without access to safe and reliable light. These four
   countries each have specific and vital roles to the success of this
   mission.
   Students truly value and learn from one another's cultures and life
   experiences, and digital collaboration allows students to appreciate
   each others' schools and homes. They share knowledge about how lack of
   access to light limits learning opportunities and divides neighbors who
   have and don't have light after dark. Riverview High School specializes
   in designing a renewably-powered lighting system. Preston Middle School
   specializes in engineering a 3D printed case to house the light.
   Students at the CHAT House (Care and Hope through Adoption and
   Technology) in Uganda and students in the Dominican Republic are using
   the prototypes, documenting and sharing field research, and will be
   distributing the final product to their family, friends and neighbors.
   High level STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics)
   entrepreneurial thinking occurs because all students are motivated by
   authentic human needs. Students donate their time, strength,
   intelligence and energy. Collaboration happens during traditional school
   time, but more often outside of school hours because of time
   differences. Students learn, create and refine asynchronously through
   blogs, video, photos, brainstorming and suggestions. One Million Lights
   truly incorporates all disciplines and requires every voice to achieve
   success.
   From industry and academic professionals, an open-sourced circuit and 3D
   printer file are available for the light source. Anyone in the world can
   print the light shell and assemble the electronic components. Schools,
   communities and businesses can send their newly-manufactured light to a
   global humanitarian organization (yet to be named) for distribution to
   families around the world who do not have access to reliable, clean,
   safe light.
   International Technology, Education and Development (INTED)Conference
   participants are invited to become part of this incredible journey where
   science and humanity merge to improve the lives of everyone involved.
   Turn on the science and humanitarian light in your students as they turn
   on light in other parts of the world: together, we can produce One
   Million Lights!}},

Abstract = {{Being involved in ITEC (innovative Technologies for Engaging Classrooms,
   www.itec.eun.org), an EUN funded project developed from 2010 to 2014 in
   more than 2500 classrooms across 20 European countries, my 10th grade
   students (Ss) piloted a Learning Story (LS) built from three trends:
   collaboration, augmented reality and community engagement.
   In a first step, in collaboration with SMART Tech Spain, we organized a
   workshop involving teachers, pedagogic advisors, parents and Ss to
   develop our LS: Virtual Museum (VM). Based on the trends mentioned, we
   designed a set of Learning Activities (LA) that were integrated into our
   LS on a narrative intended to serve as a guide for the teachers
   responsible of developing the pilots: along a term, Ss would work in
   teams with the common goal of building a VM to be shared with the
   community in order to explain (in a wide sense) topics of any subject
   (in the original narrative, a set of remarkable places, monuments,
   buildings, paintings,. on the Ss' nearest environment, to be described,
   analyzed, contextualized and shared with the community through a digital
   tool). One of the main concerns on the design of the LAs was engaging
   the Ss in the learning process, from the definition of the objectives to
   the assessment process.
   The first pilot was developed by my 10th grade Maths Ss, with the topic
   of Geometry: they were engaged into a research to build shareable items
   related with the topic starting with their own interests in real life:
   sports, fashion, food, architecture, astronomy,. anything was a good
   starting point. After a collaborative process each team had to
   contribute to the class VM with an augmented reality enhanced image
   linked to the mathematical content explained and to a blog where the
   whole process of creation could be followed. In order to have a complete
   view of the process at any moment, we tested a new digital tool provided
   by SMART as part of the pilot activities.
   Once the teams formed, the Ss, in a collaborative process through
   discussion, had to agree in everything, from the topic to the way to
   present it, taking into account the audience, the content to be added,
   the use of augmented reality or the presentation tool. Through the
   process, they had to find an equilibrium point with all the ideas, in
   order to have a final unique item, agreed content to add, an image to be
   part of the VM, and a blog describing the process in detail. The
   assessment criteria were agreed in a cooperative session amongst the Ss
   and the teacher, being one of the main goals the depth of mathematical
   content to be added and explained.
   The assessment process had two different parts: teacher supervision by
   following the blog, the collaborative workspace in the digital tool and
   observation on the working sessions, and peer assessment from team to
   team (this needed new sessions of discussion to get a single mark from
   each team for each item published).
   The experience resulted in more engagement of Ss in the learning
   process, more responsibility taking (even by the students less engaged);
   role assumption was a soft process in every team that resulted in
   strengths and weaknesses self-awareness. In the final reflection
   sessions, the Ss commented as their preferred methodology change their
   access to parts of the learning process that traditionally were
   forbidden for them, in particular the whole assessment process.}},

Abstract = {{Indian higher education landscape is changing rapidly. Demographic
   bulge, expanding school education and rising aspirations has put
   considerable pressure for expansion of Higher Education. There are
   greater expectations from Higher Education due to the country's rapid
   economic growth, rising incomes, outward orientation and growing
   optimism. The rapid developments in science and technology and the
   challenges of globalization are also posing additional challenges to the
   education system in the country. In this era of digitalization the
   infusion of technology into teaching and learning has a remarkable
   influence on the instructional strategies of the educational
   institutions Keeping this in view a study is undertaken with the
   following objectives:
   To elicit the various innovative teaching pedagogy in higher education.
   To examine the opinion of students about the innovative teaching methods
   that they perceive as the most interesting and best teaching method.
   To suggest the way forward in which technology can facilitate a
   student-centered classroom.
   A survey was conducted to find the perception of students with regards
   to the core components of Higher Education such as Curriculum revision,
   teaching pedagogy, Activity based learning and Evaluation pattern along
   with opinions on Innovative teaching methodologies and their level of
   satisfaction with respect to innovative and ICT integrated teaching with
   the help of a structured questionnaire. A stratified random sampling
   technique was adopted for selecting 250 respondents (students) pursuing
   their Under Graduation in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) situated
   in Hyderabad. It is found that the success of any method basically
   depends on availability of adequate trained personnel, proper planning
   of the teacher, understanding the level of competencies of learner,
   ensuring the availability and proper use of technology, integrating
   academics with ethics. This enables the learner to inculcate the quest
   for knowledge, ensures a learner to be a lifelong learner in pursuit of
   excellence.}},

Abstract = {{Recent educational reforms around the world have been heavily colored by
   the `technology' imperative. Information and Communication Technology
   (ICT) in the educational process is considered a transforming agent and
   a necessary prerequisite for quality teaching and learning.
   Current national initiatives for integrating technology in education in
   Greece include the development of media-enriched textbooks in primary
   and secondary education in (almost) all subjects and the development of
   the national learning object repository `Photodentro'. These are
   considered important agents for change in teaching and learning in Greek
   schools.
   This paper will present the results of the development of media-enriched
   textbooks for music and visual arts in primary and secondary education
   in Greece. The aims for this enrichment and for creating the various
   original learning objects for each subject will be analyzed and
   connected to the aims and objectives of the recent educational reform in
   Greece as well as current trends in teaching in learning in and with the
   arts. Also, challenges and obstacles faced by the creative team will be
   presented in order to complete the picture.
   Finally, teachers' perceptions and practices/uses in relation to the
   media-enriched textbooks and `Photodentro' learning object repository
   (LOR) that were collected during a small scale research that took place
   in selected schools in Greece, will be analyzed and connected to future
   opportunities.
   This paper touches upon two main topics within the scope of this
   conference:
   Technology-Enhanced Learning, as it presents the results of a large
   scale national project to enhance teaching and learning with the use of
   digital technology. More particularly it focuses on teaching and
   learning of music and arts in primary and secondary education in Greece
   with the use of media-enriched textbooks.
   Research on Technology in Education as it draws conclusions from a
   research-based inquiry on teachers' perceptions and use of the new
   digital technology-based resources, namely the media-enriched textbooks
   and `Photodentro', the national learning object repository.}},

   facilitate social inclusion of senior people through digital inclusion.
   Both faculty members and students of the summer course are exposed to
   strengthen three types of transversal competencies, ICT competences,
   learning to learn competence and social responsibility competence, each
   group from their own role and perspective. The results are presented
   through a double experience, one contextualized in senior people as
   students and their needs for inclusion and the other, the curricular
   management innovation from the partial perspective of transversal
   competences, in the context of the University Social Responsibility
   (USR) and the Service-Learning as pedagogical strategy for R\&D+I. In
   the atmosphere generated in the course for seniors and their social
   needs, was feasible to meet the models, strategies, programs and
   university policies, which allowed to test the general working
   hypothesis, that if show success in applications for ICT didactic
   activities selected, in an age group that has greater difficulty in
   managing digital technologies, could get a proportionately higher
   success in the age groups of students with minor difficulties managing
   these technologies. The results are feasible to be replicated in part or
   completely in environments of international higher education, since a
   minimal set of generic competences mediated by ICT competences are used,
   where they have to be updated continuously by teachers and students in a
   context of interest to universities, as it is the development of
   university social responsibility.}},

Abstract = {{RefComTIC is an interactive manual that focus to meet the needs of the
   faculty, specifically those involved in results-oriented curricular
   innovation. It aims to help the strengthening of those competencies
   associated with Information Technology and Communication (ICT). The use
   of RefComTIC contemplates the development on students of the transversal
   competences associated to the professional profile of the undergraduate
   at our University. It also eases the management of new ICT related
   curricular changes, policy and activities of the University. At the
   level of curricular changes support is given to the management and
   updating of contents associated with transversal competences and ICT
   educational activities for teachers, given the ease an automated system
   allows for the modification of its content. At the level of university
   policies and concerning transversal competences, the manual assists in
   the process of remembering, including and keeping professors updated on
   this area. These features correlate with sustainable digital inclusion
   (SDI), the general model that supports the development strategy and
   usability of the manual, as professors require support in strengthening
   their ICT competences associated with their subjects, while also
   learning how ICT mediated activities contribute to this matter covered
   by the program of their subject. At the level of ICT didactical
   activities, it allows orientating the use of resources to strengthen
   both the pedagogical strategies and the development and strengthening of
   ICT competences of the teacher itself, and in turn the collaboration
   among them. In addition to the outlined above, the capacity of the
   interactive manual to contribute to social knowledge management by
   influencing the axis of curricular innovation and mediate with the
   strengthening of the other competences of the professional profile, one
   of which is social responsibility, is highlighted. In this regard we
   advance to meet the challenge of raising awareness of ethical and moral
   values that should guide users of digital technologies. It is shown that
   the use of ICT skills in a digital environment that facilitates the
   reinforcement of a minimum of transferable skills, to strength
   transversal competences, is feasible. Drupal has been selected as the
   development environment, allowing the generation of automated systems by
   including metadata in every part of the process, allowing the finding of
   meaningful relationships in content and applications. This digital tool
   also is open source, which helps with the development and improvement by
   the contributions of the open source community, and finally, facilitates
   its use by not requiring the acquisition of licenses by teacher users.
   As a technological solution, it could be an ideal tool for the
   construction of digital content, lecture notes, exercise guides among
   others}},

Abstract = {{Modern technology and the advent of Open Educational Resources ( OER)
   have fundamental effects on learning and teaching. Rather than being
   mere dispensers of information, modern teachers increasingly assume a
   proactive role, exploiting OER to enrich their course and didactic
   material and also engaging personally in the production of new digital
   content. Peer production is also growing, supported by the new
   collaborative possibilities afforded by the internet. The present paper
   will discuss the emerging paradigm of teachers as makers of educational
   content and explores the challenges of content re- use and collaborative
   authorship, in terms of skills, working methodologies and authoring
   environment capabilities.
   Drawing on these cases the paper proposes an innovative, two- level
   collaborative course development framework, aimed at promoting and
   supporting reciprocal learning and dialogue among educators, to develop
   didactic material that serves the learners' needs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at investigating the legal framework of Open Educational
   Resources (OER).
   OER comprise learning, teaching and research material available in the
   public domain or released under open license. Such definition stands out
   the area of copyright, which protects intellectual property rights, and
   embraces the copyleft's approach, based on creative common licenses
   (CCL) and, particularly, open licenses.
   The analysis will take into account the juridical underpinnings of Open
   Licenses and their practical and operational drawbacks in the management
   of educational content.
   The results will be placed in the context of m-learning and global
   distance education. An Open Educational Resource can be modified or
   adapted in order to be available on different platforms and devices,
   despite geographical or technological limitations. Not to mention the
   opportunity to allow learners with disability to gain access to the
   content without limitations (e.g. converting into audio a written
   document with a text-to-speech software, the use of which is usually
   forbidden in copyrighted works).
   To better understand the differences, a short insight on the history of
   creative works' protection could be useful. Gutenberg innovations' in
   printing led to the opportunity to protect the rights of authors and
   publishers. Copyright has been the only and, therefore, the most
   effective way to protect your creative work ever since.
   It lies on the concept of Intellectual Property, defining the rights
   concerned (the so-called Intellectual Property Rights IPRs).
   On this basis, it is clearly an all-or-nothing option: the owner has all
   the rights reserved, although he could sell, or let someone else manage,
   some of them. In more recent times, we underwent a similar revolution:
   internet. The free Software movement led to the drafting of some new
   licences (GPL, GNU). This expertise was later transferred in a new, more
   comprehensive movement called Copyleft in order to underline its own
   unique perspective and its difference from Copyright.
   The digital content offers many possibilities, with the Creative Common
   Licenses the Author can choose which rights to retain and how he would
   prefer its work to be used and re-used. They're not substituting the
   Copyright, but filling the holes and offering new opportunity to share
   and collaborate in creative work.
   The CCL, nowadays drafted in the 4.0 version, represent a powerful tool
   to boost educational resources and e-learning systems in compliance with
   law, rights and in perfect accordance with development and evolution.}},

Title = {{How to identify e-learning trends in academic teaching Methodological
   approaches and the analysis of scientific discourses}},
Journal = {{INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31+}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce methodology and
   findings of a trend study in the field of e-learning. The overall
   interest of the study was the analysis of scientific e-learning
   discourses. What comes next in the field of academic e-learning? Which
   e-learning trends dominate the discourse at universities? Answering such
   questions is the basis for the adaptation of service strategies and
   IT-infrastructures within institutions of higher education.
   Design/methodology/approach - Which e-learning formats dominate the
   current scientific discourse? To answer this question, a trend study
   based on a content analysis was performed. The abstracts of 427
   scientific articles of leading German-speaking e-learning conferences
   Gesellschaft fur Medien in der Wissenschaft and E-Learning-Fachtagungen
   der Gesellschaft fur Informatik e. V. (GMW and DeLFI) - published from
   2007 to 2013 - were examined. A category scheme was derived from the
   Horizon Report. The category scheme then was gradually expanded and
   adapted to the data material during the investigation.
   Findings - This paper found that the detailed analysis of the frequency
   distribution over the seven years reflects the intensity of scientific
   discussion towards e-learning trends within the investigation period,
   and conclusions about the didactical or technical potentials of
   innovations can be drawn because both conferences are different in terms
   of their objective. The authors also classified the life stages of
   selected innovations based on the Gartner hype cycles, and the striking
   findings of the study will be formulated in the form of assumptions,
   which reflect the development potential of learning management, mobile
   learning, virtual worlds, e-portfolio, social media and Massive Open
   Online Courses in German Higher Education.
   Research limitations/implications - Only abstracts of the selected
   contributions were investigated. Errors in the category allocation due
   to unclear terminology cannot be excluded. Organisers of the
   investigated conferences often define the (main) topics. This influenced
   the spectrum of represented topics overall, as well as the focus of
   individual contributions. The above-presented study was conducted at
   German-speaking conferences and, therefore, reflects the situation in
   Germany, Switzerland and Austria. No conclusions about actors or
   institutional relationships can be made, in contrast to the original
   assumptions of discourse analysis. The categorial classification of
   contributions does not allow any conclusions about the quality of the
   discourse.
   Originality/value - The study shows how proceedings of scientific
   conferences can be used for trend studies. It became clear that
   discourse analytical studies can be used complementary to other methods
   of future studies. The advantage of this methodology lies mainly in the
   easy access to the text material, as conference proceedings are mostly
   available online. In addition, the analysis of large amounts of data (or
   texts) can be greatly facilitated by use of digital technologies (e.g.
   by automatic analysis of keyword). This paper makes an important
   contribution to the diffusion of digital media in higher education.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{This exploratory case study investigates pathways taken by a Canadian
   French immersion high school teacher invested in pedagogical change. To
   fairly evaluate the successfulness of her attempt to effect change,
   Cummins' `framework of coercive and collaborative relations of power
   manifested in macro- and micro-interactions' was employed. Its use shed
   light on the structural adaptations needed for the innovation she was
   attempting to introduce to succeed. The teacher wanted to introduce
   plurilingual pedagogy informed by the Common European Framework of
   Reference for Languages (CEFR) into a French-medium content-based course
   by drawing on student ease with using technology such as i-Movie. The
   findings gained through an analysis of classroom-based observation,
   interviews, documents and artefacts suggest the structural challenges
   she faced led her to make decisions at odds with her beliefs and goal of
   implementing innovative pedagogy (she modified a key aspect of a social
   justice task). They further suggest a mismatch between what she
   anticipated student reactions to the innovation would be as compared to
   their actual reactions. Students welcomed the chance to draw on their
   out-of-school digital knowledge to reflect their (linguistic) identity
   through their work, suggesting IT-enabled plurilingual pedagogy informed
   by the CEFR merits further exploration.}},

Abstract = {{Entrepreneurship is perceived as a powerful driver of economic growth
   and job creation. In recent years stimulation of entrepreneurship in
   education in general, and in the creative industries in particular, is
   high on the political agenda. The creative industries have by default of
   its serviceoriented focus, always been an entrepreneurial and less an
   employee environment. In the creative industries 80\% are
   microbusinesses, with one to three employees1. SME's (Small and Medium
   Entreprise) represent the most important source for creating new jobs.
   The creative industries are no exception to this. At the same time, the
   sector is strongly projectbased and demand driven. Loose moments between
   projects asks for flexible employment and employment in the sector is
   very volatile. Still the media sector is in full transition offering
   plenty of appealing and inspirational role models to ambitious and
   creative young people. These innovative and tantalizing startups and the
   new business models that often come along with it, infuse new ideas and
   approaches in traditional companies. Classical examples are Facebook as
   a news aggregator or Twitter as a new form of journalism. While a lot is
   happening online, there is also much potential for the print industry
   whether in 2D or 3D printing, where 3D modeling and printing is an
   emerging market in product design and development. To summarize,
   opportunities to explore new services and products and to establish your
   private business in the creative industry abound.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, models have been used by designers to represent abstract
   design ideas or to analyze and evaluate the refined design solutions.
   The digital model, in particular, represents the logics, process, and
   intended result of the design in the form of digital information and
   media. Innovations in Internet of Things (IoT) and 3D printing
   technologies now enable the various levels of real-world spatial
   interactions that were possible only when the user becomes an avatar in
   a cyberspace. This level of model virtualizes the design and the
   building itself, becoming an organism of information and materials
   whether it is being digital analogue.
   This phenomenon calls for the reorganization of the conceptual framework
   during the architectural design process where different kinds of models
   coexist and continuously evolve. Beyond the ad hoc communications
   between two modes of models, a symbiotic framework is proposed in this
   paper, where digital and analogue models interact in synergetic ways in
   the form of design versions and prototypes. This framework is especially
   appropriate for designing the smart space. It reflects the paradigm of
   form-finding and prototyping over the traditional counterpart of design
   process: form-making. The concept of Smart Analogue Model (SAM) is
   introduced as a main instrument to facilitate this process. The SAM
   refers to the prototyping of smart space by integrating ICT-embedded
   components like sensors and actuators. Through the co-evolving process,
   two models interact in various channels by utilizing techniques from
   parametric design, design-by-simulation, and physical computing. The
   impacts on the pedagogy of architectural design studios are discussed
   within the framework of the proposed symbiotic design process. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Technologies and skills in the ICT sector have rapidly advanced in the
   past forty years, but the profession has not kept up with this process.
   Unfortunately, poorly qualified colleagues are even found in sector
   today. The EU ensures that the knowledge, skills and creativity of the
   European workforce (including ICT practitioners) meet the highest
   standards, by using effective lifelong learning. ICT programs offer
   workers the full advantage of strategic and operational opportunities.
   More and better qualified ICT practitioners and e-skilled managers are
   needed to take advantage of them. That is why e-skills are a central
   aspect of European policies, which increase the competitiveness and
   productivity of the workforce. Education providers, government and
   industries have to collaborate to accomplish these goals. Important
   factors of the digital divide are networking, internet penetration and
   services, as well as e-skills on all levels. This research and
   developments focus on the discovery of the differences in the
   e-readiness and developing of education programs in agri-informatics to
   reduce the digital gaps in agriculture and rural areas. In the first
   part of the article, the usage of network services were evaluated on two
   regional levels. On the national level, it analyzed the EU member
   states, in order to compare their actual development level. On a
   micro-regional level, the SMEs of a typical rural settlement were
   evaluated, since within the functional analysis, the evaluation of rural
   regions has grown in importance and, with regard to territory and
   population, Hungary is mainly classified as a rural area. 106
   enterprises were involved in this study and the data collected during
   the research were derived by Principal Component and Cluster analyses.
   Farms consider network services to be unnecessary because of the nature
   of their work, even though most of the factors included in the analysis
   were considered important or expressly important by service and
   commercial enterprises, regardless of the applications they use. The
   second part of the article presents those educational tools which could
   increase the e-readiness of SMEs and principally aid agricultural
   enterprises.}},

Abstract = {{Because of disruption stemming from digital media products and services,
   radio stations across the country are enacting organizational changes to
   provide digital content while maintaining a strong radio broadcast
   presence. This study asks: How do views on organizational competition
   correspond with organizational identity discourse? And, how do cognitive
   competitor networks differ among public media organizations, and among
   people in similar roles across different organizations? Theories of
   organizational identity, networks, and strategic groups are applied to
   interview data from 75 people in 14 organizations. The way individuals
   perceived competitors encapsulated the connection between organizational
   identity and strategy. Descriptive network analysis of cognitive
   competitor networks showed that people in similar departments across
   organizations had similar views about competitors, but there was
   divergence among these role-based groups. This study demonstrates how
   views about competitors inform organizational identity discourse and
   produces dialectical tensions with regard to strategy that, if ignored,
   can potentially hamper innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless mobile communication has become more familiar and popular among
   other communication system for transmitting data to enable the user to
   communicate with other third parties at any place at any time. Due to
   third party interception, transmission of data, connection
   establishment, connection release, billing processes are in insecure
   environments. So many researchers had put their effort to develop an
   innovative authentication scheme for GSM network. The existing
   authentication scheme provides security with high communication and
   computational overhead using a symmetric key cryptography. The proposed
   scheme mainly focuses on providing security to global system for mobile
   communication system using hyperelliptic curve cryptography and DNA
   computing technique for mutual authentication, secret key generation
   and, data encryption and decryption algorithm. Finally, a security
   analysis shows that authentication algorithm is more secure and

Abstract = {{This study investigated, via quasi-experiments, the effects of
   student-centered project-based learning with initiation (SPBL with
   Initiation) on the development of students' computing skills. In this
   study, 96 elementary school students were selected from four class
   sections taking a course titled ``Digital Storytelling{''} and were
   assigned to the following four groups: SPBL with Initiation group (G1, n
   = 20), SPBL group (G2, n = 31), PBL group (G3, n = 24), and Traditional
   group (G4, n = 21). Students had to design digital materials for digital
   storytelling. The researchers collected both quantitative and
   qualitative data, including conducting interviews with students and
   using teachers' journals. Based on the analysis in this study, the
   effect of SPBL with Initiation on students' computing skills was
   significantly higher than for those without or with other treatments.
   This research provides an innovative design and illustration of SPBL
   with Initiation for teachers, educators, and schools that are keen to
   enhance students' computing skills.}},

Abstract = {{Economic recession has expanded during the last five years from U.S.A.
   to Europe and sprawls at an international level. Governments try to
   redefine their strategies and policies in order to recognize and deal
   with this unexpected environment, while they prioritize alternative
   methods in order to return to growth and to control national and
   supranational economics. Some of these strategic changes emphasize on
   innovation and research as the means to overcome this recession. The aim
   of this paper is to question and illustrate the connection between
   innovation and fiscal growth and in this order to explore whether
   Governments can capitalize innovation against fiscal crisis. Emphasis
   will be given on Information Technology ( IT) innovation initiatives
   that are being undertataken with these updated strategies. Literature
   findings depict such an interconnection, while findings from the latest
   European strategies are compared to data from other countries regarding
   innovation's capitalization against fiscal recession and national

Title = {{Retail shopper marketing: the future of promotional flyers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL \& DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{488+}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the recent evolution
   of store flyers to illustrate how a tool of traditional marketing can be
   applied to generate insight on customer ``couch-to-cart{''} behaviour
   thus supporting an innovating shopper marketing approach. The authors
   support this position by elaborating on three themes: first, the recent
   evolution of flyers, driven by incorporation of customer insight derived
   from loyalty data and by new features enabled by flyer digitalization;
   second, the evolution of the flyer planning and management process,
   related to opportunities and challenges in the retailer organisational
   structure; and third, the rise of online flyer aggregators.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used field interviews. The
   authors included the perspectives of different subjects involved in
   planning and delivering flyer-based promotions. Secondary data were also
   collected regarding flyer activities of a sample of 67 retail groups
   across 15 countries and four industries.
   Findings - Critical aspects of flyers as retail marketing tools emerged.
   The authors found that there are changes taking place in flyer-based
   promotion caused by ``fertilisation{''} by loyalty data and digital that
   have not been captured by research so far. Retailers are experimenting
   with flyer aggregators. These infomediaries generate new insight on
   various aspects of the shopping cycle. Retailers can use these metrics
   to improve flyer strategy and negotiation with suppliers. The authors
   shed light on obstacles that prevent exploitation of shopper marketing
   benefits and value. Among the managerial challenges the authors found
   retailer organisation and management and functional integration.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper points to four areas for
   future research: promotion innovation, electronic intermediaries,
   marketing organisation and competition. Research questions are
   suggested.
   Practical implications - This study contributes to retail management by
   identifying best practices that support promotional campaign development
   in a shopper marketing perspective. The authors provide suggestions
   around the incorporation of loyalty data in the flyer planning process
   and the creation of inter-functional teams.
   Originality/ value - Academic research has long addressed flyer-based
   promotion, but has not linked it to innovation or shopper marketing.
   Little or no attention has been paid to the flyer management process and
   its organisational dimensions, nor to digital flyers.}},

Abstract = {{New approaches in documentary films are discussed in this study. It is a
   fact that the classic narration in documentary film will no longer exist
   in films produced in the near future. Today the changes and developments
   in technology bring different technical possibilities for documentary
   film making as well as different styles of narration. The discovery and
   experimentation with different narration styles by documentary film
   directors and producers are shaping new narration possibilities. Thus,
   films shaped with the new approaches have been witnessed in documentary
   films recently and led to a redefining of documentary films. Now, new
   genres such as `new media documentary', `interactive documentary' and
   `non-linear documentary' are emerging. As the amount of work on this
   subject is marginal in the Turkish literature this study has become a
   necessity. The aim of the study is to describe the innovations and new
   forms of documentary film. A comparative analysis done using the content
   analysis technique reflects the differences between the `new genre'
   documentaries that use the new approaches and traditional documentary
   films. The present study has verified that the said changes are
   reflected in the `form' and `usage' characteristics of the type of
   documentary films realized by IDFA DocLab with the use of the digital
   analysis technique.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{116-121}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - There is increasing interest from researchers, teachers and
   other professionals, individuals with autism, and families about the
   potential for innovative technologies to transform learning experiences
   and facilitate friendships and social networks. Media accounts have
   highlighted both the apparently miraculous impacts of technology on
   supporting communication and learning for people with autism, as well as
   significant concerns about whether technology use is healthy, safe and
   socially appropriate for children and young people. Rarely, however, is
   any evidence reported to support either set of claims. The paper aims to
   discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - This short paper reports on an Economic
   and Social Research Council-funded seminar series in the UK that is
   critically reviewing and discussing the field with respect to the
   research evidence base but also the assumptions that are made about
   where, how and whether innovative technologies may be useful for people
   with autism and their families.
   Findings - The first seminar in the series focused on whether
   technologies create a social bubble for people with autism and presented
   research demonstrating that technology use can be positive, supportive
   and rewarding.
   Originality/value - This paper offers an up-to-date insight into some of
   key debates about the benefits and limitations of social technologies
   for people with autism. Its value lies in raising questions about, and
   discussing evidence that challenges, some of the negative assumptions
   that are often perpetuated by the media about the potentially harmful
   effects of technologies.}},

Pages = {{233-238}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to raise important questions from
   the different perspectives on autism research that arose from a seminar
   on autism and technology, held as part of an ESRC-funded series on
   innovative technologies for autism.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper focuses on the roles of
   technology in understanding questions about different perspectives on
   autism: how do people on the spectrum see neurotypicals (people without
   autism) and vice versa?; how do the authors use eye gaze differently
   from each other?; how might technology influence what is looked at and
   how the authors measure this?; what differences might there be in how
   people use imitation of others?; and finally, how should the authors
   study and treat any differences?
   Findings - The authors synthesise common themes from invited talks and
   responses. The audience discussions highlighted the ways in which the
   authors take account of human variation, how the authors can understand
   the perspective of another, particularly across third-person and
   second-person approaches in research, and how researchers and
   stakeholders engage with each other.
   Originality/value - The authors argue that the question of perspectives
   is important for considering how people with autism and neurotypical
   people interact in everyday contexts, and how researchers frame their
   research questions and methods. The authors propose that stakeholders
   and researchers can fruitfully engage directly in discussions of
   research, in ways that benefit both research and practice.}},

Title = {{Semantic Modeling of Collocations for Lexicographic Purposes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{200-223}},
Abstract = {{The study which we will present in this paper aims at investigating and
   modeling lexical-semantic properties of collocations. Pairs of words
   that co-occur with statistic salience will be extracted automatically
   from a large German corpus with the help of the ``Wortprofil{''}, a
   sketch-engine-like application. From these sets of co-occurring words,
   collocations in the narrow sense are selected manually. With these data,
   the following research questions will be addressed a) concerning the
   collocates: are we able to classify these into lexical-semantic classes
   and group them accordingly; b) concerning the bases: are we able to find
   significant numbers of shared collocates for lexicalsemantically related
   bases and thus reach some form of generalization and regular patterns?
   In our study we apply the Meaning-Text Theory of Mel'cuk, more
   precisely, the concept of Lexical Functions (LF). The idea to employ LFs
   for lexicographic work on collocations is not new. However, the
   combination of LF with semantic wordnets for the abstraction over
   individual bases (addressing question b above) is innovative as it has,
   to the best of our knowledge, not yet been used for modeling a larger
   subset of collocations in any language. In the study we report here, we
   have focused on a set of lexical items and their collocations in order
   to test the appropriateness of Lexical Functions and to model the
   phenomena and the intersection of collocates of related base words to
   generalize collocational patterns.
   A practical goal of our work will gain a clearer view of how to use
   lexicalsemantic features for the encoding of collocation in
   semasiological dictionaries such as the Digitales Wrterbuch der
   Deutschen Sprache (DWDS). A further goal and a contribution to
   lexicological theory is to better understand the interdependence between
   regularity and arbitrariness of lexical choice. While the arbitrariness
   of lexical choice makes collocations hard to learn for the
   second-language learner, we assume that there are some (sub-)
   regularities, at least within groups of semantically related headwords.
   Applied properly to the task of language learning, such regularities
   should facilitate the acquisition of this part of the vocabulary.}},

   experts in the governing of education. The article offers a historical
   and conceptual account of the organisational form of the policy
   innovation lab. Policy innovation labs are characterised by specific
   methods and techniques of design, data science, and digitisation in
   public services such as education. The second half of the article
   details how labs promote the use of digital data analysis,
   evidence-based evaluation and `design-for-policy' techniques as methods
   for the governing of education. In particular, they promote the
   `computational thinking' associated with computer programming as a
   capacity required by a `reluctant state' that is increasingly concerned
   to delegate its responsibilities to digitally enabled citizens with the
   `designerly' capacities and technical expertise to `code' solutions to
   public and social problems. Policy innovation labs are experimental
   laboratories trialling new methods within education for administering
   and governing the future of the state itself.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how an educational intervention is implemented is
   essential to evaluating its effectiveness. With the increased use of

   is to outline ways in which researchers can harness learning analytics
   and user data to gain a deeper understanding of the implementation of
   digital innovations and their impact on teaching and learning. We
   discuss four considerations for the integration of learning analytics

   digital technologies and intensive human anatomy training as a result of
   a long-standing successful partnership between these two esteemed
   institutes. The student also has to complete a research dissertation
   which encompasses both the digital perspective and a related medical,
   dental, surgical, veterinary (comparative anatomy) or life science
   specialty to enhance development in the digital field for a variety of
   specialties. This article discusses the background in development of
   this degree, the course structure and the career prospects and

Journal = {{JOURNALISM PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{65-77}},
Abstract = {{Practices of news selection, presentation and distribution have been
   transposed to the domain of audiences communicating through network
   media. Media practices of journalists and ``mediaoriented practices{''}
   of audiences (Couldry) make use of the network as a common resource,
   merging into a new form of ``news-based communication.{''} This new
   situation of public communication questions institutional approaches to
   journalism and the crisis it currently experiences. The paper proposes
   to regard journalism as a structure of public communication which is
   mutually enacted by journalists and audiences alike. Practice is
   outlined as a conceptual tool to study how social structures such as
   journalism can innovate. In practice, cultural schemas value resources
   of communication and endow actors with agency. As media of public
   communication are de-differentiated in digital contexts, practice offers
   a way to understand innovation as the gradual transposition of such
   schemas to new resources.}},

Journal = {{JURNAL TEKNOLOGI}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{49-56}},
Abstract = {{The demand for copyright protection of text documents is extremely vital
   especially when the text is transmitted over the Internet. One of the
   best practical resolutions to maintain the security of document media is
   digital watermarking. Several approaches have been proposed to guarantee
   the safety and protection of the documents against dishonest copying and
   distribution. This paper suggests an innovative zero-watermarking scheme
   for the purpose of authentication and tamper detection in simple text
   documents. The algorithm generates a watermark based on the effective
   characters of the text contents which can be extracted later using
   extraction algorithm to identify the status of tampering in the text
   document. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   algorithm against random tampering attacks. Watermark pattern matching
   and watermark distortion rate are used as evaluation parameters on
   multiple text samples of varying length.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, the authors approach the perspective of Online
   Education in the Metaverse from the tensioning between what
   characterizes a novelty and what characterizes an innovation in
   education. They present and discuss the subtopic ``Learning Contexts in
   Metaverse{''} to draw attention to those aspects that involve the
   learning process in the context of 3D digital virtual worlds. In the
   subtopic ``Methodologies in Metaverse,{''} they present the
   methodologies: `` Methodology of Learning Projects Based in Problems{''}
   and ``Problematizing Methodology of Case Study.{''} In the context
   methodologies, the authors approach the ``Pedagogical Intervention in
   Metaverse.{''} In the subtopic ``Novelty or Innovation?{''} they bring
   examples of 3D digital virtual worlds that represent a novelty and/or
   innovation. In conclusion about the chapter, the authors believe that
   the development of online education in the metaverse can contribute to
   elevating the quality in education within the world educational scenario
   through more innovative pedagogical proposals.}},

Journal = {{LIBRARY MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{362-377}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Digital humanities (DH) has become a much discussed topic
   among both humanities scholars and library professionals. The library
   and information science (LIS) community has taken efforts in providing
   new facilities and developing new services to meet humanities scholars'
   changing research behaviors and needs employing digital tools and
   methods. How to effectively collaborate with the DH community has been a
   challenging task to LIS in their digital library (DL) development
   endeavors. The purpose of this paper is to discover productive ways for
   LIS to support DH scholarship, specifically, what DL components,
   including content, technology, and service, should and could be
   developed for digital humanists.
   Design/methodology/approach - As an initial effort of the Digital
   Humanities Interest Group at University of California, Irvine Libraries,
   the examination is primarily based on a cross-boundary environmental
   scan in both DH and DL fields. The environmental survey includes both a
   literature review and web and physical site visits. The survey results,
   especially a gap analysis between the behaviors and needs of humanities
   scholars and the digital content, technologies, and services currently
   offered by the DL community, are used to shape the proposed roles of DH
   librarianship.
   Findings - First, DH's innovative approach to research and teaching
   practices brings opportunities and challenges. Second, DH research is
   collaborative work. Third, major channels are established for the DH
   community. Fourth, various tools and data sets are developed to support
   different types of projects. Fifth, DH community has unbalanced
   geographical and disciplinary distribution. Sixth, DH research output
   still lacks attention, integration, and sustainability. Finally, LIS
   professionals play unique roles in DH projects. Overall, the communities
   of DH and DL share common goals and tasks.
   Practical implications - This paper proposes these present and future
   roles of LIS professionals: creator and contributor; curator; messenger
   and liaison; educator; mediator and interpreter; host; partner;
   innovator;{''}hybrid scholar{''}; advocate; consultant. At the
   organizational level, libraries should demonstrate higher efficiency and
   effectiveness in the services by revamping organizational culture or
   structure to stimulate and realize more and deeper cross-boundary
   conversations and collaborations. On a larger scale, the DL community
   should strive to become more visible, valuable, and approachable to the
   DH community; and even better, become part of it.
   Originality/value - This paper examines both DH and DL fields critically
   and connects the two communities by discovering gaps and commonalities.
   Based on the findings, the authors recommend roles and actions to be
   taken by LIS professionals, libraries, and the DL community. This paper
   is valuable to both humanities scholars who are seeking support in their
   research using digital methods and LIS professionals who are interested
   in providing more effective and suitable services. The paper also helps
   library administrators and aspiring librarians better understand the
   concept of DH and grasp insight on the present and future of DH
   librarianship.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, highway bridge conditions have been monitored by visual
   inspection with structural deficiencies being manually identified and
   classified by qualified engineers and inspectors. However, the quality
   of inspection results obtained through the traditional inspection
   approach depends on the individual inspector's subjective judgment based
   on his/her knowledge and experience, as well as varying field
   conditions. In addition, these traditional inspection procedures require
   significant investments in both time and labor cost. Under these
   circumstances, innovative non-destructive bridge condition assessment
   technologies using infrared thermography and digital concrete surface
   imaging have been developed and applied to the highway bridge structures
   in Japan. This paper describes the results of integrated high-end
   infrared thermography (IR) and line cameras to obtain bridge deck
   cracks, defects and delamination with on-site applications for sample
   bridges in the state of Florida, Virginia and Maryland.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices must be
   combined with integrated circuits (ICs) for operation in larger
   electronic systems. While MEMS transducers sense or control physical,
   optical or chemical quantities, ICs typically provide functionalities
   related to the signals of these transducers, such as analog-to-digital
   conversion, amplification, filtering and information processing as well
   as communication between the MEMS transducer and the outside world.
   Thus, the vast majority of commercial MEMS products, such as
   accelerometers, gyroscopes and micro-mirror arrays, are integrated and
   packaged together with ICs. There are a variety of possible methods of
   integrating and packaging MEMS and IC components, and the technology of
   choice strongly depends on the device, the field of application and the
   commercial requirements. In this review paper, traditional as well as
   innovative and emerging approaches to MEMS and IC integration are
   reviewed. These include approaches based on the hybrid integration of
   multiple chips (multi-chip solutions) as well as system-on-chip
   solutions based on wafer-level monolithic integration and heterogeneous
   integration techniques. These are important technological building
   blocks for the `More-ThanMoore' paradigm described in the International
   Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. In this paper, the various
   approaches are categorized in a coherent manner, their merits are
   discussed, and suitable application areas and implementations are
   critically investigated. The implications of the different MEMS and IC
   integration approaches for packaging, testing and final system costs are
   reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{In the museum world, innovative design practices often result from
   collaborations spanning disciplinary borders within the museum. This
   article focuses on prototyping as one of the fundamental methods to
   support design activity, and to foster collaboration among members of
   the design team. In particular, the article aims to explore how
   prototypes support design practice by integrating knowledge coming from
   different team members' expertise. Using a qualitative research
   approach, this paper explores the use of prototypes in five digital
   media projects in museums. The qualitative data collected have been
   analysed and discussed through the lenses of the
   Socialization-Externalization-CombinationInternalization knowledge
   management framework. This study aims to contribute to a better
   understanding of how and why team members can take advantage of
   prototypes to create, transfer, combine, and embody knowledge.}},

Pages = {{369-382}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to describe a library project exploring
   innovative options for embedding information literacy skills in the
   elementary school library by utilizing Minecraft, a virtual world
   three-dimensional (3D) building game environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - The small-scale descriptive study, with a
   follow-up survey, focuses on a group of fifth-grade students in an
   after-school technology club facilitated by the school librarian. The
   students designed and built a 3D virtual world library game for younger
   students to help them learn digital citizenship and information
   literacy.
   Findings - Analysis of observations, interviews and videos indicated
   that students were highly engaged in learning information literacy
   elements throughout all stages of the project from design, building,
   implementation and testing of younger students.
   Research limitations/implications - Although the small number of
   students enrolled in the club is a limitation, the feedback provided
   strong evidence of motivation for learning through gamification. Further
   research could assess learning outcomes with the curriculum,
   specifically for digital citizenship and information literacy.
   Practical implications - Embedding information literacy into a 3D world
   allows students to learn computer code, mathematics, game design, and
   fosters collaboration while demonstrating digital citizenship.
   Social implications - Game design requires teamwork, a real-life skill
   essential for students entering the work force.
   Originality/value - Few articles share student-designed solutions of
   critical information literacy needs. This study exemplifies
   constructivist learning in a gaming environment.}},

Abstract = {{From blogs to crowdfunding, YouTube to LinkedIn, online photo-sharing
   sites to open-source community-based software projects, the social web
   has been a meaningful player in the development of archaeological
   practice for two decades now. Yet despite its myriad applications, it is
   still often appreciated as little more than a tool for communication,
   rather than a paradigm-shifting system that also shapes the questions we
   ask in our research, the nature and spread of our data, and the state of
   skill and expertise in the profession. We see this failure to critically
   engage with its dimensions as one of the most profound challenges
   confronting archaeology today. The social web is bound up in relations
   of power, control, freedom, labour and exploitation, with consequences
   that portend real instability for the cultural sector and for social
   welfare overall. Only a handful of archaeologists, however, are
   seriously debating these matters, which suggests the discipline is
   setting itself up to be swept away by our unreflective investment in the
   cognitive capitalist enterprise that marks much current web-based work.
   Here we review the state of play of the archaeological social web, and
   reflect on various conscientious activities aimed both at challenging
   practitioners' current online interactions, and at otherwise situating
   the discipline as a more informed innovator with the social web's
   possibilities.}},

Abstract = {{Ecommerce industry, which started flourishing in India nearly ten years
   back has come a long way in a very short span of time in India. It is
   today one of the fastest growing sector of the Indian digital economy.
   Online shopping or online retailing - an application of e commerce, has
   become a popular trend in India from last few years. Due to
   mordernization, digitialisation and globalization Indian population have
   started enjoying the benefits of online shopping like convenience in
   shopping, 24 hrs shopping, free delivery, huge discounts, etc, at their
   doorstep. Some of popular online shopping websites in India Amazon. com,
   Flipkart.com, Snapdeal.com, Paytm.com, Ebay.in, Jabong.com, Myntra.com,
   Shopclues.com, Pepperfry, Homeshopl 8.com, yebhi.com. Flipkart, one
   among the top leader in ecommerce business in India started its
   operation in 2007 with selling online books and presently Flipkart is
   offering product categories like clothing, accessories, footwear,
   electronics, home decor and much more. On 6 Oct 2014 Flipkart introduced
   a new strategy of its own ``the big billion day sale{''}. It was a one
   day sale which is considered to be the biggest sale among all the sale
   offered till now by e-tailors. Many companies and brands are offering
   sales and discount for their customers in Indian online and offline
   market. Promoting sales by providing innovative offers to customers is
   good but at the same time a million dollar question also arises that
   ``What are the boundaries or how big should be the innovation?{''}.}},

Journal = {{PATHOLOGY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{23-33}},
Abstract = {{Significant technologic gains have led to the adoption of innovative
   digital imaging solutions in pathology. Whole slide imaging (WSI), which
   refers to scanning of conventional glass slides in order to produce
   digital slides, is the most recent imaging modality being employed by
   pathology departments worldwide. WSI continues to gain traction among
   pathologists for diagnostic, educational, and research purposes. This
   article provides a technologic review of WSI platforms and covers
   clinical and nonclinical pathology applications of these imaging
   systems. Barriers to adoption of WSI include limiting technology, image
   quality, problems with scanning all materials (eg, cytology slides),
   cost, digital slide storage, inability to handle high-throughput routine
   work, regulatory barriers, ergonomics, and pathologists' reluctance.
   Emerging issues related to clinical validation, standardization, and
   forthcoming advances in the field are also addressed.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-expanding communicative space online has provided Chinese
   individuals with unprecedented access to an exploding base of
   user-generated content and has engendered innovative ways of mass
   collaboration and grassroots participation in the information production
   process. Within this context, an emerging pattern has redefined the
   contours of Chinese cyber culture in which dispersed individuals
   creatively coordinate efforts to expose outrageous wrongdoings and
   transgressions committed by government officials and other targeted
   individuals. This article scrutinizes the role of social media in China
   in opening up new windows of opportunities for mass collaboration and
   collective action. The analysis is embedded in the current Chinese
   socio-political power relations and hegemonic structure, and focuses on
   the salient themes, trending patterns, and circumstantial factors
   underlying this type of social media activism. It concludes with a
   deliberation on the implications of this type of populism for so-called
   netizens, the authoritarian polity, and the evolving new media landscape
   in China.}},

Abstract = {{University as a research center has a responsibility to commercialize
   research products. Sebelas Maret University (UNS) is intensively
   developing featured products. A clinic management application has been
   developed to be the initial product by the inventor. The clinic
   management application is already developed in prototype form. The
   application should be tested before entering the market to determine
   compliance with the customers need. Technology Innovation Center UNS
   conducts a pre-test market survey to determine consumer wants and needs,
   target market, and knowing consumers assessment of the clinic management
   application. Pre-test market is conducted by distributing questionnaires
   in two stages. We use the 4P, 4S, and 4C marketing mix model as a
   reference to formulating questionnaires. The first stage aims to
   identify and obtain variables that considered by respondents in choosing
   an application to complete a job. The second stage, respondents are
   asked to give an assessment to the clinic management application. Both
   stages can provide input on inventors to make product improvement and
   gives an overview about application that required by customer to
   complete a job.}},

Abstract = {{Teaching analog and digital electronic subjects is not a trivial task
   because is necessary to use opposite methodologies. The electronic
   design in the digital field is centered in the use of microprocessor and
   FPGA based circuits using high level programing/configuring languages.
   The counterpart analog design is traditionally based in the use of
   elementary components associated with macroblocks such operational
   amplifiers in order to built-up the wanted mission circuit. Some few
   components, as the FPAA, are analogically configurable in a similar
   manner already used with the FPGA. However the use of this kind of
   components is not straightforward once is necessary to acquire some
   concepts not taught in the traditionally analog electronic classes.
   The current work presents an innovative remote lab to support teaching
   of the FPAAs.}},

   result of each area maturation state. So, are also the teaching
   methodologies, being challenging for both teachers and students. The
   electronic design in the digital field is centered in the use of
   microprocessor and FPGA based circuits using high level
   programing/configuring languages. In a different way, the analog design
   is traditionally based on the use of elementary components associated
   with macroblocks, such operational amplifiers in order to built- up the
   wanted mission circuit. Some analog programmable components, as the
   PSoC, are analogically configurable in a manner similar to those already
   used in the digital domain. The use of this type of components is not
   straightforward, being necessary to get some concepts traditionally not
   taught in the analog electronic classes. The training using PSoC is then
   indispensable to verify if the programmed circuit corresponds to the
   intended one.
   The current work presents an innovative remote lab to support teaching
   of the PSoC.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe there is a very high concentration of small enterprises
   operating not only in local but also in international markets. In the
   past, these firms have shown a lower propensity to invest in information
   and communication technologies (ICT), when compared with larger
   companies. The main reasons were technologies' high prices and small
   firms' inability to fully understand and exploit the strategic potential
   of new technologies. Recently several factors have encouraged small
   firms to adopt digital technologies, mainly web 2.0 tools, like social
   media. Social media offer plenty of opportunities for small enterprises:
   they can interact with their stakeholders and can receive
   opinions/suggestions to improve their products/services. In this paper
   we analyse the adoption and use of social media by a sample of 48 small
   firms. The analysis allows to identify some specificity in the way small
   firms use social media and to assess their ability to exploit
   technologies' potential. Data has been collected by websites' analysis,
   a questionnaire survey and interviews with entrepreneurs and/or
   ICT/Marketing managers. Results show that social media open a wide range
   of opportunities for small firms, because they are cheap and don't
   require high-level technological competences. Small firms are starting
   to realize the importance of virtual channels to achieve business goals
   and are gradually learning to take advantage from the use of such
   technologies, although often introduced as an element of curiosity or
   because they are considered ``fashionable{''}. Small enterprises using
   social media are open to relationships with external stakeholders
   (customers, suppliers, sponsors, partners) and willing to share business
   information. This way of doing business represents a breakdown of
   traditional organization models. Micro and small enterprises, which are
   usually deep-rooted in their local environment, may take advantage of
   web 2.0 technologies and e-commerce sections to operate in a global
   market.}},

Abstract = {{As the Internet use has been growing and attracting more and more
   people, the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) has
   become popular among people, especially young people. Young people are
   not only keen on using ICTs for communicating with their peers but also
   for their education because they are more computer literate than their
   teachers and parents. Thus, they prefer to have fast and instantaneous
   communication and reach information quickly. Although teachers and
   students are far from each other physically, they communicate thanks to
   information and communication technologies, learn new information about
   their lessons, repeat this information, and reinforce what they learn in
   class. The developments in the use of ICTs also affect language
   education since language education cannot be thought without ICTs.
   Students who learn a language do not only use their textbooks, but also
   join Facebook groups, use digital learning materials, communicate with
   their friends and teachers via Skype and Whatsapp, listen to podcasts,
   and watch videos on Youtube. Keeping in mind the importance of ICTs in
   education, this study aims at exploring the perceptions of language
   learners on the use of ICTs and mobile applications in education,
   especially in language learning. Participants of this study are 137
   students at Modern Languages Department who are learning English,
   German, French, Italian, Spanish, Chinese and Russian at the School of
   Foreign Languages, Anadolu University. Necessary data for the study were
   collected via a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of questions
   seekingparticipants' demographic information and some predetermined
   open-ended questions exploring participants' use of ICTs. Emerging
   themes in open-ended questions were found using Constant Comparison
   Method. The results of the study served to establish models in
   innovations in language teaching, new methods to make lessons more
   attractive, recommendations for educational institutions and teachers.
   Based on the results, certain implications were drawn from the study in
   order to organize future language teaching practices that utilize ICTs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces current research taking place at the University of
   Edinburgh, which examines students' use of social media and how they
   manage their digital footprint. The work engages all student cohorts
   (undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD, and including online students) and
   aligns with the innovative cross-University `Digital Footprint' campaign
   (2014-2015) in order to conduct a systematic programme of research aimed
   at building our institutional and sectoral understanding of how students
   are managing their digital footprints, where such management is lacking,
   and what this might mean for future institutional planning to build
   student competence in this area. This paper will outline the rationale
   for this work, including theoretical and practical contexts and
   challenges associated with running a digital footprint (social media
   awareness) campaign on this scale, as well as providing some initial
   insights arising from activities to date. It will also look ahead to
   ongoing and future activities, including further research work and a
   planned impact analysis of the social media awareness campaign. The
   ``Managing your digital footprint{''} campaign is a collaboration
   between the University of Edinburgh Institute for Academic Development
   (IAD), EDINA, Student Information Portals, Information Services, Careers
   Service, and the Edinburgh University Student Association. The research
   is funded under the University of Edinburgh Principal's Teaching Award
   Scheme and is being led by researchers from the IAD, the Moray House
   School of Education and EDINA. It is anticipated that research findings
   for this project will feed into University of Edinburgh policy, provide
   evidence-based guidance to colleagues with responsibility for embedding
   digital social media in learning and teaching, provide evidence to
   enable support services to meet students' needs and use of social media,
   and give a rich picture of the current `state of play' among our diverse

Abstract = {{In collaboration with the Institute of Mental Health and the Centre for
   Advanced Studies at the University of Nottingham, CaSMa (Citizen-Centric
   Approaches to Social Media Analysis) held a thought-provoking workshop
   to reconsider and reflect upon concerns about social media data,
   especially in relation to vulnerable adults and minors who may
   inadvertently be part of the user group. Held over a single day, the
   workshop included subject experts such as Monica Whitty (University of
   Leicester), Karen Douglas (University of Kent), Jens Binder (Nottingham
   Trent University) and Ilka Gleibs (London School of Economics). The
   speakers engaged with the audience to illustrate a series of relevant
   ethical issues (e.g., anonymity and privacy) and their implications not
   only on Internet-mediated research aspects but for day-to-day
   Internet-related activities. During the workshop, two hands-on sessions
   focused on the ethics of personal data in both theory and practice, and
   how social medial data can be accessed and analysed to: (1) understand
   the ways people use social media and what this means for individuals and
   society, (2) understand social phenomena and events expressed in social
   media by drawing upon social media as a critical, and timely, source of
   information, (3) develop facilities and approaches that are sensitive to
   the personal nature of human data: Citizen-centric approaches, (4)
   promote responsible innovation in the capture, analysis and use of human
   data. The ultimate goal of the workshop was to further understand the
   issues that social scientists encounter when accessing and handling
   personal data, and possible ethical solutions in developing sustainable
   and reliable `Citizen Social Science'. This paper presents the most
   relevant insights as formulated from the workshop discussions on social
   media data and mental health. These insights were provided by
   clinicians, researchers, and policy makers interested in understanding
   the ethical constraints inherent to digital human data generated through
   the use of online platforms by vulnerable users (e.g., children, young
   people and adults experiencing mental distress). These groups were of
   particular interest given that they may often not be fully aware of the
   terms and conditions accepted when accessing such online services.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel instrument for measuring bed-load transport in
   closed channel flows. The instrument is based on modern innovations in
   high-frequency acquisition and processing of digital images, and its
   novelty allows for quantifying instantaneous sediment transport rate in
   an efficient and non-intrusive way. With this instrument, experiments
   were conducted in a closed rectangular channel under various water
   pressures. For each experiment, uniform sediment particles were paved on
   the flat bed, and their motions were recorded with a high-speed camera.
   Velocities of active particles (particle entrained to motion) were
   calculated by identifying and tracking particles in motion. The effects
   of various parameters were analyzed, including sampling frequency,
   sampling area, flow intensity, and water pressure. Preliminary analysis
   of the experimental results yields interesting new findings. Bed load
   transport displays a streak-like pattern on the bed, i.e, sediment
   particles tend to be entrained into motion in patches rather than
   individually. This nonuniformity indicates that large-scale coherent
   structures near channel bed may play an important role in ``picking
   up{''} sediment particles. The sampling frequency affects the percentage
   of particles in motion as well as their velocities; the sediment
   transport rate, however, seems to be irrelevant to sampling frequency.
   The streamwise and spanwise particle velocities exhibit Gaussian and
   exponential probability density functions, respectively. The absolute
   pressure exerts negligible influence on the entrainment of non-cohesive
   particle, and the threshold of Shields number for bed load initiation is
   about 0.03. The experiments show that variation in instrumental
   parameters may substantially alter the final results.}},

Abstract = {{Society is facing serious threats due to climate change. Climate change
   affects urban areas by increased air temperatures (Heat Urban Island
   Effect) and possibly by increasing the chances of heavy rainfall. In the
   case of extreme rainfalls, flooding assessment tools are important for
   decision makers. Moreover, accurate modeling tools could directly
   contribute to the resilience of cities and its existing infrastructure.
   In the present article we describe a methodology which combines 1 and 2
   dimensional modeling. The surface runoff is considered in the 2
   dimensional component. Here, we apply a newly developed numerical method
   (Stelling, 2012) for detailed 2 dimensional flooding simulations. The
   sewer system and surface channels are considered in the 1 dimensional
   component. Both components are interactively coupled. Another specific
   feature of the presented methodology is the innovative method for
   handling the inflow of rainfall into the sewer. In contrast to standard
   methods of lateral inflow on the 1 dimensional component for the
   distribution of rainfall our methodology applies spatially distributed
   rainfall on the 2 dimensional component. We apply this methodology to
   construct a model for the city of Purmerend, the Netherlands. The model
   results are satisfactorily compared with existing measurements. Next,
   the model is applied to analyze the effects of extreme rainfall
   scenarios, e.g. a rainfall of 100 mm hr-1 of intensity. The results of
   the presented model are used to highlight the focusing areas and
   structures to guarantee the resilience of Purmerend against extreme
   rainfall.

Abstract = {{Maintaining well skilled and knowledgeable employees is key to
   sustaining our competitive advantage through smarter information use of
   digital technologies. By reviewing current government training practice
   and information technology (IT) governance, this paper describes a
   funded project that shares valuable insights into differentiating what
   people do and do not know. An innovative research programme was devised
   to investigate the interactive effect of instructional strategies and
   training mode preferences on the acquisition of introductory ethics
   concepts. Three instructional treatments involved: interactive
   computer-based (online) Web 2.0 technologies; traditional face-to-face
   teacher-led classroom; and a blend of face-to-face and the computerised
   strategies. A preferred training mode instrument was used to establish
   the participants' favourite training mode, experience with eLearning,
   and work mode training expectation. The Quest interactive test-item
   analysis system (Adams \& Khoo, 1996) provided the instructional
   performance measuring tool, which ensured an absence of error
   measurement in the ethics knowledge testing instrumentation. We show the
   gains in knowledge of introductory ethics achievement for three training
   treatment groups; face-to-face, computerised and a blend of both. Having
   access to our individual virtual learning space is critical; this
   project places Australia at the centre of training through a pseudo
   virtual reality environment. Adopting such Web 2.0 technologies in the
   race to empower the global reach of an individual's access to adaptable
   eLearning tools may satisfy our unyielding intellectual thirst for
   creating new learning spaces for the next decade.}},

Abstract = {{Heart failure seems inevitable as we grow older; even younger people
   succumb to its cruel onset. Finding solutions has kept medical
   researchers continually chasing ways to limit its effects. Yet much can
   be done in a proactive sense for patients with heart conditions that can
   be used to support patients in becoming reflective, empowered and active
   self-carers themselves. In another project, Riegel, Jaarsma and
   Stromberg (2012) investigated individual patient-centered case-studies,
   to understand how to best encourage people to become confident
   self-carers (Aidemark, Askenas, Martensson, \& Stromberg, 2013). We have
   drawn on these earlier works to design and build a proof-of-concept for
   a participatory eLearning system to innovate quality eHealth education
   for self-care heart failure prevention. The first task has been to
   develop an evaluation framework that represents the need for individual
   extensibility of effective online human-computer interactive (HCI)
   healthcare. Our plans are to use this framework to compare other online
   healthcare systems research. Critical to the success of this educational
   information system (IS) are the diversity of the system-users' that are
   raised by the human-dimensions of online healthcare. HCI archetypes will
   guide the user as they journey through key healthcare scenarios. Our
   main aim with this project is to provide a participatory online
   self-managed healthy heartcare programme. This paper describes our first
   project objective which is to test our evaluation framework.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the concept and literature of `smart cities' has
   focused attention on the relation between new technologies, the problem
   solving capacities of cities as ecosystems and the role of citizens,
   SMEs and design oriented professional focused on developing new
   solutions. In smart cities two approaches seem to be prevalent. One is
   technology pushed, top-down, and focuses on creating new products in
   order to fully exploit the possibilities of new technologies such as
   broadband networks. Many cities are in the process of developing digital
   strategies, often in alliance with larger IT firms, in order to create
   new future business models that underpin city life. The bottom-up
   approach perceives of cities as ecosystems for developing new city
   solutions, and uses the diversity and intelligence of these ecosystems
   to create user-driven innovations in open collaborative processes that
   generate added value. These are often referred to as `living labs'. This
   paper aims at identifying the essential building blocks for the
   ecosystems that are required for a successful smart city that is able to
   link top-down efforts with a bottom-up approach. Following such a
   bottom-up approach, we start with a case study of an open data and smart
   city initiative in the Dutch city of Enschede in the context of the
   national initiatives on open data. It is based on document analysis and
   an interview with the open data officer in the selected city. The
   remainder of the paper analyses the approach followed by Enschede by
   considering the case from a governance, an IT, a societal as well as
   from a business perspective. Based on this study we come up with three
   categories of building blocks for ecosystems for innovative smart
   cities.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating the use of Web-based and mobile technology applications into
   K-12 world languages contexts requires innovative teacher preparation
   models. This chapter evaluates a multi-step technology integration unit
   that develops in pre-service teachers the skills necessary to plan and
   carry out learner-centered communicative instruction. Importantly, this
   unit also incorporates five skills for disruptive innovators.
   Pre-service teachers blend pedagogy, technology tools, and content in
   project-based learning lesson design while practicing creative-thinking
   skills. As student teachers learn to repurpose mobile applications for
   the language-learning classroom, they empower articulate digital natives
   and foster 21st century learning. Given technology's constant growth,
   teaching integration of specific apps will have limited benefits. On the
   other hand, teaching how to innovate and repurpose will serve student
   teachers for their entire career. Results of this study show growth in
   lesson planning, creativity, and innovation skills.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Modern digital public spaces are evolving from being mostly the
   provider of ICT and internet connection to institutions that provide
   complex range of services and support for the community. With this shift
   in their focus new challenges are emerging, among others their
   sustainability.
   Methodology/Approach: We build on and extend the methodology of Digital
   Cooperatives project. Within this project, survey on 59 digital public
   spaces from 12 EU countries was conducted. These digital public spaces
   were examined in 21 areas, some of them relating to their
   sustainability. We further analyse the sustainability issue of these
   digital public spaces.
   Findings: We identified three main issues affecting sustainability of
   digital public spaces - budgeting, services and community. Digital
   public spaces mostly rely on public funding and have limited
   diversification of their funds, which increases a risk when one source
   of funding drops out. They also have to build a strong community of
   users, supporters, which will make use of their capacities and helps
   co-create new services and thus strengthen and improve the community
   itself.
   Originality/Value of paper: Research in this paper is based on the
   collection of best practices from various EU countries in the field of
   digital public spaces. Recommendations based on these practices could
   help the creation of new, and in current digital public spaces.}},

Abstract = {{In higher education, the challenge presented by the current educational
   scenario cannot go unnoticed, in which variables related to numerous
   transformations converge in different ways: the role played by teachers
   and students, the ways of learning, sharing and communicating knowledge,
   and the times and spaces in which learning takes place. Nowadays, a
   multiplicity of pedagogical innovative actions is possible by taking
   advantage of the new means, resources and environments that the digital
   technologies have made available for teaching, and which may boost and
   enrich it.
   In consequence, training professionals for university teaching displays
   the unavoidable commitment of thinking about the characteristics that
   teaching should adopt in higher education within the new contexts. This
   article is aimed at analyzing the feasibility of incorporating changes
   in the teaching modalities in university classrooms, from the
   exploration of proposals such as flipped classrooms, open educational
   resources, the possibility to enrich the ideas shared and scattered all
   over the cyberspace, through the so called collective intelligence which
   propitiates a boosted learning.
   Within the framework of the Course of Studies on University Teaching
   Specialization of the Veterinary Sciences School of the University of
   Buenos Aires, an experience carried out in the workshop ``Selection and
   Production of Didactic Materials{''} is described, which was directed to
   the design of hypermedial didactic materials for a flipped classroom,
   using the remix procedure and with a representation of the teacher as
   content curator.}},

Abstract = {{. This study used qualitative methods to explore why some educators
   embrace the use of digital game-play (DGP) in the classroom. The results
   indicated that these teachers had a very strong belief that DGP could be
   beneficial for learning which stemmed from experiencing their own form
   of subjective success with using DGP in the classroom, availing
   themselves of information and advocacy about using DGP in the classroom
   and personal experiences with DGP either through their own DGP or
   through watching their own children play games. They also shared
   positive attitudes towards information and communication technologies
   generally and had initially been invited to use DGP in the classroom by
   someone in authority. Their use of DGP was also something that they felt
   made them different to other teachers. Applying these findings to
   Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory predicted that the diffusion
   rate of using DGP in the classroom will continue to be slow. Finally,
   this study indicates that teachers need to experience their own form of
   subjective `success' in order to find DGP valuable and this subjective
   `success' often goes beyond test score performance.}},

Abstract = {{The application of innovative technologies in dentistry and orthodontics
   has been very interesting to observe. The development of cone-beam
   computed tomography (CBCT) as a preferred imaging procedure for
   comprehensive orthodontic treatment is of particular interest. The
   information obtained from CBCT imaging provides several substantial
   advantages. For example, CBCT imaging provides accurate measurements,
   improves localization of impacted teeth, provides visualization of
   airway abnormalities, it identifies and quantifies asymmetry, it can be
   used to assess periodontal structures, to identify endodontic problems,
   to plan placement sites for temporary skeletal anchorage devices, and to
   view condylar positions and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) bony
   structures according to the practitioner's knowledge at the time of
   orthodontic diagnosis. Moreover, CBCT imaging involves only a minimal

Abstract = {{The protection of soils and thus maintaining the ability to perform
   their ecological function requires careful analysis of the soils
   properties. The diversification of protection and de-pollution
   techniques of the soil determines the development of investigation
   techniques, both of the composition and of the soil characteristics. In
   this regard, experiments performed in the Laboratory of Soil Science
   from the Technical University ``Gheorghe Asachi{''} University, and
   other institutions with which the University has collaborative
   relationships represents an important contribution to the development of
   research methodology of soil for various purposes. Some of the most
   significant results were obtained in soil physics and refers to: the use
   of infrared spectrometry in research of soil matrix composition, the
   study of soil porosity by electron microscopy and medical imaging
   technique, the experimental determination of hydraulic conductivity of
   soil and the use of mathematical models in research on aero-hydric soil
   regime. Themineralogical composition of the clay in soil was studied
   using IR spectra obtained with a Shimadzu spectrophotometer
   Iraffinity-1. Colloidal inorganic matrix or clay, as it is commonly
   called, has a number of properties which are a result of the
   characteristics of its components. The quality of the clay can be
   established by identification of these components and their proportions.
   Clay minerals identified in studied clay soils are: illite, smectite
   (montmorillonite), kaolinite and chlorite. In addition, spectrometry
   revealed the presence of vermiculite elements or poorly expressed
   interstratifications. QUANTA electron microscope 3D Dual Beam 200, used
   in the study of the soil porosity, is a combination of two systems:- SEM
   is an electron microscope that produces enlarged images of a variety of
   samples performing a magnification of over 100,000x at a high resolution
   digital format.- FIB is an ion beam system that provides high resolution
   images. In the field of soil science, for research on porous
   environment, axial tomography using X-ray (X-ray computer tomography -
   CT) or Gamma is a highly effective and innovative method for
   investigating soil structure, spatial distribution of porosity and
   ground water content. Experimental determination of the soil hydraulic
   conductivity was made on a modern complex installation, having the
   possibility of recording data and their automatic processing. Land MOHID
   software was used to simulate water flow through porous media (soil). It
   solves the Richards equation for saturated and unsaturated porous media.
   Currently, soil hydraulic properties are described by using the Van
   Genuchten equation. However, the model is prepared, where appropriate,
   to include any model which describes water content and the hydrostatic
   pressure or the relationship between the conductivity and hydrostatic
   pressure, respectively. The simulation results showed that the MOHID
   Land computer program, with adjustments made by Porous Media Module
   Properties, PREEQC and Sediment Quality, is a pertinent tool for
   analysing issues like: soil water dynamics, transport of solutions and
   transformations undergone by the different substances and some
   components of the air from the soil. For the soil water dynamics
   simulation using Land MOHID software, it is necessary that the input
   data such as rainfall, irrigation and soil characteristics (hydraulic
   parameters) to be representative in the studied area and obtained as
   result of high rank analysis and quality studies.
   The conclusions emphasize the importance of results and contributions to
   the development of knowledge, which are appreciated as result of a
   coherent and relevant analysis of the scientific literature.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the results of a collaborative action research
   conducted with people living with intellectual disabilities (ID) who
   were going through a community integration process. To be successfully
   integrated into a community, they need to develop basic life skills as
   much as they need to learn to use mobile technologies for authentic
   interactions (Davidson, 2012) and to be self-advocates online (Davidson,
   2009a). This study used the Capability Approach pioneered by Sen (1992)
   and Nussbaum (2000), which focusses on what people can do rather than on
   their deficiencies. I recruited a group of eight people with ID who
   wished to set goals, engage in developing new capabilities, share their
   goals and act as models for others with ID who want to learn to live on
   their own. In this article, I examine the process of developing
   self-advocacy videos with mobile technologies using the Capability
   Approach and I analyze the inventory of capabilities collected through
   this study. I provide recommendations for intervention through mobile
   technologies with the long term-goal of helping people with ID to become
   contributing citizens. I discuss the innovative action research
   methodology I used to help people with ID become self-advocates and take
   control of the messages they give through producing their own digital
   resources.}},

Title = {{Emerging technologies and sports events Innovative information and
   communication solutions}},
Journal = {{SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{175-189}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the development and
   potential applications of emerging information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) in sports. The case studies are presented in
   details: computer system for tracking and visualisation in TV
   broadcasting and players/teams performance analysis in football. The
   paper concludes with the authors' opinion that future implementation of
   digital technologies, in the first instance, goal-line technologies, to
   support accurate, practical and reliable decision making in sports is
   highly needed and represent a basis for further increase in the
   commercial value of the pre-eminent global sport.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research utilised an exploratory
   approach to data gathering due to the fact that the topic is new and
   data are difficult to collect. The topic is analysed using case study
   method.
   Findings - The research found that there is an emerging market to extend
   the reach of digital technologies adapted for sports industry and sports
   events. Increasingly, developers are exploring and exploiting the vast
   potential of the ICTs to create value in the field of sports events. The
   development of emerging technologies create new opportunities that
   sports industry demands a growing range of innovative solutions for the
   purposes of decision making to be tested and accepted in the near
   future.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is based on data
   limitations related to the innovative ICT solutions, the rules of the
   game which significantly limit the scope for product innovation and a
   need to make a decision on application of an adequate solution within a
   short time period. In order to develop the extensive research results in
   the future, more information will be available after the termination of
   ongoing testing procedure.
   Practical implications - It is evident that digital video processing has
   found many applications in sports content analysis and TV broadcasting
   of competitive sports. The governing bodies should be aware of their
   role to support successful innovation which requires the coordinated
   action of all the actors who play vastly different roles in its
   commercialisation process.
   Originality/value - The paper emphasises how much technology has added
   to communication and economic potential of sports events, underlying
   that issue of video technology application to ease decision making in
   football is currently one of the most pressing matters due to constant
   arrival of new cases concerning ``incorrect{''} decisions that add fuel
   to the controversy. The football authorities have finally recognised
   that the game has to be responsive to the concerns and suggestions of
   its customers.}},

   involving art students in utilizing processing agents as part of studio
   practice by learning how to code programming languages is a rare
   occurrence. This article advocates for computational thinking as an
   urgent need within art education to prepare students to utilize digital
   innovations and create code-based artworks. By reviewing the
   constructionist origins of computational thinking for art educational
   purposes, we posit that creative code can benefit studio art practice
   while making broader contributions to conceptions of computational
   thinking across disciplines. We emphasize three concepts to engage in
   critical digital making by recognizing code as critical text, code as
   open or proprietary, and code as digital material to be performed and
   acted upon.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers the implications of recent innovations in digital
   history for the relationship between the academy and the public. It
   argues that while digitisation and the internet have attracted large new
   audiences, academic historians have been reluctant to engage with this
   new public. We suggest that recent innovations in academic digital
   history, such as the highly technocratic `Culturomics' movement, have
   had the unintended effect of driving a wedge between higher education
   and the wider public. Similarly, academic history writing has been slow
   to embrace the possibilities of the internet as a means of dissemination
   and engagement; and academic publishing has moved even more reluctantly.
   Despite these issues, this article argues that the internet offers real
   opportunities for bridging the divide between the academy and a wider
   audience. Through non-traditional forms of publication such as blogging;
   through Open Access policies; and through new forms of visualisation of
   complex data, the digital and online allow us to present complex history
   to a wider audience. We conclude that historians need to embrace the
   `affordances' and `disruptions' posed by the internet to render the
   discipline more open and democratically accessible.}},

Abstract = {{Mapmaking has become widespread through the Internet, resulting in a
   wide range of cartographic quality. To achieve better quality, mapmaking
   needs tools and online services for intuitive and efficient on-demand
   mapping. A project team at IGN, the French National Mapping Agency, is
   working on producing a digital cartographic model (DCM) from various
   existing databases and maps on which such tools and services are based.
   This DCM ranges from detailed topographic maps to small general road
   maps. GeoServer Web Map Service capabilities were used extensively to
   produce quality maps with various legends. Special care was taken to
   make a default legend suitable for customer data overlays, both
   on-screen and on paper. Web-based interface prototypes were built to
   guide users in choosing colors and creating their own original map
   legends. Users can also rely on a growing catalog of harmonious color
   palettes and map samples as sources of inspiration.}},

Abstract = {{The architecture of a product is the design and specification of
   inherent subsystems, components, and interfaces between subsystems.
   Well-defined interfaces allow the development of standardized subsystems
   that may be shared across product lines, e.g., technology platforms.
   Past research shows the benefits of modular product architecture in
   terms of improving cost of goods through common components and materials
   as well as improving development time cycles for derivative products.
   Product architecture does not occur by accident; it must be engineered
   and implemented. This study explores the impact of digital design and
   information technology (IT) on the development of modular product
   architectures. Through an empirical study of 122 firms and follow-up
   interviews with several respondents, we study the impact of digital
   design tools and IT infrastructure on the development of modular product
   architecture and overall project outcomes. The results indicate that a
   firm's IT infrastructure has a strong, significant relationship with the
   development of modular product architecture. The findings also show a
   strong, positive relationship between the development of modular product
   architecture and project outcomes. However, in contrast to the common
   perception that digital design tools enhance R\&D productivity and
   effectiveness, we do not find a significant relationship between digital
   design tool usage and modular product architecture or overall project
   outcomes. The findings suggest that digital design tools and their
   organizational implementation need improvement in up-front new product
   development phases.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-emerging demands on miniaturization of electronic devices have
   pushed the development of innovative materials with desired properties.
   One major endeavor is the development of organic- or organic-inorganic
   hybrid-based electronics as alternatives or supplements to silicon-based
   devices. Herein we report the first observation of the coexistence of
   resistance switching and ferroelectricity in a metal-organic framework
   (MOF) material, {[}InC16H11N2O8]center dot 1.5H(2)O, denoted as RSMOF-1.
   The electrical resistance of RSMOF-1 can be turned on and off repeatedly
   with a current ratio of 30. A first-principles molecular dynamics
   simulation suggests that the resistive switching effect is related to
   the ferroelectric transition of N center dot center dot center dot H-O
   center dot center dot center dot H-N bridge-structured dipoles of the
   guest water molecules and the amino-tethered MOF nanochannel. The
   discovery of the resistive switching effect and ferroelectricity in MOFs
   offers great potential for the physical implementation of novel
   electronics for next-generation digital processing and communication.}},

Title = {{Exploring anal self-examination as a means of screening for anal cancer
   in HIV positive men who have sex with men: a qualitative study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anal cancer is relatively common in HIV-positive men who
   have sex with men(MSM). However there are no clear guidelines on how to
   effectively screen for anal cancer. As earlier diagnosis of anal cancer
   is associated with increased survival, innovative ways such as utilizing
   anal self-examination to identify anal cancer should be explored.
   Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 HIV-positive
   MSM from a range of ages (35 to 78 years). This study explored
   acceptability and barriers to implementing ASE as a method of anal
   cancer screening. Framework analysis was used to identify themes.
   Results: Seventeen out of 20 men had conducted an ASE before - six
   (35\%) were for medical reasons, six (35\%) for sexual reasons, three
   (18\%) for both medical and sexual reasons, and two (12\%) for cleaning
   purposes. Only 5 men were currently confident in detecting an
   abnormality. Whilst men were generally comfortable with the idea of
   utilizing ASE as a means for detecting anal cancer, potential barriers
   identified operated at three levels: attitudinal (discomfort with any
   anal examinations, anxiety about finding an abnormality, preference for
   health professional examination), knowledge (lack of awareness of anal
   cancer risk and ignorance of anal cancer symptoms) and practical
   (inadequate physical flexibility, importance of hygiene).
   Conclusion: ASE may be an acceptable means for anal cancer detection in
   HIV-positive MSM but training in detecting abnormalities is needed. The
   preference for health professional examination and inadequate physical
   flexibility may preclude its use for some men. Future trials to confirm
   its wider acceptability will be needed before undertaking an
   effectiveness trial for detecting anal cancer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative architecture to drastically enlarge
   the bandwidth of the Doherty power amplifier (DPA). The proposed
   topology, based on novel input/output splitting/combining networks,
   allows to overcome the typical bandwidth limiting factors of the
   conventional DPA. A complete and rigorous theoretical investigation of
   the developed architecture is presented leading to a closed-form
   formulation suitable for a direct synthesis of ultra-wideband DPAs. The
   theoretical formulation is validated through the design, realization,
   and test of a hybrid prototype based on commercial GaN HEMT device
   showing a fractional bandwidth larger than 83\%. From 1.05 to 2.55 GHz,
   experimental results with continuous-wave signals have shown efficiency
   levels within 83\%-45\% and within 58\%-35\% at about 42- and 36-dBm
   output power, respectively. The DPA has also been tested and digitally
   predistorted by using a 5-MHz Third Generation Partnership Project
   (3GPP) signal. In particular, to evaluate the ultra-wideband and the
   multi-mode capabilities of the prototype, f(1) = 1.2 GHz, f(2) = 1.8
   GHz, and f(3) = 2.5 GHz have been selected as carrier frequencies for
   the 3GPP signal. Under these conditions and at 36-dBm average output
   power, the DPA shows 52\%, 35\%, and 52\% efficiency and an adjacent
   channel power ratio always lower than -43 dBc.}},

Abstract = {{In his article ``Electronic Poetry and the Importance of Digital
   Repository{''} Manuel Brito analyzes selected early digital repositories
   of electronic poetry. In addition to issues concerning efficiency and
   discursive practice, Brito's discusses the objectives, contents, and the
   funding of digital repositories. Brito argues that digital repositories
   promote poetry, enable networking and quick publishing of innovative
   poetry, they intensify the reading experience, and make a readership
   possible that is larger than that of print poetry. Networking,
   interaction, and web-based communication intensify the writing and
   reading experience while new modes of discourse are emerging
   continually. Not just passive consumerism promoted by an attractive
   presentation, digital repositories engage in developing aesthetics of
   poetry as a continual process of innovation. Their objectives, contents,
   and the funding of these e-repositories are not based on market-driven
   concepts or by academic purposes, but on the wish to allow for a true
   encounter with language. Importantly, in the case of new media
   publishing the figure of the editor has become responsible for
   reconciling novelty, lived cultural experience, and technical know-how.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim: Leaving open or closing the oculo-facial defect by
   means of a myocutaneous flap mainly depends on maxillofacial surgical
   considerations. For those cases that present a closed defect, the
   authors aim to evaluate an innovative method of ocular bulb positioning
   using a magnetic resonance imaging dataset.
   Technique: Following cancer removal and plastic reconstructive surgery,
   a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format magnetic
   resonance imaging dataset was used to determine the volume and position
   of the left ocular bulb. The exact location of the prosthetic bulb was
   determined by mirroring this position on the affected side. Images of
   the eyeglasses were imported into the virtual environment, and the
   designs of the substructure and facial prosthesis were projected using
   computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) technology.
   Discussion: The updated method presented here enables restoration with a
   facial prosthesis, even when a myocutaneous flap is used to close the
   defect, thereby resolving the problem of ocular bulb positioning and
   enabling the rapid and easy design of a retention system connected to
   eyeglasses.
   Clinical relevance The proposed protocol aims to develop and describe a
   viable method for the construction of a facial prosthesis for a patient
   whose face had been reconstructed using a myocutaneous free flap.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-adiabatic isoperibol solution calorimeter has been indigenously
   developed. The measurement system comprises modules for sensitive
   temperature measurement probe, signal processing, data collection, and
   joule calibration. The sensitivity of the temperature measurement module
   was enhanced by using a sensitive thermistor coupled with a lock-in
   amplifier based signal processor. A microcontroller coordinates the
   operation and control of these modules. The latter in turn is controlled
   through personal computer (PC) based custom made software developed with
   LabView. An innovative summing amplifier concept was used to cancel out
   the base resistance of the thermistor. The latter was placed in the
   dewar. The temperature calibration was carried out with a standard
   platinum resistance (PT100) sensor coupled with an 81/2 digit
   multimeter. The water equivalent of this calorimeter was determined by
   using electrical calibration with the joule calibrator. The
   experimentally measured values of the quantum of heat were validated by
   measuring heats of dissolution of pure KCl (for endotherm) and tris
   (hydroxyl methyl) amino-methane (for exotherm). The uncertainity in the
   measurements was found to be within +/- 3\%. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Current cellular spectrum at below 3 GHz bands is experiencing severe
   shortage and cannot keep up with the dramatic proliferation of mobile
   traffic in the near future, requiring the search for innovative
   solutions to enable the 5G era. mmWave communications, with a possible
   gigabit-per-second data rate, have attracted great attention as a
   candidate for 5G broadband cellular communication networks. However, a
   complete characterization of mmWave links for 5G wireless networks still
   remains elusive and there are many challenges and research areas that
   need to be addressed. In this work we discuss several key elements to
   enable mmWave communications in 5G:
   Channel characteristics regarding mmWave signal attenuation due to free
   space propagation, atmospheric gaseous and rain are explained.
   The hybrid (digital plus analog) beamforming architecture in mmWave
   system is discussed. \_ The blockage effect in mmWave communications due
   to penetration loss and possible approaches are presented.
   The application of mmWave transmission with narrow beams in
   non-orthogonal device-to-device communication is proposed.
   mmWave transmission in the booster cell of heterogeneous anchor-booster
   networks.
   mmWave transmission for small cell backhaul is further discussed.}},

Title = {{High-performance digitization of natural history collections: Automated
   imaging lines for herbarium and insect specimens}},
Journal = {{TAXON}},

Abstract = {{The digitization of natural history collections calls for new, efficient
   solutions. Digitization of millions of specimens, with reasonable
   digitization costs and high statistical repeatability requires increased
   automation and industrial-scale workflows. However, the variation in
   specimen form, size and coloring creates challenges for digitization
   methodology, pushing development towards optional actions. In this
   paper, we report the results of the digitization of herbarium and beetle
   collections using automated imaging lines. The technology of the imaging
   lines was based on a common innovation, but the versions used were
   applied to either 2-D sheets or small 3-D objects. The aim was to
   develop processes for enhancing the digitization of natural history
   specimens, but at the same time, to produce end products with high
   quality. Results showed that the herbarium and beetle collections could
   be digitized by using automation at the rate of hundreds or thousands of
   individual specimens per day. This is 5-10 times faster than the more
   manual methods of digitization which were previously used. The produced
   data, images and specimen label data were uniform in quality and could
   be viewed within minutes after being produced. Results indicate that the
   efficiency of digitization can be raised for different types of natural
   history specimens by use of automation and well-defined processes, and
   the increase in production rate does not reduce the quality of the
   end-results.}},

Title = {{Should Laptops Be Allowed in the Classroom? Two Viewpoints}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1580-1588}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This Point/Counterpoint article discusses the pros and cons of deploying
   one aspect of instructional technology in dental education: the use of
   laptops in the classroom. Two opposing viewpoints, written by different
   authors, evaluate the arguments. Viewpoint 1 argues that laptops in
   classrooms can be a catalyst for rapid curricular advancement and
   prepare dental graduates for the digital age of dentistry. As dental
   education is not limited to textual information, but includes skill
   development in spatial relationships and hands-on training, technology
   can play a transformative role in students' learning. Carefully
   implemented instructional technology can enhance student motivation when
   it transforms students from being the objects of teaching to the
   subjects of learning. Ubiquitous access to educational material allows
   for just-in-time learning and can overcome organizational barriers when,
   for instance, introducing interprofessional education. Viewpoint 2
   argues that, in spite of widespread agreement that instructional
   technology leads to curricular innovation, the notion of the use of
   laptops in classrooms needs to be deconstructed and rethought when
   effective learning outcomes are sought. Analyzing the purpose, pedagogy,
   and learning product while applying lessons learned from K-12
   implementation leads to a more complex picture of laptop integration in
   dental classrooms and forms the basis for questioning the value of such
   usage. For laptop use to contribute to student learning, rather than
   simply providing opportunity for students to take notes and access the
   Internet during class, this viewpoint emphasizes that dental educators
   need to think carefully about the purpose of this technology and to
   develop appropriate pedagogical strategies to achieve their objectives.
   The two viewpoints agree that significant faculty development efforts
   should precede any introduction of technology into the educational
   process and that technology alone cannot change education. While the
   first viewpoint emphasizes the pivotal role of technology in bringing
   dental education into the contemporary digital world, the second
   viewpoint focuses on challenges surrounding laptop usage in the
   classroom including the alignment of instructional methods with learning
   objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The first commercial array-induction measurement was performed by BPB in
   Alberta, Canada in December 1982. The tool designation was Digital
   Induction Sonde (mnemonic DIS); it was the result of a rapid development
   effort following a decision in late 1979 to commission an integrated
   digital well-logging system whose innovations would be adopted
   universally in the decade that followed. The DIS went on to be the
   workhorse of the company's logging operations in low-conductivity well
   fluids, and the basic elements of the design continue to be built into
   every array-induction tool operated by Weatherford today. This article
   tells the story of why the DIS was developed, the challenges faced by
   the engineering team, how they were overcome, and why it was not called
   an Array Induction until five years after its introduction.}},

Abstract = {{This study of the digital divide within Japan utilizes data from the
   country's 47 prefectures for multivariate and spatial analysis of
   distributions of information and communication technology (ICT)
   variables. The paper constructs an exploratory conceptual model of
   technology utilization and expenditures in Japan, induced from prior
   literature. Ten dependent ICT utilization and expenditure factors are
   posited to be related to 12 independent demographic, economic,
   infrastructure, education, innovation and openness factors. The
   relationship of the independent to dependent factors is moderated by
   analysis of spatial patterns of technology utilization to examine
   proximities and reduce spatial bias. Based on the model, a multivariate
   analysis identifies correlates of the nation's digital divide, including
   patents registered by Japanese citizens, newspaper circulation, students
   and pupils per capita, household expenditures on education, rural/urban
   status, and Japan's aged population structure which has wide
   generational gaps. Spatial clusters and outliers of ICTs in prefectures
   are analyzed, with attention to their policy impacts. Findings suggest
   modifications to the conceptual model. Implications of findings for the
   country's official national technology planning policies are considered
   and recommendations made to expand them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a web-based, medical research network that
   relies on patient self-reporting to collect and analyze data on the
   health status of patients, mostly suffering from severe conditions. The
   network organizes patient participation in ways that break with the
   strong expert culture of medical research. Patient data entry is largely
   unsupervised. It relies on a data architecture that encodes medical
   knowledge and medical categories, yet remains open to capturing details
   of patient life that have as a rule remained outside the purview of
   medical research. The network thus casts the pursuit of medical
   knowledge in a web-based context, marked by the pivotal importance of
   patient experience captured in the form of patient data. The originality
   of the network owes much to the innovative amalgamation of networking
   and computational functionalities built into a potent social media
   platform. The arrangements the network epitomizes could be seen as a
   harbinger of new models of organizing medical knowledge creation and
   medical work in the digital age, and a complement or alternative to
   established models of medical research.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To review the range of promising technologies (e.g., smart
   phones, remote monitoring devices) designed to enhance aging in place;
   identify challenges for implementation of those technologies; and
   recommend ways to improve access to technologies in older populations.
   Method: A narrative review of research, practice, and policies from
   multiple fields, including information science, gerontology,
   engineering, housing and social services, health care and public health.
   Results: Despite a wide range of emerging and current technologies,
   there are significant challenges for implementation, including an uneven
   evidence base, economic barriers, and educational and ergonomic issues
   that adversely affect many older adults. Discussion: Recommendations for
   future development and adoption include improving the evidence base
   through field-testing of packages of devices in diverse populations of
   older adults; development of innovative funding mechanisms involving
   multidisciplinary teams, older adults, and caregivers; and promotion of
   safety and security in the use of these technologies in older
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The following article describes innovative thin-walled freeform metal
   structures, who are parametrically designed, digitally pre-fabricated
   pieces and connected using rivets. While in the past decade the rivet
   has been largely replaced by welding and bolting as a connecting element
   in metal construction, it proves to be beneficial in the context of thin
   steel and aluminum plates, where quick, small, and strong connections
   are made possible, which do not require pre-heating or cause distortions
   as often encountered in welding. They are also generally less visible
   than bolts and can be shot quickly without requiring any further nuts or
   washers.}},

Title = {{Educational Technologies in Problem-Based Learning in Health Sciences
   Education: A Systematic Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{142-154}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: As a modern pedagogical philosophy, problem-based learning
   (PBL) is increasingly being recognized as a major research area in
   student learning and pedagogical innovation in health sciences
   education. A new area of research interest has been the role of emerging
   educational technologies in PBL. Although this field is growing, no
   systematic reviews of studies of the usage and effects of educational
   technologies in PBL in health sciences education have been conducted to
   date.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to review new and emerging
   educational technologies in problem-based curricula, with a specific
   focus on 3 cognate clinical disciplines: medicine, dentistry, and speech
   and hearing sciences. Analysis of the studies reviewed focused on the
   effects of educational technologies in PBL contexts while addressing the
   particular issue of scaffolding of student learning.
   Methods: A comprehensive computerized database search of full-text
   articles published in English from 1996 to 2014 was carried out using 3
   databases: ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Eligibility criteria for
   selection of studies for review were also determined in light of the
   population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) guidelines.
   The population was limited to postsecondary education, specifically in
   dentistry, medicine, and speech and hearing sciences, in which PBL was
   the key educational pedagogy and curriculum design. Three types of
   educational technologies were identified as interventions used to
   support student inquiry: learning software and digital learning objects;
   interactive whiteboards (IWBs) and plasma screens; and learning
   management systems (LMSs).
   Results: Of 470 studies, 28 were selected for analysis. Most studies
   examined the effects of learning software and digital learning objects
   (n = 20) with integration of IWB (n = 5) and LMS (n = 3) for PBL
   receiving relatively less attention. The educational technologies
   examined in these studies were seen as potentially fit for problem-based
   health sciences education. Positive outcomes for student learning
   included providing rich, authentic problems and/ or case contexts for
   learning; supporting student development of medical expertise through
   the accessing and structuring of expert knowledge and skills; making
   disciplinary thinking and strategies explicit; providing a platform to
   elicit articulation, collaboration, and reflection; and reducing
   perceived cognitive load. Limitations included cumbersome scenarios,
   infrastructure requirements, and the need for staff and student support
   in light of the technological demands of new affordances.
   Conclusions: This literature review demonstrates the generally positive
   effect of educational technologies in PBL. Further research into the
   various applications of educational technology in PBL curricula is
   needed to fully realize its potential to enhance problem-based
   approaches in health sciences education.}},

Abstract = {{Taking technological developments in urban mapping and the megacity
   phenomena of rapid change and sprawling space as its starting point,
   this essay provides a history of the present through a genealogy of maps
   of Montpellier in France, a rapidly growing modern city that provides
   examples from the earliest printed maps of the 16th century through to
   the most recent innovations in public-sponsored 3D mapping. By tracing
   the shifting correlations of narrative elements, it places in historical
   perspective the relationship between those concepts, such as verticality
   and horizontality, and perception and representation, which are
   problematized in the contemporary contexts of megacities and digital
   technology.}},

Title = {{A critical comparison between XRD and FIB residual stressmeasurement
   techniques in thin films}},
Journal = {{THIN SOLID FILMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{572}},
Pages = {{224-231}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Residual stress has a significant effect on the performance of thin
   films, in terms of adhesion, hardness, wear and fatigue resistance.
   Thus, when assessing innovative coatings or new deposition technologies,
   it is important to perform residual stress evaluation by means of a
   suitable and reliable technique.
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) is one of the commonly used techniques, because
   it is non-destructive, surface sensitive and phase selective. However,
   it is subject to certain limitations: X-ray diffraction allows stress
   evaluation (i.e. its indirect deduction from the measured diffraction
   profile) only in case of crystalline materials, and the results may be
   subject to aberrations in the presence of texture or stress gradients
   often occurring in thin films. Recently, a new class of methods for
   residual stress evaluation has been proposed, based on incremental
   focused ion beam (fib) milling, combined with high-resolution in situ
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and full field strain
   analysis by digital image correlation (DIC).
   The aim of the present paper is to explore in some detail the
   significance of the stress values obtained for the same coating by X-ray
   diffraction and focused ion beam milling, and to demonstrate that the
   analysis of residual stress depth gradients is possible by using FIB-DIC
   techniques. Finally, a comparative assessment of the weaknesses and
   strengths of the two techniques will be carried out. For this purpose, a
   chromium nitride highly textured thin film sample was chosen. The
   residual stress state evaluation by the two methods was carried out for
   the coating deposited by the cathodic arc evaporation (CAE-PVD)
   technique.
   Although many significant differences were identified between the X-ray
   diffraction and focused ion beam milling methods, careful consideration
   of the gauge volumes and weighting demonstrated that satisfactory
   agreement was obtained. The analysis highlighted the importance of the
   issues related to (a) probe-to-sample interaction volume (gauge volume),
   (b) film texture, and (c) the elastic anisotropy. All these factors must
   be taken into account in order to enable valid comparisons to be drawn.

Abstract = {{A major challenge to digital forensic analysis is the ongoing growth in
   the volume of data seized and presented for analysis. This is a result
   of the continuing development of storage technology, including increased
   storage capacity in consumer devices and cloud storage services, and an
   increase in the number of devices seized per case. Consequently, this
   has led to increasing backlogs of evidence awaiting analysis, often many
   months to years, affecting even the largest digital forensic
   laboratories. Over the preceding years, there has been a variety of
   research undertaken in relation to the volume challenge. Solutions posed
   range from data mining, data reduction, increased processing power,
   distributed processing, artificial intelligence, and other innovative
   methods. This paper surveys the published research and the proposed
   solutions. It is concluded that there remains a need for further
   research with a focus on real world applicability of a method or methods
   to address the digital forensic data volume challenge. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Medical humanities courses are typically taught in face-to-face teaching
   environments, but now medical humanities educators, alongside educators
   from other disciplines, are facing shifts in higher education towards
   online (and sometimes open) courses. For the medical humanities
   educator, there is limited guidance regarding how technology-enhanced
   learning design can support the learning outcomes associated with
   medical humanities. This article aims to provide useful direction for
   such educators on how digital technologies can be used through
   learner-focused pedagogies. Specific examples are provided as to how the
   affordances of Web 2.0 and other tools can be realised in innovative
   ways to help achieve skills development within the medical humanities.
   The guidance, alongside the practical suggestions for implementation,
   can provide important conceptual background for medical humanities
   educators who wish to embrace technology-enhanced learning, and
   reconceptualise or redesign medical humanities for an online or blended
   teaching environment.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, individuals with severe psychiatric illnesses struggle to
   receive evidence-based care. While science has made remarkably slow
   progress in the development and implementation of effective psychiatric
   treatments, we have witnessed enormous progress in the emergence and
   global penetration of personal computing technology. The present paper
   examines how digital resources that are already widespread (e.g.,
   smartphones, laptop computers), can be leveraged to support psychiatric
   care. These instruments and implementation strategies can increase
   patient access to evidenced-based care, help individuals overcome the
   barriers associated with the stigma of mental illness, and facilitate
   new treatment paradigms that harness wireless communication, sensors and
   the Internet, to enhance treatment potency. Innovative digital treatment
   programmes that have been used successfully with a range of conditions
   (i.e., schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline
   personality disorder) are presented in the paper to demonstrate the
   utility and potential impact of technology-based interventions in the
   years ahead.}},

Abstract = {{This article provides insights on how to manage collective innovation in
   the digital economy, an innovation regime which is riddled with complex
   regulatory challenges and increasing litigation over intellectual
   property rights. Private collective organizations face two main
   challenges: (1) to promote collective innovation while preserving the
   private interests of the firms within the collective, and (2) to ensure
   that collective innovation does not weaken healthy competition. Through
   a case study of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), an
   exemplary private collective federation of organizations composed of
   standardization bodies, industry consortia and technology producers, we
   identify organizational solutions to these challenges. We find that a
   combination of specific IP rights instruments is key to manage these
   trade-offs. We also find that the combined policies of essential
   patenting, FRAND, and maximum royalty rate help overcome the specific
   challenges associated with collective innovation within competitive
   contexts. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings for
   managers and for policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   To chronicle a medical professional society's adoption of innovation and
   to describe themes pertinent to the adoption.
   Recent findings
   In September 2013, the American College of Obstetricians and
   Gynecologists (ACOG) published a Committee Opinion on Toxic
   Environmental Agents that included an infographic and social media
   awareness campaign. To date, it claims one of the highest total audience
   reaches for an ACOG Facebook post reaching nearly 18 000 viewers.
   Despite this powerful promise, ACOG's timely and successful social media
   campaign did not always appear an obvious strategy. Although social
   media took hold of popular culture in the early 2000s, social media's
   professional etiquette remained uncharted and rife, with cautionary
   tales through the latter half of the decade.
   Summary
   Through a thoughtful and dedicated process, the ACOG Fellow and Junior
   Fellow leadership partnered to navigate the appropriate balance of
   innovation and prudence that propelled ACOG into social media's golden
   age, and paved the pathway for more progressive institutional changes.}},

Abstract = {{Organisational routines embed and are increasingly embedded within IT
   artefacts. In this paper, I challenge the conventional notion that
   warrants the primacy of human activities in the study of routines and
   bring artefacts in general and IT artefacts in particular to the very
   centre of my theorising. Through an in-depth case study of crown
   prosecutors' work, I endeavour to explain the way legislative and IT
   artefacts are implicated in the transformation of police prosecutor
   routines. I show that legislative artefacts play a constitutive role
   that generates a new role position and a new system of social practices
   while IT artefacts serve a regulative function that enforces a newly
   programmed sequence of steps onto pre-existing practices. I argue for
   the benefits of foregrounding legislative and IT artefacts to develop a
   nuanced account of organisational routines that responds to recent calls
   for research that contextualises the IT artefact outside single
   settings. I draw on the Transformational Model of Social Activity to
   unpack the causal linkages between legislative and IT artefacts.
   Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we show that a small innovation in inspection
   technology can make substantial differences in inspection outcomes. For
   restaurant hygiene inspections, the state of Florida has introduced a
   handheld electronic device, the portable digital assistant (PDA), which
   reminds inspectors of about 1,000 potential violations that may be
   checked for. Using inspection records from July 2003 to June 2009, we
   find that the adoption of PDA led to 11\% more detected violations and
   subsequently, restaurants may have gradually increased their compliance
   efforts. We also find that PDA use is significantly correlated with a
   reduction in restaurant-related foodborne disease outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Analytics of `Big Data' has been so promising that it is thought to be a
   new frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity in science
   and business. Vast amounts of material damage data constitute a unique
   set of ``Big Data{''} which are generated from damage events when
   materials are under applied stress, and their occurrence is strongly
   related to the source physics. Such data forms fundamental ``information
   infrastructure{''} such that the ensemble of these events can be used as
   the basis for evaluating the state of material damage, thereby making
   data-enabled material damage evaluation a new frontier for innovation.
   Presently, data-enabled digital analytics of material damage is in its
   infancy and is much needed to advance our understanding of damage
   physics, which has, for the most part, been overlooked by the classical
   deterministic approaches. In this article, we propose a framework of
   data-enabled science for evaluating material damage that includes the
   introduction of a 3S principle to guide the efforts, and a global damage
   variate D, which is a multivariate data matrix of random damage with its
   rows and columns being observations (spectrum) and scale (time series)
   vectors, respectively, of the real world damage. This multivariate
   damage data matrix facilitates the systematic employment of standard
   methods of multivariate statistics and data mining techniques. The
   proposed framework was implemented by examples taken from typical
   engineering materials using acoustic emission. The examples revealed
   that; (1) damage events are interactive and significantly correlated;
   (2) they form different ensembles in different loading stages
   implicating damage mechanisms, and (3) their phenomenological behavior
   can be modeled numerically. The information entropy of multiscale damage
   matrices revealed a trajectory of damage state that provides a new means
   to quantify real world material damage. We also highlight some promising
   research topics related to other digital analytics that can be used for
   the investigation of material damage.}},

   Unfortunately, there is little empirical evidence to suggest what
   influence these new IT tools have on NPD performance. Through a
   project-level, exploratory, empirical study, the impact of these new IT
   tools on the development phase of the NPD process is investigated. We
   find that the use of these new tools is significantly lower than the
   adoption of traditional IT tools such as e-mail and
   computer-aided-design. Traditional tools have a significant, positive
   impact on NPD outcomes, including team collaboration, the
   concepts/prototypes generated, and management evaluation. Interestingly,
   new media tools such as project wikis and shared collaboration spaces
   also have a significant, positive impact on concepts/prototypes
   generated, and management evaluation. Surprisingly, social networking
   tools like weblogs and Twitter negatively impact management evaluation
   while having no impact on NPD team collaboration and concepts/prototypes
   generated. These results suggest that social networking tools in their
   current guise are not helpful to the NPD team and may in fact be
   distracting to innovation management during the development phase.}},

Abstract = {{Development of a digital material representation (DMR) model of dual
   phase steel is presented within the paper. Subsequent stages involving
   generation of a reliable representation of microstructure morphology,
   assignment of material properties to component phases and incorporation
   of the model into the commercial finite element software are described
   within the paper. Different approaches used to recreate dual phase
   morphology in a digital manner are critically assessed. However,
   particular attention is placed on innovative identification of phase
   properties at the micro scale by using micro-pillar compression tests.
   The developed DMR model is finally applied to model influence of micro
   scale features on failure initiation and propagation under loading
   conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Real-time small signal stability analysis of the power electronic-based

Abstract = {{Power Electronic-based Components (PECs) can provide excellent features
   such as, load regulation, high power factor, and transient performance,
   especially in the large scale distribution systems. Accordingly,
   contemporary power distribution systems or Power Electronic-based
   Distribution Systems (PEDS) are highly penetrated with the Renewable
   Energy Resources (RERs) as well as innovative PECs such as, Solid State
   Transformers (SSTs) and inverters. Therefore, they are prone to exhibit
   negative impedance instability in consequence of high power factor and
   constant-power nature of the individual components in the system. Thus,
   small-signal as well as large-signal stability assessments of the PEDS
   play prominent role in operational (real-time) stage of the systems
   analyses. In this paper new small-signal stability analysis technique is
   developed based on d - q impedance measurement and Nyquist criterion
   that is capable of investigating the systems' small-signal stability in
   real-time. Furthermore, small-signal stability of a sample PEDS
   comprised from a SST connected to the source and variable load is
   investigated through the proposed method and with utilizing Real-Time
   Digital Simulator (RTDS) platform. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing is not a new practice but it is a concept that has gained
   substantial attention during recent disasters. Drawing from previous
   work in the crisis informatics, disaster sociology, and
   computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) literature, this paper first
   explains recent conceptualizations of crowdsourcing and how
   crowdsourcing is a way of leveraging disaster convergence. The CSCW
   concept of ``articulation work{''} is introduced as an interpretive
   frame for extracting the salient dimensions of ``crisis
   crowdsourcing.{''} Then, a series of vignettes are presented to
   illustrate the evolution of crisis crowdsourcing that spontaneously
   emerged after the 2010 Haiti earthquake and evolved to more established
   forms of public engagement during crises. The best practices extracted
   from the vignettes clarified the efforts to formalize crisis
   crowdsourcing through the development of innovative interfaces designed
   to support the articulation work needed to facilitate spontaneous
   volunteer efforts. Extracting these best practices led to the
   development of a conceptual framework that unpacks the key dimensions of
   crisis crowdsourcing. The Crisis Crowdsourcing Framework is a
   systematic, problem-driven approach to determining the why, who, what,
   when, where, and how aspects of a crowdsourcing system. The framework
   also draws attention to the social, technological, organizational, and
   policy (STOP) interfaces that need to be designed to manage the
   articulation work involved with reducing the complexity of coordinating
   across these key dimensions. An example of how to apply the framework to
   design a crowdsourcing system is offered with a discussion on the
   implications for applying this framework as well as the limitations of
   this framework. Innovation is occurring at the social, technological,
   organizational, and policy interfaces enabling crowdsourcing to be
   operationalized and integrated into official products and services.}},

Abstract = {{With innovations in the Internet, it is becoming increasingly relied
   upon. In the last decade, research on peer-to-peer (P2P) technology has
   become even more popular. As more people use P2P systems, the
   scalability and flexibility of the systems must be considered. In this
   study, an arrangement graph is used to form a P2P overlay, the
   Arrangement-Graph Overlay (AGO), to reduce system overhead and bind
   routing hops. The proposed AGO utilizes the properties of the
   arrangement graph, i.e., that each node has a unique ID and IDs between
   adjacent nodes differ by only one digit, to form the overlay network and
   develop a routing algorithm. The routing hops of the proposed AGO system
   can be bound within a certain number because of the diameter of the
   arrangement graph. Experimental results show that the proposed AGO
   system can greatly reduce system overhead and perform routing in a
   constant number of hops, even in a large-scale network environment. The
   experimental results also show that the AGO system consumes less
   bandwidth, which is an important consideration in P2P systems.}},

Abstract = {{Automated control of consumer electricity loads, or active demand (AD)
   management, is a key component of many smart grid futures. Within the
   sociology of expectations, expectations define the future role and
   responsibilities of actors with respect to a new technology and in so
   doing set a trajectory for design and development. This paper explores
   the expectations of the behaviour of end users, envisaged by the
   designers and engineers of an AD project. Three main themes emerge. The
   first theme is that designers situate the new technology in an
   electricity consumption ideal, where households harmonise daily routines
   to service electricity retail markets. In the second theme, AD is
   aligned to new technological landscapes and enhanced through digital
   innovations. These visions are crucial for achieving the third theme,
   namely economically rational consumers. For widespread adoption of AD,
   however, the technology needs to be designed for real, as opposed to
   ideal users.}},

Abstract = {{A new digital predistortion technique based on a direct learning
   architecture is proposed for linearising power amplifiers (PAs) with
   non-linear memory effects. It is based on the non-uniform memory
   polynomial (MP) model and with a quadratically interpolated LUT. There
   are mainly two innovations. First, compared with the conventional MP
   model, the non-uniform MP model achieves the same modelling accuracy
   with less coefficients. Secondly, compared with the linearly
   interpolated LUT, the quadratically interpolated LUT has higher
   accuracy, which is adopted to realise a part of the mathematical
   computations in the predistortion. The proposed solution is validated on
   a real PA ZFL-2500. It reduces the number of the model's coefficients
   and achieves a spectrum regrowth suppression of about 15 dB with a table
   size of only 8.}},

Abstract = {{The sustenance of food and nutritional security are the major challenges
   of the 21st century. The domestic food production needs to increase per
   annum at the rate of 2\% for cereals and 0.6\% for oilseeds and pulses
   to meet the demand by 2030. The Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and the black
   soil regions (BSR) are the two major food production zones of the
   country. Since irrigation potential is limited and expansion of
   irrigated area is tardy, rainfed agriculture holds promise to satisfy
   future food needs. Frontline demonstrations of these two regions have
   shown that there is a large gap at the farmers' and achievable levels of
   yields. This gap can be filled by adopting scientific approach of
   managing the natural resources. There is tremendous pressure of biotic
   and abiotic stresses hindering the crop production and that warrants for
   a systematic appraisal of natural resources. The National Bureau of Soil
   Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS\&LUP) under the Indian Council of
   Agricultural Research (ICAR) divided the country into 60 agro-ecological
   sub-regions (AESRs) in 1994 by superimposing maps on natural resources
   like soils, climate and length of growing period (LGP) for crops and
   other associated parameters. With the passage of nearly two decades and
   the advent of modern facilities of database management and improved
   knowledge base on natural resources, a need was felt to revise the
   existing AESR map to reach near the ground reality of crop performance.
   The new database stored in soil and terrain digital database (SOTER) has
   helped in modifying the AESR delineations of the BSR (76.4 m ha) and the
   IGP (52.01 m ha). The estimated available water content, saturated
   hydraulic conductivity and use of pedo-transfer functions in assessing
   the drainage conditions and soil quality have helped in computing with
   improved precision the LGP, and revise the earlier AESRs in BSR and IGP
   areas. This innovative exercise will be useful for the future AESR-based
   agricultural land use planning.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers the role Paedagogica Historica has played in
   stimulating new approaches in the history of education within the
   international community since the emergence of the new series in 1900.
   Particular focus is placed on the volumes published in the wake of ISCHE
   (International Standing Conference in the History of Education)
   conferences and the special issues, which the editors began to promote
   in 1990 as a way of highlighting innovative scholarship in the field.
   The article considers a total of 55 issues. In addition to a
   presentation of the diversity of topics addressed, the article assesses
   the following: editorial strategies to reach a broader public and
   connect with specialised networks internationally; efforts to achieve
   international ranking for the journal; the ways individual scholars or
   national communities showcase certain approaches or themes in the
   history of education. Finally, the article will consider the limits to
   the journal's efforts to establish trends in our contemporary digital

Abstract = {{Archaeological filmmaking is a relatively under-examined subject in
   academic literature. As the technology for creating, editing, and
   distributing video becomes increasingly available, it is important to
   understand the broader context of archaeological filmmaking; from
   television documentaries to footage shot as an additional method of
   recording to the informal `home videos' in archaeology. The history of
   filmmaking in archaeology follows innovations within archaeological
   practice as well as the availability and affordability of technology.
   While there have been extensive analyses of movies and television shows
   about archaeological subjects, the topic of archaeological film has been
   characterized by reactions to these outside perspectives, rather than
   examinations of footage created by archaeologists. This can be
   understood to fall within several filmic genres, including expository,
   direct testimonial, impressionistic, and phenomenological films, each
   with their own purpose and expressive qualities. Footage taken on site
   can also be perceived as a form of surveillance, and can modify
   behaviour as a form of panopticon. Consequently, there are
   considerations regarding audience, distribution, and methods for
   evaluation, as these films are increasingly available on social media
   platforms. This paper explores the broad context for archaeological
   filmmaking and considers potential futures for the moving image in
   archaeology.}},

Abstract = {{Organizational practices that foster a dialogic relationship between
   organizations and their constituent customers have created an arena for
   inbound and outbound innovation. At the nexus of this development
   occurring in the media industries, these flows are carried by various
   forms of digital, social media and an increasing digital presence in the
   form of dynamic websites with varying degrees of interactive
   capabilities. In this paper, we posit that the newspaper industry is
   torn between indifference and cautious apprehension caused by the
   difficulty in marrying the journalism profession's carefully guarded
   gatekeeping practices with the revolving doors of open innovation.
   Gatekeeping has emerged as a fiercely defended cornerstone for the
   industry and the profession of journalism itself is not enough to
   distinguish amateurs from professionals; for the segregation between
   professionals and amateurs to carry weight rather than being reduced to
   a hollow title, the segregation needs a practice that explicitly
   enforces gatekeeping-where actions speak louder than titles. Against
   this backdrop, we pursue the following research question: Why has
   IT-enabled open innovation become such a contentious issue in the
   context of the newspaper industry? Combining contextual in-situ
   ethnographic interviews and observation with an industry-wide content
   analysis of Swedish newspaper websites, we present an in-depth view of
   what IT-enabled open innovation means in the context of the newspaper
   industry. Results show that the process of legitimization inscribed by a
   particularly charged information technology-the printing press-continues
   to exert great influence in what constitutes open practice in the
   newspaper industry.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication of digital prostheses has acquired growing importance
   not only for the possibility for the patient to overcome psychosocial
   trauma but also to promote grip functionality. An application method of
   three dimensional-computer-aided design technologies for the production
   of passive prostheses is presented by means of a fifth finger amputee
   clinical case following bilateral hand replantation.
   Three-dimensional-computerized tomography was used for the collection of
   anthropometric images of the hands. Computer-aided design techniques
   were used to develop the digital file-based prosthesis from the
   reconstruction images by inversion and superimposing the contra-lateral
   finger images. The rapid prototyping manufacturing method was used for
   the production of a silicone bandage prosthesis prototype. This approach
   replaces the traditional manual method by a virtual method that is basis
   for the optimization of a high speed, accurate and innovative process.}},

Abstract = {{One notable `disruptive' impact of massive open online courses (MOOCs)
   has been an increased public discussion of online education. While much
   debate over the potential and challenges of MOOCs has taken place online
   confined largely to niche communities of practitioners and advocates,
   the rise of corporate `xMOOC' ventures such as Coursera, edX and Udacity
   has prompted popular mass media interest at levels not seen with
   previous educational innovations. This article addresses this important
   societal outcome of the recent emergence of MOOCs as an educational form
   by examining the popular discursive construction of MOOCs over the past
   24 months within mainstream news media sources in United States,
   Australia and the UK. In particular, we provide a critical account of
   what has been an important phase in the history of educational
   technology-detailing a period when popular discussion of MOOCs has far
   outweighed actual use/participation. We argue that a critical analysis
   of MOOC discourse throughout the past two years highlights broader
   societal struggles over education and digital technology-capturing a
   significant moment before these debates subside with the anticipated
   normalization and assimilation of MOOCs into educational practice. This
   analysis also sheds light on the influences underpinning how many people
   perceive MOOCs thereby leading to a better understanding of
   acceptance/adoption and rejection/resistance amongst various
   professional and popular publics.}},

Abstract = {{This themed issue of MIA advances our understanding of how digital media
   are implicated in processes of change. It interrogates how people engage
   digital media in creative practices that lead to interventions in their
   own or others' lives, and explores the intentionalities through which
   they do this, and the processes and experiences such activities involve.
   The intention is to bring to the fore the idea of intervening as a way
   of being active in the world as a scholar, creative practitioner,
   activist or simply someone living their everyday life in ways that seek
   to generate forms of change. The articles in this issue address the use
   of creative interventions for affective and community-constructing ends,
   examining and highlighting the conscious use of the digital to disrupt
   and subvert existing patterns in communication and culture, heralding
   new possibilities while promoting inclusivity and social innovation.}},

Title = {{The field of radical innovation: Making sense of organizational cultures

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1343-1350}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Organic organizational structures and cultures facilitate innovation
   because they allow organizations to shift their understanding of what a
   product, service or technology means. Yet, organic organizations may
   have to instill mechanistic structures and bureaucratic processes if
   they produce successful radical innovations. Thus, the basis of
   innovation can be undermined by its consequences. To explore this issue,
   this paper analyzes data from an ongoing longitudinal case study of a
   SME digital-design agency that developed a radical innovation for the
   market research industry. The paper observes that founders of the
   organization shifted their position to become managers as a result of
   their radical innovation and that other members of the organization
   have, consequently, re-evaluated their attitude toward the organization.
   To conceptualize our findings we turn to the work of Pierre Bourdieu.
   His notion of fields which structure experiences and are, themselves,
   structured by experiences offers a framework to understand the dynamics
   within an organization that occur as a result of a successful radical
   innovation. The contribution of our paper is: theoretically, we relate
   the discussion of innovation to wider social theories of practice and,
   thus, introduce temporal and cultural dynamics into the account of
   radical innovation; methodologically, we provide an example of a
   longitudinal study; and, in managerial terms, we indicate where
   divisions occur within an organization concerning the construction of
   meaning between managers and employees after a radical innovation. (C)

   firm. To redress this shortcoming, this study adopts the perspective of
   the firm to facilitate an understanding of digital marketing and social
   media usage as well as its benefits and inhibitors. The second
   generation of Internet-based applications enhances marketing efforts by
   allowing firms to implement innovative forms of communication and
   co-create content with their customers. Based on a survey of marketing
   managers, this article shows that firms face internal and external
   pressures to adopt a digital presence in social media platforms. Firms'
   digital marketing engagement can be categorized according to perceived
   benefits and digital marketing usage. To improve digital marketing
   engagement, marketers must focus on relationship-based interactions with
   their customers. This article demonstrates how some firms are already
   accomplishing just that. (C) 2014 Kelley School of Business, Indiana

Abstract = {{This paper describes an in-vehicle nonintrusive biopotential measurement
   system for driver health monitoring and fatigue detection. Previous
   research has found that the physiological signals including eye
   features, electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG) and
   their secondary parameters such as heart rate and HR variability are
   good indicators of health state as well as driver fatigue. A
   conventional biopotential measurement system requires the electrodes to
   be in contact with human body. This not only interferes with the driver
   operation, but also is not feasible for long-term monitoring purpose.
   The driver assistance system in this paper can remotely detect the
   biopotential signals with no physical contact with human skin. With
   delicate sensor and electronic design, ECG, EEG, and eye blinking can be
   measured. Experiments were conducted on a high fidelity driving
   simulator to validate the system performance. The system was found to be
   able to detect the ECG/EEG signals through cloth or hair with no contact
   with skin. Eye blinking activities can also be detected at a distance of
   10 cm. Digital signal processing algorithms were developed to decimate
   the signal noise and extract the physiological features. The extracted
   features from the vital signals were further analyzed to assess the
   potential criterion for alertness and drowsiness determination.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents an analysis of Italian fashion retailing showing
   its evolution, its main characteristics, and its contemporary strengths
   and weaknesses.
   Starting from a theoretical foundation of retail design, the article
   depicts the main evolutionary trajectories of the Italian system in its
   articulation of distribution channels and the related innovative
   approach. This is explained with reference both to mono-brand retail
   chains, set up by Italian fashion companies and designer brands, which
   suddenly expanded onto international markets; and to local multi-brand
   retailers and department stores, still present over the territory. The
   final section of the article focuses on recent dramatic changes
   occurring in the retail business thanks to the digital revolution,
   showing specific criticality conditions but also innovative emerging
   cases.
   The evolutionary trajectories traced, peculiar formats presented, and
   contemporary emerging paradigms are enriched by cases analyzed by
   literature review, desk research, and field case study research
   conducted by the author over the last twelve years.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual Labs (VLAB) is a multi-institutional Open Educational Resources
   (OER) initiative, exclusively focused on lab experiments for engineering
   education. This project envisages building a large OER repository,
   containing over 1650 virtual experiments mapped to the engineering
   curriculum. The introduction of VLAB is a paradigm shift in an
   educational system that is slow to change. Treating VLAB OER as an
   educational technology innovation, its adoption by potential-adopter
   engineering students (N = 131) is modeled based on Roger's theory of
   perceived attributes. Regression and factor analysis were used to
   analyze the data. Results indicate that the attributes of Compatibility,
   Ease of Use, Relative Advantage, and Trialability significantly
   influence potential-adopter students' intention to adopt an innovation
   like VLAB. The study also observed that using OER (such as VLAB) on
   desktops and low-cost tablets had similar effects in student performance
   to using physical labs. This has interesting implications for education
   policy-makers who are looking to reduce the digital divide.}},

   Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory, in this paper we advance a conceptual
   model for examining this important topic. The two dimensional matrix and
   the micro-level description of informal learning activities presented
   provide a framework for both further research on technology-mediated
   practices for informal learning, as well as the design of formative
   contexts for learning to occur.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The benefits of online learning come at a price. How can we
   optimize the overall value?
   Aims: Critically appraise the value of online learning.
   Methods: Narrative review.
   Results: Several prevalent myths overinflate the value of online
   learning. These include that online learning is cheap and easy (it is
   usually more expensive), that it is more efficient (efficiency depends
   on the instructional design, not the modality), that it will transform
   education (fundamental learning principles have not changed), and that
   the Net Generation expects it (there is no evidence of pent-up demand).
   However, online learning does add real value by enhancing flexibility,
   control and analytics. Costs may also go down if disruptive innovations
   (e. g. low-cost, low-tech, but instructionally sound ``good enough''
   online learning) supplant technically superior but more expensive online
   learning products. Cost-lowering strategies include focusing on core
   principles of learning rather than technologies, using easy-to-learn
   authoring tools, repurposing content (organizing and sequencing existing
   resources rather than creating new content) and using course templates.
   Conclusions: Online learning represents just one tool in an educator's
   toolbox, as does the MRI for clinicians. We need to use the right
   tool(s) for the right learner at the right dose, time and route.}},

Abstract = {{We are currently witnessing an alarmingly increasing array of attacks on
   secure infrastructures used for industrial and commercial purposes. The
   success of these attacks has relied heavily on an innovative stratagem.
   This stratagem makes use of digital certificates to devise malicious
   code or servers as trustworthy, ultimately deceiving end users. This has
   led to an escalating demand for forged or stolen valid digital
   certificates on the electronic black market. Certification authorities
   (CAs) themselves are now coming under fire. Virus reports have surfaced
   on malicious software whose sole purpose was to grab certificates from
   within certain CAs' infrastructures. The growing popularity of these
   attacks is putting in doubt the effectiveness of one of the pillars upon
   which security in the digital world is built, cryptography and digital
   signatures. What is to blame? In a phrase, Trust by default. To increase
   the usability of public key infrastructure interactions, a number of CAs
   are pre-included in users' browsers and operating systems. These
   entities are trusted by default, and this trust is now being exploited.
   In this paper, we shall try to shed light on the true dimensions and
   implications of trust by default in public key infrastructure
   environments. We attempt to raise awareness about the severity of this
   kind of attacks, demystify the security challenges and identify unique
   security threats. We need to ring the alarm about trust-related issues
   in online communications. We analyze the issue from an information and
   communication security perspective and explore the notion of trust
   relations in this context. We support the doctrine that trust should be
   built on informed judgment, and this can only be achieved through
   increased openness. Following this, we put forward for consideration a
   number of proposals that attempt to overcome the issue at hand, by
   increasing user-side awareness and thus solution effectiveness,
   regarding digital certificate transactions. We present an experimental
   mechanism that is able to provide users with customized digital
   certificate repositories based on an open crowd sourcing method.

Abstract = {{Background: An accurate and reliable measurement of shoulder range of
   motion (ROM) is important in the evaluation of the shoulder. A
   smartphone digital clinometer application is a potentially simpler
   method for measuring shoulder ROM. The goal of this study was to
   establish the reliability and validity of shoulder ROM measurements
   among varying health care providers using a smartphone clinometer
   application in healthy and symptomatic adults.
   Methods: An attending surgeon, fellow, resident, physician assistant,
   and student served as examiners. Bilateral shoulders of 24 healthy
   subjects were included. Fifteen postoperative patients served as the
   symptomatic cohort. Examiners measured ROM of each shoulder, first using
   visual estimation and then using a goniometer and smartphone clinometer
   in a randomized fashion.
   Results: The interobserver reliability among examiners showed
   significant correlation, with average intra-class correlation
   coefficient {[}ICC(2,1)] values of 0.61 (estimation), 0.69 (goniometer),
   and 0.80 (smartphone). All 5 examiners had substantial agreement with
   the gold standard in healthy subjects, with average ICC(2,1) values
   ranging from 0.62 to 0.79. The interobserver reliability in symptomatic
   patients showed significant correlation, with average ICC(2,1) values of
   0.72 (estimation), 0.79 (goniometer), and 0.89 (smartphone). Examiners
   had excellent agreement with the gold standard in symptomatic patients,
   with an average ICC(2,1) value of 0.98.
   Conclusion: The smartphone clinometer has excellent agreement with a
   goniometer-based gold standard for measurement of shoulder ROM in both
   healthy and symptomatic subjects. There is good correlation among
   different skill levels of providers for measurements obtained using the
   smartphone. A smartphone-based clinometer is a good resource for
   shoulder ROM measurement in both healthy subjects and symptomatic
   patients. (C) 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of

Abstract = {{This article presents an image-processing model for detection of rust
   zones using digital images of metals. The input image, containing a wide
   range of possible rusted textures, is simulated with Perlin Noise, which
   allows simulating extreme corrosion conditions, without waiting for

   tests under different noise conditions and texture variations, generated
   with Perlin Noise, are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   the pulse repetition interval (PRI) is continuously varied. This, in
   combination with digital beamforming (DBF) on receive, allows
   high-resolution imaging of a wide continuous swath without the need for
   a long antenna with multiple apertures. However, staggered-SAR systems
   require a mean pulse repetition frequency (PRF) much larger than the
   signal Doppler bandwidth and allow the use of transmitted pulses of
   limited length. This letter proposes a novel processing strategy for
   staggered SAR data, which allows a reduction of the mean PRF and the use
   of longer transmitted pulses. The performance obtained with the proposed
   novel strategy is evaluated and compared with a conventional SAR system
   operating with constant PRI.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption level of digital music is still at its formative stage
   although the adoption renders advantageous to consumers. Therefore, the
   study develops a model to predict on the motivation leading to
   consumer's intention to adopt mobile music services by extending
   Perceived Cost (PC), Perceived Credibility (PCr), Social Influence (SI),
   and Personal Innovativeness (INNO) with Technology Acceptance Model
   (TAM). 160 Respondents were tested using a multi-stage Multiple
   Regression Analysis (MRA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach.
   A non-linear non-compensatory Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) ANN with
   feed-forward back-propagation algorithm and ten cross-validation neural
   networks was deployed in order to capture the motivators of mobile music
   adoption. All predictor variables were found to have relevance to the
   output neuron based on the non-zero synaptic weights connected to the
   hidden neurons. The RMSE values indicated that the ANN models were able
   to predict the motivators with very high accuracy. The ANN models have
   out-performed the MRA models as they are able to capture the non-linear
   relationships between the predictor and criterion variables. While the
   study found that TAM is a significant predictor, the insignificance
   linear relationships of PCr and INNO requires further investigation. The
   music industry can use the findings from this study beneficially to the
   development of mobile music adoption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as
   potential minimally invasive diagnostic biomarkers in oncology.
   Considerable efforts are being made in the development of lab-on-a-chip
   devices for biomedical applications to purify and detect miRNAs from
   biological fluids. Here, we report the development of an innovative
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based parallel device whose internal surface
   can opportunely be functionalized with positively charged
   3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) alone or mixed with two different
   neutral poly(ethylene glycol) silanes (PEG-s). The differently
   functionalized internal surfaces of the PDMS chip were characterized
   with s-SDTB (sulfosuccinimidyl-4-o-(4,4-dimethoxytrityl) butyrate) and
   the portion of the surface able to adsorb a synthetic fluorescently
   labeled miRNA was determined. Interestingly, the adsorbed miRNA (both
   synthetic and cell supernatant-derived) was found mainly on the bottom
   surface of the chip and could be reverse transcribed into cDNA directly
   on the same PDMS chip used for its purification, saving hours with
   respect to the use of standard purification kits. We identified 0.1\%
   APTES/0.9\% PEG-silane as the most efficient PDMS functionalization to
   capture both synthetic and extracellular miRNA. Moreover, the amount of
   captured miRNA was increased by treating the cell supernatant with a
   commercially available lysis buffer for RNA extraction. We assessed that
   the available miRNA binding sites on the functionalized surface were
   efficiently saturated with only one incubation, shortening the time and
   greatly simplifying the protocol for miRNA purification from biological
   samples. Finally, the extracellular miRNA purification efficiency of the
   PDMS functionalized multichip determined via real-time quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was confirmed by droplet digital PCR
   (ddPCR) quantification. This work shows an innovative, rapid and easy to
   use microdevice for the purification and reverse transcription of
   circulating miRNAs, approaching the realization of diagnostic and
   prognostic oncomiR-based assays.}},

Title = {{Tooth whitening with hydrogen peroxide in adolescents: study protocol
   for a randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Technological innovations in dental materials have been
   fueled by the desire of patients to improve the esthetics of their
   teeth. This emphasis on esthetics has led dentists to seek resources
   that respect the standards established by society, but without
   compromising the integrity of the teeth.
   Methods/design: The aim of the proposed controlled clinical trial will
   be to assess colorimetric changes and increased dental sensitivity in
   adolescent patients submitted to tooth whitening with 6\% and 7.5\%
   hydrogen peroxide using home kits with whitening strips. Adolescents
   aged 12 to 20 years will be allocated to different groups based on
   treatment (n = 16 per group): (1) placebo; (2) 6.0\% hydrogen peroxide
   (White Class with Calcium, FGM); (3) 7.5\% hydrogen peroxide (White
   Class with Calcium, FGM); and (4) 7.5\% hydrogen peroxide (Oral B 3D
   White, Oral-B). After the whitening procedures, the participants will be
   evaluated using a visual analog scale for tooth sensitivity and digital
   spectrophotometry to measure changes in color. Descriptive analysis of
   the data will be performed. Either the chi-squared test or Fisher's
   exact test will be used for the determination of associations among the
   categorical variables. Student's t-test and analysis of variance will be
   used to compare mean colorimetric data. Pearson's correlation
   coefficients will be calculated to determine the strength of
   correlations among the continuous variables.
   Discussion: This randomized trial will provide an opportunity to
   evaluate products such as whitening strips in comparison to other
   self-administered methods, especially in adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the feasibility of connecting environmental
   sensors such as light, humidity, or CO2 receptors to a building
   information model (BIM). A base case was created in Rhino; using
   Grasshopper and Firefly, a simple digital model responded to
   lighting-levels detected by a photoresistor on an Arduino board. The
   case study was duplicated using Revit Architecture, a popular BIM
   software, and Dynamo, a visual programming environment, in an innovative
   application. Another case study followed a similar procedure by
   implementing the Revit API directly instead of using Dynamo. Then the
   process was reversed to demonstrate that not only could data could be
   sent from sensors to change the 3D model, but changes to parameters of a
   3D model could effect a physical model through the use of actuators. It
   is intended that these virtual/physical prototypes could be used as the
   basis for testing intelligent facade systems before constructing full
   size mock-ups.}},

Abstract = {{Effective e-government creates an environment for citizens to have
   greater access to their government and, in theory, makes
   citizen-to-government contact more inclusive. Our research examines two
   distinct but related measures of e-government effectiveness, namely the
   online service index and the e-participation index, both reported in the
   2010 e-government survey conducted by the United Nations. We analyze the
   impact of political structure, public sector performance and policy
   initiatives on both indices in more than 150 countries. Our multiple
   regression analysis shows that there is greater e-government capability
   in countries that have more effective public sector governance and
   administration, and policies that advance the development and diffusion
   of information and communication technologies. More democratic
   institutions and processes, however, appear to have a negative impact on
   e-government. In addition, countries that practice effective governance
   and promote competition in the telecommunications sector demonstrate
   more extensive provision of e-participation. These results suggest that
   the path to e-government leverages different strategies depending on a
   nation's political structure, and that authoritarian countries may be
   utilizing e-government to maintain the status quo. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Research on the statutory license for certain types of
   copyright-protected content has revealed an unlikely symbiosis between
   uncertainty and efficiency. Contrary to received wisdom, which tells us
   that in order to increase efficiency, we must increase stability, this
   Article suggests that uncertainty can actually be used to increase
   efficiency in the marketplace. In the music industry, the battle over
   terrestrial performance rights that is, the right of a copyright holder
   to collect royalties for plays of a sound recording on terrestrial radio
   has raged for decades. In June 2012, in a deal that circumvented the
   statutory license for sound recordings for the first time ever,
   broadcasting giant Clear Channel granted an elusive terrestrial
   performance right to a small, independent record label named Big Machine
   and agreed to pay royalties where no such legal obligation exists. This
   result not only improves upon many of the statutory license's
   inefficiencies but is also the opposite of what we would expect given
   both the tumultuous history surrounding the rights at issue and the
   respective parties' bargaining positions. It suggests an underexplored
   mechanism at play: uncertainty. Using the statutory license for sound
   recordings and the Clear Channel Big Machine deal to motivate the
   analysis, this Article argues that bounded uncertainty such as
   uncertainty about the future legal status of terrestrial performance
   rights and uncertainty about future digital business models converts a
   statutory license into a ``penalty default license.{''} Just as penalty
   default rules encourage more efficient information exchange between
   asymmetrical parties, penalty default licenses encourage More efficient
   licensing among otherwise divergent parties by motivating them to
   circumvent an inefficient statutory license in favor of private
   ordering. While not without its drawbacks, which previous work
   identified and ameliorated, private ordering improves upon the statutory
   approach, resulting in greater efficiency not only for the parties
   involved but for society overall. Recognition of the role that
   uncertainty plays in converting an inefficient statutory license into a
   penalty default license that improves market efficiency while mitigating
   inequality has implications beyond the statutory licensing context. It
   suggests a revision in the way we view the relationship between
   uncertainty and efficiency. Specifically, it shows that when coupled
   with a penalty default, uncertainty can bring greater efficiency to the
   marketplace by encouraging private ordering with its tailored terms and
   responsiveness to rapid legal and technological change while mitigating
   concerns about inequality and gamesmanship.}},

Abstract = {{Geckos employ their adhesive system when moving up an incline, but the
   directionality of the system may limit function on downhill surfaces.
   Here, we use a generalist gecko to test whether limb modulation occurs
   on downhill slopes to allow geckos to take advantage of their adhesive
   system. We examined three-dimensional limb kinematics for geckos moving
   up and down a 458 slope. Remarkably, the hind limbs were rotated
   posteriorly on declines, resulting in digit III of the pes facing a more
   posterior direction (opposite to the direction of travel). No
   significant changes in limb orientation were found in any other
   condition. This pes rotation leads to a dramatic shift in foot function
   that facilitates the use of the adhesive system as a brake/stabilizer
   during downhill locomotion and, although this rotation is not unique to
   geckos, it is significant for the deployment of adhesion. Adhesion is
   not just advantageous for uphill locomotion but can be employed to help
   deal with the effects of gravity during downhill locomotion,
   highlighting the incredible multi-functionality of this key innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, at least a dozen Asian jurisdictions have
   adopted significant data privacy (or `data protection') laws. South
   Korea started to implement such laws in relation to its public sector in
   the 1990s, then its private sector from 2001, culminating in the
   comprehensive Personal Information Privacy Act of 2011. Internationally,
   :there have been two stages in the development of data privacy
   principles (the common core of such laws), the first typified by the
   OECD's data protection Guidelines of 1981, and the second typified by
   the European Union data protection Directive of 1995, with a third stage
   currently under development.
   This article analyses the privacy principles in this Korean law,
   focussing on those aspects that are innovative or offer a high level of
   protection in international terms, and demonstrates the extent of
   innovation and strength of the Korean law by comparison with data
   privacy principles in laws of other Asian jurisdictions. The principles
   in the Korean law are clearly the strongest in Asia, although this is
   not yet fully complemented on the enforcement side. A brief comparison
   is also made with proposed European Union and Council of Europe reforms.
   In some respects the Korean principles go beyond those currently found
   in European laws, and indicate that innovation in data privacy
   legislation no longer originates solely in Europe. (C) 2014 Graham

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{139-152}},

Abstract = {{Ceramic re-fitting has traditionally focused on linking sherds to
   vessels using their formal features or decoration. This paper presents
   an innovative procedure designed to test such associations using ceramic
   thin section analysis. An assemblage of the earliest hand-made ceramics
   from central Iberia dated to the second half of the 6th millennium BC
   was used as a test case. First, the whole ceramic assemblage was
   subjected to macroscopic morphological sorting, taphonomic evaluation
   and a re-fitting operation. These tasks led to the recognition of both
   secure physical joins and probable matches. 16 sherds, representing 8
   pairs, were selected from among those probable matches. These samples
   were investigated by thin section petrography and the photomicrographs
   processed using digital image analyses to produce qualitative
   mineralogical and quantitative textural data for assessing the
   likelihood of each pair belonging to the same vessel. The results show
   the potential of this strategy for matching sherds to vessels, as well
   as its reliability and wide applicability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this report I propose to examine the concept of the smart city' from
   the standpoint of spatial enablement. I analyse emerging research on
   smart cities, particularly those addressing the potential role of
   GISciences in the development and implementation of the concept of smart
   cities. I develop the idea that the intelligence of a city should be
   measured by its ability to produce favourable conditions to get urban
   operators (citizens, organizations, private companies, etc.) actively
   involved into sociospatial innovation dynamics. To obtain such a
   commitment, I believe that operators should be able to develop and
   mobilize (digital) spatial skills so that they could efficiently manage
   their spatiality. In other words, I argue that a smart city is first of
   all a spatially enabled city.}},

Abstract = {{Service-oriented architecture (SOA), workflow, the Semantic Web, and
   Grid computing are key enabling information technologies in the
   development of increasingly sophisticated e-Science infrastructures and
   application platforms. While the emergence of Cloud computing as a new
   computing paradigm has provided new directions and opportunities for
   e-Science infrastructure development, it also presents some challenges.
   Scientific research is increasingly finding that it is difficult to
   handle ``big data{''} using traditional data processing techniques. Such
   challenges demonstrate the need for a comprehensive analysis on using
   the above-mentioned informatics techniques to develop appropriate
   e-Science infrastructure and platforms in the context of Cloud
   computing. This survey paper describes recent research advances in
   applying informatics techniques to facilitate scientific research
   particularly from the Cloud computing perspective. Our particular
   contributions include identifying associated research challenges and
   opportunities, presenting lessons learned, and describing our future
   vision for applying Cloud computing to e-Science. We believe our
   research findings can help indicate the future trend of e-Science, and
   can inform funding and research directions in how to more appropriately
   employ computing technologies in scientific research. We point out the
   open research issues hoping to spark new development and innovation in
   the e-Science field.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative cement-based repair materials may require different
   procedures for application in comparison to standard repair
   requirements. Before their field application, a proper protocol should
   be established. Apart from laboratory experiments, numerical simulation
   can be of great use. Herein, a lattice type model is used to simulate
   fracture performance of fiber reinforced repair material - strain
   hardening cementations composite (SHCC) and its performance in the
   repair system. Repair material was first tailored through numerical
   testing in a single fiber pullout test and a direct tension test.
   Further on, structural behavior of the repair system and impact of
   initial defects in the mortar substrate (reflective cracking) was
   examined. The influence of fiber addition, different simulated substrate
   roughness and interface properties between new and old material on the
   performance of the repair system is investigated. Fracture propagation
   and sequence of crack development obtained by simulation is compared to
   experimental results. The numerical study gives insight into the
   benefits of distributed microcracking and high ductility of the fiber
   reinforced system over localized cracking and inherent brittleness of a
   nonreinforced repair system. It is envisioned that this approach can be
   used to tailor the properties of the repair system for specific
   applications, resulting in more reliable and durable concrete repairs in
   the future. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A lightweight bridge inspection system using a dual-cable suspension
   mechanism}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{52-63}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Visual inspection is the primary means of evaluation of the structural
   conditions of a bridge. Since visual inspection often requires engineers
   to place themselves in hazardous environments, many researchers have
   developed inspection vehicles and robot arms in order to increase safety
   and accessibility during inspections. However, the use of such heavy
   equipment may only be suitable for large bridges due to restrictions in
   working space. Therefore, this research aims to develop an innovative
   bridge inspection system that is portable, simple, affordable, and can
   be easily applied on smaller yet large number bridges. We developed a
   systematic approach, which includes a lightweight inspection system
   using a dual-cable suspension mechanism, as well as strategies to
   conduct inspections. The inspection system is composed of three
   components: the controller, the dual-cable suspension, and the
   inspection platform. By using a dual-cable suspension mechanism, the
   bridge inspector can manipulate the controller to place the inspection
   platform beneath the bridge and capture images with digital vision
   devices. Unlike robot arms or heavy vehicles, the cable-based system has
   the capacity to sustain much more than its own weight. This means that
   the total weight is greatly reduced and the cost is much lower than in
   existing methods. Additionally, the inspection strategies developed in
   this research can provide complete, efficient and flexible inspection
   procedures. Vertical and horizontal inspection strategies have been
   developed to allow sequential inspection for normal structures and
   multi-view inspection for special structures by manipulation of the
   inspection system. A prototype of the inspection system has been
   constructed and two field experiments were conducted to test the
   feasibility of the proposed method. The experimental results proved that
   the proposed system was able to work efficiently on a narrow bridge
   without affecting the traffic. The inspection system can also provide
   centimeter-level resolution inspection images, allowing general defects
   such as cracks and spalling concrete to be seen clearly. With further
   research, the proposed system and concept is expected to enhance overall
   bridge inspection efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Game-Based Community Cognitive Health Intervention for Minority and
   Lower Socioeconomic Status Older Adults: A Feasibility Pilot Study}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the
   feasibility of implementing a noncomputerized, game-based, community
   cognitive health intervention with minority and/or lower socioeconomic
   status (SES) older adults in order to improve cognitive performance and
   quality of life.
   Materials and Methods: Through partnerships with community
   organizations, we implemented an innovative pilot 10-week cognitive
   training intervention. Noncomputerized games were used to combine social
   interaction and cognitive training that challenged attentional and
   memory function for 1 hour each week over the span of 10 weeks. One game
   used in the intervention program was created by adapting a working
   memory training task into a fun and competitive card game; the other two
   games were commercially available.
   Results: The intervention and pre/post assessments were able to be
   delivered in a community setting. Overall retention was satisfactory,
   but it dropped in later weeks of the intervention. Older adult
   participants reported enjoying the games and being invested in their
   performance. They also reported playing the games with family and
   friends at home. Older adult participants complied with game rules but
   were reluctant to comply with instructions to rotate game partners and
   game types. They preferred their first partners, and they preferred the
   card game over the existing commercial games.
   Conclusions: This intervention has the potential to improve quality of
   life and reduce disparities in cognitive health in older adults because
   it is an accessible game-based intervention program that motivates older
   adult participants to engage cognitively and to continue this engagement
   beyond the formal training sessions. However, in order to carry this out
   on a larger scale, particular attention must be paid to recruitment,
   retention, and training procedures. This article discusses the critical
   need for cognitive training interventions in minority and lower SES
   older adults, the intended benefits, and the best approaches to
   conducting this type of intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Discourses of public sector reform in the UK have been shaped in recent
   years by the participation of new kinds of hybrid cross-sector
   intermediaries such as think tanks, social enterprises and other third
   sector organisations. This article provides a documentary analysis of
   Demos, the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts and
   the Innovation Unit as intermediary organisations in public sector
   reform, exploring their promotion of modes of digital governance and
   their mobilisation of new software technologies as models for new kinds
   of governing practices. These intermediary organisations are generating
   a model of knowing public services that operates through collecting and
   analysing big data, consisting of personal information and behavioural
   data on individual service users, in order to co-produce personalised
   services. Their objective is a new style of political governance based
   on human-computer interaction and machine learning techniques in which
   citizens are to be governed as co-producers of personalised services
   interacting with the algorithms of database software.}},

Abstract = {{Although genetic algorithms (GAs) have proved their ability to provide
   answers to the limitations of more conventional methods, they are
   comparatively inefficient in terms of the time needed to reach a
   repeatable solution of desired quality. An inappropriate selection of
   driving parameters is frequently blamed by practitioners. The use of
   hybrid schemes is interesting but often limited as they are
   computationally expensive and versatile. This paper presents a novel
   hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) for the design of digital filters. HGA
   combines a pure genetic process and a dedicated local approach in an
   innovative and efficient way. The pure genetic process embeds several
   mechanisms that interact to make the GA self-adaptive in the management
   of the balance between diversity and elitism during the genetic life.
   The local approach concerns convergence of the algorithm and is highly
   optimized so as to be tractable. Only some promising reference
   chromosomes are submitted to the local procedure through a specific
   selection process. They are more likely to converge towards different
   local optima. This selective procedure is fully automatic and avoids
   excessive computational time costs as only a few chromosomes are
   concerned. The hybridization and the mechanisms involved afford the GA
   great flexibility. It therefore avoids laborious manual tuning and
   improves the usability of GAs for the specific area of FIR filter
   design. Experiments performed with various types of filters highlight
   the recurrent contribution of hybridization in improving performance.
   The experiments also reveal the advantages of our proposal compared to
   more conventional filter design approaches and some reference GAs in
   this field of application. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the advancement of computing and optical technologies, it is now
   possible to capture digital holograms of real-life object scenes.
   Theoretically, through the analysis of a hologram, the three-dimensional
   (3D) objects coded on the hologram can be identified. However, being
   different from an optical image, a hologram is composed of complicated
   fringes that cannot be analyzed easily with traditional computer vision
   methods. Over the years, numerous important research investigations have
   been attempted to provide viable solutions to this problem. The aim of
   this work is three-fold. First, we provide a quick walkthrough on the
   overall development of holographic-based 3D object recognition (H3DOR)
   in the past five decades, from film-based approaches to digital-based
   innovation. Second, we describe in more detail a number of selected
   H3DOR methods that are introduced at different timelines, starting from
   the late sixties and then from the seventies, where viable digital
   holographic-based 3D recognition methods began to emerge. Finally, we
   present our work on digital holographic, pose-invariant 3D object
   recognition that is based on a recently introduced virtual diffraction
   plane framework. As our method has not been reported elsewhere, we have
   included some experimental results to demonstrate the feasibility of the
   approach. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Polymermaterials have been considered as promising candidates for the
   implementation of memristor devices due to their low-cost, easy solution
   processability, mechanical flexibility and ductibility, tunable
   electronic performance through innovative molecular design cum synthesis
   strategy and compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor
   (CMOS) technology as well. The digital-type polymer memristor behaves as
   resistive random access memory with non-volatility, high density, more
   speed, low power consumption, large ON/OFF ratio, high endurance and
   long retention, and is recognized as an appealing candidate for the next
   generation ``universal memory{''}. As a logic component, the analog-type
   memristor, with the ability to emulate the fundamental synaptic
   functions of short-term/long-term plasticity (STP/LTP), spike-timing
   dependent-plasticity (STDP), spike-rate dependent plasticity (SRDP) and
   ``learningexperience{''} behaviors, can be used to construct artificial
   neural networks for neuromorphic computation. In this review, we shall
   attempt to summarize the recent progress in research on the materials,
   switching characteristics and mechanism aspects of two terminal polymer
   memristors, for both information storage and neuromorphic applications
   that inspire great interest in the industrial and academic communities.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this research is to understand the technological trajectory
   of the case study of Shale gas production. As a unit of analysis and
   measurement, we used the international classification of patents for
   inventions related to the topic retrieved from three different
   international databases. First the study analyzes consolidated
   technologies considered as granted patents, then the ongoing innovations
   identified as patent applications, and last the technologies introduced
   to the international market granted through the Patent Cooperation
   Treaty. According to the methodology, the frequency and relational
   indicators were applied to the unit under study. The results obtained
   describe the technological behavior of the domain. This technique
   allowed identifying the subject areas involved in the geophysical
   processes of oil and Shale-gas production related to the use of digital
   computing systems through the study of patent classifications.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Humanities (DH) has come a long way towards establishing itself
   as a dynamic and innovative field of study. However, it has been pointed
   out that the DH community predominantly comprises scholars from a
   handful of mainly English-speaking countries, and a current challenge is
   achieving a broader internationalization of the DH community. This
   article provides an overview of the landscape in terms of geo-linguistic
   diversity, as well as reviewing current DH initiatives to broaden
   regional and linguistic diversity and identifies some of the main
   challenges ahead. The aim of this article is to serve as a benchmark of
   the current situation and suggest areas where further research is
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating data from different sources represents a tremendous research
   opportunity across the humanities, social, and natural sciences.
   However, repurposing data for uses not imagined or anticipated by their
   creators involves conceptual, methodological, and theoretical
   challenges. These are acute in archaeology, a discipline that straddles
   the humanities and sciences. Heritage protection laws shape
   archaeological practice and generate large bodies of data, largely
   untapped for research or other purposes. The Digital Index of North
   American Archaeology (DINAA) project adapts heritage management data
   sets for broader open and public uses. DINAA's initial goal is to
   integrate government-curated public data from off-line and online
   digital repositories, from up to twenty US states, and which
   qualitatively and quantitatively describe over 500,000 archaeological
   sites in eastern North America. DINAA hopes to promote extension and
   reuse by government personnel, as well as by domestic and international
   researchers interested in the cultures, histories, artifacts, and
   behaviors described within these public data sets. DINAA innovatively
   applies methodologies and workflows typical of many `open science' and
   digital humanities programs to these data sets. The distributed nature
   of data production, coupled with protections for sensitive data, add
   layers of complexity. Ethically negotiating these issues can wider the
   collaboration between stakeholder communities, and offer an
   unprecedented new view on human use of the North American landscape
   across vast regions and time scales.}},

Abstract = {{New Hollywood, from the late 1960s to early 1980s, was marked by an
   innovation in film business (production, marketing, audience) together
   with an opening up of film form. Today, some 50 years later, film
   culture is again in flux with new models of funding, production and
   distribution for the digital age. The impact of these developments on
   screenwriting is (necessarily) speculative at this stage. The focus of
   this article is on screenwriter/director Paul Schrader, a jump-cut from
   Taxi Driver (1976) to The Canyons (2013) - his experiment in
   `post-theatrical cinema' with novelist/screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis.
   The film was written for microbudget and crowdfunded on the Kickstarter
   platform. It assembles the notorious cast of porn star James Deen and
   celebrity maelstrom Lindsay Lohan. The Canyons rolled out with an
   aggressive online marketing strategy and innovative `day and date'
   distribution model with an eye to video on demand. Larry Gross has
   described the film as belonging to `this cultural moment'. In this
   analysis of The Canyons I ask: What does it mean to conceive, and write,
   a screenplay for the present, for `now'? How does screenplay development
   and creative collaboration differ in a crowdfunded/microbudget
   environment? How does the film interact with new forms, and aesthetics,
   appropriate to this `cultural moment'? In the final part of the article
   I attempt to situate the film within a wider narrative framework via
   Schrader's diagnosis of `narrative exhaustion', Douglas Rushkoff's
   theory of `present shock' and Ellis' rumination on the American
   `post-empire' condition.}},

Abstract = {{In an age where digital images are omnipresent, the use of participant
   photography in qualitative research has become accessible and
   commonplace. Yet, scant attention is paid to the social justice impact
   of photovoice amongst studies that have used this innovative method as a
   way to promote social justice. There is a need to review this method to
   understand its contributions and possibilities. This literature review
   of photovoice research studies (i) explores whether authors implicitly
   or explicitly related the methodologies to their aims of promoting
   social justice (methodology-method fit) and (ii) outlines the social
   justice research impact of photovoice findings using the framework of
   social justice awareness, amelioration and transformation. PubMed,
   Scopus, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were searched from the
   years 2008-13 using the following keywords: photovoice; photonovella;
   photovoice and social justice; and photovoice and participatory action
   research. Of the 30 research studies reviewed, only thirteen identified
   an underlying methodology guiding the photovoice method. The social
   justice impacts emphasized were more related to social justice awareness
   (n = 30) than amelioration (n = 11) or transformation (n = 3). Future
   researchers using photovoice as a way to promote social justice are
   encouraged to assess and plan for the social justice impact desired.}},

Abstract = {{Technology competition between wireless communication technologies can
   lead to new, more or less disruptive services. A potentially disruptive
   technology would be to have unlicensed transmission in the lower UHF
   bands at power levels up to, e.g. 2 W EIRP. This would give citizens a
   share of the best spectrum for free use. Tools against congestion could
   be based on mandatory stochastic channel back-off or, if multiple users
   are present, on adaptive power and bandwidth control. Compared to the
   FCC TV white space regulation, no back link would be needed as the
   spectrum would be used exclusively by wireless devices. In an
   environment of shrinking interest in terrestrial TV broadcasting, such a
   regulation is expected to create a new market for high-range consumer
   devices, competing with licensed communication, while also being
   suitable for offloading traffic from licensed operations. Furthermore,
   the approach will allow for efficient digitization of equipment for
   Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE), but could also be made
   compatible with novel disaster relief services. To enable accurate
   interference prediction, it is proposed that, instead of only providing
   transmitter regulation, receivers should also be regulated, such as be
   required to adhere to a certain minimum selectivity. The proposal should
   be taken up in the WRC process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The ongoing digitization of multiple industries has drastically reduced
   the half-life of skills and capabilities acquired by knowledge workers
   through formal education. Thus, firms are forced to make significant
   ongoing investments in training their employees to remain competitive.
   Existing research has not examined the role of training in improving
   firm-level productivity of knowledge firms. This paper provides an
   innovative econometric framework to estimate returns to such employee
   training investments made by firms. We use a panel dataset of small-to
   medium-sized Indian IT services firms and assess how training enhances
   human capital, a critical input for such firms, thereby improving firm
   revenues. We use econometric approaches based on optimization of the
   firm's profit function to eliminate the endogenous choice of inputs
   common in production function estimations. We find that an increase in
   training investments is significantly linked to an increase in revenue
   per employee. Further, marginal returns to training are increasing firm
   size. Therefore, relatively speaking, large firms benefit more from
   training. For the median company in our data, we find that a dollar
   invested in training yields a return of \$4.67, and this effect
   approximately grows 2.5 times for the 75th percentile-sized firm. A
   variety of robustness checks, including the use of data envelopment
   analysis, are used to establish the veracity of our results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a sociomaterial perspective on digital coordination.
   It extends Pickering's mangle of practice by using a trichordal approach
   to temporal emergence. We provide new understanding as to how the
   nonhuman and human agencies involved in coordination are embedded in the
   past, present, and future. We draw on an in-depth field study conducted
   between 2006 and 2010 of the development, introduction, and use of a
   computing grid infrastructure by the CERN particle physics community.
   Three coordination tensions are identified at different temporal
   dimensions, namelyobtaining adequate transparency in the present,
   modeling a future infrastructure, and the historical disciplining of
   social and material inertias. We propose and develop the concept of
   digital coordination, and contribute a trichordal temporal approach to
   understanding the development and use of digital infrastructure as being
   orientated to the past and future while emerging in the present.}},

Abstract = {{Food composition databases (FCDBs) form an integral part of nutrition
   and health research, patient treatment, manufacturing processes, and
   consumer information. FCDBs have traditionally been compiled at a
   national level; therefore, until recently, there was limited
   standardization of procedures across different data sets. Digital
   technologies now allow FCDB users to access a variety of information
   from different sources, which has emphasized the need for greater
   harmonization. The European Food Information Resource (EuroFIR) Network
   of Excellence and Nexus projects (2005-2013) has been instrumental in
   addressing differences in FCDBs and in producing standardized protocols
   and quality schemes to compile and manage them. A formal, recognized
   European standard for food composition data has been prepared, which
   will further assist in the production of comparable data. Quality
   schemes need to address both the composition data, plus the methods of
   sampling, analysis, and calculation, and the documentation of processes.
   The EuroFIR data exchange platform provides a wealth of resources for
   composition compilers and end users and continues to develop new and
   innovative tools and methodologies. EuroFIR also is working in
   collaboration with the European Food Safety Authority, and as a partner
   in several European projects. Through such collaborations, EuroFIR will
   continue to develop FCDB harmonization and to use new technologies to
   ensure sustainable future initiatives in the food composition activities
   that underpin food and health research in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{The ATLAS experiment is designed to study the proton-proton collisions
   produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Liquid Argon
   sampling calorimeters are used for all electromagnetic calorimetry
   covering the pseudorapidity region up to 3.2, as well as for hadronic
   calorimetry in the range 1.4-4.9. The electromagnetic calorimeters use
   lead as passive material and are characterized by an accordion geometry
   that allows a fast and uniform azimuthal response. Copper and tungsten
   were chosen as passive material for the hadronic calorimetry; whereas a
   parallel plate geometry was adopted at large polar angles, an innovative
   one based on cylindrical electrodes with thin argon gaps was designed
   for the coverage at low angles, where the particles flow is higher. All
   detectors are housed in three cryostats kept at 88.5 K. After
   installation in 2004-2006, the calorimeters were extensively
   commissioned over the three years period prior to first collisions in
   2009, using cosmic rays and single LHC beams. Since then, around 27
   fb(-1) of data have been collected at a unprecedented center of mass
   energies between 7 TeV and 8 TeV. During all these stages, the
   calorimeter and its electronics have been operating with performances
   very close to the specification ones. After 2019, the instantaneous
   luminosity will reach 2-3 x 10(34) cm(-2)s(-1), well above the
   luminosity for which the calorimeter was designed. In order to preserve
   its triggering capabilities, the detector will be upgraded with a new
   fully digital trigger system with a refined granularity. In 2023, the
   instantaneous luminosity will ultimately reach 5-7 x 10(34) cm(-2)s(-1),
   requiring a complete replacement of the readout electronics. Moreover,
   with an increased particle flux, several phenomena (liquid argon
   boiling, space charge effects ...) will affect the performance of the
   forward calorimeter (FCal). A replacement with a new FCal with smaller
   LAr gaps or a new calorimeter module are considered. The performance of
   these new calorimeters is being studied in highest intensity particle
   beams. This contribution covers all aspects of the first three years of
   operation. The excellent performance achieved is especially detailed in
   the context of the discovery of the Higgs boson announced in July 2012.
   The future plans to preserve this performance until the end of the LHC
   program are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Development of homogenous metal matrix nanocomposites with uniform
   distribution of nanoreinforcement, preserved matrix nanostructure
   features, and improved properties, was possible by means of innovative
   processing techniques. In this work, Al-SiC nanocomposites were
   synthesized by mechanical milling and consolidated through spark plasma
   sintering. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) with
   Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) facility was used for the
   characterization of the extent of SiC particles' distribution in the
   mechanically milled powders and spark plasma sintered samples. The
   change of the matrix crystallite size and lattice strain during milling
   and sintering was followed through X-ray diffraction (XRD). The density
   and hardness of the developed materials were evaluated as function of
   SiC content at fixed sintering conditions using a densimeter and a
   digital microhardness tester, respectively. It was found that milling
   for 24 h led to uniform distribution of SiC nanoreinforcement, reduced
   particle size and crystallite size of the aluminum matrix, and increased
   lattice strain. The presence and amount of SiC reinforcement enhanced
   the milling effect. The uniform distribution of SiC achieved by
   mechanical milling was maintained in sintered samples. Sintering led to
   the increase in the crystallite size of the aluminum matrix; however, it
   remained less than 100 nm in the composite containing 10 wt.\% SiC.
   Density and hardness of sintered nanocomposites were reported and
   compared with those published in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The deployment of the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) paradigm requires
   designing and integrating user-centered smart environments to assist
   people in their daily life activities. This research paper details an
   integration and validation of multiple heterogeneous sensors with hybrid
   reasoners that support decision making in order to monitor personal and
   environmental data at a smart home in a private way. The results
   innovate on knowledge-based platforms, distributed sensors, connected
   objects, accessibility and authentication methods to promote independent
   living for elderly people. TALISMAN+, the AmI framework deployed,
   integrates four subsystems in the smart home: (i) a mobile biomedical
   telemonitoring platform to provide elderly patients with continuous
   disease management; (ii) an integration middleware that allows context
   capture from heterogeneous sensors to program environment's reaction;
   (iii) a vision system for intelligent monitoring of daily activities in
   the home; and (iv) an ontologies-based integrated reasoning platform to
   trigger local actions and manage private information in the smart home.
   The framework was integrated in two real running environments, the UPM
   Accessible Digital Home and MetalTIC house, and successfully validated
   by five experts in home care, elderly people and personal autonomy.}},

Title = {{Wavelength-encoded tomography based on optical temporal Fourier
   transform}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{We propose and demonstrate a technique called wavelength-encoded
   tomography (WET) for non-invasive optical cross-sectional imaging,
   particularly beneficial in biological system. The WET utilizes time-lens
   to perform the optical Fourier transform, and the time-to-wavelength
   conversion generates a wavelength-encoded image of optical scattering
   from internal microstructures, analogous to the interferometery-based
   imaging such as optical coherence tomography. Optical Fourier transform,
   in principle, comes with twice as good axial resolution over the
   electrical Fourier transform, and will greatly simplify the digital
   signal processing after the data acquisition. As a proof-of-principle
   demonstration, a 150 -mu m (ideally 36 mu m) resolution is achieved
   based on a 7.5-nm bandwidth swept-pump, using a conventional optical
   spectrum analyzer. This approach can potentially achieve up to 100-MHz
   or even higher frame rate with some proven ultrafast spectrum analyzer.
   We believe that this technique is innovative towards the next-generation
   ultrafast optical tomographic imaging application. (C) 2014 AIP

   qualitative approach was used to analyze the data. A total of 32
   traditional-aged sophomore students at a teacher training program from a
   north-western Turkish university participated in the study. It was found
   that the students' performance expectancies, effort expectancies and
   attitudes toward the use of tablet PCs in education were not high.
   However, though the students had unpleasant experiences with tablet PCs
   in the instruction they were not pessimistic about using tablet PCs
   outside of the classroom.}},

Abstract = {{This study empirically examines the correlation between the quality of
   e-government and trust in government. It used survey data collected in
   2013 from the metropolitan areas of Seoul. An index was developed to
   measure the quality of e-government services, and the Gov 3.0 values
   were reflected in the analysis, including openness, sharing,
   communication, and collaboration. The results show a partial correlation
   between the quality of e-government service and trust in government. In
   addition, the level of trust varied according to the different type of
   the digital divide groups. It suggests that as ICT (Information
   Communication Technology) has become more sophisticated, a willingness
   to share information among organizations and stakeholders may become a
   major factor to thoseactively seeking information and resources to make
   value-added products. It also suggests that more integrated data
   management including network securityand an open attitude toward
   information sharing will be more important beyond the level of technical
   issues.}},

Abstract = {{An overview of recent advances in biosensors and bioactuators based on
   biocomputing systems is presented. Biosensors digitally process multiple
   biochemical signals through Boolean logic networks of coupled
   biomolecular reactions and produce an output in the form of a YES/NO
   response. Compared to traditional single-analyte sensing devices, the
   biocomputing approach enables high-fidelity multianalyte biosensing,
   which is particularly beneficial for biomedical applications.
   Multisignal digital biosensors thus promise advances in rapid diagnosis
   and treatment of diseases by processing complex patterns of
   physiological biomarkers. Specifically, they can provide timely
   detection and alert medical personnel of medical emergencies together
   with immediate therapeutic intervention. Application of the biocomputing
   concept has been successfully demonstrated for systems performing logic
   analysis of biomarkers corresponding to different injuries, particularly
   as exemplified for liver injury. Wide-ranging applications of
   multianalyte digital biosensors in medicine, environmental monitoring,
   and homeland security are anticipated. ``Smart{''} bioactuators, for
   signal-triggered drug release, for example, were designed by interfacing
   switchable electrodes with biocomputing systems. Integration of
   biosensing and bioactuating systems with biomolecular information
   processing systems advances the potential for further scientific
   innovations and various practical applications. (C) 2014 Society of

Abstract = {{The slow-down in traditional silicon complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scaling (Moore's law) has created an
   opportunity for a disruptive innovation to bring the semiconductor
   industry into a postsilicon era. Due to their ultrathin body and
   ballistic transport carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have the intrinsic transport
   and scaling properties to usher in this new era. The remaining
   challenges are largely materials-related and include obtaining purity
   levels suitable for logic technology, placement of CNTs at very tight
   (similar to 5 nm) pitch to allow for density scaling and source/drain
   contact scaling. This review examines the potential performance
   advantages of a CNT-based computing technology, outlines the remaining
   challenges, and describes the recent progress on these fronts. Although
   overcoming these issues will be challenging and will require a large,
   sustained effort from both industry and academia, the recent progress in
   the field is a cause for optimism that these materials can have an
   impact on future technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews large-scale digital developments in the National
   Health Service in England in recent years and argues that there is a
   mismatch between digital and organisational thinking and practice. The
   arguments are based on new institutional thinking, where the digital
   infrastructure is taken to be an institution, which has been shaped over
   a long period, and which in turn shapes the behaviour of health
   professionals, managers and others. Many digital services are still
   being designed in line with a bureaucratic data processing model. Yet
   health services are increasingly based on a network model, where health
   professionals and service managers require information systems that
   allow them to manage risks proactively and to coordinate multiple
   services on behalf of patients. This article further argues that the
   data processing model is being reinforced by Open Data policies and by
   related developments in the acquisition of genomic and telehealth data,
   suggesting that the mismatch will persist. There is, therefore, an
   ongoing tension between frontline and central objectives for digital
   services. It may be that the tension can only be resolved when - or if -
   there is trust between the interested parties.}},

Abstract = {{Ergonomics analysis helps to improve workers' safety and the working
   environment, as well as aiding in the design of tools and equipment for
   effective production. It plays an important role in time and cost
   savings, and moreover it improves the quality in product development and
   production. Furthermore, ergonomics analysis is part of an
   epidemiological study or safety engineering for the prevention of
   industrial or musculoskeletal disease. In order to conduct modeling and
   simulation for ergonomic analysis, creating digital environments and
   digital human models is essential. However, to create a digital
   environment, a massive and time-consuming workload is needed for
   gathering information or the computer-aided design data of equipment,
   tools, products, and so on, and the location or direction as to where
   these objects are positioned. Also, when creating a digital human model,
   it requires expert knowledge, effort and massive time for creating
   digital humans, postures, detailed moving paths, and time consumed for
   each posture, which also leads to a massive workload. In this article,
   an innovative framework, which proposes Product, Process, Plant, and
   Resource management through the product lifecycle management system for
   the automation of creating a digital environment, as well as the
   application of in-line motion capturing technology for automated
   creations of digital human model are designed; furthermore, the base
   system for the proposed framework is developed and presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a research project aimed at delivering innovation
   in a combined sphere of digital fabrication and glass investment
   casting.
   The project has established an entirely new method for creating glass
   casting moulds directly from three-dimensional computer files without
   the need for a physical mould pattern, by using a moulding approach
   based on Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) technology.
   While the paper includes a narrative of the development of the moulding
   process, the central argument of the paper is rooted in the project's
   research/innovation methodology. This argument concerns our profile as
   creative practitioners and the impact this position has on the research/
   innovation scenario. Also central in this argument is the use of
   `emergent methodologies' and `reflective practice'. A new type of rich
   media enabled research journal to aid the use of these methodologies was
   developed as a part of this project and is also presented in this paper.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Using the American recording industry as a case study, this article
   analyzes innovation and diversity concurrently and outlines the
   analytical purchase gained from doing so; examines the effects of
   performer incumbency and combinatorial role patterns, thereby offering
   an empirical application of the ``role as resource{''} perspective
   (Baker and Faulkner 1991); and provides data on an underexplored era in
   which the emergence of digital technology has had wide-ranging
   repercussions. Regressing measures of innovation (form) and diversity
   (content) on incumbency status and combinatorial role patterns reveals
   that innovation and diversity operate through distinct collaborative
   patterns. New artists are found to be carriers of musical innovation,
   and while performing artists with autonomy over the roles of songwriter
   and producer are more likely to be progenitors of musical diversity,
   innovation emerges from role specialization. Artistic roles and
   performer attributes, moreover, come together in particular ways to
   influence diversity and innovation depending on the environmental
   context. Post compact disc (CD) format era, innovation wrought by
   producer specialization is predominant, but the music is devoid of
   diversity. I conclude by arguing that the manner in which configurations
   of diversity and innovation interact has implications both for cultural
   production and reception.}},

Abstract = {{The Newport Ship is the most substantial late medieval vessel excavated
   and recovered in Britain in recent years. It was abandoned after
   extensive salvage, possibly following attempts at repairs to the hull.
   More than 23 m of the clinker-built ship were recovered, along with
   significant artefact and environmental assemblages. Finds point to
   strong Iberian connections during the active life of the ship, which
   arrived in Newport in the Severn Estuary, after the spring of AD 1468.
   The dismantling and recovery of the ship has enabled detailed recording
   using innovative 3D digital techniques and approaches to hypothetical
   reconstruction. Publication includes a digital archive hosted by the
   Archaeological Data Service, a substantial report and this article. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Skills in aseptic technique are essential competencies for
   preventing infection; yet, aseptic technique is a difficult concept to
   master. During urinary catheter insertion, failure to properly adhere to
   strict aseptic technique has been linked to infections and sepsis. This
   pilot study used simulation to identify the most common breaches in
   aseptic technique during urinary catheter insertion.
   Methods: Baccalaureate nursing students with prior documentation of
   competency were recruited to demonstrate performance of urinary
   catheterization on a task trainer. The procedure was recorded, and
   breaches in technique were identified through review of the digital
   recordings.
   Results: Data were available for 13 participants. Participants ranged in
   age from 21 to 43 years (mean, 26.6). Ten participants (77\%) were
   female and three (23\%) were male. The participants' mean self-rating of
   confidence was 3.6 on a 5-point scale (range, 3-5), indicating some
   confidence in performing the skill. Examination of the video recorded
   data showed that 10 participants (77\%) breached aseptic technique in at
   least one category and in some instances several categories. The most
   common breach was cleansing the meatus; seven participants (54\%)
   performed it incorrectly.
   Conclusions: One-time competency validation using a simulator is not
   enough to ensure skill mastery or retention. Urinary catheter insertion
   is a high-risk skill and therefore should be afforded ample time to
   practice. Innovative approaches to ensure skill mastery, including
   urinary catheterization and other skills requiring sterile techniques,
   are needed.}},

Journal = {{SERVICE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{190-205}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Emerging from the rapid growth of information technology (IT) in a
   digital world is the explosion and rapid ascent of IT-related service
   innovation occurring around the globe. All successful service innovation
   in a digital world consists of two main abstract domains: signs (because
   only signs can be digitized) and practices. Signs are perceivable, but
   practices are not. Signs are commonly understood as resources in the
   digital world, whereas practices are understood as providing context,
   not as resources. This article proposes a change in this perspective:
   according to service-dominant logic, both signs and practices can become
   resources for service and value cocreation. They become resources if
   they are integrated in a service offering. We illustrate how recent
   digital service innovations can be explained with this perspective and
   how it can be used to distinguish incremental from radical innovation.
   The article also suggests, using this perspective, that IT and
   innovation specialists can productively develop ideas and concepts for
   future service innovation. From the practices framework presented,
   directions for further research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionThis technical innovation presents a method that reproduces
   the position of a dental implant after insertion without the reuse of
   X-ray radiation.
   Material and MethodsAn implant was inserted into the natural gap between
   the canines and premolars of three domestic pigs. A Straumann Scanbody
   was then screwed to the implant, and a digital impression of the jaw
   segment was made. The scanbody was scanned using a hand-held scanner.
   This was followed by the radiological detection of implant position on a
   CBCT. On the computer, the position of the implant was calculated and
   compared with the radiologically detected position.
   ResultsThe calculated and determined position of the dental implant by
   the scanner is in good agreement with the radiologically controlled
   position.
   DiscussionEvaluating the position of implants using intraoral scans is
   an easy and radiation-free method of three-dimensional site assessment
   after superimposition over a three-dimensional data set.}},

Abstract = {{With the widespread use of the Internet and the rapid development of
   digital technologies, copyright protection of multimedia content has
   become an important issue. Among the available technologies, digital
   watermarking techniques are regarded as a solution to the property right
   protection for multimedia resources. To evaluate the performance of a
   visible watermarking technique, robustness and perceptual translucence
   are two essential criteria for the watermark applications. In order to
   get the best trade-off between the embedding energy of a watermark and
   perceptual translucence, this study presents a technique named ICOCOA
   (innovated content and contrast aware) by exploiting the contrast
   sensitivity function (CSF) and noise reduction of human vision system in
   the wavelet domain. Another novel idea of this work is to propose the
   innovated CSF masking (I-CSF) curve which provides better weight
   perception where a game-theoretic architecture can be leveraged to
   determine the best I-CSF masking for the watermarked image. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only
   provides a good translucent quality of the watermark but also achieves
   the robustness against the common image processing operations.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Referrals for torticollis/plagiocephaly have increased
   dramatically because of ``Back to Sleep{''} campaigns and front-line
   staff becoming more proficient at recognition and referral to
   physiotherapy. These infants generally respond well to early
   intervention so longer waitlists raise concern about clinical outcomes
   due to delay. Methods: Therapists developed a group-based, team service
   delivery model based on best practices in individual treatment programs.
   The program was implemented and evaluated for assessment and treatment
   of infants presenting with these conditions, including caregiver
   satisfaction. Results: Compared with individual treatment, the group
   format enabled therapists to increase capacity to serve this population
   by 70\%, with equivalent quality and achievement of discharge criteria,
   as well as a modest service cost saving per child. Caregiver
   questionnaires indicate satisfaction with the service. Conclusions:
   Group service delivery is a cost-effective and efficient way to manage
   increased referrals for torticollis/plagiocephaly while maintaining
   comparable treatment outcomes. Video Abstract: For more insights from

Abstract = {{The rapid rise of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) signals a shift in
   the ways in which digital teaching and learning are engaged in and
   understood. Drawing upon a comprehensive search of nine leading academic
   databases, this paper examines the initial phase of MOOC scholarship
   (2009-2013), and offers an analysis of these empirical studies that
   conceptualizes themes in MOOC scholarship and locates them within a
   chronological framework. Two key phases of scholarship about MOOCs are
   identified, each with associated research imperatives and themes. Phase
   One: Connectivist MOOCs, Engagement and Creativity 2009-2011/2012.
   Themes of Phase One include: development of Connectivism as a learning
   theory, and technological experimentation and innovation in early
   cMOOCs. Phase Two: xMOOCs, Learning Analytics, Assessment, and Critical
   Discourses about MOOCs 2012-2013. Themes of Phase Two include: the rise
   of xMOOCs, further development of MOOC pedagogy and platforms, growth of
   learning analytics and assessment, and the emergence of a critical

Abstract = {{In the proposed advanced computing environment, known as the HoneyBee
   Platform, various computing devices using single or multiple interfaces
   and technologies/standards need to communicate and cooperate efficiently
   with a certain level of security and safety measures. These computing
   devices may be supported by different types of operating systems with
   different features and levels of security support. In order to ensure
   that all operations within the environment can be carried out seamlessly

   developed. The purpose of this long-term project is to investigate and
   implement a new functional layered model of the common mobile platform
   with secured and trusted ensemble computing architecture for an
   innovative Digital Economic Environment in the Malaysian context. This
   mobile platform includes a lightweight operating system to provide a
   common virtual environment, a middleware for providing basic
   functionalities of routing, resource and network management, as well as
   to provide security, privacy and a trusted environment. A generic

Abstract = {{With the aim of integrating HIV and tuberculosis care in rural Kenya, a
   team of researchers, clinicians, and technologists used the
   human-centered design approach to facilitate design, development, and
   deployment processes of new patient-specific TB clinical decision
   support system for medical providers. In Kenya, approximately 1.6
   million people are living with HIV and have a 20-times higher risk of
   dying of tuberculosis. Although tuberculosis prevention and treatment
   medication is widely available, proven to save lives, and prioritized by
   the World Health Organization, ensuring that it reaches the most
   vulnerable communities remains challenging. Human-centered design, used
   in the fields of industrial design and information technology for
   decades, is an approach to improving the effectiveness and impact of
   innovations that has been scarcely used in the health field. Using this
   approach, our team followed a 3-step process, involving mixed methods
   assessment to (1) understand the situation through the collection and
   analysis of site observation sessions and key informant interviews; (2)
   develop a new clinical decision support system through iterative
   prototyping, end-user engagement, and usability testing; and, (3)
   implement and evaluate the system across 24 clinics in rural West Kenya.
   Through the application of this approach, we found that human-centered
   design facilitated the process of digital innovation in a complex and
   resource-constrained context.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The lack of high quality timely data for evidence-informed
   decision making at the district level presents a challenge to improving
   maternal and newborn survival in low income settings. To address this
   problem, the EQUIP project (Expanded Quality Management using
   Information Power) implemented a continuous household and health
   facility survey for continuous feedback of data in two districts each in
   Tanzania and Uganda as part of a quality improvement innovation for
   mothers and newborns.
   Methods: Within EQUIP, continuous survey data were used for quality
   improvement (intervention districts) and for effect evaluation
   (intervention and comparison districts). Over 30 months of intervention
   (November 2011 to April 2014), EQUIP conducted continuous
   cross-sectional household and health facility surveys using 24
   independent probability samples of household clusters to represent each
   district each month, and repeat censuses of all government health
   facilities. Using repeat samples in this way allowed data to be
   aggregated at six four-monthly intervals to track progress over time for
   evaluation, and for continuous feedback to quality improvement teams in
   intervention districts. In both countries, one continuous survey team of
   eight people was employed to complete approximately 7,200 household and
   200 facility interviews in year one. Data were collected using personal
   digital assistants. After every four months, routine tabulations of
   indicators were produced and synthesized to report cards for use by the
   quality improvement teams.
   Results: The first 12 months were implemented as planned. Completion of
   household interviews was 96\% in Tanzania and 91\% in Uganda. Indicators
   across the continuum of care were tabulated every four months, results
   discussed by quality improvement teams, and report cards generated to
   support their work.
   Conclusions: The EQUIP continuous surveys were feasible to implement as
   a method to continuously generate and report on demand and supply side
   indicators for maternal and newborn health; they have potential to be
   expanded to include other health topics. Documenting the design and
   implementation of a continuous data collection and feedback mechanism
   for prospective description, quality improvement, and evaluation in a
   low-income setting potentially represents a new paradigm that places
   equal weight on data systems for course correction, as well as
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a ductile stainless steel fibrous reinforcing
   material containing innovative continuous stainless steel fibre
   filaments with a 30 gm diameter. The objective was to report on the
   mechanical properties and failure modes of these stainless steel fibrous
   layers impregnated with a ductile epoxy resin system. The mechanical
   behaviour under quasi-static tension and compression was evaluated
   experimentally in both principle material directions, along with the
   in-plane shear properties. The in-plane mechanical properties were
   determined by use of resistance strain gauge measurements and the
   Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique, providing full-field strain
   maps during loading and identifying local strain concentrations. It was
   observed that under tension, steel fibre reinforced epoxy exhibits
   similar ductile deformation behaviour to that of the dry continuous
   steel fibre filaments, i.e., an initial elastic response, a definite
   yield point and consecutive plastic and strain hardening behaviour up to
   19.5 \% failure strain. A difference in tensile and compressive
   behaviour of the unidirectional steel fibre composite was reported. The
   out-of-plane fibre waviness attributed to the warp binder yarns makes
   the material sensitive towards fibre microbuckling and kink-band
   formation during compressive loading. The damage morphology of failed
   specimens loaded in different directions was examined using both optical
   microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), identifying the
   principle features of failure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Planar 2D x-ray mammography is generally accepted as the preferred
   screening technique used for breast cancer detection. Recently, digital
   breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has been introduced to overcome some of the
   inherent limitations of conventional planar imaging, and future
   technological enhancements are expected to result in the introduction of
   further innovative modalities. However, it is crucial to understand the
   impact of any new imaging technology or methodology on cancer detection
   rates and patient recall. Any such assessment conventionally requires
   large scale clinical trials demanding significant investment in time and
   resources. The concept of virtual clinical trials and virtual
   performance assessment may offer a viable alternative to this approach.
   However, virtual approaches require a collection of specialized
   modelling tools which can be used to emulate the image acquisition
   process and simulate images of a quality indistinguishable from their
   real clinical counterparts. In this paper, we present two image
   simulation chains constructed using modelling tools that can be used for
   the evaluation of 2D-mammography and DBT systems. We validate both
   approaches by comparing simulated images with real images acquired using
   the system being simulated. A comparison of the contrast-to-noise ratios
   and image blurring for real and simulated images of test objects shows
   good agreement (< 9\% error). This suggests that our simulation approach
   is a promising alternative to conventional physical performance
   assessment followed by large scale clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{Governments and businesses alike are coming to understand that national
   and global economies should use the Internet as a medium for innovation
   and economic growth. A critical component that has been left to service
   providers to establish and manage is that of digital identities of
   online clients and customers. Lack of regulation and effective methods
   of management has resulted in greater concerns over privacy, security,
   and productivity in online environments, thus hindering the development
   and use of the full potential of the Internet. This paper attempts to
   explore the role of a government initiated digital identity management
   system in supporting the creation of a stronger digital economy. The
   author provides an overview of the identity management infrastructure
   development initiatives in Gulf Cooperation Council countries and
   briefly examines their potential to revolutionize and transform existing
   economic models. The author argues that the new smart identity cards
   produced in these countries may serve as secure tokens that connect
   digital and physical identity, create trustworthy environments, and
   strengthen confidence in online transactions critical to the growth of
   the digital economy.}},

Abstract = {{The key current challenges for the industrial application of all optical
   switching networks are energy consumption, transmission rate, spectrum
   efficiency, and switching throughput. The energy consumption problem is
   mainly researched in this paper. From the perspective of components and
   modules, node equipment, and network levels, different enabling
   technologies are proposed to overcome this problem, which are also
   evaluated through different experimental demonstrations. First,
   high-sampling-rate digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and WSS-based
   ROADM modules are demonstrated as components and modules for
   energy-efficient all optical switching networks. Then, an all optical
   transport network test-bed consisting of 10 Pbit/s level all optical
   switching nodes based on multi-level and multi-planar switching
   architecture is experimentally demonstrated for the first time, which
   can reduce power consumption by 43\%. A control architecture for
   energy-efficient all optical switching networks is built with OpenFlow
   based software defined networking (SDN), and experimental results are
   given to verify the performance of this control architecture. Finally,
   we describe an All Optical Networks Innovation (AONI) project in China,
   which aims to explore transmission, switching, and networking
   technologies in all optical switching networks, and then two application
   scenarios are forecast based on the technical breakthroughs of this
   project.}},

Abstract = {{Digital-physical toolkits enable the layperson to design everyday
   consumer products. The aim of this paper is to identify and gain
   understanding of the unexplored possibilities of digital-physical
   toolkits. Looking at several different types of toolkits that enable
   novices to create, adapt or customize a design, we analyzed these
   toolkits and identified several characteristics and mechanisms that they
   share. We also investigated how people use toolkits through two usage
   experiments. In the first experiment, we identified several issues that
   arise when consumers use toolkits. In the second experiment, we
   developed a vocabulary for the exploration of the design space and we
   identified specific behaviors that laypersons enact when designing. The
   results of this paper are introduced through our lay design model, which
   deals with different types of layperson autonomy as well as with the
   unexplored possibilities of learning paths and iteration within
   digital-physical toolkits. If lay design becomes commonplace there will
   be an increasing need for understanding this practice. The unexplored
   possibilities discussed in this paper present opportunities for
   designers, and taking advantage of them will have far-reaching
   consequences for the whole product development cycle, from the way
   products are designed and developed to how they are distributed and
   sold.}},

Abstract = {{The digital environment is growing rapidly, through ubiquitous and
   increasingly powerful personal computing devices, and the demand for
   information to be accessible. Libraries and archives, as traditional
   providers and storehouses of content, are adapting to this changing
   environment by adopting new and innovative digital content delivery
   mechanisms to unmask their special collections. In 2012, the University
   of Wollongong Library implemented a comprehensive digitisation program
   for its unique archival and research collections. Film, photographs,
   documents, artworks and audio are being made available online through
   several platforms and delivery tools in combination, complementing the
   increasingly important role played by the library in supporting
   research, education, and community engagement. The implementation of a
   Digital Collections Portal has channelled Australian and international
   audiences to the library's digital content. Open access to collections
   is a key library goal, with success measured in part by the amount of
   material made available and the number of times it is downloaded. With a
   focus on building collections, prominent issues such as format shifting,
   metadata production, and methods of open communication have been
   resolved as the library develops expertise and knowledge in managing an
   embedded digitisation programme.}},

Abstract = {{Digitization has reached things. This shift promises to alter the
   business and legal landscape for a range of industries. Digitization has
   already disrupted copyright-based industries and laws. As cost barriers
   fell, individuals engaged with copyrighted work as never before.
   Business-to-business and business-to-consumer models of industrial
   copyright faltered and, in some cases, failed. Industries were forced to
   reorganize, and the foundations of copyright were reexamined. This
   Article assesses a prime example of the next phase of digitization: 3D
   printing and its implications for intellectual property law and
   practice.
   3D printing is a general-purpose technology that will do for physical
   objects what MP3 files did for music. The core patent bargain sharing
   how to make something in exchange for exclusivity may be meaningless in
   a world of digitized things. While 3D printers will unleash the
   creativity of producers and reduce costs for consumers, they will also
   make it far easier to infringe patents, copyrights, and trade dress.
   This will compel firms to rethink their business practices and courts to
   reconsider not only patent law but also long-established doctrine in
   areas ranging from copyright merger to trademark post-sale confusion.
   Moreover, Congress will need to consider establishing some sort of
   infringement exemption for 3D printing in the home and expanding the
   notice-and-takedown rules of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to
   websites that host software enabling 3D printing of patented items and
   distinctive trade dress. While a 3D printer is not yet a common
   household item, the time to start thinking about that future is now.}},

Abstract = {{Sonography techniques use multiple transducer elements for tissue
   visualization. Signals received at each element are sampled before
   digital beamforming. The sampling rates required to perform
   high-resolution digital beamforming are significantly higher than the
   Nyquist rate of the signal and result in considerable amount of data
   that must be stored and processed. A recently developed technique,
   compressed beamforming, based on the finite rate of innovation model,
   compressed sensing (CS), and Xampling ideas, allows a reduction in the
   number of samples needed to reconstruct an image comprised of strong
   reflectors. A drawback of this method is its inability to treat speckle,
   which is of significant importance in medical imaging. Here, we build on
   previous work and extend it to a general concept of beamforming in
   frequency. This allows exploitation of the low bandwidth of the
   ultrasound signal and bypassing of the oversampling dictated by digital
   implementation of beamforming in time. By using beamforming in
   frequency, the same image quality is obtained from far fewer samples. We
   next present a CS technique that allows for further rate reduction,
   using only a portion of the beamformed signal's bandwidth. We
   demonstrate our methods on in vivo cardiac data and show that reductions
   up to 1/28 of the standard beamforming rates are possible. Finally, we
   present an implementation on an ultrasound machine using sub-Nyquist
   sampling and processing. Our results prove that the concept of
   sub-Nyquist processing is feasible for medical ultrasound, leading to
   the potential of considerable reduction in future ultrasound machines'
   size, power consumption, and cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper has two motivations: firstly, to compare the Digital Surface
   Models (DSM) derived by passive (digital camera) and by active
   (terrestrial laser scanner) remote sensing systems when applied to
   specific architectural objects, and secondly, to test how well the
   Gaussian classic statistics, with its Least Squares principle, adapts to
   data sets where asymmetrical gross errors may appear and whether this
   approach should be changed for a non-parametric one. The field of
   geomatic technology automation is immersed in a high demanding
   competition in which any innovation by one of the contenders immediately
   challenges the opponents to propose a better improvement. Nowadays, we
   seem to be witnessing an improvement of terrestrial photogrammetry and
   its integration with computer vision to overcome the performance
   limitations of laser scanning methods. Through this contribution some of
   the issues of this ``technological race{''} are examined from the point
   of view of photogrammetry. A new software is introduced and an
   experimental test is designed, performed and assessed to try to cast
   some light on this thrilling match. For the case considered in this
   study, the results show good agreement between both sensors, despite
   considerable asymmetry. This asymmetry suggests that the standard Normal
   parameters are not adequate to assess this type of data, especially when
   accuracy is of importance. In this case, standard deviation fails to
   provide a good estimation of the results, whereas the results obtained
   for the Median Absolute Deviation and for the Biweight Midvariance are
   more appropriate measures.}},

Abstract = {{Digital storytelling, which combines the art of storytelling with a
   variety of digital audio, video, and multimedia images, has been
   increasingly used as a language learning tool as research studies have
   shown it to be effective in enhancing the development of language skills
   as well as related language learning skills, such as autonomy,
   collaboration, and problem-solving skills. However, before successful
   language learning can take place, teachers' concerns regarding
   technology adoption has to be explored, especially since there is very
   little research in this area in the Malaysian context. This study
   addresses this gap in knowledge by sharing the concerns of four English
   as Second Language (ESL) instructors in terms of their attitudes and
   acceptance of the use of technology in the form of digital storytelling
   in teaching ESL at a Malaysian public university. ``Concern{''} in this
   study refers to the evoked feelings and perceptions towards an
   innovation and the change process. The data of the study are drawn from
   the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) and interviews of the
   instructors. The findings revealed that the teachers perceive the
   technology to be beneficial to their students to a certain extent;
   however, resistance to the technology was particularly strong in two of
   the instructors and this could lead to failure in technology
   integration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the development of mobile-assisted language learning
   (MALL) over the past 20 years is reviewed with a particular focus on the
   pedagogical challenges facing its exploitation. Following a
   consideration of the definition of mobile learning, the paper describes
   the dominant mobile technologies upon which MALL applications have been
   based: MP3 players, personal digital assistants, and mobile phones. It
   then identifies the prevalent methodological approach that has underlain
   the great majority of MALL implementations: a behaviorist,
   teacher-centered, transmission model of instruction. However, though
   rarely implemented, MALL is equally capable of supporting more
   innovative constructivist, collaborative, learner-centered instruction,
   examples of which are examined. Besides being restricted by a
   pedagogical approach very much out of step with methodologies that have
   guided foreign language teaching for nearly four decades, MALL has also
   been constrained by access to technology. In part, this problem has been
   due to the necessity of acquiring mobile devices for student usage and
   the costs associated with mobile network and Internet connections. Even
   more so, the exploitation of mobile devices for language learning has
   been hampered by a lack of hardware standardization and entrenched
   operating system incompatibilities. The paper concludes that MALL has
   yet to realize its full potential and that achieving this aim is more a
   matter of pedagogy than technology. The financial and technological
   factors that have impeded the effective exploitation of MALL are likely
   to be resolved as operating system incompatibilities are overcome by
   market forces and students as well as teachers acquire suitable mobile
   devices for their own personal use. The future of MALL lies in the
   exploitation of the communication and multimedia affordances of mobile
   devices in ways that support collaborative, task-based learning both
   within and outside of the classroom.}},

Abstract = {{With approximately 4 physicians per 100,000 inhabitants, Mozambique
   faces one of the most severe health care provider shortages in
   Sub-Saharan Africa. The lack of sufficient well-trained medical school
   faculty is one of Mozambique's major barrier to producing new physicians
   annually. A partnership between the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane and
   the University of California, San Diego, has addressed this challenge
   with support from the Medical Education Partnership Initiative. After an
   initial needs assessment involving questionnaires and focus groups of
   residents, and working with key members from the Ministry of Health, the
   Medical Council, and Maputo Central Hospital, a set of interventions was
   designed. The hospital's internal medicine residency program was chosen
   as the focus for the plan. Interventions included curriculum design, new
   teaching methodologies, investment in an informatics infrastructure for
   access to digital references, building capacity to support clinical
   research, and providing financial incentives to retain junior faculty.
   The number of candidates entering the internal medicine residency
   program has increased, and detailed monitoring and evaluation is
   measuring the impact of these changes on the quality of training. These
   changes are expected to improve the long-term quality of postgraduate
   training in general through dissemination to other departments. They
   also have the potential to facilitate equitable distribution of
   specialists nationwide by expanding postgraduate training to other
   hospitals and universities.}},

Abstract = {{This is the era of digital landscapes; the widespread availability of
   powerful sensing technologies has revolutionized the way it is possible
   to interrogate landscapes in order to understand the processes sculpting
   them. Vastly greater areas have now been acquired at `high resolution':
   currently tens of metres globally to millimetric precision and accuracy
   locally. This permits geomorphic features to be visualized and analysed
   across the scales at which Earth-surface processes operate. Especially
   exciting is the capturing of process dynamics in repeated surveying,
   which will only become more important with low-cost accessible data
   generation through techniques such as Structure from Motion (SfM). But
   the key challenge remains; to interpret high resolution Digital Terrain
   Models (DTMs), particularly by extracting geomorphic features in robust
   and objective ways and then linking the observed features to the
   underlying physical processes. In response to the new data and
   challenges, recent years have seen improved processing of raw data into
   DTMs, development of data fusion techniques, novel quantitative analysis
   of topographic data, and innovative geomorphological mapping. The twelve
   papers collected in this volume sample this progress in interrogating
   Earth-surface processes through the analysis of DTMs. They cover a wide
   range of disciplines and spatio-temporal scales, from landslide prone
   landscapes, to agriculturally modified regions, to mountainous
   landscapes, and coastal zones. They all, however, showcase the
   quantitative exploitation of information contained in high-resolution
   topographic data that we believe will underpin the improvement of our
   understanding of many elements of Earth-surface processes. Most of the
   papers introduced here were first presented in a conference session at
   the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in 2011. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{There is an emerging consensus that undergraduate biology education in
   the United States is at a crucial juncture, especially as we acknowledge
   the need to train a new generation of scientists to meet looming
   environmental and health crises. Digital resources for biology now
   available online provide an opportunity to transform biology curricula
   to include more authentic and inquiry-driven educational experiences.
   Digitized natural history collections have become tremendous assets for
   research in environmental and health sciences, but, to date, these data
   remain largely untapped by educators. Natural history collections have
   the potential to help transform undergraduate science education from
   passive learning into an active exploration of the natural world,
   including the exploration of the complex relationships among
   environmental conditions, biodiversity, and human well-being. By
   incorporating natural history specimens and their associated data into
   undergraduate curricula, educators can promote participatory learning
   and foster an understanding of essential interactions between organisms
   and their environments.}},

Abstract = {{As various forms of social media are spreading, we often witness that an
   idea of an individual user drives macroscopic changes. From the
   perspectives of product development and marketing, the opinions left by
   potential consumers in online social network can generate big ripple
   effects. This study analyzes the user opinions in online space to grasp
   preferences toward various products psychologically categorized by
   users. We also suggest an aspect of the market mentally configured by
   users using network modeling while following the framework of economic
   sociology. Existing analyses on online market place are mainly dealing
   with structural issues such as inter-actor relationships and status
   measurement. This study, however, analyzes complex preferences regarding
   diverse products and brands and derives a new model for inter-market
   connections. We expect that our study will provide important
   consequences on digital marketing and community design of corporations
   planning word of mouth effect in online space.}},

Abstract = {{The past 200,000 years of human cultural evolution have witnessed the
   persistent establishment of behaviors involving innovation, planning
   depth, and abstract and symbolic thought, or what has been called
   ``behavioral modernity.{''} Demographic models based on increased human
   population density from the late Pleistocene onward have been
   increasingly invoked to understand the emergence of behavioral
   modernity. However, high levels of social tolerance, as seen among
   living humans, are a necessary prerequisite to life at higher population
   densities and to the kinds of cooperative cultural behaviors essential
   to these demographic models. Here we provide data on craniofacial
   feminization (reduction in average brow ridge projection and shortening
   of the upper facial skeleton) in Homo sapiens from the Middle
   Pleistocene to recent times. We argue that temporal changes in human
   craniofacial morphology reflect reductions in average androgen
   reactivity (lower levels of adult circulating testosterone or reduced
   androgen}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, arts and culture have been placed at the center of
   attention when discussing economic growth. In particular, studies on the
   ``creative class{''} have been using arts and culture as an important
   factor impacting local economies. In addition, studies on local economic
   development have frequently viewed universities as a major factor in
   economic growth. In the middle of this discussion is new economic growth
   via creativity, via new recipes and new combinations of local capital,
   and via innovation centers. Combining these disparate literatures brings
   to center stage both clusters of arts and culture and concentrations of
   research and human capital development. Hence, the focus of this paper
   is to analyze the dual impacts of universities and arts districts on
   innovation and economic growth through employment in digital media. The
   results indicate that cultural districts have a consistently positive
   effect on local digital media economic activity-employment and
   innovation. The same cannot be said for research universities.}},

Abstract = {{The use of composite indicators as a tool for ranking and making
   decisions is ever increasing in a world marked by the inequalities and
   competition in all domains. However, the dependence of countries ranking
   on the weighing scheme used to aggregate individual indices or
   sub-indicators, most of the time set by experts/stakeholders may weaken
   the credibility of composite indicators. One method which is able to
   overcome these limits is the ``Data Envelopment Analysis{''} approach,
   particularly named ``Benefit-Of-the-Doubt{''} in the context of
   composite indicators' construction. We propose a revaluation of the
   Digital Access Index given that Information technology is the most
   important factor driving improvement in a wide array of areas critical
   for the quality of life for individuals as well as societies. We have
   shown that this method is more suitable for identifying trends and
   drawing attention to particular issues and also for setting policy
   priorities. In fact, the weights of the individual indices, used to
   compute the composite indicators are based on the data itself and are
   proper for the country under consideration. These weights contain
   adequate information in order to help policy-makers to better understand
   the nature of the new innovation economy and the types of public
   policies needed to drive innovation, productivity and broad-based
   prosperity for its citizens.}},

Abstract = {{Business method patents are a special class of patents that allow
   companies to assert ownership over technologies and the ways in which
   those technologies are put to use. Looking at the history of business
   method patents in the United States and the recent resurgence of this
   type of patent activity in the mobile and handheld computing sectors, I
   argue that business method and related software patents act as quiet
   quests for control over information and cultural practices. Business
   method and software patents highlight how certain actors use moments of
   technological change to secure economic and cultural advantages through
   law and regulation. Instead of fostering innovation and rewarding
   inventors, these patents are an impractical form of intellectual
   property that seeks to mimic traditional conceptions of physical objects
   in an era of digital goods. This article serves as a call for scholars
   undertaking research on the migration of media and culture to new
   digital formats and devices to consider how patents act as protocols
   that pre-inscribe devices with certain features, gestures, and meanings.
   As an increasing variety of cultural goods such as music, movies, and
   books migrate into digital formats online, business method and software
   patents have significant implications for the production, circulation,
   and use of digital commodities.}},

Abstract = {{For stereometric processing of optical image pairs, the concept of
   epipolar geometry is widely used. It helps to reduce the complexity of
   image matching, which can be seen to be the most crucial step within a
   workflow to generate digital elevation models. In this paper, it is
   shown that this concept is also applicable to the cocircular geometry of
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image pairs. First, it is proven that,
   for any feasible SAR acquisition, the deviation from true epipolar
   geometry is within subpixel range and therefore acceptably small. Based
   on this, we propose a method to create ``epipolar{''} geometry for
   arbitrary stereo configurations of any SAR sensor through appropriate
   geometric image transformations. Consequently, the semiglobal matching
   (SGM) algorithm can be applied, which is restricted to epipolar geometry
   and is thus known to be highly efficient. This innovative approach,
   integrating both epipolar transformation and SGM, has been applied to a
   TerraSAR-X stereo data set. Its benefit has been demonstrated in a
   comparative assessment with respect to results, which have been
   previously achieved on the same test data using state-of-the-art
   stereometric methods.}},

Abstract = {{Maker spaces and maker activities offering access to low-cost digital
   fabrication equipment are rapidly proliferating, evolving phenomena at
   the interface of lay and professional design. They also come in many
   varieties and change fast, presenting a difficult target for, for
   instance, public authorities, who would like to cater for them but
   operate in much slower planning cycles. As part of participatory
   planning of Helsinki Central Library, we experimented with a form of
   collaborative futuring with and by makers. By drawing elements from both
   lead-user workshops and participatory design, we conducted a futuring
   workshop, which allowed us to engage the local maker communities in
   identifying the issues relevant for a public maker space in 2020. It
   further engaged the participants in envisioning a smaller prototype
   maker space and invited them into realising its activities
   collaboratively. Our results indicate that particularly the information
   about future solutions was of high relevance, as was the opportunity to
   trial and elaborate activities on a rolling basis in the prototype
   space. Insights about more general trends in making were useful too, but
   to a lesser extent, and it is likely that these could have been gained
   just as easily with more traditional means for futuring.}},

Abstract = {{Many digital innovation efforts approach the challenge of transforming a
   traditional product as primarily technological, in the belief that a
   digital product can simply replace an existing traditional one. The high
   adoption rate of tablets potentially offers new opportunities for the
   sheet music market and creates the promise of a digital breakthrough in
   this traditional industry. However, simply developing an application
   with a snazzy design will not convince musicians to adopt digital sheet
   music, as they demand consistent usability. In this article we
   investigate how NeoScores, an intriguing startup, handles many
   challenges of innovating sheet music. The three founders are experienced
   musicians and regretted that many industries and products were
   successfully digitalizing except for sheet music. We will study how
   NeoScores invests time and effort in technology development, in
   balancing the traditional sheet music culture and in meeting the
   requirements of musicians.}},

Abstract = {{The Pakistan film industry in its heyday in the 1970s was producing
   upward of 100 films annually making it one of the largest in the world
   and arguably the largest of the Muslim world. Despite the fact that the
   Pakistan film industry has produced a staggering number of images they
   have not been studied in any great depth. Little is known of the earlier
   painters or of their work. This article looks at these posters as a form
   of popular art that is colourful, innovative and unique in its
   creativity. The history, technique and impact of this popular art form
   is analyzed through secondary research as well as primary ethnographic
   fieldwork that was undertaken between 2010 and 2012 in Lahore. The
   article also charts the rise of hand-painted posters as a means of
   advertising and proceeds to examine the representation of different
   genres of films in the posters. The development of this vibrant
   indigenous art form is looked at through the eyes of master painters and
   their experiences through the different decades of Pakistani cinema. The
   article concludes with an account of the decline of this unique art form
   as resulting from the overall contraction of the industry and the
   technological changes that saw digital prints replace hand painted
   craftsmanship.}},

Abstract = {{Social media brings a new dimension to health care for patients,
   providers, and their support networks. Increasing evidence demonstrates
   that patients who are more actively involved in their healthcare
   experience have better health outcomes and incur lower costs. In the
   field of cardiology, social media are proposed as innovative tools for
   the education and update of clinicians, physicians, nurses, and medical
   students. This article reviews the use of social media by healthcare
   providers and patients and proposes a model of ``networked care{''} that
   integrates the use of digital social networks and platforms by both
   patients and providers and offers recommendations for providers to
   optimize their use and understanding of social media for quality

Abstract = {{Objectives: The current digital revolution is particularly relevant for
   interactions of healthcare providers with patients and the community as
   a whole. The growing public acceptance and distribution of new
   communication tools such as smart mobile phones provide the prerequisite
   for information and communication technology (ICT) -assisted healthcare
   applications. The present study aimed at identifying specifications and
   perceptions of different interest groups regarding future demands of
   ICT-supported doctor-patient communication in Austria.
   Methods: German-speaking Austrian healthcare experts (n = 73; 74 percent
   males; mean age, 43.9 years; SD 9.4) representing medical professionals,
   patient advocates, and administrative personnel participated in a
   2-round online Delphi process. Participants evaluated scenario-based
   benefits and obstacles for possible prospect introduction as well as
   degree of innovation, desirability, and estimated implementation dates
   of two medical care-related future set ups.
   Results: Panelists expected the future ICT-supported doctor-patient
   dialogue to especially improve the three factors doctors-patient
   relationship, patients' knowledge, and quality of social health care.
   However, lack of acceptance by doctors, data security, and monetary
   aspects were considered as the three most relevant barriers for ICT
   implementation. Furthermore, inter-group comparison regarding
   desirability of future scenarios showed that medical professionals
   tended to be more skeptical about health-related technological
   innovations (p < .001).
   Conclusions: The findings of this survey revealed different expectations
   among interest groups. Thus, we suggest building taskforces and using
   workshops for establishing a dialogue between stakeholders to positively
   shape the future of ICT-supported collaboration and communication
   between doctors and patients.}},

Abstract = {{The European Union recently launched an innovative participatory
   mechanism allowing its citizens across Europe get together and set the
   agenda for policy-making in Brussels. The tool - the European Citizens'
   Initiative - was labelled as ``most direct and digital{''} ever in the
   history of European democratic experimentation as it made it possible to
   collect signatures (of which it is required not less than 1 million) in
   favour of an initiative via the internet (e-collection). Launched on I
   April 2012 the ECI was met with major enthusiasm in Brussels, but soon
   stumbled over serious difficulties as the organisers on the ground were
   unable to set up their online collection systems. The present paper
   looks into this ICT-related crisis from the point of reference of
   e-democracy theory based on the findings of a qualitative case-study. As
   a deliverable, it offers an understanding of factors and stakeholder
   rationales which shaped the design and implementation of the digital
   dimension of the ECI (iECI). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Noncooperative game-theoretic tools have been increasingly used to study
   many important resource allocation problems in communications,
   networking, smart grids, and portfolio optimization. In this paper, we
   consider a general class of convex Nash equilibrium problems (NEPs),
   where each player aims at solving an arbitrary smooth convex
   optimization problem. Differently from most of current works, we do not
   assume any specific structure for the players' problems, and we allow
   the optimization variables of the players to be matrices in the complex
   domain. Our main contribution is the design of a novel class of
   distributed (asynchronous) best-response-algorithms suitable for solving
   the proposed NEPs, even in the presence of multiple solutions. The new
   methods, whose convergence analysis is based on variational inequality
   (VI) techniques, can select, among all the equilibria of a game, those
   that optimize a given performance criterion, at the cost of limited
   signaling among the players. This is a major departure from existing
   best-response algorithms, whose convergence conditions imply the
   uniqueness of the NE. Some of our results hinge on the use of VI
   problems directly in the complex domain; the study of these new kind of
   VIs also represents a noteworthy innovative contribution. We then apply
   the developed methods to solve some new generalizations of Single Input
   Single Output (SISO) and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) games in
   cognitive radio systems, showing a considerable performance improvement
   over classical pure noncooperative schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Digitization of collections in Dutch museums can be traced back to 1969.
   Since then, significant resources have been allocated to digital
   activities. Results from the digitization trajectory analysis show that
   museums present a similar rate of adoption (and dissemination) for
   computers, the Internet, and information policy documents, with a
   10-year difference while digitization of collections and online
   publication of collections have a much slower adoption rate. An
   explanation is found in the national policies designed to adopt
   technology focusing on innovation rather than organizational change or
   skill development. Restricted online publication of collections
   represents an important efficiency loss.}},

Abstract = {{Big data is increasingly the cornerstone on which policy making is
   based. However, with potential benefits and applications come challenges
   and dilemmas. In this set of symposium articles, authors examine the
   promise and problems of big data, exploring associated prospects, risks,
   parameters, and payoffs from a variety of perspectives. The articles
   address myriad challenges in the handling of big data sets, such as
   collection, validation, integrity, and security; ontological issues
   attending data analytics and conceptual transformations; the foundations
   of big data collection for social science research; the gap between the
   acquisition of data and its use to advance discovery and innovation; the
   costs and benefits of using big data in decision making and analysis;
   and, finally, related problems of privacy, security, and ethics. Issues
   such as these will continue to arise with increased use of big data as
   fundamental to policy making and governance in today's growing
   information society.}},

Abstract = {{Governments are increasingly resorting to technology mandates to force
   development and commercialization of socially-desirable technologies
   that the market, for various reasons, seems unable or unwilling to
   provide in a timely manner. This Article analyzes three recent examples
   of government-imposed technology mandates, including explicit or de
   facto government requirements for electric vehicles, digital TV, and
   non-incandescent light bulbs. The analysis demonstrates that while all
   three mandates were motivated by legitimate and worthy goals, all three
   mandates encountered controversy, delays, confusion, and at best partial
   success. Three major conclusions can be drawn from these three cases
   studies: (1) Technology mandates should be a last resort for government
   to induce beneficial technologies; (2) When government resorts to
   technology mandates it should do a better job of trying to anticipate
   the social, economic, and technological implications of the intended
   technology change; and (3) When government resorts to technology
   mandates it should put into place mechanisms for ongoing review and
   adjustment of technology mandates.}},

Title = {{Twitter mining for fine-grained syndromic surveillance}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Digital traces left on the Internet by web users, if
   properly aggregated and analyzed, can represent a huge information
   dataset able to inform syndromic surveillance systems in real time with
   data collected directly from individuals. Since people use everyday
   language rather than medical jargon (e.g. runny nose vs. respiratory
   distress), knowledge of patients' terminology is essential for the
   mining of health related conversations on social networks.
   Objectives: In this paper we present a methodology for early detection
   and analysis of epidemics based on mining Twitter messages. In order to
   reliably trace messages of patients that actually complain of a disease,
   first, we learn a model of naive medical language, second, we adopt a
   symptom-driven, rather than disease-driven, keyword analysis. This
   approach represents a major innovation compared to previous published
   work in the field.
   Method: We first developed an algorithm to automatically learn a variety
   of expressions that people use to describe their health conditions, thus
   improving our ability to detect health-related ``concepts{''} expressed
   in non-medical terms and, in the end, producing a larger body of
   evidence. We then implemented a Twitter monitoring instrument to finely
   analyze the presence and combinations of symptoms in tweets.
   Results: We first evaluate the algorithm's performance on an available
   dataset of diverse medical condition synonyms, then, we assess its
   utility in a case study of five common syndromes for surveillance
   purposes. We show that, by exploiting physicians' knowledge on symptoms
   positively or negatively related to a given disease, as well as the
   correspondence between patients' ``naive{''} terminology and medical
   jargon, not only can we analyze large volumes of Twitter messages
   related to that disease, but we can also mine micro-blogs with complex
   queries, performing fine-grained tweets classification (e.g. those
   reporting influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms vs. common cold or
   allergy).
   Conclusions: Our approach yields a very high level of correlation with
   flu trends derived from traditional surveillance systems. Compared with
   Google Flu, another popular tool based on query search volumes, our
   method is more flexible and less sensitive to changes in web search
   behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Journalists who regularly cover science, health, environment and
   technology in Africa and the Arab world face a number of difficulties:
   Lack of elementary resources for journalistic research, and newsroom
   environments that are not always supportive of specialised reporting.
   Also a need for capacity to cover science is often bemoaned as well as
   difficulties in interactions between journalists and scientists. The
   evaluation of the world's largest support initiative for science
   journalism in developing countries, the SjCOOP mentoring programme,
   shows that some of these problems can be mitigated through a variety of
   support programmes, especially `distance mentoring'. The article
   analyses ways of building capacity and offering general support with the
   help of ICTs. Organisational structures for specialised reporting in 40
   newsrooms are compared. Cases of structural advancement and innovation
   for science journalism are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The design of finite impulse response (FIR) filters can be formulated as
   a non-linear optimization problem reputed to be difficult for
   conventional approaches. The constraints are high and a large number of
   parameters have to be estimated, especially when dealing with
   two-dimensional FIR filters. In order to improve the performance of
   conventional approaches, the authors explore several stochastic
   methodologies capable of handling large spaces. The authors specifically
   propose a new genetic algorithm (GA) in which some innovative concepts
   are introduced to improve the convergence and make its use easier for
   practitioners. The algorithm is globally improved by adapting the
   mutation and crossover and selection operators with the genetic
   advances. A dynamic ranking selection scheme is introduced to limit the
   promotion of extraordinary chromosomes. A refreshing mechanism is
   investigated to manage the trade-off between diversity and elitism. The
   key point of the proposed approach stems from the capacity of the GA to
   adapt the genetic operators during the genetic life while remaining
   simple and easy to implement. Most of the parameters and operators are
   changed by the GA itself. From an initial calibration, the GA performs
   the design problem while calibrating and repeatedly re-calibrating
   itself for solving it. The authors demonstrate on various cases of
   filter design a significant improvement in performance.}},

Abstract = {{We present a computational approach for designing wire meshes, i.e.,
   freeform surfaces composed of woven wires arranged in a regular grid. To
   facilitate shape exploration, we map material properties of wire meshes
   to the geometric model of Chebyshev nets. This abstraction is exploited
   to build an efficient optimization scheme. While the theory of Chebyshev
   nets suggests a highly constrained design space, we show that allowing
   controlled deviations from the underlying surface provides a rich shape
   space for design exploration. Our algorithm balances globally coupled
   material constraints with aesthetic and geometric design objectives that
   can be specified by the user in an interactive design session. In
   addition to sculptural art, wire meshes represent an innovative medium
   for industrial applications including composite materials and
   architectural facades. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
   using a variety of digital and physical prototypes with a level of shape
   complexity unobtainable using previous methods.}},

Abstract = {{The recent adaptation of tilt-shift photography by digital technology
   has produced a fascinating optical illusion that makes film captures of
   real landscapes appear as if they are fake miniatures - an animated
   tilt-shift flanerie that encapsulates cities into toy-like visions of
   themselves, using time-lapse photography to create the effect of
   stop-motion animation. This sophisticated reimagining of 19th-century
   postcards utilizes early 20th-century innovations in aerial photography
   to create a radical shift in scale - both visual and temporal - that
   results in startling alterations in perception and a new phenomenology
   of seeing. The confluence of micro and macro perception into one
   animated image challenges the human perception of time and space in a
   way that mirrors modernization and globalization. Tilt-shift flanerie
   also, as this article argues, echoes changes in global perspective that
   encourage greater cosmopolitan awareness and the reworking of cultural
   and national boundaries in line with a postmodern erosion of the
   monocular eye and universal vision. It results in an enhanced spatial
   perspective that allows us, like Alice in Wonderland, to scale ourselves
   to an unexpected new relationship with the world, inscribing individuals
   into a landscape that fits energetically, tilting and shifting, into the
   eye of the beholder.}},

Abstract = {{The development of front-end converters for power factor correction and
   DC link voltage control of power electronics converters such as, UPS,
   Inverters, and Switched Power Supplies, has been attracting great
   interest from the scientific community that works toward the
   achievements of cost reduction, high efficiency, and reliability. In
   this context, this paper proposes a microprocessed control technique for
   sinusoidal input line current imposition in front-end ac-dc converters.
   This gave rise to an innovative sensorless boost converter, named in
   this work as PFC-Boost-CSL. The proposed method is based on experimental
   acquisition of gate-drive signal sequences for different load
   conditions. These signals correspond to a complete cycle of the AC input
   voltage and are recorded in the microcontroller memory in order to be
   reproduced when used in a boost converter without current sensor. In the
   operation of PFC-Boost-CSL, a suitable switching sequence is sent to
   drive the power switch in order to minimize output voltage error and
   maintain a sinusoidal input current. Aiming to prove the proposed
   control concept, a 600 W PFC-Boost-CSL prototype was built and analyzed
   in laboratory and the main experimental results are presented herein.

Abstract = {{Virtual paleontology unites a variety of computational techniques and
   methods for the visualization and analysis of fossils. Due to their
   great potential and increasing availability, these methods have become
   immensely popular in the last decade. However, communicating the wealth
   of digital information and results produced by the various techniques is
   still exacerbated by traditional methods of publication. Transferring
   and processing three-dimensional information, such as interactive models
   or animations, into scientific publications still poses a challenge.
   Here, we present different methods and applications to communicate
   digital data in academia, outreach and education. Three-dimensional
   PDFs, QR codes, anaglyph stereo imaging, and rapid prototyping methods
   routinely used in the engineering, entertainment, or medical industries
   are outlined and evaluated for their potential in science publishing and
   public engagement. Although limitations remain, these are simple, mostly
   cost-effective, and powerful tools to create novel and innovative
   resources for education, public engagement, or outreach.}},

Abstract = {{Ankara, the capital of Turkey is situated in the middle of Anatolia. The
   center of Ankara is an important commercial area and a pedestrian
   shopping center. A main road, Ataturk Boulevard, bisects the central
   area of the city and this street contains a variety of building types
   which reflect the identity of the city. However in recent years, the
   urban environment of this street has been affected by the urban sprawl
   and visual pollution. This paper presents an innovative approach to a
   project that aims to re-design and renovate the existing building
   facades in the Boulevard in harmony with the existing environment. The
   project uses high resolution digital camera images from a calibrated
   digital camera and uses a digital close-range photogrammetry technique
   with integrated geographical information systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Computer visualisations are widely used to evaluate future urban
   environments in international competitions. Rapid technological progress
   in graphics computer software has enabled architects and landscape
   planners to produce sophisticated images that are not only capable of
   transmitting the characteristics of the future environment, they also
   manage to evoke in observers the sort of feelings and emotions which can
   only be aroused by experiencing the space. This present paper attempts
   to identify the affective responses that influence the evaluation of
   urban environment proposal, analysing the model of architects and
   non-architects's preferences. A sample of 104 architects and 113
   non-architects expressed their opinions on 48 urban computer
   simulations. The results show that for both groups the success of a
   digital visualisation is associated to the feelings of innovation and
   wellbeing. However, their assessments differ significantly because each
   group associates these feelings with different aspects. In general,
   architects are more critical in their assessments. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The paper describes an innovative technique to implement a low-power
   high-speed CMOS interface circuit for differential capacitive sensors.
   The proposed approach comprises a capacitance to current converter
   providing current-summing and current-differencing capability. It also
   exploits an autotuning feedback loop to control the common-mode current,
   thereby ensuring virtually the same maximum sensitivity and measure
   accuracy ir-respectively of the input parasitic capacitance. Therefore,
   the main limitation of all previous current-mode techniques is nearly
   eliminated. Besides, as an additional distinctive aspect, the proposed
   solution is suitable for both linear-and hyperbolic-type capacitive
   sensors. To validate the idea an interface circuit was designed in a
   65-nm CMOS technology powered from a 2.5-V supply and dissipating 88-mu
   A standby current. Measurements show that relative capacitive sensor
   variations up to +/- 900 fF (+/- 100\% of the nominal value) even in
   presence of a large parasitic capacitance of 2.5 pF are detected in less
   than 1 mu s with a sensitivity of about 5 nA/fF and with an relative
   error lower than +/- 1.5\%, without requiring digital calibration.}},

Abstract = {{Technological developments in newborn and population screening,
   biomarker discovery for monitoring treatment and rapid high throughput
   DNA sequencing are having a great impact on the diagnostic procedure for
   symptomatic patients with lysosomal storage diseases. The use of dried
   blood spots, initially for newborn screening, has stimulated the
   introduction of automated, rapid and more sensitive methods for the
   assay of lysosomal enzymes, including the synthesis of novel substrates.
   Storage products and secondary metabolites in urine and cells can be
   identified and measured very accurately and sensitively by high
   performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. This has
   enhanced the preliminary metabolite screen for LSDs and facilitated the
   diagnosis of transport defects. Fast, reliable and affordable high
   throughput DNA sequencing, such as whole or selected exome sequencing,
   is helping to make diagnoses in difficult cases, to reveal novel gene
   defects, to widen the clinical spectrum of diseases and possibly to
   identify modifying genetic factors. Bioinformatics will be necessary to
   handle the data generated by these new technologies. Notwithstanding,
   these technical innovations, accurate and reliable diagnosis will still
   depend on the knowledge and experience of skilled laboratory staff.}},

Abstract = {{While research has shown that investments in IT capability may translate
   into improved firm performance, how and why they do is still a source of
   debate. Drawing on financial options thinking, recent research suggests
   that managers can support appropriate investment decisions by examining
   digital options. However, current research has not effectively
   translated the financial options construct into the IT domain, which
   makes it difficult to rigorously examine digital options. To address
   this void, we revisit general options theory and review current notions
   of digital options. To support understanding, we extend current
   theorizing by offering a rigorous conceptual foundation that defines the
   digital option lifecycle and relationships to neighboring constructs. To
   support practice, we present principles for examining digital options
   for a specific business process. To illustrate the detailed workings of
   the theory, we examine a production planning process in the dairy
   industry to arrive at a set of desirable and feasible IT capability
   investments. Our proposed theory supports managerial practice by
   offering a rigorous and actionable foundation for digital options
   thinking. It also sets an agenda for academic research by articulating
   theory-based constructs and principles that are subject to further
   empirical and theoretical investigation.}},

   textual analysis of Facebook's page of the Student Federation of the
   University of Chile (FECH). In 2011, Chile experienced massive
   mobilizations for seven months. These were perhaps the most important
   social protests in Chile's recent history, where young people played a
   leading role in the discussion over education. During these events,
   Facebook was one of the digital social networks most widely used by the
   mobilized organizations. In FECH's case, it utilized Facebook mainly to
   call for protest actions, to highlight the achievements of the movement,
   and to indicate their opponents. However, most of the content published
   on this Facebook page was produced by traditional media, showing that
   conventional communication strategies of social movements are
   interrelated with new innovative practices. Therefore, this article
   rejects technological determinism, because it does not recognize the
   complex characteristics of student and youth movements.}},

Abstract = {{As media education concepts and practices have been disseminated and
   strengthened in European countries and Americas, the policies
   responsible for that expansion remain little known, particularly in
   countries where the achievements have been recently noted. That is the
   case for Brazil, where there have been new opportunities for media
   education, considered as a valuable resource to help accomplish goals of
   the educational system. This paper looks into the contribution of media
   education to the enhancement of teaching and learning in the context of
   innovations brought by recent policies of the Brazilian Ministry of
   Education. After educational reform programmes which brought the
   opportunity for emerging fields such as media education, we produced
   teaching material and conducted a series of workshops with students and
   teachers from state secondary schools. By reading and producing
   multimedia information about local public services available to young
   people, pupils learned about democracy, citizenship, civic engagement,
   media language, and identity. Lessons from our experiment are discussed
   against the backdrop of education policies being implemented to
   ameliorate harsh conditions resulting from the recent economic crisis.
   We suggest that media education can help by creating a learning
   environment in which the students become aware of the value of
   educational attainments.}},

Abstract = {{The growth and integration of ICTs in the global economy have created
   conditions that profoundly affect our society, dividing communities
   between those who effectively appropriate these resources and those who
   do not, what is called the digital divide. This exploratory study seeks
   to propose and validate ways of assessing this phenomenon in higher
   education, from the construction of a model and a comprehensive
   methodology that value contextual conditions, in addition to measuring
   access factors and motivation for use, that have been employed in
   previous research. To obtain indications about the behavior of this
   phenomenon, we developed research with students from three universities
   in Bogota, administering 566 surveys in four phases that would test the
   variables proposed in the model. The results show that the variables of
   the model link causally, with the strongest relations between education,
   attitude towards ICTs and ICT application. Although students have good
   access to ICTs and high levels of education, no strong relationship was
   found in regards to perceived impact on production. This may be
   explained by a superficial appropriation of ICT, due to a context that
   is alien to its conditions of origin (industrialism, innovation), poor
   quality of education and economies not centered around R\&D.}},

Abstract = {{We report a digital microfluidic system designed for droplet-based
   long-term culture and analysis of algae. The system includes unique
   innovations relative to standard devices including an active reservoir
   structure to maintain homogeneous cell density, a customized device
   layout capable of controlling a wide range of different droplet volumes,
   vertical interconnects to collect spent reagents, detection zones
   compatible with parallel-scale optical measurements using a standard
   multiwell plate reader, and optimized features for droplet dispensing in
   parallel. The method allows for automated, multiplexed analysis with
   significant reductions in human intervention, representing a decrease
   from 600 pipette steps (for a conventional screen in multiwell plates)
   to fewer than 20 (for the new microfluidic technique). The system was
   applied to screen conditions favourable for lipid generation in the
   widely used algal model for biofuel production, Cyclotella cryptica. A
   dependence on illumination wavelength was observed, with the best
   conditions (representing a four-fold increase relative to control)
   comprising an alternation between yellow (similar to 580 nm) and blue
   (similar to 450 nm) illumination wavelengths. These effects were
   observed for both micro- and macro-scale cultures, and are consistent
   with a putative mechanism involving photooxidative stress. We propose
   that the microfluidic system described here is an attractive new
   screening tool with potential advantages for applications in renewable
   energy, biotechnology, materials science, and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To describe novel innovations and techniques for the
   detection of high-grade dysplasia.
   Materials and Methods. Studies were identified through the PubMed
   database, spanning the last 10 years. The key words ({[}{''}computerized
   colposcopy{''} or ``digital colposcopy{''} or ``spectroscopy{''} or
   ``multispectral digital colposcopy{''} or ``dynamic spectral
   imaging{''}, or ``electrical impedance spectroscopy{''} or ``confocal
   endomicroscopy{''} or ``confocal microscopy{''} or ``optical coherence
   tomography{''}] and {[}{''}cervical dysplasia{''} or cervical
   precancer{''} or ``cervix{''} or ``cervical{''}]) were used. The
   inclusion criteria were published articles of original research
   referring to noncolposcopic evaluation of the cervix for the detection
   of cervical dysplasia. Only English-language articles from the past 10
   years were included, in which the technologies were used in vivo, and
   sensitivities and specificities could be calculated.
   Results. The single author reviewed the articles for inclusion. Primary
   search of the database yielded 59 articles, and secondary
   cross-reference yielded 12 articles. Thirty-two articles met the
   inclusion criteria.
   Conclusions. An instrument that globally assesses the cervix, such as
   computer-assisted colposcopy, optical spectroscopy, and dynamic spectral
   imaging, would provided the most comprehensive estimate of disease and
   is therefore best suited when treatment is preferred. Electrical
   impedance spectroscopy, confocal microscopy, and optical coherence
   tomography provide information at the cellular level to estimate
   histology and are therefore best suited when deferment of treatment is
   preferred. If a device is to eventually replace the colposcope, it will
   likely combine technologies to best meet the needs of the target
   population, and as such, no single instrument may prove to be
   universally appropriate. Analyses of false-positive rates, additional
   colposcopies and biopsies, cost, and absolute life-savings will be
   important when considering these technologies and are limited thus far.}},

Abstract = {{We review the contributions to this Special Issue that highlight the
   diverse ways in which memory takes place that go beyond the standard
   personal autobiographical memory and its reliance on internal imagery.
   We look at how contributors explore a highly individual memory of trauma
   and re-consider it as a complex, socially contested phenomenon. We next
   turn to a discussion of shared memory within dyads and then look at a
   contribution that examines bodily and gestural alignment during shared
   recollection among group members and/or families. From there,
   contributors raise considerations of collective memory in
   prisoner-of-war survivors and among football fans attending a World Cup
   event. The next contribution illustrates how collective forgetting
   creates social bonds in a similar manner to collective remembering.
   Finally, we show how the boundaries of memory are being stretched by
   digital technology through its influence on how we recall and share
   memories. Methodological innovations are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Mental rotation is an important spatial processing ability and an
   important element in intelligence tests. However, the majority of past
   attempts at training mental rotation have used paper-and-pencil tests or
   digital images. This study proposes an innovative mental rotation
   training approach using magnetic motion controllers to allow learners to
   manipulate and interact with three-dimensional (3D) objects.
   Stereovision allows learners to perceive the spatial geometric form of a
   3D object. This approach allows learners to perceive 3D objects in space
   through stereovision and make mental rotation visible from each
   intrinsic and invisible mental rotation step using motion-interaction
   methods. This study examines the effects of user training performance
   and perceptions. The results indicate that the proposed approach can
   improve user mental rotation ability effectively. Learners expressed
   high degrees of concentration toward the mechanism that included direct
   control and immediate feedback. The results also suggest that female
   testers perceive greater degrees of playfulness toward the mechanism and
   improve more through training than male testers.}},

Abstract = {{Critical thinking (CT) and English literacy are two essential 21st
   century competencies that are a priority for teaching and learning in an
   increasingly digital learning environment. Taking advantage of
   innovations in educational technology, this study empirically
   investigates the effectiveness of CT-infused adaptive English literacy
   instruction using a Moodle system. A one-group pretest-posttest design
   was employed to evaluate the effect of the treatment on students'
   acquisition of CT skills (CTS) and English literacy. A total of 83
   students enrolled in two sections of a general studies course at a large
   university in Taiwan participated in the semester-long experiment.
   Adaptive learning was achieved through the use of an online Moodle
   system for (1) online grouping (based on pretest English literacy
   scores), (2) delivery of specifically designed adaptive learning
   materials for each group and (3) provision of individualised feedback.
   CT-infused language activities based on social constructivist principles
   were designed for each level of adaptive instruction, whereas direct
   instruction for fostering CTS was provided in class and practiced or
   reflected upon in groups. Empirical results demonstrate that CT-enhanced
   adaptive English literacy instruction simultaneously improved students'
   CTS and English literacy and that students' online discussions developed
   towards higher levels of interaction. This paper illustrates an
   effective blended learning model for adaptive instruction and offers
   recommendations for designing CT-infused language learning activities
   that can successfully foster both CT and English literacy outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Internet has become a major source for disseminating
   educational resources for science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM), little is known about the extent to which these
   resources are being used, their relationship to academic performance,
   and the type of users accessing these resources online. This study used
   two innovative tools, Google Trends and Web analytics, to explore
   interest in and usage of the PhET website, one of the most well-known
   online science simulation resources. This study found that search
   interest in the PhET science simulations has been growing continuously
   since 2005. However, search interest in PhET was positively correlated
   with academic performance and income, and negatively correlated with the
   achievement gap between high- and low-performing students. Moreover,
   Internet users in states with more White students were more interested
   in the PhET science simulations. Yet Internet users in states with more
   Black students were less interested in these science simulations. These
   findings suggest that the way online STEM resources are being used is
   likely to widen, rather than narrow, the achievement gap. This is the
   first study to utilize Internet search trend data and Web analytics
   tools for monitoring Internet use for educational purposes. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This article describes the design and implementation of the Pure Land
   projects, consisting of two visualization systems and their respective
   applications, Pure Land: Inside the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang {[}2012]
   and Pure Land Augmented Reality Edition {[}2012]. Each installation
   allows participants to engage in different ways with a full-scale
   augmented digital facsimile of Cave 220 from the UNESCO World Heritage
   site of the Mogao Grottoes, Gansu Province, northwestern China. This
   project is a collaboration between the Applied Laboratory for
   Interactive Visualization and Embodiment (ALiVE), City University of
   Hong Kong, and the Dunhuang Academy. In the Pure Land projects, the
   digital facsimiles of this cultural paragon have been transformed,
   providing formative personal experiences for museum visitors. The
   projects integrate high-resolution digital archeological datasets
   (photography and 3D architectural models) with immersive, interactive
   display systems. This work is of great importance because the treasuries
   of paintings and sculptures at Dunhuang are extremely vulnerable to
   human presence and, in the case of Cave 220, permanently closed to
   public visitors. Comprehensive digitization has become a primary method
   of preservation at the site. Both installations have been shown to the
   public at a variety of museums and galleries worldwide-to critical
   acclaim. The projects contribute to new strategies for rendering
   cultural content and heritage landscapes and suggest the future for
   embodied museography. Here, each project is described in detail,
   including innovations in interface technological application and user
   experience.}},

Title = {{Staggered SAR: High-Resolution Wide-Swath Imaging by Continuous PRI
   Variation}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a remote sensing technique, capable of
   providing high-resolution images independent of weather conditions and
   sunlight illumination. This makes SAR very attractive for the systematic
   observation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface. However,
   conventional SAR systems are limited in that a wide swath can only be
   achieved at the expense of a degraded azimuth resolution. This
   limitation can be overcome by using systems with multiple receive
   apertures, displaced in along track, but a very long antenna is required
   to map a wide swath. If a relatively short antenna with a single
   aperture in along track is available, it is still possible to map a wide
   area: Multiple swaths can be, in fact, simultaneously imaged using
   digital beamforming in elevation, but ``blind ranges{''} are present
   between adjacent swaths. This paper considers an innovative concept,
   staggered SAR, where the pulse repetition interval (PRI) is continuously
   varied. This concept allows the imaging of a wide continuous swath
   without the need for a long antenna with multiple apertures. The choice
   of the sequence of PRIs and the preprocessing of the raw data are
   discussed in detail, showing how the staggered SAR is even less affected
   by ambiguities of pointlike or extended targets with respect to a system
   with constant PRI, which simultaneously maps multiple swaths. Some
   system design examples are finally presented and compared.}},

Abstract = {{Effective clinical treatments for volumetric muscle loss resulting from
   traumatic injury or resection of a large amount of muscle mass are not
   available to date. Tissue engineering may represent an alternative
   treatment approach. Decellularization of tissues and whole organs is a
   recently introduced platform technology for creating scaffolding
   materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The muscle
   stem cell niche is composed of a three-dimensional architecture of
   fibrous proteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, synthesized by
   the resident cells that form an intricate extracellular matrix (ECM)
   network in equilibrium with the surrounding cells and growth factors. A
   consistent body of evidence indicates that ECM proteins regulate stem
   cell differentiation and renewal and are highly relevant to tissue
   engineering applications. The ECM also provides a supportive medium for
   blood or lymphatic vessels and for nerves. Thus, the ECM is the nature's
   ideal biological scaffold material. ECM-based bioscaffolds can be
   recellularized to create potentially functional constructs as a
   regenerative medicine strategy for organ replacement or tissue
   repopulation. This article reviews current strategies for the repair of
   damaged muscle using bioscaffolds obtained from animal ECM by
   decellularization of small intestinal submucosa (SIS), urinary bladder
   mucosa (UB), and skeletal muscle, and proposes some innovative
   approaches for the application of such strategies in the clinical
   setting.}},

Abstract = {{Managing social-ecological systems and human well being in a sustainable
   way requires knowledge of these systems in their full complexity.
   Multi-loop social learning is recognized as a crucial element to
   sustainable decision-making for land and water resources management
   involving a process of managing change where the central methodological
   concern is with effectively engaging the necessary participation of
   system members in contributing to the collective knowledge of the
   system. Ensuring the inclusion of the community of concern may help to
   ensure robust knowledge, the necessary plurality of views,
   responsibility sharing and trust enhancement. This will also provide
   more dynamic lines of input to problem solving: local and changing forms
   of knowledge, emerging concerns and constraints all feed into an ongoing
   decision-making process. This conceptual paper is focused specifically
   on identifying the key drivers and conditions that facilitate multi-loop
   social learning and the untapped potential of virtual learning platforms
   in this context. The hyper-connectivity that characterizes digitally
   mediated networks opens up significant possibilities for information
   exchange, knowledge creation, feedback, debate, learning and innovation,
   social networking, and so on. This paper provides a thorough literature
   review of the conditions and affordances that are conducive to
   multi-loop social learning in the context of sustainable land and water
   governance. The insights from this review confirm the potential of a
   `learning ecology' or virtual learning platform for knowledge
   co-production, trust building, sense making, critical self-reflection,
   vertical and horizontal collaboration, and conflict resolution, while
   serving as a facilitating platform between different levels of
   governance, and across resource and knowledge systems. To conclude this
   paper, a developmental research agenda is proposed to refine and improve
   understanding of multi-loop social learning processes and their
   effective facilitation through virtual learning platforms. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{An optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD), which enables
   optical superposition of digital information onto the direct view of the
   physical world and maintains see-through vision to the real world, is a
   vital component in an augmented reality (AR) system. A key limitation of
   the state-of-the-art OST-HMD technology is the well-known
   accommodation-convergence mismatch problem caused by the fact that the
   image source in most of the existing AR displays is a 2D flat surface
   located at a fixed distance from the eye. In this paper, we present an
   innovative approach to OST-HMD designs by combining the recent
   advancement of freeform optical technology and microscopic integral
   imaging (micro-InI) method. A micro-InI unit creates a 3D image source
   for HMD viewing optics, instead of a typical 2D display surface, by
   reconstructing a miniature 3D scene from a large number of perspective
   images of the scene. By taking advantage of the emerging freeform
   optical technology, our approach will result in compact, lightweight,
   goggle-style AR display that is potentially less vulnerable to the
   accommodation-convergence discrepancy problem and visual fatigue. A
   proof-of-concept prototype system is demonstrated, which offers a
   goggle-like compact form factor, non-obstructive see-through field of
   view, and true 3D virtual display. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The 50-year march of Moore's Law has led to the creation of a relatively
   cheap and increasingly easy-to-use world-wide digital infrastructure of
   computers, mobile devices, broadband network connections, and advanced
   application platforms. This digital infrastructure has, in turn,
   accelerated the emergence of new technologies that enable
   transformations in how we live and work, how companies organize, and the
   structure of entire industries.
   As a result, it has become important for all business students to have a
   strong grounding in IT and digital innovation in order to manage, lead,
   and transform organizations that are increasingly dependent on digital
   innovation. Yet, at many schools, students do not get such grounding
   because the required information systems core class is stuck in the
   past. We present a vision for a redesigned IS core class that adopts
   digital innovation as a fundamental and powerful concept (FPC). A good
   FPC serves as both a foundational concept and an organizing principle
   for a course.
   We espouse a particularly broad conceptualization of digital innovation
   that allows for a variety of teaching styles and topical emphases for
   the IS core class. This conceptualization includes three types of
   innovation (i.e., process, product, and business model innovation), and
   four stages for the overall innovation process (i.e., discovery,
   development, diffusion, and impact). Based on this conceptualization, we
   examine the implications of adopting digital innovation as an FPC. We
   also briefly discuss broader implications relating to (1) the IS
   curriculum beyond the core class, (2) the research agenda for the IS
   field, and (3) the identity and legitimacy of IS in business schools.}},

Abstract = {{Online crowdsourcing markets (OCM) are becoming more popular as a source
   for data collection. In this paper, we examine the consistency of survey
   results across student samples, consumer panels, and online
   crowdsourcing markets (specifically Amazon's Mechanical Turk) both
   within the United States and outside. We conduct two studies examining
   the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the
   expectation-disconfirmation theory (EDT) to explore potential
   differences in demographics, psychometrics, structural model estimates,
   and measurement invariances. Our findings indicate that (1) U.S.-based
   OCM samples provide demographics much more similar to our student and
   consumer panel samples than the non-U.S.-based OCM samples; (2) both
   U.S. and non-U.S. OCM samples provide initial psychometric properties
   (reliability, convergent, and divergent validity) that are similar to
   those of both student and consumer panels; (3) non-U.S. OCM samples
   generally provide differences in scale means compared to those of our
   students, consumer panels, and U.S. OCM samples; and (4) one of the
   non-U.S. OCM samples refuted the highly replicated and validated TAM
   model in the relationship of perceived usefulness to behavioral
   intentions. Although our post hoc analyses isolated some cultural and
   demographic effects with regard to the non-U.S. samples in Study 1, they
   did not address the model differences found in Study 2. Specifically,
   the inclusion of non-U.S. OCM respondents led to statistically
   significant differences in parameter estimates, and hence to different
   statistical conclusions. Due to these unexplained differences that exist
   within the non-U.S. OCM samples, we caution that the inclusion of
   non-U.S. OCM participants may lead to different conclusions than studies
   with only U.S. OCM participants. We are unable to conclude whether this
   is due to of cultural differences, differences in the demographic
   profiles of non-U.S. OCM participants, or some unexplored factors within
   the models. Therefore, until further research is conducted to explore
   these differences in detail, we urge researchers utilizing OCMs with the
   intention to generalize to U.S. populations focus on U.S.-based
   participants and exercise caution in using non-U.S. participants. We
   further recommend that researchers should clearly describe their OCM
   usage and design (e. g., demographics, participant filters, etc.)
   procedures. Overall, we find that U.S. OCM samples produced models that
   lead to similar statistical conclusions as both U.S. students and U.S.
   consumer panels at a considerably reduced cost.}},

Abstract = {{The academic literature on the prize system describes prizes as a
   radical alternative to intellectual property. The debate over which
   system is preferable has existed for centuries and usually boils down to
   a single question: Can the government determine the appropriate reward
   for innovations without relying on intellectual property rights to
   reveal their value to consumers? If yes, scholars assume that prizes are
   superior because they avoid deadweight loss and provide equal or better
   incentives for innovation. This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding
   of the nature of intellectual property rights. It equates intellectual
   property with uniform monopoly pricing and monopoly profits, while
   depicting the prize system as the only effective strategy to achieve
   efficient consumer pricing and government control over rewards. In
   reality, intellectual property merely provides a right to exclude others
   from the market. Governments can and often do institute policies that
   resemble prize systems in both their structure and objectives alongside
   intellectual property systems. Governments use subsidies (and sometimes
   price controls) to push consumer prices closer to marginal cost and
   adjust the incentives for innovation. Given these other policy levers
   available within an intellectual property regime, the existing prize
   literature has exaggerated and misconceived the differences between the
   two systems. Under many circumstances, the prize system has no advantage
   over intellectual property in terms of avoiding deadweight loss.
   Moreover, intellectual property will frequently offer superior
   incentives to prizes irrespective of whether it is used to measure an
   invention's value to consumers because it provides an ongoing check
   against expropriation, thereby permitting renegotiation of rewards over
   time to reflect changing estimations of an invention's social value.
   Contrary to the long-standing framework used to compare the two systems,
   intellectual property may be superior to prizes even when the government
   can determine the appropriate reward for innovations.}},

Abstract = {{In the light of different studies carried out at European and national
   level, it is unclear if the use of Information Society Technologies
   (ISTs) in the teaching-learning process is fulfilling initial
   expectations. Considering that teachers are the keystone upon which the
   required transformation is to be built, we consider the following
   questions: are teachers digitally illiterate? Do they have other reasons
   for not integrating ISTs in their classrooms? This research consists of
   a descriptive study of the teaching staff in the Autonomous City of
   Melilla. An ad hoc questionnaire was designed and administered to the
   pre-university teachers of the city. A sample of 173 teachers from the
   different stages of non-university level was obtained. After carrying
   out a descriptive and inferential analysis of the data obtained, a
   certain level of digital illiteracy among teachers was found, mainly in
   the didactic application of ISTs. Some solutions are given for teachers
   to improve their digital literacy to face the demands of 21st century
   society.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative approach for security-enhanced optical stealth
   transmission in a synchronous digital hierarchy network is proposed and
   experimentally investigated. The security enhancement is achieved
   through a signal modulation format, so-called
   polarization-modulated-code-shift-keying, which is implemented with two
   superstructured fiber Bragg gratings-based optical-code-division
   multiple-access encoders and a polarization modulator. The proposed
   modulation format can provide a constant energy level for both bits 0's
   and 1's, which avoids secure vulnerability of single-stealth-user with
   on-off-keying modulation before coupling into the host channel and after
   the cascade of filters. Moreover, a self-made cost-effective
   gain-switched distributed feedback laser with relatively narrow spectrum
   is first employed as a stealth optical source, which greatly reduces the
   system cost and complexity. The stealth signal is recovered and detected
   asynchronously. The experimental results show high secure performance
   and robustness against eavesdropping, while keeping a bit error rate
   below forward error correction limit. (c) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Introduction. A legislative mandate to adopt digital textbooks in
   Florida provides an opportunity to identify concerns school librarians
   have regarding digital textbook implementation.
   Method. The stages of concern questionnaire was used to identify stages
   of concern among Florida school librarians about their potential role in
   this implementation.
   Analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and
   the distribution of responses to each question. Questions were separated
   into seven separate stages, with key differences analysed using the
   stages of concern profiles and the analysis of variance test.
   Results. Results indicate that participants conform to the non-user
   profile, which has higher unconcerned (Stage 0), informational concerns
   (Stage 1) and personal concerns (Stage 2). It is also found that school
   librarians' restrictive schedules and heavy workloads prevent them from
   studying new innovations - in particular digital textbooks. Intensified
   personal concerns (Stage 2) suggest potential resistance to digital
   textbooks.
   Conclusions. These findings could provide librarians as educators an
   opportunity to establish more interest in digital textbooks and to
   discuss those textbooks' impact on teaching and learning. More broadly,
   the findings can provide some implications and recommendations to help
   educational policy makers and school administrators identify issues
   related to expanding digital textbooks.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a converged broadcast and broadband platform in
   order to deliver 3D media to both mobile and fixed users with guaranteed
   minimum quality of experience (QoE). The work presented offers an ideal
   business model for operators having both digital video broadcast and
   Internet Protocol (IP)-based media services. To that end, the DVB and
   peer-to-peer Internet technologies will be combined to provide
   sufficient resources for supporting high-bandwidth high-quality 3D
   multiview video. The motivations behind combining these technologies are
   outlined with an emphasis on their complementary characteristics. In
   addition, the overall design of the proposed architecture is presented
   focusing on the protocols that are exploited to achieve the interworking
   of the underlying technologies. Moreover, innovative key techniques for
   supporting both fixed and mobile users in an efficient manner are
   introduced.}},

Title = {{How advanced are Italian regions in terms of public e-services? The
   construction of a composite indicator to analyze patterns of innovation
   diffusion in the public sector}},

Abstract = {{This paper applies an open and transparent methodology to construct a
   composite indicator for the analysis of the diffusion of ICT in the
   public sector and the development of public e-services across Italian
   regions. This methodology, based on OECD/EC-JRC Handbook and
   incorporating experts' opinion into a Data Envelopment Analysis, will
   allow us to define a ranking of Italian regions in terms of ICT adoption
   and of e-service development. Data are obtained by merging four
   different surveys carried out by Between Co. (2010-2011) and Istat -
   Italy's National Bureau of Statistics (2009). We add to extant empirical
   literature in three ways. First, we offer a comprehensive measurement of
   advances in digital government that is not circumscribed to a single
   domain (e.g. administrative procedures of public administrations) but is
   rather aimed to capture a wide spectrum of public e-services
   (e-government, e-education, Intelligent Transport Systems, e-health).
   Second, we tackle a major drawback of existing statistics and
   benchmarking studies which are largely based on the count of services
   provided online, by including more sophisticated indicators on the
   quality of services offered and on back office changes. The results -
   both in terms of scores and regional rankings - highlight the presence
   of different patterns of adoption and use of public e-services at the
   local level. Third, we offer a rich account of the extreme heterogeneity
   of public e-service development and of the underlying technological and
   organizational change at the sub-national level, and hence provide a
   basis for the differentiating policy measures across regions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The ambitious goals of the European ``Digital Agenda{''} need active
   involvement by regional innovation systems. Effective regional ``digital
   strategies{''} should be both consistent with the European framework and
   based on available evidence on the needs and opportunities of local
   contexts. Such evidence should be used to balance the different
   components of the Information Society development (e.g. eServices vs.
   infrastructures; ICT supply and demand), so as to ensure that they can
   all unleash their full potential. Therefore, EU regions should spend
   more money to overcome regional weaknesses than to improve existing
   assets. In this paper we explore the different strategies of the EU's
   lagging regions through the analysis of the allocation of 2007-13
   Structural Funds. Then, we verify whether such strategies respond to
   territorial conditions by comparing strategic choices made with the
   actual characteristics of local contexts. Results show that EU regions
   tend to invest more resources in those aspects in which they already
   demonstrate good relative performances. Possible causes of this
   unbalanced strategic approach are discussed, including the lack of sound
   analysis of the regional context and the path dependence of policy
   choices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of lidar (light detection and ranging) 3-D photorealistic
   outcrop models, combined with traditional sedimentological and
   structural fi eld data, improves the accuracy and effi ciency of
   qualitative and quantitative characterization of outcrops, which in turn
   can be used as analogs for reservoir modeling and other geologic
   purposes. This paper illustrates how geological data extraction from 3-D
   photorealistic outcrop models can be exploited, and presents some novel
   workfl ows that reduce the time needed for postprocessing. The extracted
   data are calibrated with conventional outcrop studies and allow
   extensive quantitative analyses and detailed statistical examinations of
   the distribution, dimension, and shape of geological features that can
   be used to defi ne and build geological models. We present the fi rst
   statistical characterization based on lidar of a set of geological
   outcrops at centimeter resolution (bed scale) over a distance of 45 km
   (basin scale). These innovative methods of outcrop visualization and
   characterization are applied to the Eagle Ford Formation, an important
   unconventional hydrocarbon play in Texas. The Eagle Ford Formation
   consists of alternating organic-rich mudstone, limestone, and
   bentonites; mudstones represent the source and reservoir of the
   hydrocarbons, limestones control the rock's brittleness, and bentonites
   provide time lines for dating and correlating sections. The presented
   analyses provide empirical relationships that can be applied to better
   understand geologic processes, to build geologic models, and to reduce
   uncertainties in exploration and development of hydrocarbon systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes how labor market factors have shaped early returns
   on big data investment using a new data source-the LinkedIn skills
   database. The data source enables firm-level measurement of the
   employment of workers with technical skills such as Hadoop, MapReduce,
   and Apache Pig. From 2006 to 2011, Hadoop investments were associated
   with 3\% faster productivity growth, but only for firms (a) with
   significant data assets and (b) in labor markets where similar
   investments by other firms helped to facilitate the development of a
   cadre of workers with complementary technical skills. The benefits of
   labor market concentration decline for investments in mature data
   technologies, such as Structured Query Language-based databases, for
   which the complementary skills can be acquired by workers through
   universities or other channels. These findings underscore the importance
   of geography, corporate investment, and skill acquisition channels for
   explaining productivity growth differences during the spread of new
   information technology innovations.}},

Abstract = {{For 150 years, fair use was a solely American doctrine. But in the 1990s
   and 2000s, the Philippines, Israel, and South Korea all adopted
   American-style fair use. Since then, debates have erupted over whether
   or not to introduce fair use into the copyright laws of a half dozen
   additional countries, including the Netherlands, Canada, the United
   Kingdom, Japan, and Australia. Why is fair use going global? What do
   innovators, scholars, and legislators see in the fair use doctrine? And
   what is tipping the scale in favor of or against fair use? We don't yet
   know whether the global fair use movement will fizzle out or take over
   world intellectual property regimes. But looking at the debates over the
   global spread of fair use, even at this early stage, tells us a lot
   about digital media's challenge to the regulation of both technological
   innovation and online expression.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we use a mixed-methods engineering approach to analyze how
   traditional retailers can use mobile commerce services to enable
   data-driven marketing and thus compete with the pervasive end-customer
   ownership of companies controlling the mobile channel. The paper
   provides the first systematic analysis of the implications of the
   virtual world market players Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay/PayPal, and
   Amazon on traditional retailers' business. We use case study research to
   identify the elements that are required for and suitable to such a
   strategy. In a second step, we use design science in order to identify
   and develop the necessary value creation roles, their activities, and
   the value flows between them. The paper provides two major outcomes: (1)
   a set of 12 building blocks for generating and applying customer data
   for traditional retailers adding mobile services and (2) a role-based
   reference model for the value network of the future retail customer
   interface and marketing (CIM). The reference model is validated with
   expert interviews. As an exemplary application of the model, we show two
   extreme scenarios with strong and weak retailer market positions. As an
   additional contribution to practice, we present a further introspective
   analysis of the value network's key new role-that of mobile customer
   relationship management service provider-and propose a corresponding
   functional component architecture that fulfills the information
   technology requirements for the role's complex functionality.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional tissue platforms are rapidly becoming the method of
   choice for quantification of the heterogeneity of cell populations for
   many diagnostic and drug therapy applications. Microfluidic sensors and
   the integration of sensors with microfluidic systems are often described
   as miniature versions of their macro-scale counterparts. This technology
   presents unique advantages for handling costly and difficult-to-obtain
   samples and reagents as a typical system requires between 100 nL to 10
   mu L of working fluid. The fabrication of a fully functional cell-based
   biosensor utilizes both biological patterning and microfabrication
   techniques. A digital micro-mirror (photolithographic) system is
   initiated to construct the tissue platform while a cell printer is used
   to precisely embed the cells within the construct. Tissue construct
   developed with these technologies will provide an early diagnostic of a
   drug's potential use. A three-dimensional interconnected microfluidic
   environment has the potential to eliminate the limitations of the
   traditional mainstays of two-dimensional investigations. This paper
   illustrates an economical and an innovative approach of fabricating a
   three-dimensional cell-laden microfluidic chip for detecting drug
   metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an energy-efficient SAR ADC for ultra-low power
   applications. The asynchronous 2 b/step scheme halves both conversion
   time and DAC/digital circuit's switching activities and hence likewise
   reduces static and dynamic energy consumption. A low-power sleep mode is
   engaged at the end of each clock period. The technical contributions of
   this work include: 1) an innovative 2 b/step reference scheme based on a
   hybrid R-2R/C-3C DAC to minimize DAC hardware, 2) an
   interpolation-assisted time-domain 2 b comparison scheme that saves 33\%
   in comparator circuitry, and 3) a dual-edge-comparison mechanism that
   reduces the time-domain comparator's (TDC) switching activities by 50\%.
   All these techniques help reduce circuit overhead and overall energy
   consumption. The prototype ADC was fabricated in 180 nm CMOS process
   with an active area of 0.103 mm(2). With a single 0.6 V supply and
   reference, the ADC achieves an ENoB of 9.2 bits and a FoM of 6.7
   fJ/conversion-step while sampling at 100-kS/s.}},

Abstract = {{Tablet PCs, netbooks, and smart phones are similar to one another in
   that they possess the basic functions of computers, but they differ in
   what functions they emphasize. Rogers' diffusion of innovation model has
   been widely recognized as a powerful model for predicting technology
   adoption. This study adopted Rogers' model to examine the adoption
   intentions of the three new types of computers. A telephone survey was
   conducted to collect data. This study made 1757 telephone calls, from
   which 1100 valid calls were obtained, representing a response rate of
   62.61\%. The data analysis demonstrates that the findings are generally
   congruent with the predictions of Rogers' model. However, this study's
   results also reveal one limitation of Rogers' model, its pro-innovation
   bias, which explains why the diffusion of netbooks was incongruent with
   Rogers' model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two innovative methods for tunnel monitoring that
   are based on digital photogrammetry. Both have been conceived to speed
   up operations that are currently accomplished by using engineering
   geodesy techniques and instruments. On the same time, proposed solutions
   are cheap and affordable. The first one is aimed at measuring relative
   deformations of transversal cross-section of tunnels. Some special
   targets are placed on the tunnel vault and their coordinates are
   measured by means of a small photogrammetric block made up of four
   images. A wire is used to setup the scale and to make all measurements
   comparable overtime. The second method can be applied for the
   measurement of vertical deformations along the longitudinal profile of
   tunnels. A new image-based approach called `photogrammetric levelling'
   is discussed here, which is based on the metric rectification of each
   single image depicting a couple of special rods to be hung on levelling
   benchmarks. This technique can be used to replace traditional optical
   and digital level instruments. Both applications can be carried out by
   using a calibrated amateur camera. Some experiments in controlled and
   real environments allowed assessing performances and limitations of
   these techniques for operational surveys in tunnel monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Multiscale analysis of high resolution total magnetic intensity (TMI)
   aeromagnetic data over a regional scale is investigated to delineate
   structural framework suitable for groundwater exploration in an arid
   region of South Australia. An innovative workflow in processing TMI data
   is designed, which aids in the multiscale analysis of TMI data in tilt
   angle domain. The rationale in considering multiscale analysis in the
   tilt angle domain is discussed in the paper. Each processing module of
   the workflow of multiscale analysis has been analyzed and the interim
   output in each processing step is used in the image based
   interpretation. An interpretation mechanism is formalized by collating
   digital elevation model (DEM) and geological data with the multiscale
   images of tilt angle anomalies of high resolution TMI data. The image
   based interpretation technique with multiscale analysis of high
   resolution aeromagnetic data has been tested successfully for
   groundwater resource targeting in an arid region of western Gawler
   Craton, South Australia. The method has been found to be an important
   aid in delineating structural trends, in identifying paleovalley or
   paleochannels and in understanding hydrogeomorphological setup of the
   study area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most crucial problems in cultural heritage environment is the
   remote monitoring of the state of monuments, especially of large
   surfaces (e.g. frescos, chapels). In 2011 a complete 3D colour
   digitization of the Sistine Chapel was executed by the RGB-ITR (Red
   Green Blue - Imaging Topological Radar) laser scanner prototype,
   developed by the UTAPRAD-DIM (Technical Unit for the development of
   APplications of RADiations - Diagnostics and Metrology) lab of C.R. ENEA
   Frascati. The preservation of the frescos is put at risk by the salt
   efflorescence (e.g., calcium carbonate) due to physical and chemical
   agents. These outcrops showing colours deterioration appear on the
   fresco as whitish areas of variable size. Within this framework, the
   scientific challenge is to provide a starting point for the non-invasive
   diagnosis of fresco degradation in order to contribute to the design and
   realization of innovative solutions for the restoration and conservation
   of the paintings, especially in presence of extended surfaces with
   difficult access. The present work shows the results obtained by the
   integration of two techniques, based on the RGB-ITR hyper-photos and the
   watershed algorithm for a semi-automatic detection of defects on fresco.
   The study case concerns the fresco located inside the Sistine Chapel
   known as ``Temptations of Christ{''} by Sandro Botticelli. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Lymphatic dissemination is a key event in cervical cancer progression
   and related tumor lymphatic markers are viewed as promising prognostic
   factor of nodal extension. However, validating such parameters requires
   an objective characterization of the lymphatic vasculature. Here, we
   performed a global analysis of the lymphatic network using a new
   computerized method applied on whole uterine cervical digital images.
   Sixty-eight cases of cervical neoplasia (12 CIN3, 10 FIGO stage 1A and
   46 stage IB1) and 10 cases of normal cervical tissue were reacted with
   antibodies raised against D2-40, D2-401p16 and D2-40/Ki67. Immunostained
   structures were automatically detected on whole slides. The lymphatic
   vessel density (D2-40), proliferating lymphatic vessel density
   (D2-401ki67) and spatial lymphatic distribution in respect to the
   adjacent epithelium were assessed from normal cervix to early cervical
   cancer and correlated with lymphovascular space invasion and lymph node
   status. Prominent lymphatic vessel density and proliferating lymphatic
   vessel density are detected under the transformation zone of benign
   cervix and no further increase is noted during cancer progression.
   Notably, a shift of lymphatic vessel distribution toward the neoplastic
   edges is detected. In IB1 cervical cancer, although intra- and
   peritumoral lymphatic vessel density are neither correlated with
   lymphovascular space invasion nor with lymph node metastasis, a specific
   spatial distribution with more lymphatic vessels in the vicinity of
   tumor edges is predictive of lymphatic dissemination. Herein, we provide
   a new computerized method suitable for an innovative detailed analysis
   of the lymphatic network. We show that the transformation zone of the
   benign cervix acts as a baseline lymphangiogenic niche before the
   initiation of neoplastic process. During cancer progression, this
   specific microenvironment is maintained with lymphatic vessels even in
   closer vicinity to tumor cells.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of
   each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is
   expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the
   determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint
   perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the
   evolutionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective
   histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5
   data provide cell-type-specific digital expression of human
   protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide
   protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein
   was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all
   other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across
   epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human
   cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type,
   its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it
   expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to
   create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identifies the
   possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals)
   provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas
   cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of
   continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of
   animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain
   architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of
   cell-type-specific domain architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual communities provide numerous resources, immediate feedback, and
   information sharing, enabling people to rapidly acquire information and
   knowledge and supporting diverse applications that facilitate
   interpersonal interactions, communication, and sharing. Moreover,
   incorporating highly mobile and convenient devices into practice-based
   courses can be advantageous in learning situations. Therefore, in this
   study, a tablet PC and Google + were introduced to a health education
   practice course to elucidate satisfaction of learning module and
   conditions and analyze the sequence and frequency of learning behaviors
   during the social-network-based learning process. According to the
   analytical results, social networks can improve interaction among peers
   and between educators and students, particularly when these networks are
   used to search for data, post articles, engage in discussions, and
   communicate. In addition, most nursing students and nursing educators
   expressed a positive attitude and satisfaction toward these innovative
   teaching methods, and looked forward to continuing the use of this
   learning approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, as in other spheres of activity, new technologies have
   gradually entered different phases of geoheritage management. The EDYTEM
   laboratory has led a technology watch and some experimentation, as part
   of a European LEADER programme, to better understand, test and develop
   the uses of these innovative practices in the field of geoheritage. This
   article presents a review of existing and emerging technologies in the
   depiction and interpretation of geosites. Three main topics are analysed
   in particular. First, the georeferencing and mapping of geoheritage,
   especially with recent developments in web mapping and mobile access to
   map data. Then, digital imaging (primarily 3D modelling based on
   techniques of photogrammetry), laser scanning or scan volume and also
   the real time observation of natural phenomena through a webcam.
   Finally, some experiments of interpretation of geoheritage using
   augmented reality, a process which enriches discovery through digital
   media, or virtual reality technologies that create a virtual universe
   with which one can engage. This paper shows that the diversity of
   practices, tools and experiences meets some basic needs: geolocation,
   geovisualisation, interpretation and understanding of the geosites.
   Finally, a discussion of the innovations inherent in the development of
   these practices, their interests and scopes allows us to put them into
   perspective with respect to their efficiency, reliability and
   appropriation by different users.}},

Abstract = {{The work presented here forms part of a cultural and scientific context
   for the continuous improvement of computer sciences to support
   geological and geomorphological research, by allowing the development
   and application of specific tools and innovative methodologies.
   Cooperation between the Regional Museum of Natural Sciences of Torino
   and the Department of Earth Sciences of the University of Torino has
   facilitated the development and implementation of a methodology aimed at
   the identification and evaluation of the geological and geomorphological
   heritage of the Piemonte region. The methodological steps applied are
   described in full in a case study of Seguret Valley (Piemonte, NW
   Italy). The employment of geomatic tools, such as digital
   photogrammetry, geographical information systems (GIS) and global
   navigation satellite system (GNSS), has allowed the production of a
   geomorphological map of the area and the identification, listing and
   selection of the most representative and important sites. Terrestrial
   laser scanner (LiDAR), although currently used for demonstration
   purposes, has the potential to be used in the identification of
   potential risks associated with the enjoyment of the site by the public.
   Web Mapping tools based on GoogleMapsA (c) architecture have also been
   set up for the web dissemination of geoscientific
   information-appropriately simplified without prejudicing accuracy-in
   enable as broad an audience as possible to be reached.}},

Abstract = {{Recent high-tech innovations in digital surgical technology have led to
   advances in three-dimensional (3D) and high-definition (HD) operating
   scopes. We introduce a novel 3D-HD flexible surgical scope called
   ``3D-Eye-Flex{''} and evaluate its utility as an alternative to the
   operating microscope.
   The 3D-Eye-Flex has a 15 mm long 3D-HD scope-head with a 15 mm outer
   diameter, a focus distance of 18-100 mm and 80A degrees angle of view.
   Attached to a 615-mm-long flexible bellows, 3D-Eye-Flex can be easily
   fixed to the operating table. Microsurgical dissection of wet brain
   tissue and drilling a skull base model were performed under the scope
   while using the 3D-HD video monitor.
   This scope system provided excellent illumination and image quality
   during the procedures. A large depth of field with stereoscopic vision
   had a greater advantage over using an operating microscope. 3D-Eye-Flex
   was easy to manipulate and provided an abundance of space above the
   operative field. Surgeons felt comfortable while working and could
   easily shift the position of the scope.
   This novel 3D-HD flexible scope is an effective alternative to the
   operating microscope as a new surgeon's eye and will be suitable for
   digital image-based surgery with further refinement.}},

Abstract = {{Point mutations in a cis-regulatory element of Sonic Hedgehog are
   frequently associated with preaxial polydactyly in humans, mice, and
   cats. The Hemingway mutant in the Maine Coon cat exhibits polyphenic
   effects of polydactyly that are not equally distributed. A statistical
   analysis of a comprehensive data base of Hemingway mutants reveals a
   biased and discontinuous distribution of extra digits. Further biases
   exist in the difference of effects in fore- versus hind-limbs and in
   left-right asymmetry. These non-equally distributed phenotypic effects
   cannot be explained by the point mutation alone. We propose a double
   mapping model, termed the Hemingway Model, to account for the biased
   distribution of supernumerary digits. The model is based on the random
   bistability of individual cells in the limb area affected by the
   mutation and on the application of the Central Limit Theorem. It
   proposes two kinds of mapping events that (a) transform a mutational
   effect of single additive changes into a continuous distribution, and
   (b) transform the continuous distribution into discrete character states
   via developmental threshold effects. The threshold widths for the
   occurrence of discrete extra digits are specified as units of standard
   deviations of the continuous variable. This makes it possible to specify
   the generation of empirical developmental variables (the liability of
   quantitative genetics) as a result of developmental parameters that give
   rise to biased morphological patterns and phenotypic novelty.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the need for a shift towards more Foresight-based
   inclusive innovation processes and introduces the concept of
   ``Innovation Foresight{''} (IF) in this respect. IF represents an
   approach for bringing the future into holistic innovation processes, in
   which users and other stakeholders are systematically involved to detect
   future opportunities and risks. This could allow for a better
   integration of inclusive, long-term visions in decision-making and
   strategic thinking in the context of innovation. To be effective and
   enable mutual learning, the IF process calls for future-oriented,
   continuous interaction with current/anticipated users and a better
   integration of methods and approaches from different fields, including
   Foresight, user/market research and human-centred product design. This
   paper discusses two empirical studies that closely involved users in the
   exploration, imagination and creation of future TV experiences. Study 1
   aimed to identify users' specific (future) needs and possible Lead User
   ideas concerning digital TV (DTV) in Flanders through an online survey
   (N = 11.802 digital TV users). 13 unique ideas representing important
   unfulfilled needs were identified and evaluated. Study 2, which focused
   on `Future TV experiences', consisted of a multi-method research
   approach in three phases, resulting in six persona profiles, that help
   to provide an understanding of users' daily practices and futures
   aspirations. It is argued that a better introduction of future
   anticipation in inclusive innovation processes could enhance the input
   of users in innovation and contribute to the detection of potential
   user/societal needs and possible unexpected forms of use. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Aim The aim of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) was to compare the
   clinical performance of the tunnel technique with subepithelial
   connective tissue graft (TUN) versus a coronally advanced flap with
   enamel matrix derivative (CAF) in the treatment of gingival recession
   defects. The use of innovative 3D digital measuring methods allowed to
   study healing dynamics at connective tissue (CT)-grafted sites and to
   evaluate the influence of the thickness of the root covering soft
   tissues on the outcome of surgical root coverage. Material \& Methods
   Twenty-four patients contributed a total of 47 Miller class I or II
   recessions for scientific evaluation. Precise study models collected at
   baseline and follow-up examinations were optically scanned and virtually
   superimposed for digital evaluation of clinical outcome measures
   including mean marginal soft tissue thickness (THK). Healing dynamics
   were measured in a defined region of interest at CT-grafted sites where
   volume differences between time points were calculated. Results At
   12months, recession reduction as well as mean root coverage were
   significantly better at CT-grafted sites treated in the TUN group
   (1.94mm and 98.4\% respectively) compared to the non-augmented sites of
   the CAF group (1.17mm and 71.8\% respectively) and statistical analysis
   revealed a positive correlation of THK (1.63mm TUN versus 0.91mm CAF,
   p<0.0001) to both these variables. Soft tissue healing following
   surgical root coverage with CT-grafting was mainly accomplished after
   6months, with around two-thirds of the augmented volume being maintained
   after 12months. Conclusions The TUN resulted in thicker gingiva and
   better clinical outcomes compared to CAF. Increased gingival thickness
   was associated with better surgical outcomes in terms of recession
   reduction and root coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Cementless metal-back acetabular cups have good long-term results, but
   some problems have appeared due to the shell's stiffness, modularity and
   required bearing surfaces. The RM Pressfit (R) Cup is a single-piece
   polyethylene cementless acetabular cup that is covered by a thin layer
   of titanium. This allows for bone integration without limitations
   related to the stiffness of a metal-back shell. There is very little
   published information about this new, innovative implant design. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological
   results from a continuous series of 91 cups (85 patients) with a
   follow-up of at least 4 years. No patients were lost to follow-up. The
   Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used to assess the clinical outcome. To
   assess the radiological outcomes, digital X-rays were used to evaluate
   the cup position and integration; wear was measured using Livermore's
   technique. The clinical results were excellent: the mean HHS was 94 and
   82\% of cases had good or excellent scores. Three of the cups had to be
   revised because of dislocation brought on by incorrect positioning.
   X-rays revealed that three implants had shifted during the first 6
   weeks, but had stabilized afterwards. Bone integration on X-rays was
   satisfactory in all cases with no signs of osteolysis. The configuration
   of the bone trabeculae showed that loads between the implant and
   peri-acetabular cancellous bone were evenly distributed. The wearof the
   polyethylene cup-ceramic head bearing was 0.07 mm/year. The results of
   this series are consistent with recent published studies with the RM
   Pressfit (R) Cup. Level of evidence: IV. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{This Twitter Research Forum essay by International Journal of Sport
   Communication (IJSC) Editor and leading strategic sport media scholar
   Paul Pedersen provides an important perspective on the challenges
   encountered by scholarly journals to the rise of interest in social
   media and sport. Using metrics on the content of articles published in
   IJSC, Pedersen notes publications concerning social media and sport have
   now reached parity with research on legacy media in electronic and print
   forms. Pedersen observes that because social media data are often
   readily available, scholars can quickly produce social media
   thematic/content analyses and surveys and that these are less taxing and
   time consuming when compared to other methods appropriate to studying
   other topics. This has resulted in a seeming avalanche of social media
   and sport submissions and raises questions about whether journals
   focused exclusively on digital media and sport are needed. The rise in
   submissions has presented challenges in selecting appropriate reviewers
   and raised risks of an academic groupthink within delimited quarters of
   the sport communication academic community. The essay closes with
   suggestions for research on sport andsocial media to advance its agenda
   to inquiry that is more innovative, rigorous, substantive, and
   significant.}},

Journal = {{IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE}},

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{8-23}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements) is an
   innovative formation flying radar mission that opens a new era in
   spaceborne radar remote sensing. The primary objective is the
   acquisition of a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with unprecedented
   accuracy (12 m horizontal resolution and 2 m relative height accuracy).
   This goal is achieved by extending the TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) mission by a second, TerraSAR-X like satellite TanDEM-X
   (TDX) flying in close formation with TerraSAR-X (TSX). The resulting
   large single-pass SAR interferometer features flexible baseline
   selection enabling the acquisition of highly accurate cross-track
   interferograms not impacted by temporal decor-relation and atmospheric
   disturbances. Beyond the global DEM, several secondary mission
   objectives based on along-track interferometry as well as new bistatic
   and multistatic SAR techniques have been defined.
   Since 2010 both satellites have been operated in close formation to map
   all land surfaces at least twice and difficult terrain even up to four
   times. While data acquisition for DEM generation will be concluded in
   the second half of 2014 it is expected to complete the processing of the
   global DEM by the end of 2015. This paper provides an overview of the
   TanDEM-X mission and summarizes its actual status as well as the
   performance of the system and the first final DEMs. Up to now the
   mission driver was the DEM generation and scientific experiments have
   been limited to the pre-defined DEM formation geometries. This paper
   also outlines the current planning for a dedicated science phase
   starting in the last quarter of this year.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   This paper discusses the methodological challenges of using the 3D
   social virtual world Second Life for research and offers some solutions
   on a range of research issues including research ethics committee
   approval, gaining consent, recruitment of sample, data collection and
   engagement with `in - world culture'.
   Background
   The attraction of social virtual worlds to researchers is their ability
   to mimic the physical world, as they, are seen as `places' where people
   have a feeling of presence (being there) and social presence (being
   there with others) through the use of a `customisable' avatar (digital
   self-representation). Emerging research demonstrating the persuasive
   nature of avatars on health behaviours through virtual worlds, online
   games and the 3D web has increased the use of and interest in these
   areas for delivering health information, advice and support. However,
   conducting research can be challenging in a 3D world where people are
   represented as anonymous avatars in an environment unlike any other
   online media.
   Data sources
   25 semi-structured interviews were conducted in Second Life from
   September 2011-June 2012.
   Implications for nursing
   Nurses wishing to undertake research in social virtual worlds should
   spend time in-world to acquire technical skills and gain an
   understanding of the culture of the world.
   Conclusion
   Our experience of an interview-based study in virtual worlds indicates
   that researchers require several virtual world technical skills to
   create innovative tools to recruit, gain consent and collect data and an
   understanding of in-world culture, language and social norms to increase
   the chances of successful research.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic information systems (GIS) represent more than a tool for
   spatial data handling. Qualitative and mixed-methods approaches with GIS
   value the suite of spatial methods and technologies, while typically
   showing a marked sensitivity toward issues of subjectivity, knowledge
   production, exclusion, reflexivity, and power relations. Although recent
   research in the use of qualitative GIS demonstrates the ways in which
   spatial representations and analyses can be used as part of critical
   geographic inquiry, there remain significant opportunities to
   demonstrate and synthesize the particular affordances of these
   approaches. Alongside broader developments in public scholarship and the
   digital humanities, mixed-methods research with GIS is coming of age, as
   technological innovations are easing access to data and access to
   visualization and analytical tools for some. The implications of these
   developments at the level of knowledge construction within
   community-based, critical research have been underexplored, however.
   What are the specific affordances of mixed-methods research with GIS?
   How are mixed-methods knowledges made and worked through community
   engagement? Here, we trace how qualitative GIS methods uniquely enable
   multiple narratives to change the ways in which GIS is practiced. To
   illustrate this process, we present findings from the use of qualitative
   GIS to study urban gardening in a postindustrial, Midwestern city. Key

   geografica (SIG) son algo mas que una herramienta para el manejo de
   datos espaciales. Las aplicaciones de SIG con metodos cualitativos y
   mixtos valoran la suite de metodos y tecnologias espaciales, al tiempo
   que muestran tipicamente una marcada sensibilidad hacia cuestiones de
   subjetividad, produccion de conocimiento, exclusion, reflexion y
   relaciones de poder. Si bien la investigacion reciente sobre el uso de
   los SIG cualitativos demuestra las maneras como pueden utilizarse las
   representaciones y analisis espaciales como parte de la indagacion
   geografica critica, todavia hay oportunidades significativas para
   demostrar y sintetizar la factibilidad particular de estos enfoques.
   Junto a los mas amplios desarrollos en sabiduria publica y las
   humanidades digitales, la investigacion de metodos mixtos con SIG esta
   llegando a ser una realidad, a medida que las innovaciones tecnologicas
   estan facilitando a algunos el acceso a datos y el acceso a herramientas
   analiticas y de visualizacion. Las implicaciones de estos desarrollos a
   nivel de la construccion de conocimiento dentro de la investigacion
   critica de base comunitaria, sin embargo, han sido poco exploradas.
   Cuales son las posibilidades especificas de la investigacion a base de
   metodos mixtos con SIG? Como se hacen y se aplican los conocimientos de
   metodos mixtos a traves del compromiso comunitario? En el articulo
   exploramos la manera como los metodos de los SIG cualitativos
   singularmente habilita multiples narrativas para cambiar el modo como

Abstract = {{Advancements in genomics and personalized medicine not only effect
   healthcare delivery from patient and provider standpoints, but also
   reshape biomedical discovery. We are in the era of the `-omics', wherein
   an individual's genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome can be
   scrutinized to the finest resolution to paint a personalized biochemical
   fingerprint that enables tailored treatments, prognoses, risk factors,
   etc. Digitization of this information parlays into `big data'
   informatics-driven evidence-based medical practice. While individualized
   patient management is a key beneficiary of next-generation medical
   informatics, this data also harbors a wealth of novel therapeutic
   discoveries waiting to be uncovered. `Big data' informatics allows for
   networks-driven systems pharmacodynamics whereby drug information can be
   coupled to cellular-and organ-level physiology for determining
   whole-body outcomes. Patient `-omics' data can be integrated for
   ontology-based data-mining for the discovery of new biological
   associations and drug targets. Here we highlight the potential of `big
   data' informatics for clinical pharmacology.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of technological change, consumers face an environment
   increasingly complex, leading to significant challenges regarding buying
   and consuming choices and consumer protection. The most important and
   most influential technological changes in terms of the impact on the
   consumer, are iduced by internet, digitization and globalization.
   However, the era of technological change also means developing
   biotechnologies, nanotechnologies, new materials and new energy sources,
   all these changing people's lives, living conditions, their needs and
   their behaviour as consumers.
   The literature highlights the factors that influence purchasing
   behaviour and changes manifested in terms of values, stressing the
   importance of promoting and protecting consumer's rights and interests,
   The new responsible consumer can become a key driving force of
   sustainable development only if it is able to capitalize on new
   opportunities and to counter new risks of modern marketing technologies
   based on the Internet and mobile communications. This involves the
   assimilation of new knowledge throughout life to keep up with the
   accelerating pace of technological innovation and diffusion of
   e-commerce solutions and mobile commerce.
   We study the correlation between the composite index of consumer
   conditions and the level of participation in lifelong learning
   programmes in some Member States, based on secondary analysis of the
   data available at EU level,. The results confirm that the consumer's
   situation is better in countries where the level of participation in
   lifelong learning programmes is higher. At the same time, however, the
   correlation is not linear. This shows that the consumer's situation does
   not depend exclusively on formal continuing education but also other
   factors such as timeliness and severity of legal and institutional
   framework of consumer protection, the acquisition of knowledge through
   informal means, the requirement of different customers in different
   countries.}},

Abstract = {{The need to guarantee equitable access to health regardless of
   geographic, economic, or technological barriers motivated the Member
   States of the Organization of American States to create the Telehealth
   Network of the Americas, coordinated by the InterAmerican
   Telecommunication Committee.
   The Network focuses on the use of new information and communications
   technology applied to health, based on the values of respect, equity,
   and solidarity and mandated by the philosophy of primary health. Its
   members include government agencies, nongovernmental organizations,
   university forums, hospital federations, and telecommunications
   companies, and it has already extended its reach to other continents and
   to different fields in which telemedicine is being used.
   Among its first achievements, it has implemented an innovative tool to
   be used in cases of disaster or limited geographic access. This mobile
   telemedicine station is housed in a portable case that includes a
   computer, various digital devices (otoscope, ophthalmoscope, microscope,
   dermatoscope), a high-resolution digital camera, an X-ray film viewer,
   and a satellite antenna. With this tool, it is possible to provide
   specialized support for rural physicians and primary health care workers
   located far from large urban centers.}},

Title = {{WIRED-UP OR WIND-UP? THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF BROADBAND POLICY IN NEW

Journal = {{MEDIA INTERNATIONAL AUSTRALIA}},

Pages = {{146-156}},

Abstract = {{Government policy has played a crucial role in driving the development
   of broadband technology in New Zealand, but this has evidently been
   shaped by the interplay of different ministerial imperatives and
   rationales under different administrations. The Labour-led government's
   2005 Digital Strategy primarily aimed at increasing consumer uptake of
   basic broadband to overcome the `digital divide'. This evolved into the
   more ambitious 2008 Digital Strategy 2.0 which, consistent with Labour's
   `third way' philosophy, focused both on grassroots community engagement
   and economic goals (involving both the Ministry for Culture and Heritage
   and the Ministry of Economic Development). However, the election of the
   National-led government later in 2008 brought a shift in the principles
   and outcomes driving broadband policy. National's Ultra-Fast Broadband
   initiative has seen NZ\$1.35 billion allocated to telecommunications
   companies that won contracts to develop a nationwide fibre-optic
   infrastructure. The political rationale more strongly reflects
   macro-economic imperatives informed primarily by the revamped Ministry
   for Business, Innovation and Employment. This more commercial policy
   orientation has nevertheless led the government into some complex and
   contradictory positions, particularly with respect to its reluctance to
   insulate the UFB initiative from demands to re-regulate the media sector
   in response to convergence and competition issues. Taking a critical
   institutionalist approach and drawing on evidence from key policy
   documents and interview data with policy actors, this analysis outlines
   several policy tensions underpinning the shifts in New Zealand's
   telecommunications and broadband policy between 2005 and 2013.}},

Abstract = {{Software-defined radio is a rapidly developing field that is driving the
   development of and innovation in communications technology, and promises
   to significantly impact all communications sectors. Entities developing
   these SDR systems require a trained workforce that has been prepared
   with the mindset, knowledge, skills, and tools required to address both
   the system (breadth) and technical (depth) aspects of SDR systems.
   Developing SDRs necessarily involves a collection of disciplines
   including, but not limited to, electromagnetics, radio-frequency
   engineering, communications, digital signal processing, embedded
   systems, computer programming, and systems engineering. Whereas
   electrical engineering and computer science and engineering curricula at
   the university level may include courses in all of these areas, a
   student's typical curriculum does not; nor does it usually involve the
   integration of all these topics. However, SDR can be employed as an
   integrative construct that facilitates systems thinking and cross-domain
   learning via peers. In this article, we present several significant
   educational efforts across six U. S. universities that have developed
   integrated curricula in SDR, most including a significant laboratory
   component.}},

Abstract = {{With its focus on the field of digital piracy (DP), the February 2013
   special issue of Convergence explored a number of novel research topics
   using unconventional research methods. In doing so, the issue stands out
   from the bulk of DP research, which often concentrates on economic and
   commercial aspects. Such concerns demand particular research methods
   that are in turn subject to limitations. Drawing from a broad range of
   literature across various disciplines, this article both explores these
   limitations and demonstrates that alternative approaches exist, which
   can greatly enhance the understanding of digital piracy on a more
   holistic level. The article concludes with suggestions for future
   research, arguing in particular that cross-discipline research will best
   serve the field by promoting innovative methods of data collection and
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A 5-year case study of an established regional newspaper in Britain
   investigates journalists about their perceptions of convergence in
   digital technologies. This research is the first ethnographic
   longitudinal case study of a UK regional newspaper. Although conforming
   to some trends observed in the wider field of scholarship, the analysis
   adds to skepticism about any linear or directional views of innovation
   and adoption: the Northern Echo newspaper journalists were observed to
   have revised their opinions of optimum Web practices, and sometimes
   radically reversed policies. Technology is seen in the period as a
   fluid, amorphous entity. Central corporate authority appeared to
   diminish in the period as part of a wider reduction in formalism.
   Questioning functionalist notions of the market, the study suggests
   cause and effect models of change are often subverted by contradictory
   perceptions of particular actions. Meanwhile, during technological
   evolution, the `professional imagination' can be understood as strongly
   reflecting the parent print culture and its routines, despite pioneering
   a new convergence partnership with an independent television company.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years, the application of different wireless
   technologies has been explored in order to enable Internet connectivity
   from vehicles. In addition, the widespread adoption of smartphones by
   citizens represents a great opportunity to integrate such nomadic

   architecture to provide the ubiquitous connectivity needed to enhance
   the smart train concept is presented and preliminarily tested. It
   combines an intra-wagon communication system based on nomadic devices
   connected through a Bluetooth Piconet Network with a highly innovative
   train-to-ground communication system. In order to validate this
   communication solution, several tests and simulations have been
   performed and their results are described in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays mobile phones include quality photo and video cameras, access
   to wireless networks and the internet, GPS assistance and other
   innovative systems. These facilities open them to innovative uses, other
   than the classical telephonic communication one. Smartphones are a more
   sophisticated version of classic mobile phones, which have advanced
   computing power, memory and connectivity. Because fake lithographs are
   flooding the art market, in this work, we propose a smartphone as
   simple, robust and efficient sensor for lithograph authentication. When
   we buy an artwork object, the seller issues a certificate of
   authenticity, which contains specific details about the artwork itself.
   Unscrupulous sellers can duplicate the classic certificates of
   authenticity, and then use them to. authenticate. non-genuine works of
   art. In this way, the buyer will have a copy of an original certificate
   to attest that the. not original artwork. is an original one. A solution
   for this problem would be to insert a system that links together the
   certificate and the related specific artwork. To do this it is
   necessary, for a single artwork, to find unique, unrepeatable, and
   unchangeable characteristics. In this article we propose an innovative
   method for the authentication of stone lithographs. We use the color
   spots distribution captured by means of a smartphone camera as a
   non-cloneable texture of the specific artworks and an information
   management system for verifying it in mobility stone lithography.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) digital models obtained by laser scanning are
   particularly useful for monuments located in remote places and suffering
   from erosion such as ancient rock carvings. Here we describe research by
   the Iranian-Italian Joint Expedition in Khuzestan, which conducted
   surveys on three rock carvings dating to the Parthian period (2nd
   century B.C.-3rd century A. D.). The rock carvings of Hung-e Azhdar,
   Hung-e Yaralivand, and Hung-e Kamalvand are located near the modern city
   of Izeh, in the highlands of the Khuzestan province of southwestern
   Iran. The 3D digital models of the rock carvings provide new information
   on their method of manufacture and cultural significance by bringing
   forward previously undetected details, both technical and
   iconographical. The digital measurements reveal that the Hung-e Azhdar
   relief was re-sculpted in antiquity, and that on the upper part of the
   Hung-e Yaralivand relief there are clear traces of an inscription
   unnoticed by previous surveys. Given that these observations are the
   result of objective measurements verifiable by other observers using the
   same data, the 3D surface analysis offers promise of an advance in the
   study of ancient sculptural works and the models are innovative means
   for documenting and sharing both raw and elaborated data.}},

Abstract = {{Current literature demonstrates that, at least initially, incumbents
   invest less in the in-house development of a new technology than do
   entrants, whether diversifying or de novo; this is because, for
   incumbents, new technology challenges managers' mental models through
   changes in capabilities, revenue models, or product features. What has
   not been explored, despite its significance for strategic action, is
   whether (and if so, why) incumbent, diversifying, and de novo firms
   might invest differently across variants of a new technology through a
   discontinuity. This paper uses unique quantitative, archival, and
   interview data on the investment choices of incumbent, diversifying, and
   de novo firms around three variants of biotechnology-small-molecule,
   large-molecule and gene therapy drugs-to show there are differences in
   investment choices across groups of firms and to suggest that these can
   be explained through differences in volatility of outcomes across
   variants. When volatility in product performance generates volatility in
   firm-level outcomes, de novo firms can cap negative consequences through
   bankruptcy, an alternative that is extremely costly for established
   firms (whether incumbent or diversifying), given their complex corporate
   structure. By keeping indirect bankruptcy costs low, de novo firms'
   simple corporate structure allows them to extract option value from
   volatility, making established versus de novo firms the key groups for
   analysis of investment choices, not incumbent versus entrant firms. This
   article thus identifies the interaction between a technological
   investment's volatility and de novo firms' simple corporate structure as
   the explanatory variable for the observed investment differences. I
   discuss implications for technology strategy and the competitive
   analysis of discontinuities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a process model of trajectory shifts in
   institutional entrepreneurship. We focus on the liminal periods
   experienced by institutional entrepreneurs when they, unlike the rest of
   the organization, recognize limits in the present and seek to shift a
   familiar past into an unfamiliar and uncertain future. Such periods
   involve a situation where the new possible future, not yet fully formed,
   exists side-by-side with established innovation trajectories. Trajectory
   shifts are moments of truth for institutional entrepreneurs, but little
   is known about the underlying mechanisms of how entrepreneurs
   reflectively deal with liminality to conceive and bring forth new
   innovation trajectories. Our in-depth case study research at CarCorp
   traces three such mechanisms (reflective dissension, imaginative
   projection, and eliminatory exploration) and builds the basis for
   understanding the liminality of trajectory shifts. The paper offers
   theoretical implications for the institutional entrepreneurship
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates a social media-enabled, customer co-creation
   project that employs front-end innovation (FEI) at a well-known,
   large-scale food manufacturer. It sheds light on the role of social
   media technology in transforming the characteristics of FEI in terms of
   boundaries and knowledge distance. What type of exploratory or
   exploitative innovation ideas does a project of this sort enable? How
   did the project evolve? What lessons can be learned from this project? A
   longitudinal case study of Barilla was carried out through two rounds of
   interviews with marketing, business development and innovation, and
   digital communication managers. The evidence gathered highlights the
   emergent evolution of this customer co-creation project from an initial
   stage of idea exploitation to a more complex and fruitful stage in which
   both exploitation and exploration were simultaneously accomplished. (C)

   interconnections, an innovative method is proposed to predict the
   physical intrinsic eye diagram. Such a technique is based on the
   measured impedance profile results of time-domain reflectometry, which
   includes the electric characteristics both of the connector itself and
   testing jigs. The latter's are to be removed to leave the connector's
   part only for the eye diagram prediction. This method can be verified
   further by SPICE simulation and measurement in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{We present Fisher matrix projections for future cosmological parameter
   measurements, including neutrino masses, Dark Energy, curvature,
   modified gravity, the inflationary perturbation spectrum,
   non-Gaussianity, and dark radiation. We focus on DESI and generally
   redshift surveys (BOSS, HETDEX, eBOSS, Euclid, and WFIRST), but also
   include CMB (Planck) and weak gravitational lensing (DES and LSST)
   constraints. The goal is to present a consistent set of projections, for
   concrete experiments, which are otherwise scattered throughout many
   papers and proposals. We include neutrino mass as a free parameter in
   most projections, as it will inevitably be relevant DESI and other
   experiments can measure the sum of neutrino masses to similar to 0.02 eV
   or better, while the minimum possible sum is similar to 0.06 eV. We note
   that constraints on Dark Energy are significantly degraded by the
   presence of neutrino mass uncertainty, especially when using galaxy
   clustering only as a probe of the BAO distance scale (because this
   introduces additional uncertainty in the background evolution after the
   CMB epoch). Using broadband galaxy power becomes relatively more
   powerful, and bigger gains are achieved by combining lensing survey
   constraints with redshift survey constraints. We do not try to be
   especially innovative, e.g., with complex treatments of potential
   systematic errors - these projections are intended as a straightforward
   baseline for comparison to more detailed analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The materials innovation infrastructure in the materials genome
   initiative (MGI) consists of three major components: computational
   tools, experimental tools, and digital data. This article will review
   experimental tools for high-throughput, high spatial resolution
   measurements of several materials properties such as elastic modulus,
   thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and thermal expansion.
   Application of these tools on composition-varying samples such as
   diffusion multiples can be used to quickly and efficiently obtain
   composition-phase-structure- property relationships for materials
   property database establishment. They can also be used in conjunction
   with theoretical modeling to find and explain unusual effects to improve
   the predictability of models. More micron scale resolution experimental
   tools are in development. These high-throughput tools will be an
   essential part of MGI.}},

Abstract = {{While technological innovations over the last thirty years have markedly
   improved the ways in which people communicate and gather information,
   these advances have also led to computer crimes and related deviance
   becoming permanent fixtures in our society. In an effort to curtail
   internet offending, it is important for academics and practitioners
   alike to better understand why some individuals engage in
   cybercriminality. Criminologists have utilized several theories to
   investigate this type of deviance, including low self-control theory.
   However, the vast majority of this prior research has focused on a
   narrow scope of offending, namely digital piracy. The current study
   utilizes a sample of 488 undergraduate students to evaluate the theory's
   generality hypothesis by examining the extent to which low self-control
   predicts online deviance in general and beyond digital piracy more
   specifically. Study results support the generality hypothesis in that
   low self-control is related to non-digital piracy online deviance.
   Specific findings, policy implications, and directions for future
   research are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper sets out to use Science Fiction Prototyping (SFP) as a tool to
   explore how networked electronic products might evolve in the future
   digital economy. It highlights a number of trends already evident in the
   commercial environment (the increasing speed of new product launches and
   associated decision making, the growth of data available to decision
   makers, the ability to imbue devices with limited sensing and decision
   making faculties) and sets this against enduring issues around the
   limits and efficacy of human decision making. This is used as the basis
   for a vignette in which products increasingly carry the burden of
   decision making in terms of their form, function and interaction with
   consumers, a responsibility which has unexpected outcomes. It highlights
   the difficulties associated with forecasting discontinuities for
   practitioners, the value of SFP as a tool to address these challenges
   and the prospects for the widespread adoption of SFP as a forecasting
   methodology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents Manchester Digital Laboratory (MadLab) as an
   ``organisation as prototype{''} in terms of its innovation; emphasising
   its permeability to external collaboration and internal structure. We
   present the accumulation of experience and inspiration found in this
   organisational prototype as a significant development with as much
   social impact as any single material invention. Few organisations are
   held up as examples of organisational prototypes although notable
   exceptions such as Apple Computers and Factory Records do exist. Few of
   these examples offer a systematic accounting for the basis of
   organisational innovation and its application elsewhere. This work sets
   out to understand how inspirations drawn from sources such as literature
   and popular media and seemingly disparate personal ideas and skills,
   through processes of invention and innovation can become the basis for a
   sustainable organisation capable of creating value. In this manner we
   present MadLab as a prototype that is the product of the personal
   interests and motivations of the directors and their influences
   including science fiction. Whilst the directors did not consciously
   engage in Science Fiction Prototyping we present their actions,
   organisational structure and collaboration as a model for the
   realisation of organisational Science Fiction Prototyping. This
   empirical study focusses on MadLab; its short history, its people, its
   activities and the intersecting creative influences on the different
   groups that make up the organisation. The understanding gained of this
   organisational prototype is then considered within a more generalised
   view of organisation types and their potential to create value and
   achieve long-term viability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fabcreating, a highly sophisticated form of 3D printing, has become
   ubiquitous by 2033. We outline how digital fabrication might evolve in a
   science fiction prototype (SFP) and provide a 2033 use case in which
   consumers produce their own highly customized consumer electronics at
   home. It shows how consumers virtually select, customize and print
   mobile phones and highlights how digital fabrication impacts society at
   large. Our technology outlook is backed by expert interviews. Our story
   vignette forms a showcase to address the role of technology, creativity
   and context in SFP. We address the anatomy of SFP and argue that context
   is important in order to promote opportunity recognition and to envisage
   game changing technologies and their societal impact. We develop a SFP
   typology based on a technology prototype and context prototype

Abstract = {{Objectives: To identify studies reporting mobile device integration into
   undergraduate and graduate nursing curricula. To explore the potential
   use of Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation model as a framework to guide
   implementation of mobile devices into nursing curricula.
   Design: Literature review and thematic categorization.
   Data sources: Literature published up until June 2013 was searched using
   EBSCO, PubMed, and Google Scholar.
   Review method: The literature was reviewed for research articles
   pertaining to mobile device use in nursing education. Research articles
   were grouped by study design, and articles were classified by: 1)
   strategies for individual adopters and 2) strategies for organizations.
   Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory was used to categorize reported
   implementation strategies.
   Results: Fifty-two research studies were identified. Strategies for
   implementation were varied, and challenges to integrating mobile devices
   include lack of administrative support and time/funding to educate
   faculty as well as students. Overall, the use of mobile devices appears
   to provide benefits to nursing students; however the research evidence
   is limited.
   Conclusion: Anticipating challenges and ensuring a well laid out
   strategic plan can assist in supporting successful integration of mobile
   devices. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study examines the government leadership and strategic
   restructuring that guided The Republic of Korea's remarkable ICT-led
   development from 1980 to the present. That time span coincided with
   tumultuous political, social and economic transformation inside Korea
   including the growth of such powerful chaebol industry groups as
   Samsung, LG and SK. Globally, the period covered by this study featured
   the growth of new and more powerful digital networks epitomized by the
   internet. It also marked South Korea's transition from a development to
   a network state, allowing assessment of what the experience implies for
   developmental state theory.
   This research shows that the most convincing explanation for the decline
   of the Korean developmental state lies in its transformation into a
   network state. Nevertheless, it illustrates the continuing explanatory
   power of key concepts from the developmental state model, including a
   competent bureaucracy, a political system that allows the bureaucracy
   sufficient autonomy, market conforming methods for state intervention,
   and a ``control tower,{''} to guide industrial policy in the networked
   era. Korea's success suggests the value of technically trained leaders
   in the ICT sector, and in sharp contrast with Japan, the importance of
   the cross cultural experience and global outlook that many of them
   gained while studying at top universities in the U.S.
   For most of the three-plus decades in this study, the MIC served as
   Korea's control tower for the ICT sector, guiding policy and technology
   projects, and culminating in the 2006 U-Korea Master Plan, an ambitious
   blueprint for becoming the world's first ubiquitously networked nation.
   However, only two years later the Lee Myung-bak administration
   dismantled the ICT control tower in favor of a five year experiment with
   a liberal, market oriented approach to the ICT sector, much like policy
   in the United States. It was widely considered a failure and in 2013
   President Park Geun-hye restored the control tower function within the
   new ``super{''} Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning.
   The Korea experience also has more general implications for policymakers
   in the information age. These include the need for national, long-term
   policies, the vital role of education, ranging from highly specialized
   R\&D to broadly-based public-private sector efforts to ensure demand for
   services. While Korea's past success depended heavily on the manufacture
   and export of hardware and infrastructure, the President Park Geun-hye
   administration, with its emphasis on building a ``creative economy{''}
   signaled recognition that software, content and services will be more
   important than hardware in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{While the sales of mobile digital content have been growing
   exponentially, the understanding of its diffusion remains limited in the
   literature. In this study, we set out to enrich this understanding using
   a growth curve modelling approach. We applied four widely used growth
   curve models of innovation diffusion and compared their performance in
   explaining the diffusion of mobile digital content empirically. Analysis
   based on the data collected on a product adopted by nearly 30 million
   mobile phone users over a 149-week period in 31 regions in China
   revealed that the Gompertz model was the most effective model in
   depicting the diffusion process, with more than 99 \% of the variance
   explained. Moreover, we found that population, urbanization, education
   level, and mobile technology usage were significant determinants of
   various parameters such as the diffusion rate and inflection point of
   the diffusion process, respectively. Implications for both researchers
   and practitioners are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This special issue brings together a set of contributions that represent
   and explore the state of the art regarding the development and
   application of digital technology-enhanced research approaches in
   educational research-e-research for education. Over the recent years,
   digital technologies have enhanced various aspects of scholarly
   practices, such as data collection and analysis, research collaboration,
   and publishing. New technology-enhanced research approaches have been
   emerging in a number of educational research domains, such as learning
   analytics, educational data mining, digital ethnography and educational
   informatics. Although the potential of digital approaches has been
   generally acknowledged, many overarching conceptual and methodological
   questions remain unexplored and under-theorised. This special issue
   provides a landmark collection that synthesises some important empirical
   and methodological advances in this research field, including
   methodologically innovative case studies and critical analyses of
   overarching epistemological, methodological and practical issues that
   inevitably will shape future developments of this research field.}},

   Systems Condition Assessment Technologies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Condition assessment of wastewater collection systems is a vital part of
   a utility's asset management program. Reliable information on pipe
   condition is needed to prioritize rehabilitation and replacement
   projects, given the current state of our nation's infrastructure.
   Although inspections with conventional closed-circuit television (CCTV)
   have been the mainstay of pipeline condition assessment for decades,
   other technologies are now commercially available. Five of these
   innovative technologies were selected for field trials under the U. S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) demonstration program: zoom
   camera, electroscanning, digital scanning, laser profiling, and sonar.
   The goal of the field demonstration was to evaluate the technical
   performance and cost of these technologies. The field demonstration was
   conducted in August 2010 and was hosted by the Kansas City, Missouri
   Water Services Department. The innovative technologies were compared to
   CCTV inspection. Each technology identified maintenance and structural
   defects by collecting data or images of the pipe condition. The camera
   technologies (i.e., digital scanning, zoom camera, and CCTV) and laser
   scanning provided pipe condition above the water line, whereas sonar
   assessed conditions below the water line. Electroscanning detected
   leakage-related defects anywhere along the pipe circumference. Costs
   were compared for different inspection technologies based on actual
   costs for planning, field work, data analysis, and reporting. Total
   costs for the multisensor (digital, laser, and sonar scanning)
   inspection were \$14.71 per m of pipeline inspected as compared to
   \$10.31 per m for electroscanning, \$3.46 per m for zoom camera, and
   \$9.78 to \$10.48 per m for CCTV. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil

   Lausanne (EPFL) to perform medium and high throughput screening in life
   sciences-related projects. The BSF was conceived and developed to meet
   the needs of a wide range of researchers, without privileging a
   particular biological discipline or therapeutic area. The facility has
   the necessary infrastructure, multidisciplinary expertise and
   flexibility to perform large screening programs using small interfering
   RNAs (siRNAs) and chemical collections in the areas of chemical biology,
   systems biology and drug discovery. In the framework of the National
   Centres of Competence in Research (NCCR) Chemical Biology, the BSF is
   hosting `ACCESS', the Academic Chemical Screening Platform of
   Switzerland that provides the scientific community with chemical
   diversity, screening facilities and know-how in chemical genetics. In
   addition, the BSF started its own applied research axes that are driven
   by innovation in thematic areas related to preclinical drug discovery
   and discovery of bioactive probes.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Advances in technology have contributed to the obesity epidemic and
   worsened health by reducing opportunities for physical activity and by
   the proliferation of inexpensive calorie-dense foods. However, much of
   the same technology can be used to counter these troublesome trends by
   fostering the development and maintenance of healthy eating and physical
   activity habits. In contrast to intensive face-to-face treatments,
   technology-based interventions also have the potential to reach large
   numbers of individuals at low cost. The purpose of this review is to
   discuss studies in which digital technology has been used for behavioral
   weight control, report on advances in consumer technology that are
   widely adopted but insufficiently tested, and explore potential future
   directions for both. Web-based, mobile (eg, smartphone), virtual
   reality, and gaming technologies are the focus of discussion. The best
   evidence exists to support the use of digital technology for
   self-monitoring of weight-related behaviors and outcomes. However,
   studies are underway that will provide additional, important information
   regarding how best to apply digital technology for behavioral weight
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   The study aimed to create and evaluate the educational effectiveness of
   a digital resource instructing paediatric trainees in a systematic
   approach to critical and quality observation of normal child
   development.
   Methods
   A digital educational resource was developed utilising the skills of an
   expert developmental paediatrician who was videoed assessing normal
   early child development at a series of critical stages. Videos
   illustrated aspects of language, sophistication of play and
   socialisation, cognition, and motor progress. Expert commentary,
   teaching text and summaries were used. A randomised controlled trial
   evaluated the resource. Paediatric trainees were recruited from The
   Sydney Children's Hospitals Network. Outcome measures were repeated at
   three time points (pre-teaching, immediate-post and 1 month) and
   included self-rated attitudes, knowledge of markers of development and
   observational expertise. Qualitative data on teaching usefulness were
   obtained through open-ended questions.
   Results
   Fifty-six paediatric trainees (registrar 79\%, women 82\%; mean age 31
   years) completed the pre-assessment, 46 the immediate-post and 45 the
   1-month follow-up (20\% attrition). Compared with the Control group, the
   Teaching group scored higher over time on markers of development (P =
   0.006), observational expertise (P < 0.0001), confidence (P = 0.035) and
   satisfaction (P < 0.0001). Teaching participants valued the video and
   expert commentary and reported improvement in confidence and
   understanding and acquiring a more structured approach.
   Conclusions
   The `Beyond Milestones' free online resource for medical professionals <
   password=cunningham> improves knowledge, increases confidence and is
   useful, providing a structured approach to developmental assessment. The
   techniques taught can be applied to every paediatric consultation.}},

Abstract = {{The business model concept is not new and there has been an increasing
   number of papers published, fast growing communities on Business model's
   (BM) and an abundance of conference sessions and panels on the subject
   of BM's. Business model and business model innovation has been the focus
   of substantial attention by both academics and practitioners. However,
   it appears that researchers and practitioners have yet not researched
   widely on how sensors can be applied and embedded in BM's and what
   businesses can gain from sensing business models (Lindgren and Taran in
   J Green Eng 2:1-10, 2011). Society and Businesses today invest
   tremendous amount of resources in sensors and digitalization to achieve
   better and deeper understanding of their BMs. Taking these enormous
   amounts of resources invested into account, when creating a ``sensing
   BM{''} still turn out to be a very complex venture and has several
   invention iteration still to go before we reach a full scale ``sensing
   business model{''}. The paper shows different levels and attempt of
   sensing business models and shows these in reference of a definition and
   framework of a sensing business model. Five different businesses-working
   with different sensing BM's and sensor technology-are presented. The use
   cases show combination of biological and mechanical sensors together
   with physical and digital sensors. In combination the sensoring BM could
   lead businesses into a new area of business modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic government (e-Government) is one of the most important ways
   to bridge the digital divide in developing countries. We develop a model
   of e-Government portal use. We use various individual characteristics,
   namely demographics and personality, as predictors of e-Government
   portal use. Specifically, our predictors were (1) gender, age, income
   and education; (2) the Big Five personality characteristics, i.e.
   extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness
   to experience; and (3) personal innovativeness with information
   technology. We conducted a field study in a village in India. We
   collected data from over 300 heads of household. We found support for
   our model, with most variables being significant and explaining 40\% of
   the variance in e-Government portal use.}},

Abstract = {{Masonry walls are often subject to imposed lateral loading due to the
   action of the wind, but assessing their performance experimentally can
   be costly, time consuming and there can be safety implications. This
   paper presents a novel approach to allow testing of small-scale (1/6th)
   brick/block masonry wall panels with a uniformly applied lateral load.
   Self-weight effects were correctly considered in the study by conducting
   the tests within a centrifuge. An innovative 3D digital image
   correlation method was successfully employed to measure deflections over
   the entire specimen surface. The effect of mortar strength, for brick
   specimens, was assessed in the study and it was found that the failure
   load increased for stronger mortars. Results were consistent between
   repeat specimens, both in terms of failure load and observed crack
   pattern. In addition a specimen with a small opening and a brick/block
   cavity wall assembly were tested. The opening was found to have minimal
   effect on the failure load, but a different crack pattern was observed.
   The cavity wall failed at a lower load than that suggested by design
   codes. Theoretical failure loads were calculated by the established
   yield line analysis method and compared reasonably well to the
   experimental values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents different methods, some based on geometric algebra,
   for ultrasound probe tracking in endoscopic images, 3D allocation of the
   ultrasound probe, ultrasound image segmentation (to extract objects like
   tumors), and 3D reconstruction of the surface defined by a set of
   points. The tracking of the ultrasound probe in endoscopic images is
   done with a particle filter and an auxiliary method based on
   thresholding in the HSV space. The 3D pose of the ultrasound probe is
   calculated using conformal geometric algebra (to locate each slide in 3D
   space). Each slide (ultrasound image) is segmented using two methods:
   the level-set method and the morphological operators approach in order
   to obtain the object we are interested in. The points on the object of
   interest are obtained from the segmented ultrasound images, and then a
   3D object is obtained by refining the convex hull. To do that, a peeling
   process with an adaptive radius is applied, all of this in the geometric
   algebra framework. Results for points from ultrasound images, as well as
   for points from objects from the AimatShape Project, are presented
   (A.I.M.A.T.S.H.A.P.E. - Advanced an Innovative Models And Tools for the
   development of Semantic-based systems for Handling, Acquiring, and

Abstract = {{RATIONALEGlycan heterogeneity on recombinant human erythropoietin (rEPO)
   product is considered to be one of the critical quality attributes, and
   similarity tests of glycan heterogeneities are required in the
   manufacturing process changes and developments of biosimilars. A method
   for differentiating highly complex and diverse glycosylations is needed
   to evaluate comparability and biosimilarity among rEPO batches and
   products manufactured by different processes.
   METHODSThe glycan heterogeneities of nine rEPO products (four innovator
   products and five biosimilar products) were distinguished by
   multivariate analysis (MVA) using the peak area ratios of each glycan to
   the total peak area of glycans in mass spectra obtained by liquid
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) of N-glycans from rEPOs.
   RESULTSPrincipal component analysis (PCA) using glycan profiles obtained
   by LC/MS proved to be a useful method for differentiating glycan
   heterogeneities among nine rEPOs. Using PC values as indices, we were
   able to visualize and digitalize the glycan heterogeneities of each
   rEPO. The characteristic glycans of each rEPO were also successfully
   identified by orthogonal partial least-squares discrimination analysis
   (OPLS-DA), an MVA method, using the glycan profile data.
   CONCLUSIONSPCA values were useful for evaluating the relative
   differences among the glycan heterogeneities of rEPOs. The
   characteristic glycans that contributed to the differentiation were also
   successfully identified by OPLS-DA. PCA and OPLS-DA based on mass
   spectrometric data are applicable for distinguishing glycan
   heterogeneities, which are virtually indistinguishable on rEPO products.

Title = {{Low-intensity internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety
   symptoms in routine care: protocol for a randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Worldwide prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
   is considered high; in Europe lifetime prevalence has been estimated at
   4.3 to 5.9\%. High levels of anxiety disorders have been reported in
   university students, affecting 25 to 30\% of the population. Young
   adults are some of the most vulnerable for the onset of mental health
   disorders and any stressors may act as a catalyst for their onset. The
   absence of resources can often mean that many do not seek treatment.
   Other factors that impede access to resources include such things as a
   lack of trained professionals, personal stigma, and waiting lists.
   Anxiety disorders can be treated successfully; indeed brief forms of
   cognitive-behavior therapy have been recommended. One potential avenue
   for research and development is that of delivering low-intensity
   interventions online for students with GAD. Therefore, the current study
   seeks to investigate the potential effectiveness for a low-intensity
   online CBT-based treatment for GAD in a service-based setting;
   implemented as one step in a stepped-care model.
   Methods/Design: The research is a service-based effectiveness study
   utilizing a randomized waiting-list controlled design. The active
   intervention consists of six weekly modules of online CBT. Participants
   are assigned a supporter who provides weekly post-session feedback on
   progress and exercises. Participants will complete the GAD-7 as the
   primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes include pathological worry,
   depression and measures of well-being. At three-months follow-up data
   will be collected using the GAD-7, BDI-II, PSWQ, ED-Q5 and WSAS.
   Post-session data will be collected on significant in-session events in
   treatment (HAT). A satisfaction with treatment measure will be
   administered post-treatment (SAT).
   \textbackslash{}Discussion: The study will be a contribution to the
   potential for a low-intensity internet-delivered program implemented in
   a service-based setting; implemented as one step in a stepped-care
   model. The study will be a contribution to the already established work
   in online treatments for anxiety worldwide. The study will assess the
   utility of an innovative digital health solution (SilverCloud) to
   deliver such interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidics (DMF) is a powerful technique for simple and
   precise manipulation of microscale droplets of fluid. This technique
   enables processing and analysis of a wide variety of samples and
   reagents and has proven useful in a broad range of chemical, biological,
   and medical applications. Handling of ``real-world{''} samples has been
   a challenge, however, because typically their volumes are greater than
   those easily accommodated by DMF devices and contain analytes of
   interest at low concentration. To address this challenge, we have
   developed a novel ``world-to-DMF{''} interface in which an integrated
   companion module drives the large-volume sample through a 10 mu L
   droplet region on the DMF device, enabling magnet-mediated recovery of
   bead-bound analytes onto the device as they pass through the region. To
   demonstrate its utility, we use this system for extraction of RNA from
   human whole blood lysates (110-380 mu L) and further purification in
   microscale volumes (5-15 mu L) on the DMF device itself. Processing by
   the system was >2-fold faster and consumed 12-fold less reagents, yet
   produced RNA yields and quality fully comparable to conventional
   preparations and supporting qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq analyses. The
   world-to-DMF system is designed for flexibility in accommodating
   different sample types and volumes, as well as for facile integration of
   additional modules to enable execution of more complex protocols for
   sample processing and analysis. As the first technology of its kind,
   this innovation represents an important step forward for DMF, further
   enhancing its utility for a wide range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyses the recent Facebook innovation of ``frictionless
   sharing{''}, a term which describes a smoother and wider distribution of
   content by individual users and a less overtly acknowledged but more
   efficient instrumentalization of users' immaterial labour within a
   structure of corporate monetization. It builds on my recent work on
   ``the sharing subject{''} of contemporary digital media, in which I
   argue that current online social networking practices, in their emphasis
   on ``sharing{''} content with networks of contacts, construct and
   validate the networked subject according to a version of neoliberal
   individualism. Moreover, the construction of this subject position
   implicitly recalls the heteronormativity of AIDS panic, through an
   unlikely rebranding of promiscuity as a desirable and successful mode of
   interactivity. If the new rhetoric of ``sharing{''} erases the riskiness
   of circulation previously encoded in dominant images of virality,
   notably behaviours associated with HIV, then what is the relationship of
   the projected potential of ``frictionless sharing{''} to existing
   normative frames of ethics and morality? In approaching this question, I
   revisit significant queer interventions into concepts of community and
   risk that emerged in the post-AIDS context, notably Tim Dean's recent
   examination of the barebacking subculture to which mediations of an
   idealized frictionlessness are also central.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of digital data today has been increasing at a phenomenal
   rate due to the widespread digitalisation service in almost every
   industry. The need to store such ever-increasing data aggressively
   triggers the requirement to augment the storage capacity of the
   conventional storage technologies. Unfortunately, the physical
   limitations that conventional forms face have severely handicapped their
   potential to meet the storage need from both consumer and industry point
   of view. The focus has therefore been switched into the development of
   the innovative data storage technologies such as scanning probe memory,
   nanocrystal memory, carbon nanotube memory, DNA memory, and organic
   memory. In this paper, we review the physical principles of these
   emerging storage technologies and their superiorities as the next
   generation data storage device, as well as their respective technical
   challenges on further enhancing the storage capacity. We also compare
   these novel technologies with the mainstream data storage means
   according to the technology roadmap on areal density.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional radar sensing typically employs matched filtering between
   the received signal and the shape of the transmitted pulse. Matched
   filtering (MF) is conventionally carried out digitally, after sampling
   the received analog signals. Here, principles from classic sampling
   theory are generally employed, requiring that the received signals be
   sampled at twice their baseband bandwidth. The resulting sampling rates
   necessary for correlation-based radar systems become quite high, as
   growing demands for target distinction capability and spatial resolution
   stretch the bandwidth of the transmitted pulse. The large amounts of
   sampled data also necessitate vast memory capacity. In addition,
   real-time data processing typically results in high power consumption.
   Recently, new approaches for radar sensing and estimation were
   introduced, based on the finite rate of innovation (FRI) and Xampling
   frameworks. Exploiting the parametric nature of radar signals, these
   techniques allow significant reduction in sampling rate, implying
   potential power savings, while maintaining the system's estimation
   capabilities at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Here we
   present for the first time a design and implementation of an
   Xampling-based hardware prototype that allows sampling of radar signals
   at rates much lower than Nyquist. We demonstrate by real-time analog
   experiments that our system is able to maintain reasonable recovery
   capabilities, while sampling radar signals that require sampling at a
   rate of about 30 MHz at a total rate of 1 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Many countries, regions and education districts in the world have
   experimented with models of one-device-per-student as an enabler of new
   or effective pedagogies supported by mobile technologies. Researchers
   have also designed innovations or interventions for possible adoption by
   schools or for informal learning. Of critical interest to the community
   is the question of how the more successful of these top-down or
   bottom-up models or innovations can proliferate to more usage, adoption
   and adaptation across levels of the education system. This paper
   describes a research programme that demonstrates how to make successful
   research innovations count in practice and that delineates what types of
   educational R\&D involving scaling need to take place to make the
   critical link to impacting practice. We do this in the context of one
   such curricular innovation in a Singapore school that moves through the
   various phases to where the innovation is becoming an integral part of
   routine classroom practices.}},

Abstract = {{An inquiry-based learning pedagogy coupled with a seamless learning
   environment is a potential way to realise the educational goal of
   learner-centred learning in digital classrooms in the 21st century. An
   overarching research framework is proposed for preparing teachers to
   effectively develop pedagogical designs that are premised on theoretical
   principles and facilitate inquiry-based learning in a seamless learning
   environment. We carried out an initial study using the overarching
   framework. Three questions are addressed: how a principle-based
   pedagogical design was developed and implemented, the effect that the
   principle-based pedagogical design had on students' domain knowledge
   gains and inquiry skills and how students advanced their domain
   knowledge and developed their inquiry skills. One teacher and 27
   students from a local primary school were involved in the study. Both
   qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed over two
   weeks. Six inquiry-based learning lessons focusing on a scientific
   `rustproofing' learning unit were conducted in a seamless learning
   environment, initiated in a digital classroom and extended to online
   discussions on a social network platform. The results reveal innovative
   ways of developing and implementing the pedagogical design in the
   rustproofing learning unit and demonstrate the pedagogical design's
   positive effect on students' domain knowledge gains and inquiry skills.
   In addition, how the students advanced their domain knowledge and
   inquiry skills were also explored and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic resistance is a major risk to human health, and to provide
   valuable insights into mechanisms of resistance, innovative methods are
   needed to examine the cellular responses to antibiotic treatment.
   Focused ion beam tomography is proposed to image and assess the detailed
   three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructure of single bacterial cells. By
   iteratively removing slices of thickness in the order of 10 nm, high
   magnification 2D images can be acquired by scanning electron microscopy
   at single-digit nanometer resolution. In this study, Klebsiella
   pneumoniae was treated with polymyxin B, and 3D models of both cell
   envelope and cytoplasm regions containing the nucleoid and ribosomes
   were reconstructed. The 3D volume containing the nucleoid and ribosomes
   was significantly smaller, and the cell length along the longitudinal
   axis was extended by 40\% in the treated cells, implying stress
   responses to the drug treatment. More than a 200\% increase in
   protrusions per unit surface area on the cell envelope was observed in
   the curvature analysis after treatment. Experiments by conventional
   transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were also
   performed, followed by comparison and discussions. In conclusion, the
   proposed 3D imaging method and associated analysis provide a unique tool
   for the assessment of antibiotic effects on multidrug-resistant bacteria
   at nanometer resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Analog filters are key blocks in analog signal processing. They are
   widely employed in many systems, like wireless transceivers, detectors
   read-out, sensors interfaces, etc. The IC technology choice for such
   systems is mainly dictated by the requirements of high speed and low
   power consumption of digital circuits. This pushed an impressive
   movement towards scaled technology and this has important consequences
   on the analog circuits design. The impact of technology scaling down to
   nanometre scale on analog filters design is here investigated. For
   instance, supply voltage reduction in analog filters limits circuits
   design solutions and could result in higher power consumption. Moreover,
   at the same time, innovative systems push analog filters to get higher
   and higher operation frequencies, due to the increasing bandwidth/speed
   requirements. Recent solutions for efficient low-voltage and high
   frequency analog filters in nanometre technology are described.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to understand what determines the degree of
   e-government use for multiple purposes by analyzing the Government
   Online Survey data that the Pew Internet and American Life Project
   provide. Three main purposes of e-government use are identified as:
   service use, information use, and policy research. The degree of
   e-government use for a specific purpose is predicted by five sets of
   determinants: psychological factors of technology adoption, civic
   mindedness, information channels, trust in government, and
   socio-demographic and personal characteristics. Sociodemographic
   conditions influence usage level of various transactional services
   provided by e-government. Perceived ease of use facilitates the
   acquisition of general information through e-government. Civicness is a
   critical determinant of e-government use for policy research. Policy
   researchers who are more engaged with and concerned about society,
   neighbors, and government are emerging as a new class of e-government
   users. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Smart actuators are the key components in a variety of nanopositioning
   applications, such as scanning probe microscopes and atomic force
   microscopes. Piezoelectric actuators are the most common smart actuators
   due to their high resolution, low power consumption, and wide operating
   frequency but they suffer hysteresis which affects linearity. In this
   paper, an innovative digital charge amplifier is presented to reduce
   hysteresis in piezoelectric stack actuators. Compared to traditional
   analog charge drives, experimental results show that the piezoelectric
   stack actuator driven by the digital charge amplifier has less
   hysteresis. It is also shown that the voltage drop of the digital charge
   amplifier is significantly less than the voltage drop of conventional
   analog charge amplifiers. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This article takes departure in Barbara Czarniawska's discussion of
   `Nomadic Work as Life-Story Plot'. It contextualises her analysis of
   actors' interpretations of nomadic work with a bi-focal review of the
   ambiguous realities of these phenomena. Firstly, an examination of key
   aspects of the socio-economic and political context of nomadic work in
   global neoliberal economies reveals precarious conditions that cloud
   romantic interpretations of nomadicity. Secondly, a review of studies of
   everyday practices of nomadic work shows how neoliberal, but also
   alternative futures are enacted through creative appropriation of
   collaborative technologies. One example is the work of digital `disaster
   deck' volunteers and its potential for the mobilization of `rapid,
   highly localized assistance' through closer collaboration between a
   distributed crowd, local communities, and official emergency responders
   (Starbird and Palen 2013). This and other examples suggest emergent new
   practices and politics of dwelling in mobility that are focused on
   sociality and collaboration, straddling virtual and physical commons.
   The twin critique developed in this response can augment narrative
   analysis to inform more integrated CSCW innovation that challenges the
   `brave new world of work'.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, have
   been shown to carry a variety of biomacromolecules including mRNA,
   microRNA and other non-coding RNAs. Within the past 5 years, EVs have
   emerged as a promising minimally invasive novel source of material for
   molecular diagnostics. Although EVs can be easily identified and
   collected from biological fluids, further research and proper validation
   is needed in order for them to be useful in the clinical setting. In
   addition, innovative and more efficient means of nucleic acid profiling
   are needed to facilitate investigations into the cellular and molecular
   mechanisms of EV function and to establish their potential as useful
   clinical biomarkers and therapeutic tools. In this article, we provide
   an overview of recent technological improvements in both upstream EV
   isolation and downstream analytical technologies, including digital PCR
   and next generation sequencing, highlighting future prospects for
   EV-based molecular diagnostics.}},

   independent of the provider. Compared to a Cross-Enterprise Document

Abstract = {{This article aims to provide some elements of an evolutionary theory of
   property rights. It applies a systems-based capital-theoretic
   perspective to explain the formation and transformation of property
   rights structures. The approach emphasizes how entrepreneurs create
   capital combinations by connecting capital goods-defined widely to
   include property rights, such as patents-in their production plans.
   Their actions change complementarity relations between property rights
   as used in production. We treat the property rights structure as a
   complex adaptive system that exhibits increasing structural complexity
   as it evolves. Entrepreneurs discover gaps in the property rights
   system. As they organize production to exploit profit opportunities,
   entrepreneurs regroup existing intellectual property rights (IPR) into
   new modules, such as patent pools, that encapsulate more complex
   combinations of basic building blocks of intellectual property. A patent
   pool constitutes an interpolation of a new meso level within the macro
   IPR structure. We apply our framework to the first of the patent pools
   for digital video compression technology used in digital television and
   DVDs.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual work has become an increasingly central practice for the
   organization of the 21st century. While effective virtual workgroups can
   create synergies that boost innovation and performance, ineffective
   workgroups become a great burden for organizations. Empirical research
   has shown that some negative behaviors, such as social loafing,
   negatively influence a group's affective outcomes, in both collocated
   (face-to-face) and virtual workgroups. In this study, we explore if
   working through low fidelity computer mediated communication (CMC)
   increases the negative impact of perceived loafing over cohesion and
   work satisfaction. On this rationale, we conducted a laboratory study
   with 44 groups of four members each, who worked on a project in four
   sessions over a one-month period, in either face-to-face or low fidelity
   CMC conditions. Results show that the communication media condition
   moderates the effect of perceived loafing in the expected direction,
   meaning that, in the low fidelity CMC condition perceived loafing had an
   increased negative effect on group cohesion and satisfaction with the
   work process and its results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{For nearly ten years the Colombian government has systematically
   debriefed men and women who have left the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
   Colombia (FARC) and other violent extremist organizations. Today, the
   Colombian government maintains a database of more than 15,000 digitized
   interview transcripts-the largest of its kind in the world. With the
   proper enhancements and analysis, the database can provide critical
   insights into topics such as extremist recruitment, motivation,
   information operations, intelligence activities, leadership, and
   tactical and operational adaptation and innovation. Although Colombia's
   political violence is unique in many respects, further research using
   the database contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of
   insurgency in other regions. Ultimately, this research could enhance
   efforts to prevent recruitment into, and encourage current members to
   exit from violent non-state groups, such as gangs, terrorist groups,
   militias, and drug trafficking organizations.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To test if virtual endoscopy (VE) enabled by 3-dimensional
   computed tomographic (CT) scanner with supporting software allows for
   practical clinical interrogation and evaluation of the urethral lumen
   and anatomy in an animal model.
   METHODS Assessment of urethral anatomy and repair results was performed
   in 18 male beagles using conventional retrograde urethrography,
   CT-assisted retrograde urethography, and voiding urethrocystography. The
   image slices from these studies were processed using TeraRecon software
   to create a virtual representation of the urethra and compared with
   conventional urethrography and postmortem analysis of retrieved urethras
   for diagnostic assessment and correlation.
   RESULTS CT-assisted VE showed the orientation, size, and gross
   morphology of urethral anatomy, including the lesions in all the 18
   animals studied. The VE showed patent urethra in 12 dogs, stenosed
   urethra in 3 dogs, urethral diverticulum with stricture in 2 animals,
   and fistula in one. These findings correlated with those of conventional
   diagnostic methods. The findings of the voiding and retrograde virtual
   urethrocystoscopy studies were also comparable.
   CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that CT-assisted VE is able to
   identify the anatomic landmarks in an animal model. This allows for
   detection of the site of different pathologies and their relations to
   important structures such as urethral sphincters and the bladder neck.
   Digital imaging might be used to identify urethral pathologies with
   greater details and characterization of the lesions when compared with
   the conventional urethrocystography. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Documentation of research data plays a key role in the biomedical
   engineering innovation processes. It makes an important contribution to
   the protection of intellectual property, the traceability of results and
   fulfilling the regulatory requirement. Because of the increasing
   digitalization in laboratories, an electronic alternative to the
   commonly-used paper-bound notebooks could contribute to the production
   of sophisticated documentation. However, compared to in an industrial
   environment, the use of electronic laboratory notebooks is not
   widespread in academic laboratories. Little is known about the
   acceptance of an electronic documentation system and the underlying
   reasons for this. Thus, this paper aims to establish a prediction model
   on the potential preference and acceptance of scientists either for
   paper-based or electronic documentation. The underlying data for the
   analysis originate from an online survey of 101 scientists in
   industrial, academic and clinical environments. Various parameters were
   analyzed to identify crucial factors for the system preference using
   binary logistic regression. The analysis showed significant dependency
   between the documentation system preference and the supposed workload
   associated with the documentation system (p < 0.006; odds ratio =
   58.543) and an additional personal component. Because of the dependency
   of system choice on specific parameters it is possible to predict the
   acceptance of an electronic laboratory notebook before implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The new ubiquitous interaction methods change people's life and
   facilitate their tasks in everyday life and in the workplace, enabling
   people to access their personal data as well as public resources at any
   time and in any place. We found two solutions to enable ubiquitous
   interaction and put a stop to the limits imposed by the desktop mode:
   namely nomadism and mobility. Based on these two solutions, we have
   proposed three interfaces (Zhou et al. in HCI international 2011:
   human-computer interaction. Interaction techniques and environments,
   Springer, Berlin, pp 500-509, 2011): in-environment interface (IEI),
   environment dependent interface (EDI), and environment independent
   interface (EII). In this paper, we first discuss an overview of IEI,
   EDI, and EII, before excluding IEI and focusing on EDI and EII, their
   background, and distinct characteristics. We also propose a continuum
   from physical paper-based interface to digital projected interface in
   relation with EDI and EII. Then, to validate EDI and EII concepts, we
   design and implement a MobilePaperAccess system, which is a wearable
   camera-glasses system with paper-based interface and original input
   techniques allowing mobile interaction. Furthermore, we discuss the
   evaluation of the MobilePaperAccess system; we compare two interfaces
   (EDI and EII) and three input techniques (finger input, mask input, and
   page input) to test the feasibility and usability of this system. Both
   the quantitative and qualitative results are reported and discussed.
   Finally, we provide the prospects and our future work for improving the
   current approaches.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of a monostatic pulse-Doppler radar
   transceiver trying to detect targets sparsely populated in the radar's
   unambiguous time-frequency region. Several past works employ compressed
   sensing (CS) algorithms to this type of problem but either do not
   address sample rate reduction, impose constraints on the radar
   transmitter, propose CS recovery methods with prohibitive dictionary
   size, or perform poorly in noisy conditions. Here, we describe a
   sub-Nyquist sampling and recovery approach called Doppler focusing,
   which addresses all of these problems: it performs low rate sampling and
   digital processing, imposes no restrictions on the transmitter, and uses
   a CS dictionary with size, which does not increase with increasing
   number of pulses P. Furthermore, in the presence of noise, Doppler
   focusing enjoys a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement, which scales
   linearly with P, obtaining good detection performance even at SNR as low
   as - 25 dB. The recovery is based on the Xampling framework, which
   allows reduction of the number of samples needed to accurately represent
   the signal, directly in the analog-to-digital conversion process. After
   sampling, the entire digital recovery process is performed on the low
   rate samples without having to return to the Nyquist rate. Finally, our
   approach can be implemented in hardware using a previously suggested
   Xampling radar prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 20 years, imaging informatics has been driven by the
   widespread adoption of radiology information and picture archiving and
   communication and speech recognition systems. These three clinical
   information systems are commonplace and are intuitive to most
   radiologists as they replicate familiar paper and film workflow. So what
   is next? There is a surge of innovation in imaging informatics around
   advanced workflow, search, electronic medical record aggregation,
   dashboarding, and analytics tools for quality measures (Nance et al.,
   AJR Am J Roentgenol 200:1064-1070, 2013). The challenge lies in not
   having to rebuild the technological wheel for each of these new
   applications but instead attempt to share common components through open
   standards and modern development techniques. The next generation of
   applications will be built with moving parts that work together to
   satisfy advanced use cases without replicating databases and without
   requiring fragile, intense synchronization from clinical systems. The
   purpose of this paper is to identify building blocks that can position a
   practice to be able to quickly innovate when addressing clinical,
   educational, and research-related problems. This paper is the result of
   identifying common components in the construction of over two dozen
   clinical informatics projects developed at the University of Maryland
   Radiology Informatics Research Laboratory. The systems outlined are
   intended as a mere foundation rather than an exhaustive list of possible
   extensions.}},

Abstract = {{Information Communication Technology (ICT) has a significant impact on
   the socioeconomic development of a country. However, the inequitable
   access to ICT still remains a major issue in developing countries. In
   this context, this study examines ICT knowledge infrastructure in South
   Asia from a network point of view. Existing research on ICTs are useful
   in understanding the common facts, but are limited in revealing the
   hidden structures and properties of the ICT research domain in South
   Asia. The hidden structures and properties, like key players, network of
   key players for scientific collaborations, and their network
   characteristics are analyzed and synthesized in this study. This study
   applies the mixed approach of Social Network Analysis techniques and
   Triple Helix indicators on scholarly papers obtained from the Web of
   Science database. Further, burst detection algorithm is applied on
   keywords appearing in the titles of the South Asian ICT scholarly papers
   to understand the emerging trends in the ICT research domain. This study
   helps in providing a better understanding of current trends, strengths,
   and weaknesses of ICT in South Asia, which provides a better
   understanding to bridge the digital divide and achieve socioeconomic
   development through ICT.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the implications of the predicted big data
   revolution in social sciences for the research using the Triple Helix
   (TH) model of innovation and knowledge creation in the context of
   developing and transitional economies. While big data research promises
   to transform the nature of social inquiry and improve the world economy
   by increasing the productivity and competitiveness of companies and
   enhancing the functioning of the public sector, it may also potentially
   lead to a growing divide in research capabilities between developed and
   developing economies. More specifically, given the uneven access to
   digital data and scarcity of computational resources and talent,
   developing countries are at disadvantage when it comes to employing
   data-driven, computational methods for studying the TH relations between
   universities, industries and governments. Scientometric analysis of the
   TH literature conducted in this study reveals a growing disparity
   between developed and developing countries in their use of innovative
   computational research methods. As a potential remedy, the extension of
   the TH model is proposed to include non-market actors as subjects of
   study as well as potential providers of computational resources,
   education and training.}},

Title = {{The Development of an Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring for
   Adolescents: Methodologic Approach and User Acceptability}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many adolescents suffer serious asthma related morbidity
   that can be prevented by adequate self-management of the disease. The
   accurate symptom monitoring by patients is the most fundamental
   antecedent to effective asthma management. Nonetheless, the adequacy and
   effectiveness of current methods of symptom self-monitoring have been
   challenged due to the individuals' fallible symptom perception, poor
   adherence, and inadequate technique. Recognition of these limitations
   led to the development of an innovative device that can facilitate
   continuous and accurate monitoring of asthma symptoms with minimal
   disruption of daily routines, thus increasing acceptability to
   adolescents.
   Objective: The objectives of this study were to: (1) describe the
   development of a novel symptom monitoring device for teenagers (teens),
   and (2) assess their perspectives on the usability and acceptability of
   the device.
   Methods: Adolescents (13-17 years old) with and without asthma
   participated in the evolution of an automated device for asthma
   monitoring (ADAM), which comprised three phases, including development
   (Phase 1, n=37), validation/user acceptability (Phase 2, n=84), and post
   hoc validation (Phase 3, n= 10). In Phase 1, symptom algorithms were
   identified based on the acoustic analysis of raw symptom sounds and
   programmed into a popular mobile system, the iPod. Phase 2 involved a 7
   day trial of ADAM in vivo, and the evaluation of user acceptance using
   an acceptance survey and individual interviews. ADAM was further
   modified and enhanced in Phase 3.
   Results: Through ADAM, incoming audio data were digitized and processed
   in two steps involving the extraction of a sequence of descriptive
   feature vectors, and the processing of these sequences by a hidden
   Markov model-based Viterbi decoder to differentiate symptom sounds from
   background noise. The number and times of detected symptoms were stored
   and displayed in the device. The sensitivity (true positive) of the
   updated cough algorithm was 70\% (21/30), and, on average, 2 coughs per
   hour were identified as false positive. ADAM also kept track of the
   their activity level throughout the day using the mobile system's built
   in accelerometer function. Overall, the device was well received by
   participants who perceived it as attractive, convenient, and helpful.
   The participants recognized the potential benefits of the device in
   asthma care, and were eager to use it for their asthma management.
   Conclusions: ADAM can potentially automate daily symptom monitoring with
   minimal intrusiveness and maximal objectivity. The users' acceptance of
   the device based on its recognized convenience, user-friendliness, and
   usefulness in increasing symptom awareness underscores ADAM's potential
   to overcome the issues of symptom monitoring including poor adherence,
   inadequate technique, and poor symptom perception in adolescents.

Abstract = {{Although a proficient knowledge of the road rules is important to safe
   driving, many drivers do not retain the knowledge acquired after they
   have obtained their licenses. Hence, more innovative and appealing
   methods are needed to improve drivers' knowledge of the road rules. This
   study examines the effect of game based learning on drivers' knowledge
   acquisition and retention. We find that playing an entertaining game
   that is designed to impart knowledge of the road rules not only improves
   players' knowledge but also helps them retain such knowledge. Hence,
   learning by gaming appears to be a promising learning approach for

Abstract = {{Berlin is a German city and federal state, situated in the heart of
   Europe. It has been the capital city since 1991, and is the largest city
   in the country with around 3.4 million inhabitants. This profile
   explains Berlin's historical development and emphasizes changes which
   took place during the 20th century (the Weimar period in the 1920s,
   followed by the Nazi takeover in 1933 and the city's destruction during
   World War II, then the division of the city into West Berlin and East
   Berlin, until its final reunification in 1990 after the Wall fell down).
   After reunification, Berlin experienced a new period of urban
   redevelopment in which many new buildings were constructed. This profile
   also outlines some recent positive changes in terms of Berlin's economic
   growth and its transformation into the capital of innovative new
   companies in the digital, culture and media industries. (C) 2013

Title = {{Skeletal muscle wasting with disuse atrophy is multi-dimensional: the
   response and interaction of myonuclei, satellite cells and signaling
   pathways}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance of skeletal muscle is essential for health and survival.
   There are marked losses of skeletal muscle mass as well as strength and
   physiological function under conditions of low mechanical load, such as
   space flight, as well as ground based models such as bed rest,
   immobilization, disuse, and various animal models. Disuse atrophy is
   caused by mechanical unloading of muscle and this leads to reduced
   muscle mass without fiber attrition. Skeletal muscle stem cells
   (satellite cells) and myonuclei are integrally involved in skeletal
   muscle responses to environmental changes that induce atrophy.
   Myonuclear domain size is influenced differently in fast and slow twitch
   muscle, but also by different models of muscle wasting, a factor that is
   not yet understood. Although the myonuclear domain is 3-dimensional this
   is rarely considered. Apoptosis as a mechanism for myonuclear loss with
   atrophy is controversial, whereas cell death of satellite cells has not
   been considered. Molecular signals such as myostatin/SMAD pathway,
   MAFbx, and MuRF1 E3 ligases of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and
   IGF1-AKT-mTOR pathway are 3 distinctly different contributors to
   skeletal muscle protein adaptation to disuse. Molecular signaling
   pathways activated in muscle fibers by disuse are rarely considered
   within satellite cells themselves despite similar exposure to unloading
   or low mechanical load. These molecular pathways interact with each
   other during atrophy and also when various interventions are applied
   that could alleviate atrophy. Re-applying mechanical load is an obvious
   method to restore muscle mass, however how nutrient supplementation
   (e.g., amino acids) may further enhance recovery (or reduce atrophy
   despite unloading or ageing) is currently of great interest. Satellite
   cells are particularly responsive to myostatin and to growth factors.
   Recently, the hibernating squirrel has been identified as an innovative
   model to study resistance to atrophy.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, an extensive inventory in the literature of water
   erosion modelling from a geospatial point of view is conducted. Concepts
   of scale, spatiality and complexity are explored and clarified in a
   theoretical background. Use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is
   pointed out as facilitating data mixing and model rescaling and thus
   increasing complexity in data-method relations. Spatial scale, temporal
   scale and spatial methodologies are addressed as the most determining
   geospatial properties underlying water erosion modelling. Setting these
   properties as classification criteria, 82 water erosion models are
   identified and classified into eight categories. As a result, a complete
   overview of water erosion models becomes available in a single table.
   The biggest share of the models is found in the category of the
   mechanistic pathway-type event-based models for watershed to landscape
   scales. In parallel, geospatial innovations that could be considered as
   milestones in water erosion modelling are highlighted and discussed. An
   alphabetical list of all models is also listed in the Appendix. For
   manipulating scale efficiently, two promising spatial theories are
   suggested for further exploitation in the future such as hierarchy
   theory and fractals theory. Regarding erosion applications, uncertainty
   analysis within GIS is considered to be necessary for further improving
   performance of erosion models.}},

   At the same time, the formulation of this exercise addresses the need to
   provide information future professionals new tools according to the

   his film Lincoln (2012).
   Based on previous experiences in the field of Computer-Supported
   Collaborative Learning (CSCL) and taking as reference model the critical

Title = {{Assessing the Hydro-Mechanical Behavior of Collapsible Soils Using a
   Modified Triaxial Test Device}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Unsaturated loessial Aeolian deposits tend to experience significant
   volumetric compression when subjected to loading. This behavior is
   generally attributed to their open, unstable soil fabric and their weak
   inter-particle bonding forces, which together yield a soil void
   structure that is susceptible to collapse. The current study examines
   two possible mechanisms of pore collapse in a loessial soil: pore
   collapse induced by an increase in net confining stresses under constant
   matric suction conditions, such as what occurs when a new structure is
   constructed on top of a collapsible soil deposit, and pore collapse
   induced by a change in matric suction conditions under a constant net
   confining stress, such as what occurs when a collapsible soil deposit
   beneath an existing structure experiences significant wetting due to a
   large precipitation event. To accomplish this task, an innovative test
   approach was used to assess the hydro-mechanical behavior of a highly
   collapsible loessial soil. The test setup incorporates a set of
   electronic pressure regulators coupled with three electronic pressure
   sensors to measure and control the applied pressures, and two
   high-precision digital volume change measuring devices to measure
   changes in the volume of the specimen and its degree of saturation.
   Using this approach, ``undisturbed{''} loess specimens are subjected to
   either isotropic compression at a constant matric suction, or
   wetting-induced collapse at a constant mean net stress. Results indicate
   that the hydro-mechanical behavior of collapsible soils is considerably
   stress-path dependent. For the same values of mean net stress, the
   deformation measurements of specimens subjected to isotropic compression
   were often larger than those subjected to wetting-induced collapse. For
   the isotropic compression tests, it was shown that the soil water
   retention curve of the soil depends on the mean net stress. Less
   sensitivity to the mean net stress was observed for specimens subjected
   towetting-induced collapse.}},

Abstract = {{Line drawings and digital arts appear everywhere, from simple icons and
   logos to cartoons, maps, and illustrations. We define art patterns as
   the subset of line drawings and digital arts that are comprised of
   repeated elements. There exist textures that share characteristics with
   art patterns. Examples of such textures include piled discrete elements
   with curved contours. Inspired by recent success of exemplar-based
   texture synthesis, in this paper, we focus on synthesizing art patterns
   and textures with curvilinear features from exemplars, which we cast as
   a global optimization problem. Our energy function for this problem
   measures both the appearance similarity of color patterns and shape
   similarity of curvilinear features between an input exemplar and a
   synthesized image. We develop an overall expectation-maximization-style
   algorithm for minimizing this energy function. The shape similarity part
   of the energy is minimized through an innovative application of the
   level set method. We further generalize our energy function and
   optimization algorithm to multilayer pattern and texture synthesis. Our
   generalized optimization can effectively handle multiple layers and
   synthesize valid instances of interaction.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, mobile device-assisted clinical education has become
   popular among nursing school students. The introduction of mobile
   devices saves manpower and reduces errors while enhancing nursing
   students' professional knowledge and skills. To respond to the demands
   of various learning strategies and to maintain existing systems of
   education, the concept of Cloud Learning is gradually being introduced
   to instructional environments. Cloud computing facilitates learning that
   is personalized, diverse, and virtual. This study involved assessing the
   advantages of mobile devices and Cloud Learning in a public health
   practice course, in which Google+ was used as the learning platform,
   integrating various application tools. Users could save and access data
   by using any wireless Internet device. The platform was student centered
   and based on resource sharing and collaborative learning. With the
   assistance of highly flexible and convenient technology, certain
   obstacles in traditional practice training can be resolved. Our findings
   showed that the students who adopted Google+ were learned more
   effectively compared with those who were limited to traditional learning
   systems. Most students and the nurse educator expressed a positive
   attitude toward and were satisfied with the innovative learning method.}},

Abstract = {{Seit 2007 verfolgt das Centre Pompidou, eines der bedeutendsten Museen
   fur zeitgenossische Kunst in Paris, eine neue digitale Strategie, um
   online verfugbaren Content weltweit abrufbar zu machen: das Digitale
   Centre Pompidou. Diese Plattform erlaubt den Zugriff auf die gesamte
   digitale Produktion des Museums sowie der ihm angegliederten
   Einrichtungen uber einen einzelnen Sucheinstieg. Der innovative auf
   Hypertexten basierende Ansatz beschert dem Besucher der Plattform oft
   unerwartete Entdeckungen und war das Resultat einer intensiven
   Auseinandersetzung mit dem Nutzerverhalten, moglich wurde er durch den
   Einsatz von Semantic-Web-Technologie. In Zukunft sollen die Nutzer der
   Seite noch starker eingebunden werden,damit sie den Content auch
   inhaltlich mitgestalten konnen.
   Since 2007, the Centre Pompidou, the major modern art museum in Paris,
   has been developing a new digital strategy aimed at providing a global
   platform for online digital content: the Digital Centre Pompidou. This
   platform provides access via a single entry point to the whole digital
   production of the organization and associated institutions. The
   combination of Semantic Web technologies and intensive research on
   end-user interface issues has resulted in an innovative approach to
   digital content based on hypertextual navigation which favours
   serendipity and unpredicted discoveries. Future evolutions of the
   platform also include involving users in constructing the meaning or
   semantics of the content.}},

Pages = {{58-77}},
Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{Strategic agility evokes contradictions, such as stability-flexibility,
   commitment-change, and established routines-novel approaches. These
   competing demands pose challenges that require paradoxical leadership
   practices seeking creative, both/and solutions that can enable
   fast-paced, adaptable decision making. Why is managing paradox critical
   to strategic agility? And which practices enable leaders to effectively
   manage tensions? This article describes the paradoxical nature of
   strategic agility. Drawing from data from five firms, Astro Studios,
   Digital Divide Data, IBM Global Services Canada, Lego, and Unilever it
   proposes leadership practices to effectively respond to these
   challenges.}},

Abstract = {{The creative industries face a constantly changing competitive
   environment: dematerialized transactions, market extensions, new
   offerings and new customer relations. As a result, constant innovations
   in organizational arrangements and business models have become a
   competitive advantage and threaten traditional models. They frequently
   refer to unknown combinations of free-of-charge offerings and a variety
   of original pricing strategies. The case of the periodic press serves to
   illustrate. An empirical analysis of 149 French press Web sites
   demonstrates the co-existence of three classes of online business model:
   a minima digital, pure players and exploring leaders. The study puts
   forward the original mechanisms for gratis content funding in the
   periodic press. These results are consistent with observations made in
   other countries and confirm the authors' basic assumption regarding the
   variety of existing business models and the elements that shape their
   diversity.}},
