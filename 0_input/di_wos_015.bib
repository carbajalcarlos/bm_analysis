Abstract = {{As a type of autonomous learning, interesting experiment plays an
   irreplaceable important role in the teaching process. In this paper, a
   deep discussion of interesting experiment is carried out based on the
   course of digital logic design. Discussion topics are focused on some
   issues such as characteristics, mode of project selecting, experiment
   instruction for lab work and the evaluation of experiment results.
   Practice has shown that offering interesting experiments is not only
   beneficial to increasing study interest and improving the innovation
   ability of students, but also contributes to training engineering
   quality and making the student a creative talent.}},

Abstract = {{Public transport interchanges often involve several stakeholders for
   planning and decision-making. As a result complexity leads to
   inefficient processes, leading to indecision, disruption, or costly
   delays. Consequently, the paper focuses on the application of tools for
   navigation and prioritization of opportunities in the need finding,
   fuzzy-front end, or mystery phase as introduced by Martin (2009). The
   paper outlines in a case study how a multi-stakeholder platform can
   progress from complete ambiguity in project definition through to
   clearly defined and understood projects that have a shared intent across
   the multi-stakeholder platform. These tools have been applied in a
   public transport context, by demonstrating the process of integrating
   digital innovation into various stakeholders through a participatory
   research process. The paper introduces the research background;
   discusses the hypothesis; outlines the case study; emphasizes its
   significance for multi-stakeholder decision-making and discusses the
   opportunities for the built environment.}},

   organizations and structural systems in order to develop innovative
   architectural system. We developed a multidisciplinary approach, using
   scientific analysis and design research and prototyping. We focus on the
   study of a ``living fossil{''} fish, whose armor system is so efficient
   it has remained almost unchanged for millions of years. We investigate
   its morphological characteristics, its structural properties, the
   assembly mechanisms and the underlying material properties in order to
   derive new principles to design new enhanced structural systems. We use
   micro computerized tomography and scanning electron microscopy to
   observe microstructures, parametric design to reconstruct the data into
   digital models and then several 3D printing technologies to prototype
   systems with high flexibility and adaptive capabilities, proposing new
   gradual material interfaces and transitions to embed performative
   capabilities and multifunctional potentials.}},

Abstract = {{The development of new shapes in architecture has deeply influenced the
   current perception of the built environment. The analysis of the
   processes behind this evolution is, therefore, of great interest. At
   least two well known factors, influencing this development, may be
   pointed out: the great improvement of digital tools and the tendency
   toward building distinctiveness.
   In particular, the innovation of digital tools such as parametric
   modeling is resulting in an overall diffusion of complex shapes, and the
   phenomenon is also evident in a clear expressionistic search for
   architectural singularity, that some might consider as a negative effect
   of globalization trends.
   Though, if we can consider as a positive result the fact that
   parameterization allows a deeper control over design factors in terms of
   reference to cultural, historical and physical context, at the same time
   such control possibilities are sometimes so stark to be even
   auto-referential, stepping over site-specific parameterization, to
   create unusual shapes just for the sake of complexity.
   The ever-growing diffusion of generative design processes is in fact
   going to transform niche procedures, frequently limited to temporary
   decontextualized structures, into an architectural complexification as
   an end in itself.
   The hypothesis of this paper is to demonstrate that site-specific
   parametrization can be considered as a tool able to translate intentions
   into shape; it is necessary, for this aim, the widening of the meaning
   of the word singularity.}},

   showing the integration of information technology within a postgraduate
   study program (MAS LA) for landscape architects. What has already become
   a part of the discourse in the field of architecture - generic design -
   is now also finding more resonance in the context of large-scale
   landscape architectural design. If one studies the educational
   backgrounds of landscape architects, however, they often do not match
   the same standard as those of architects. A solid background in the area
   of innovative use of information technology, especially
   computer-assisted design and CAD/CAM construction is only at a
   preliminary state at most universities. The critical arguments in the
   choice of the selected medium and the building up of a continuous
   digital chain stand here in the forefront. The aim is not to improve the
   quality of the landscape design based on the variety of the applied
   tools, but rather through the sensible use of the said. Reflections as
   well as questions of method and theory stand at the forefront of our
   efforts.}},

Abstract = {{After the promulgation of Spanish Act on Education (LOE, 2006) the
   digital competence is inserted, for the first time, in Spanish
   educational legislation among the eight fundamental competences that
   must be developed according to the recommendations of UNESCO. In order
   to achieve this competence is necessary an efficient and creative
   management of skills to gain access and to administer the information in
   the different channels and digital media to obtain knowledge.
   Current university programmes for the initial teacher training, barely
   consider the acquisition of such competences. Aware of this, we have
   implemented a complementary programme on basic audiovisual digital
   literacy teaching as an essential premise for the reading and analysis
   of the elements that form the audiovisual messages. It was formed by
   five formative actions related to the various experience fields detected
   by a questionnaire carried out among a sample of 189 students. In this
   piece of work we present a summary of the results of this unpublished
   doctoral thesis.}},

Abstract = {{In playground games, an important part of engagement occurs in the
   physical space where people focus on each other's movements. In
   contrast, digital games often focus on engagement via a screen. By
   combining digital elements with playground ideas we identify new design
   opportunities where players are given freedom to play face-to-face.
   During a Game Jam workshop, we explore this design space by looking at
   innovative ways that digital technology can respond to movement. We find
   by removing the disparity between player movement and its digital
   representation, players can concentrate on each other and enjoy closer
   interaction. Through the exploration of digital elements and playground
   ideas, we suggest designers of movement-based games should consider the
   design space between the player and the screen using interactive
   technology to create engaging social digital play experiences.}},

Abstract = {{The design and implementation of a CMOS integrated analog to digital
   interface dedicated to hybrid integration of MEMS resistive microphone
   is presented. Audio sensing is achieved with an innovative low-cost
   technology that uses single crystal piezoresistive silicon nanowires as
   transducer in a MEMS. The circuit composed of a low-noise
   instrumentation preamplifier followed by a single bit fourth order
   continuoustime sigma-delta modulator (CT-Sigma Delta M) includes bias
   circuit for sensor. To join low power applications where extensive
   digital processing is employed, 0.28 mu m CMOS process with a 2.5 V
   supply has been adopted. The test chip occupies an area of 1 mm(2).
   Post-layout simulation exhibits promising performances where noise
   density is below 8 nV/root Hz within the frequency range from 10 Hz to
   10 kHz. Complete interface circuit features a current consumption of 2.4
   mA.}},

Abstract = {{Broadband acts as a catalyst for economic growth and social inclusion.
   However, the pace at which different countries around the world and
   specifically in Latin-America and The Caribbean are adopting that
   technology varies. As a result, a Digital Divide is being created
   between those countries that are more advanced and those that are
   lagging behind. One of the challenges is how to measure that Divide.
   This paper presents an innovative comprehensive index that measures the
   state of broadband in 64 countries around four pillars: infrastructure,
   applications and digital training, regulatory frameworks, and strategic
   public policies. Those four pillars are built as a result of the
   combination of 37 indicators from renowned institutions. As a result an
   interactive tool for decision makers and policy makers is provided as a
   means to detect, in a country basis strengths and areas for improvement
   in order to have specific, concrete and actionable plans.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicle board an increasing quantity of sensors such as GNSS
   receivers, road maps, LIDARs, to ensure a reliable localization
   function. This expanding number leads to abandon a classical centralised
   data fusion method and to adopt more complex architectures such as
   Distributed Data Fusion. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect
   faults of the different sensors in such configuration and to dynamically
   reconfigure the fusion method by using simple concepts of Information
   Theory. In order to detect faults, consistency is examined through a log
   likelihood ratio between the information innovation of each sensor. The
   current study illustrates the performance of the proposed fault
   detection algorithm and the pertinence of the dynamical reconfiguration
   of the multi-sensors data fusion. Experimental results, using data from
   antilock braking system sensors, a differential global positioning
   system receiver, and an accurate digital roadmap illustrate the
   performance of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Digitalization and modern trends nowadays in the business increase
   requirements on the information skills and knowledge of workers.
   Effective use of information technology plays a key role in a successful
   business. In our opinion the main role of the universities is education
   of students in this area. Thanks to combination of theory and practical
   skills to work with IT in enterprising, students have better opportunity
   to apply themselves successfully in the labor market. The part of the
   process of education at the Faculty of Economics of the Technical
   University is the education of subject Economical Information Systems.
   In this subject students learn how to establish the small virtual firm
   and to do the business by using electronic communication, e-shop and
   e-banking. Weakness of the course is the absence of e-accounting. The
   main goal of project FASTER (Financial and Accounting Seminars Targeting
   European Regions) founded by EU is to develop an innovative on-line
   educational platform in order to facilitate the flow of existing
   practical knowledge produced in the daily routine of financial services
   of enterprises, banks \& public sector. The aim of our paper is to show
   the possibility and the importance of integrating the FASTER platform
   into the educational process of the course Economic Information Systems
   at our faculty.}},

Abstract = {{Disruptive innovations such as cloud computing and the Web are impacting
   many aspects of organisations' and people's lives in many parts of the
   world. The economic attraction of cloud computing's cost model (e. g.,
   pay as you go) has made it particularly attractive to many organizations
   in the current global and gloomy economic environment and many
   organisations in the developed world have adopted it in one way or the
   other. However, it is yet to make any comparable impact in the
   developing world. But this situation can change and cloud computing, as
   will be demonstrated in this article, could potentially have a
   disruptive impact on people's and organizations' ability to access IT
   services in those countries, thanks to increasing levels of internet
   penetration and the proliferation of smart mobile devices. Furthermore,
   the development of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), thanks to
   improvements in Web technology, could potentially have a great impact on
   the way we learn, both in the developed and the developing worlds. This
   article examines the impact of such disruptive innovations on
   organizations and people and their potential to bridge the digital and
   education divides.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this research is to introduce and highlight the
   importance of marketing through the mobile channel. Mobile marketing is
   one of the latest direct marketing promotional channels and is getting
   quite popular among marketers and business owners owing to an array of
   benefits that it offers to the potential customers as well as to
   businesses. The definition of mobile marketing emphasizes the fact that
   it connects businesses and each of their customers through their mobile
   devices at the right time and at the right place with the right message
   and requires the customer's explicit permission and/or active
   interaction. Mobile marketing and mobile advertising are the next big
   challenges in the marketing community. This is mainly because of the
   latest technological advancements which brought about a totally new era
   in the mobile world. Furthermore, marketers are always searching for
   innovative, cost-effective, and highly influential methods in order to
   increase revenue; however, considering today's shrinking economy small
   businesses as well as marketers look for ways to increase customer
   response rates by designing targeted marketing campaigns. Mobile
   marketing is the most appropriate medium to achieve these goals
   particularly because of the several benefits that it offers such as
   guaranteed distribution of marketing messages, simplified and flexible
   marketing campaigns, marketing campaign integration, quantifiable
   outcomes, and the viral potential of the marketing messages. In other
   terms, mobile marketing is helping to make ubiquitous computing a more
   realistic and everyday technology.
   Structurally, the paper investigates the value of incorporating mobile
   marketing into the marketing mix, and especially direct marketing
   practices of business enterprises. It subsequently, identifies the
   benefits that the mobile channel offers, particularly by using a
   multi-channel marketing strategy known as the Social, Local, and Mobile
   (SoLoMo) marketing. SoLoMo marketing is a novel concept of providing
   smartphone/tablet PC users access to locally-focused promotions and
   store offerings through mobile search based on their current location.
   Furthermore, mobile-enabled social networking platforms are quickly
   becoming the conduit for not only peer-to-peer interactions about
   interests and intent, but also consumer-to-marketer conversations.
   Additionally, SoLoMo marketing requires the businesses to simultaneously
   embrace adaptive planning in order to make real-time decisions based on
   social, local, and mobile responses from the target customers. As its
   name indicates, the social part of SoLoMo marketing is related to the
   various social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest,
   etc. that enable potential customers to have a dialogue with a specific
   business of their interest and to share their opinions and comments with
   others. The local part of SoLoMo marketing is based on geo-targeting
   which allows businesses to target their marketing messages to potential
   customers in a specific geographic location. Geo-targeting can be
   accomplished when customers provide their address or more commonly, when
   they let companies know their location based on their smartphone/tablet
   PC use of different Location-Based Services (LBS) like Foursquare,
   Where, etc. The LBSs enable users to take full advantage of spatial
   information using technologies such as GPS, Bluetooth, and Near-Field
   Communications (NFC) which provide, update, and monitor users'
   location-based information. Finally, the mobile part of SoLoMo marketing
   highlights the fact that the social networking and location-based
   services can be easily used on the smartphones/tablet PCs by downloading
   their relevant mobile application.
   The paper successively discusses the utilization of various mobile
   marketing communication tools and ultimately develops a conceptual
   contemporary mobile strategic marketing preliminary model in the context
   of contemporary consumer behavior.
   Methodologically, the research is theory-based and enhanced by secondary
   data. The theoretical findings are further conceptually developed to
   construct a mobile marketing provisional framework towards empirical
   validation. Both the framework and its underlying theoretical foundation
   have been preliminarily validated through interviews with specialists.
   The interviewees consisted of academics specializing on the subjects of
   electronic marketing and/or strategic marketing; and executive
   practitioners with experience in the subject. The interviewees acted as
   controls and enhancers of the theoretical development of the framework.
   Nonetheless, the latter are empirically untested and therefore de facto
   provisional. The research findings do however add to the growing
   knowledge on mobile marketing and set the basis for a more refined
   understanding through a more comprehensive perspective on the topic.}},

Abstract = {{The exponential development of information and communication technology
   in the last decade has led to the registration of a true revolution in
   computer assisted learning. The roadmap of eLearning development domain
   has different forms and approaches, many of them marking common
   knowledge that good practice that is taken over, multiplied and at the
   same time generating new theoretical guidelines. The evolution of
   e-learning practices in recent years is associated with a tremendous
   increase in complexity. By associating the concept with all situations
   and contexts educational nature in using new technologies to improve or
   complete the process, components, steps, to obtain a broad range of
   activities and products that are under the sign of innovation in
   education in the last twenty years.
   Using computerized solutions for education is beneficial and generate
   positive effects on society - education specialists say. ELearning
   solutions meet the needs of the whole educational system, providing
   useful tools for all levels - from the makers of ministries to students,
   teachers, parents and even the general public. ELearning-based learning
   methods manage to adapt to the real needs of the educational process and
   gives students access to relevant and updated.
   The major benefits of eLearning are considered to be: development of
   individual skills and team work, develop skills of analysis and
   synthesis of information and ability to put into practice the
   theoretical information learned in school. These skills are considered
   to be acquired due course content 91\%, informal learning training92\%,
   training indirect 70\%, and collaborative learning 84\%. Summarizing,
   eLearning fully meet labor market demands and modern society and help
   create more economic and social opportunities, locally and globally.
   Education specialists believe that in recent years there have been many
   changes in the educational system of the country they represent, most
   for the better. Globally, eLearning plays an increasingly important role
   in education and the effects of introducing new technologies in schools
   without major effects, helping to develop the whole society.
   ELearning solution delivered to Romania, the SIVECO lay the groundwork
   for new approaches and methodologies in the development of digital
   content transdisciplinary integrated multi-touch interactive devices.
   Multi-touch technology that supports integrated transdisciplinary
   education system was used for the first time in the world in high
   schools in Romania. Appreciated for its high degree of innovation and
   the significant role that it plays in access to quality education,
   eLearning solution developed by SIVECO Romania for this technology,
   within the project initiated by the Ministry of National Education
   ``Vision competencies educational process optimized knowledge
   society{''}, entered the finals prestigious European competitions IT \&
   Software Excellence Awards.
   The collaborative learning assisted with the most recent computer
   technologies, as is the multi-touch technology, is one of the most
   promising innovations in efforts to improve the teaching/learning. Not
   only does this approach encourages students to work together to solve
   exercises and projects that combine knowledge from multiple disciplines,
   but also helps to diversify and increase the attractiveness of learning
   activities.
   The overall objective of the Ministry of National Education developed
   between December 2009 - November 2012 was the orientation of the
   educational process at the school in accordance with the competencies
   required by the current socio-economic and which are not addressed in
   traditional learning. ELearning solution developed by a team of
   specialists from SIVECO was to develop and implement a new school
   curriculum for Mathematics, Science and Humanities disciplines and
   applications support multi-touch interactive devices that support
   collaborative learning. ELearning solutions developed by SIVECO received
   two nominations in the competition: the project of computerization of
   education in Kazakhstan and one of the most innovative approaches to
   current eLearning - project development and implementation of
   educational content for interactive multi-touch devices.
   An important advantage of this solution is given by the methodology that
   is based and enables teachers to create new lessons consistent with
   those already developed in the curriculum.
   SIVECO is the leading international provider of innovative solutions in
   education. The company also had the opportunity to be involved in a
   project of great technological complexity and strategic importance to
   the modern educational system in contributing to the foundations of new
   approaches and methodologies for the development of transdisciplinary
   educational materials for the school. At this point, we can say that
   Romania is a concrete case study approach integrated transdisciplinary
   learning methods.}},

Abstract = {{Radiography of a moving world, the paper Digitalization of the national
   patrimony, opportunities in research projects and e-learning: the
   resource harvesters in the case of Romanian literature by Luiza
   Marinescu analyzed the influence of the digitalization of millions of
   documents, books and newspaper from Romanian literature, as a social
   innovation, over the research projects and developing e-learning
   programs, in the case of the university education.
   The hiatus, the discontinuity, the pause or the interruption in
   knowledge caused by the changing the medium of writing, (which was a
   characteristic of the centuries in which evolution in writing has
   occurred) was replaced in our century by a change in the paradigm: the
   digitalization of the libraries. As a new Noah's ark going upon the face
   of the waters, the digitalization of national patrimony offers
   opportunities in research projects and e-learning. It pays to plan ahead
   until the waters are dried up from off the earth. From the point of view
   of social innovation facing bio economics the paper illustrates the
   intercultural mission of the resource harvesters in the case of Romanian
   literature.
   The strategic objectives of the paper entitled Digitalization of the
   national patrimony, opportunities in research projects and e-learning:
   the resource harvesters in the case of Romanian literature are:
   I. the affirmation of the intercultural missions of the university
   education, as an integrant part of the everyday work;
   II. the affirmation of the intercultural logic as a fundamental mission,
   despite the field of exertion (the policy of human resources or of
   material resources);
   There are three operational objectives for medium and long term
   regarding creating a specialized team interested and involved in
   applying and getting EU project funding regarding :
   1. The Intercultural Atlas
   2. The teaching of Romanian language through the foreign languages
   3. Translations bridges to communication
   This paper illustrates the fact that a community development strategy is
   the result the contribution of higher education. The community's
   knowledge potential is enriched by the leveraging on technologies and
   the forging of a concrete link between the university and life long
   learning, as a pillar for human capital development. Facing bio
   economics, the university social innovation is compared to a forest: if
   you are outside, it is dense; if you are inside, you see that each tree
   has its own position. There are different trees in a forest. The wind
   may fell the massive oak, but bamboo, bent even to the ground, will
   spring upright after the passage of the storm. Analyzing the resource
   harvesters in the case of Romanian literature, the paper has the
   following chapters:
   1. The optimization of the discounted present values
   a. The digitalization of the cultural patrimony
   b. The importance of being updated and in touch
   2. Unregulated harvesting or the reunification of the two worlds:
   manuscripts and printings
   a. The Atlas of the Old books: survival elements and causal interactions
   b. A ``biological{''} evolution of the opportunities for researchers
   3. The digitalization of Romanian literature in terms of ``Bio
   economics{''}
   a. The new territories of knowledge or the soil's fertility
   b. The seeds of e-learning: strategies, concepts, ideas and organization
   that extend and strengthen civil society
   c. Television and education? The spread of the seeds
   4. Investment in harvesting capacity
   a. The documentary politics of the University between modernization and
   personalization
   b. Why and how can you meet the Author?
   c. The polyvalent professionals
   d. The construction of an efficient cooperation
   e. The archiving and the diffusion of the results of research
   f. Preserving the harvest for another cycle of knowledge}},

Abstract = {{Organic Thin film Transistors (OTFT) have been widely investigated in
   these last years as potential candidate for the development of low cost,
   flexible and lightweight active-matrix backplanes for display
   applications. Indeed the organic semiconductors provide both promising
   electrical performances tunable by chemistry and the ability to be
   processed at low temperature with innovative printing technics on
   various large scale substrates. Thanks to the recent developments on
   both n-type and p-type solution-processed organic semiconductors, we
   have developed a printable organic complementary technology compatible
   with flexible PEN substrates. By combining state of the art materials
   exhibiting mobility in the range of 1 cm(2)/V.s and silicon inspired
   compact modeling and simulation approach, we were able to design and
   fabricate circuit's building blocks that provide the switching, digital

   overall design and production process. A simulating practical production
   process in CAD software is applied to verify the optimized process.
   It is considered that the rise of digital printing technology pulls the
   direction of fashion design toward the Eastern from the Western system,
   the former one focusing on decorative patterns and the later on
   perspective and structure. The aim of this paper is to promote new
   thinking and develop silk fabrics and silk clothing, which have more

Abstract = {{The paper addresses the social consequences of dissemination of
   innovative practices in the contemporary rural society. The focus is
   made on the impact of dissemination of information and computer
   technologies on the processes of social differentiation, including the
   processes of elimination of the ``digital inequality{''} among
   individual social strata of the rural population. The paper is based on
   the results of the sociological surveys of the processes of
   proliferation of and familiarization with innovation practices in local
   rural communities conducted by the Institute of Agrarian Problems of the
   Russian Academy of Sciences in one of the Russian regions (Saratov's
   oblast) in 2010-2011 with personal involvement of the author. The
   analysis of the obtained empirical information enabled to identify the
   features of dissemination of individual innovative practices, high-tech
   goods and services in local rural communities; to form the basic social
   groups differentiated by the intensity of use of innovative practices in
   the fields of production, consumption and leisure; make a comparative
   analysis of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of these
   groups, their lifestyle and employment strategies; to describe the
   different models of innovative behavior of the rural population. The
   author pays particular attention to drawing a portrait of the rural
   Internet user. It is found out that Internet users are the most active
   social group of rural population demonstrating a high level of
   professional education and innovative culture. They know how to derive
   social and economic benefits from new technologies and knowledge. The
   deepening ``digital inequality{''} among local rural communities cannot
   be overcome only through providing technical and economic access to new
   technologies. All population groups and strata should have equal
   opportunities of acquiring the new proficiencies and skills they need to
   familiarize themselves with innovative technologies.}},

   photography teaching and practice. With the digital video net platform
   of Chinese universities (WWW.CUSDP.com), the traditional teaching
   materials and methods can be adjusted, teaching mode enriched and
   teaching efficiency improved.
   The project was supported by the Education Department of Shan Xi
   Province, Shan Xi College Students Innovative Experience in project
   funding.
   Photography education plays a very important role in the quality
   education of college students, being able to cultivate their positive
   psychological qualities and promote their art appreciation and aesthetic
   taste. With the rapid development of digital technology and the
   popularity of the network in recent years, college students are getting
   used to and value the study and practice of digital photography.
   The development of digital technology improves the reform of both
   photography and its education. As a major containing techniques and art,
   it is inevitable to reform the mode of photography teaching. The
   tremendous transformation in photographic industry will directly bring
   about the reform of photography education, out of which the reform of
   practical mode of teaching comes first.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of `Digital Forming' was first coined by Assa Ashuach in
   2005 and later developed into a commercial company in 2009 with the aim
   of unlocking product design and co-creativity online. Digital Forming
   facilitated the design of everyday products, using synthesis of
   innovative 3D software solutions, through the online personalisation and
   shape modification of products. In addition considerable saving can be
   made by utilising the concept of postcode production, where products can
   be produced locally via the intelligent assignment of the user's
   submitted designs. By enhancing the end-user's participation in relation
   to the product design process and linking it to that of a designer, key
   benefits can also be derived. These include both optimised, tailor-made
   and therefore better-fitting products and an increased attachment to
   owned artefacts. This architecture also provides producers with the
   means to capitalise on their redundant production capacities, by
   ensuring that their otherwise non-used machine space is utilised. In
   addition, this benefits users with improved delivery times resulting
   from an optimised production and supply chain. This in turn reduces
   carbon footprint, and with an on-demand production process, the
   conventional storage and logistic issues for mass produced items are
   removed. Finally, the concept and work carried out within `training
   objects' (an intelligent platform for the use of personal data to design
   and produce optimised product) is introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Law firm librarianship is impacted by the professional environments in
   which it is an established participant: the law firm culture, the legal
   publishing industry, and general librarianship. Its directions and
   identity are also impacted by the profound technology-based
   transformations in the information professions and in society at large.
   The digitization of ever more information items and the immediate
   Web-based accessibility of those items create new and heavy expectations
   from all users. The shape of firm librarianship's future will be
   determined by these changes and the profession's readiness to confront
   them. The Googlization of search and the rise of e-books are a few of
   the more conspicuous trends to be watched. However, firm librarians can
   best counter any intimations of disintermediation or obsolescence by
   responding effectively to the two defining qualities of law firm
   practice: the monetization of time and the contextualized complexity of
   legal knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for detailed geometrical
   representation of the existing cultural heritage, in particular to
   improve the comprehension of interactions between different phenomena
   and to allow a better decisional and planning process. The LiDAR
   technology (Light Detection and Ranging) can be adopted in different
   fields, ranging from aerial applications to mobile and terrestrial
   mapping systems.
   One of the main target of this study is to propose an integration of
   innovative and settled inquiring techniques, ranging from the reading of
   the technological system, to non-destructive tools for diagnosis and 3D
   metric modeling of buildings heritage. Many inquiring techniques,
   including Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) method, have been exploited to
   study the main room of the Valentino Castle in Torino. The so-called
   ``Salone delle Feste{''} (Hall of Honor), conceived in the XVIIth
   century under the guidance of Carlo di Castellamonte, has been selected
   as a test area. The beautiful frescos and stuccoes of the domical vault
   are sustained by a typical Delorme carpentry, whose span is among the
   largest of their kind. The dome suffered from degradation during the
   years, and a series of interventions were put into place.
   A survey has revealed that the suspender cables above the vault in the
   region close to the abutments have lost their tension. This may indicate
   an increase of the vault deformation; therefore a structural assessment
   of the dome is mandatory.
   The high detailed metric survey, carried out with integrated laser
   scanning and digital close range photogrammetry, reinforced the
   structural hypothesis of damages and revealed the deformation effects.
   In addition, the correlation between the survey-model of the intrados
   and of the extrados allowed a non-destructive and extensive
   determination of the dome thickness. The photogrammetrical survey of
   frescos, with the re-projection of images on vault surface model
   (texture mapping), is purposed to exactly localize former restorations
   and their signs on fresco continuity.
   The present paper illustrates the generation of the 3D high-resolution
   model and its relations with the results of the structural survey; both
   of them support the Finite Element numerical simulation of the dome.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative technique for the detection and elimination of cracks in
   digitized paintings and images is proposed in this paper. Cracks degrade
   the quality of painting as well as authenticity of painting becomes
   questionable. In the proposed method the cracks are detected by
   thresholding the result of the morphological top-hat transform. Further,
   misidentified cracks are detected either by involving user intervention
   or by using a semi-automatic procedure based on region growing
   technique. Finally, crack interpolation also called crack filling is
   performed using order statistics filters so as to restore the cracked
   image.
   The true positive rate and false positive rate are used to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed technique. For experimental purpose we
   collected 2000 classified cracked and un-cracked digital paintings and
   images from online digital art database. The result shows achievement of
   true positive rate of about 98.3\% at the rate of 0.1 false positive per
   image. This is because of providing user intervention during module
   called identifying mis-identified cracks.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years the tide of interest in ecocities is rising in China.
   The symbiotic integration of digital city and ecological city is the new
   model of urban development in the future. Gongqing DigiEcoCity is a
   strategic cooperation project between China and Finland to improve the
   living environment and build an ecological civilization. The paper
   defines the concept of DigiEcoCity and the practice of Gongqing
   DigiEcoCity supported by Finland in technology. Further, the paper
   explores the technological integration of digital city and ecocity from
   three aspects: Digi-concepts, Eco-concepts, City-concepts. Especially,
   the scalable, localisable and replicable Key Performance Indicators
   (KPI) for Gongqing DigiEcoCity planning are put forward and discussed to
   testify its ecological suitability and livability. The paper argues that
   Gongqing DigiEcoCity is a model for an ideal city combining the
   principles of sustainable development, the innovations by the digital
   revolution and the urban functions necessary for providing a framework
   of good everyday life. The paper also argues that the concept of
   developing digiecocity requires not only the successful completion of a
   project and planning, but also the long-term maintenance in the practice
   and their acceptance by the public.}},

   the eEnviPer platform which offers an e-government tool for
   environmental permitting services to citizens. eEnviPer relies on and
   benefits from innovative technical approaches, such as clouds of public
   services and service-oriented architecture (SOA) to built open, flexible
   and collaborative e-government services, while at the same time lowering
   ICT costs. Five real life pilot cases were deployed in different

Abstract = {{The main goal of this study is to design new and innovative packaging
   for agricultural products with the use of eco-friendly raw materials,
   processes and practises. The products considered in this study were
   local Greek produce like olive oil, tsipouro, raki, fruits and
   vegetables. These products are currently packaged in a very conventional
   way and it is generally recognised that the current packaging solutions
   do not reflect the quality of the produce or the ecological trends
   worldwide. The whole study was based on the use of Computer Aided Design
   programs and other digital technology. Glass and wood was used for the
   packaging of the fluid produce (olive oil, tsipouro and raki) and the
   raw material for the packaging solutions for the fruits and vegetables
   (crates) was olive tree pruning and wood wastes with the use of
   ecological glues. Other ecological aspects that were considered and
   utilised in the current proposal/study were 1. the re-use of the
   packaging. 2. the use of less raw material than current practises, 3.
   Ease of assembly and disassembly (separation) of materials. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Education is a basic necessity and a portal for betterment. The use of
   technology in education has had a positive impact on the students,
   educators, as well as the educational system as a whole throughout the
   country. But due to the poor economic condition, many rural areas are
   not capable of affording the modern innovative education technologies
   developed by computer systems. This has brought an urban-rural digital
   divide affecting the student strengths in building their career based
   objectives. In order to attain career based objectives at their higher
   education phase collaborative education management systems would help
   them. The existing education management systems are not reachable to the
   rural areas due to various factors like lack of infrastructure,
   maintenance cost, lack of expertise, etc. This motivated us to
   investigate the technology advancement aiming for empowering IT
   education in Indian rural education system. The establishment of
   collaborative education management systems on cloud can help the
   management in elevating the problems and in providing new service models
   which in turn stimulate growth and reduce costs. The main theme of this
   paper is to propose an approach for building cloud based collaborative
   education management systems abstracting the features of cloud
   computing. Also the paper presents a view on the proliferation of cloud
   computing technology for rural education system development in India}},

   creating a digital patient road-map and by supporting data sharing
   infrastructures. As an innovative concept, the impact of digital patient
   and avatar to personalized medicine and treatment is yet to be clear.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a CMOS wind speed to frequency converter with calibration
   circuits is newly proposed. A calibration technique is proposed in this
   work. Another innovation is that the outputs of the proposed chip are
   directly digitized, they could be easily sent over a wide range of
   transmission media, such as PSN, radio, optical, IR, ultrasonic, and
   etc. Before performing the proposed calibration circuits, the maximum
   linear error is 57.3\%. After calibration, the maximum linear error is
   reduced to 2.4\%. The wind speed range is 2.6 to 3.1 m/s, and the
   corresponding output frequency range is 78.1 kHz to 455 kHz. The chip
   area is 1.08 x 1.08 mm(2). The proposed chip is suitable for devices of
   measuring wind speed.}},

   article proposes an evaluation model for service innovation capability
   of digital publishing enterprise. The model consists of three dimensions
   (quantity of service innovation, rate of service innovation, quality of

   the prior research. According to the service innovation capability
   literature, the items were selected to measure the constructs of the
   proposed model. In order to reflect the reality of the situation and the
   level of service innovation capability of digital publishing enterprise,
   we modify and validate the evaluation scale, based on the results of the
   survey of case and expert interviews, and eventually develop a service
   innovation capability evaluation model for digital publishing

Abstract = {{A line of highly innovative products is presented, which particularly
   addresses acoustical oceanographic measurements, and includes digital
   hydrophones and digital acoustic arrays. Major features are very low
   self-noise, wide dynamic range, wide bandwidth, possibly very high
   working depth, simultaneous non-acoustic data integration (possible
   options: CTD data, sound velocity and depth, orientation, GPS time and
   position, etc.), portability and ease of use, and high cost
   effectiveness. The systems being digital, the digitizer is very close to
   the hydrophones, which prevents from any electromagnetic interference
   and signal weakening along cable, even at high frequency. The systems
   are particularly suitable for ambient noise measurements. The wide
   bandwidth from 4 Hz to 90 kHz is particularly appropriate for marine
   mammal survey. Orientation and positioning data are fundamental for
   array applications aimed to noise source localization. The integration
   of acoustic data with data from a CTD or from a sound velocity profiler
   is particularly innovative, and is of major interest to who needs to
   have both noise and oceanographic survey simultaneously and in real
   time, along the same deployment, with significant time saving and better
   knowledge of the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Consistently with international and European Union's objectives to
   deliver economic and social benefits by harnessing the potential of
   information and communication technology, research and development
   efforts are mushrooming worldwide to innovate governance and management
   practices. Under the smart cities paradigm, local governments' digital
   agendas are blending with public utilities' innovations under the thrust
   of social networking and open data initiatives. In this paper we focus
   on the development of an internet-based mobile application to improve
   urban utilities management, with special regard to public open space
   maintenance and local transport. As for designing innovative spatial
   data services, we dwell on the integration of geo-tagged territorial
   objects from technically validated databases and user-created contents.
   From an e-governance perspective, key issues appear to concern the links
   between sense of place and willingness to participate in crowdsourcing
   activities, and the management synergies needed to reconcile shrinking
   budgets and growing citizen expectations.}},

Abstract = {{The service industry in Taiwan accounted for 68.8\% of GDP in 2011,
   equivalent to the same level of major industrial countries. The
   development of the industry structure in Taiwan has also followed the
   same trends as advanced countries. Strengthening the development of
   knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) is an important issue for
   industry development and policy planning. KIBS is an economic activity
   that relates to the creation, accumulation and diffusion of knowledge.
   Miles et al. divided KIBS into P-KIBS and T-KIBS. KIBS has been
   introduced to the service industry to give add value and increase
   competiveness{[}1]. In light of the above, this research uses
   information and communication companies that grew quickly in the last
   decade and collected a total of 1,890 pieces of secondary data. Each
   piece of collected data has been analyzed and determined through
   multiple databases before being put through semantic analysis and
   content analysis.
   From this research it was found that: ( 1) clients can be divided into
   eight types ( general, business, financial governmental, specific areas
   and ethnic groups, int ernational, educational, and medical service
   clients); ( 2) products can be divided into four types ( mobility
   value-added, digital convergence, light era, and cloud computing and
   medical services); ( 3) the level of innovation can be divided into six
   types ( service extension, service upgrade, major innovation, style
   change, providing new services, and newly emergent business). According
   to the analysis results and detailed interviews with experts, an
   innovative strategy for information and communication services has been
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to grasp the spectrum's state within a period of time in
   electronic reconnaissance of modern times. Digital phosphor technology
   (DPX) is a recent crucial innovation of real-time spectrum analysis
   technology. It can show the spectrum's state of a period of time
   intuitively by images and highly enhances the capability of capturing
   and observing signals and it can be applied to radar reconnaissance
   appropriately. We have designed a DPX system. Signals are sampled
   directly in RF in this system. The sample frequency is 1.2 GHz; the
   bandwidth is 500M, 1.85GHz-2.35GHz. The digitized data is sent though an
   FPGA that computes very fast spectral transforms of FFT, and the
   resulting frequency domain waveforms are saved and accumulated to create
   the bitmaps. 65,535 FFT was continuously processed and accumulated to
   create a DPX image to display the state of real-time spectrum during
   about 100 ms. The image is 3D that is composed of pixels representing x,
   y, and z values for frequency amplitude, and hit count. The z values are
   displayed by different colors, and so we need pseudo-coloring coding for
   the DPX image. The traditional Pseudo-color coding method is mainly for
   the following 256 gray image. The DPX image in our system is high
   resolution of 0-65535. To improve the display of the DPX image, a new
   method of pseudo-coloring coding based on RGB tricolor which named
   ``take-bit from binary number{''} (TBFBN) was brought forward. This
   method focused on the scope of 0-65535, coded every value, and overcome
   the lack of traditional method that coded within 0-255. To select the
   method and the parameter, several experiments was carried through, and
   by contrast, the best display was chosen. The results of practice have
   shown that the technology of DPX can show the sate of spectrum directly
   and the method of TBFBN boosted up the effect of DPX display and
   improved the ability of observing and resolving.}},

Abstract = {{In biology and biomedical research fields one of the main topic is the
   understanding of morphology and mechanics of cells and microorganisms.
   Biological samples present low amplitude contrast that limits the
   information that can be retrieved through optical bright-field
   microscope measurements. Optical transparency is overcame for fixed
   specimen by means of staining techniques but such well-established
   methods present the issue to be invasive and not applicable on live
   cells. Study of microorganism in their natural environment without
   perturbing their equilibrium is challenging in biology. The main effect
   on light propagating in such objects is in phase, indeed it is altered
   respect to the phase of the beam propagating in the surrounding medium.
   This is known as phase-retardation or phase-shift. Objects are visible
   by Phase Contrast Imaging (PCI) due to interferometric processes able to
   transform tiny phase variation in amplitude modulation so that any small
   differences in the beam optical path can be visualized. Digital
   Holography (DH) in microscopy present as a powerful tool to overcome all
   these issues. The main characteristic is the possibility to discern
   between intensity and phase information performing quantitative mapping
   of the Optical Path Length. Up to now, DH has been considered as an
   innovative and alternative approach in microscopy and it's a good
   candidate for complete specimen analysis in the framework of no invasive
   microscopy. In this paper, the flexibility of DH is employed to analyze
   in a completely and no-invasive way the cell mechanics of live and
   unstained cell subjected to appropriate stimuli. The potentialities of
   DH are employed to measure all the parameters useful to understand the
   deformations induced by external and controlled stress in living cells.}},

Abstract = {{Biology and evolution lie at the heart of the ecosystem metaphor that is
   recurrently applied in the digital era. Although the evolution and
   analogy with evolutionary biology is acknowledged within the research
   domains of business ecosystems and digital ecosystems, several key
   definitions and self-organizing properties of ecosystems have not been
   fully explored. In addition, the diffusion process of radical
   innovations altering the structure of an ecosystem remains elusive. This
   paper addresses this deficiency through a cross-fertilization of
   multiple research domains, by introducing evolutionary economics
   concepts based on insights from biology. The research synthesis
   presented serves for the introduction of a novel perspective on
   ecosystem analysis. Practitioners will gain insight in how to apply
   concepts from evolutionary economics when determining their position in
   an ecosystem. Trade-offs can then be considered and balanced to
   positively impact firm performance as well as the ecosystem in which the
   firm operates.}},

Abstract = {{To make responsible products and e-services with people and not only
   with specialists, a new eco-citizen vision of innovation is necessary,
   called e-co-innovation. In Reunion Island, we have introduced Semiotic
   Web as a human-centered method to manage sustainable development with
   ICT (Information and Communication Technologies). The signification or
   semiosis is the key psychological process that gives sense to
   e-co-innovation for making ICT usage-based research, rather than
   technology-based. The scene develops itself in partnership with
   end-users to exchange data, information and knowledge. In this sharing
   frame, the Living Labs (LL) concept allows to emphasize the importance
   on political and methodological principles to practice open innovation
   guided by usages. On more pragmatic, scientific and technical plans, we
   have set up a conceptual method for making products/services based on
   Sign management, and a tool called the Creativity or Co-design platform,
   used to build iteratively e-services with pilot users (lead-users).
   These resources have been applied for ten years at University of Reunion
   Island (UR) to help to manage tropical biodiversity (coral reefs and
   forests) and develop instrumental e-learning in music (guitar and piano)
   in order to satisfy the desires of target users in the domain of
   education by Teaching and Learning (TL).}},

Abstract = {{SEED (Social, Economic and Environmental Development) is fundamentally
   based on education, resource allocation, local-led innovation, and
   collaboration in all three SEED-areas. Radical change for SEED is
   possible and required, as Ernst Ulrich von Weizsacker outlines in Factor
   5 {[}1]. He provides examples for transforming the global economy on an
   economic path that is environmentally sustainable by increasing the
   resource productivity by factor 5 in various sectors in the
   industrialized regions, while being economically more profitable and
   balancing quality of life priorities. For developing regions, their
   development path could consequently take place in a much less resource
   inefficient way than for industrialized regions in the past. This paper
   focuses on education as a precious resource for SEED. Education is
   positioned within the context of the Cyber-Physical Environment of our
   evolving Digital Ecosystem (DE). A local-led innovation project, named
   ``Sovereign Self-Unfolding Education{''}, is referred to as a best
   practice process. It is put in context with the momentum in this area,
   and it's relation to the DE-paradigm. This paradigm is based on
   cooperation between actors and acknowledges competition (cooptition), in
   order to spur co-innovation in the people, public and private sectors
   (3Ps). The position paper argues for inclusion of these into the
   SEED-Framework of iFOSSF (International Free and Open Source Solutions
   Foundation).}},

Abstract = {{The application of Web 2.0 concepts and technologies across departments
   as well as across corporate boundaries is enjoying increasing
   popularity. By their innovative and light-weight nature, those concepts

   capability. Grounded on the critical mass theory, the current paper
   deals with the methodological approach applied to implement Web 2.0
   concepts and technologies and focuses on the startup phase of such a

Abstract = {{The growing complexity of electrical power grids is demanding
   increasingly innovative solutions to build more stable and secure grids,
   a trending that is particularly evident across the spectrum of
   industrialized countries. Such a need is also clear for emerging
   countries, wherein China has rapidly become a key development player
   whose technological solutions could have a pivotal impact on other
   infrastructure-hungry regions of the world (e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa).
   This paper provides an overview of the smart grid transmogrification,
   via the state-of-the-practice application of proactive and responsive
   nodes - synchrophasors - within the U.S. power grid and presents a
   comparison with the efforts of other actors, such as China and
   Sub-Saharan African. Specifically, the potential advantages of the
   application of synchrophasors, as well as the issues challenging their
   application, are taken into account. As happens in ecological systems,
   value is created ``by making connections,{''} and synchrophasors do
   indeed enable ``collective intelligence,{''} ``promote
   collaboration,{''} and well contribute towards scalability and
   sustainability - the realm of Digital Ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Digital systems are offering opportunities to find, select, adapt, and
   use digital educational resources for teaching and learning which are
   openly available in the Web. As a result, innovative
   technology-supported classroom-based activities are widely anticipated
   by key stakeholders in formal education, namely, students, parents,
   education managers and policy makers. This puts a tremendous pressure on
   teachers and instructors to exploit digital resources in their daily
   classroom activities. Reusing available teaching resources is currently
   a major trend worldwide. This creates the need for tools that can
   support teachers in finding, and selecting appropriate digital resources
   for populating their lesson plans in school classrooms. Such tools can
   facilitate teaching processes to adopt technology-supported
   instructional strategies in a cost effective manner. In order to be able
   to build such tools, it is important to devise and study methods that
   can support teachers in discovering and selecting appropriate digital
   resources to populate their classroom-based teaching activities, taking
   into consideration important parameters of classroom-based instruction,
   such as time constraints and class population. To this end, in this
   paper we propose a design-to-time classroom-based teaching model and a
   time-adjusted lesson planning method that incorporates a
   classroom-constrained selection algorithm for digital resources
   available in Learning Object Repositories. We also evaluate the
   performance of the proposed algorithm.}},

   strength of the nation. This study is thrilling because it has been
   argued that most of SMEs run their own business individually,
   experienced with raw material shortages, lack of business resources,
   innovation and business knowledge, lack of access to markets, and lack
   of capital access. The population in this study is all SMEs who involved
   in the supply chain of Batik industry in Indonesia. A number of 429 SMEs
   had participated in this study. Data were collected from questionnaire
   and in-depth interview. The analysis result shown that SMEs perceives
   high benefit or outcome when they collaborate virtually, however,
   government and other stakeholders have to provide several supports to
   establish this community network.}},

Abstract = {{Our ability to deliver timely, effective and cost efficient healthcare
   services remains one of the world's foremost challenges. The challenge
   has numerous dimensions including the need to develop: (a) a highly
   functional yet secure electronic health record system that integrates a
   multitude of incompatible existing systems, (b) in-home patient support
   systems to reduce demand on professional health-care facilities, and (c)
   innovative technical devices such as advanced pacemakers that support
   other healthcare procedures. Responding to this challenge will
   necessitate increased development and usage of software-intensive
   systems in all aspects of healthcare services. However the increased
   digitization of healthcare has identified extensive requirements related
   to the development, use, evolution, and integration of health software
   in areas such as the volume and dependability of software required, and
   the safety and security of the associated devices. The goal of the fifth
   workshop on Software Engineering for Health Care was to discuss recent
   research innovations and to continue developing an interdisciplinary
   community to develop a research, educational and industrial agenda for
   supporting software engineering in the health care sector.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) is a particularly fascinating field due to its
   innovative technology that allows a person to experience the sensation
   of living in a computer-generated environment. AR integrates Virtual
   Reality (VR) into the real-world, enhancing the users experience with
   the objects surrounding them in real-time. A state-of-the-art technique
   is presented in this paper, implemented by students in the Business
   Incubator from Tecnologico de Monterrey with the collaboration of
   experts and supported by the Research Chair at Campus Monterrey.
   This paper presents an interactive instructions manual using AR, which
   will guide the user through the assembly or disassembly of a car engine.
   The use of augmented reality in manufacturing activities, especially in
   the automotive industry, increases the productivity by the simulation of
   parts undergoing their manufacturing process, reducing the need to
   create physical prototypes. This article describes the way entrepreneurs
   explore new technologies, using the resources available at the R\&D
   department, to develop an AR system for the assembly of a monobloc
   engine. A bright future is perceived for life enhancing AR systems.
   Industrial applications could vary from engine systems, as presented in
   this paper, to medical or aerospace training programs, imagination is
   the limit.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the possibility of the fibre to the home (FTTH) for
   simultaneous transmission of different services such as internet,
   telephone, digital television is a reality. However, to meet the more
   demanding expectations of the end user, it is necessary to improve the
   physical infrastructure of the existing communication networks in order
   to obtain the best ratio between quality of service and price of
   implementation. So, the demand for optical devices that process
   information at a reduced cost and are easy to install is increasing. In
   this work, it is presented fibre Bragg gratings produced in polymer
   optical fibres (PFBG). These new filters combine the extended capacity
   allowed by wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) operation with the
   easiness of operation of POF. The PFBG will also be considered in the
   development of new techniques and new innovative devices for sensing
   technologies. The thermal and mechanical properties of polymeric
   materials open new possibilities in terms of robustness, sensitivity and
   operating range of sensors. These sensors can be used to monitor several
   physical parameters and to detect gases and liquids and are quite
   interesting for many applications in engineering, including structural
   health and environmental monitoring, medicine, petrochemical industry
   and to the development of smart structures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and implementation of an embedded digital
   control system for a novel acoustophoretic separation technique.
   Currently, there is a need for efficient separation technologies for
   multicomponent liquid streams that eliminate waste, reduce the required
   energy and promote a sustainable environment. Our goal is to design,
   build, and test a high-frequency, high-power, and high-efficiency
   ultrasound driver for an acoustophoretic separator The device needs to
   be able to efficiently transfer electrical energy into acoustical energy
   with minimum losses and be able to drive the low impedance of a typical
   piezo-electric transducer. The proposed new platform technology provides
   an innovative solution that consists of a large volume flow rate
   acoustophoretic phase separator based on ultrasonic standing waves with
   the benefit of having no consumables, no generated waste, and a low cost
   of energy. The technology is efficient at removal of particles of
   greatly varying sizes, including separation of micron and submicron
   sized particles. The proposed embedded digital control system (drive
   system) utilizes a TMS320F28335 digital signal processor / controller
   chip {[}2] at its core.}},

Abstract = {{Once upon a time, in a French technical institute, some people wanted to
   improve their way of teaching Information Technology systems.
   The main difficulty was knowing how to act with current materials and
   technologies. Because of the prohibitive costs of modern devices, it
   would be necessary to build a partnership with an industrial leader.
   Starting in January 2009, we made an appointment with Aastra France.
   Aastra is a major company acting especially in unified communications.
   Aastra is a leading company at the forefront of the enterprise
   communication market around the world. Aastra develops and delivers
   innovative communication products and applications for businesses.
   The choice of Aastra takes its origin in the 2005 Matra/EADS takeover.
   Matra/EADS was a french leader in digital telephony solutions and a long
   time ago, I was acting as an IT manager in a local administration, using
   Matra products.
   I will describe how we built this partnership, how we trained our team
   of teachers, and how we are going to massively certify them first, and
   how we are going to continue student training with Astra certifications.}},

   assembly planning, which integrates results from various planning
   disciplines. This paper introduces a new concept and the corresponding
   data model for application of Data Mining (DM) methods in the field of
   production assembly planning and product design. The approach contains
   the usage of existing planning data in order to extrapolate assembly
   processes. Especially linked product and process data allow the
   innovative usage of Data Mining methods. The concept presents assistance
   potentials for development of new products variants along the product
   emergence process (PEP). With this approach an early cost estimation of
   assembly processes in series production can be achieved using innovative
   Data Mining methods. Furthermore, design and planning processes can be
   supported effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Interpretation is one of the important elements in heritage tourism that
   is influenced by two types of interpretive media which are personal and
   non-personal. The non-personal interpretive media is a common
   interpretive media that exists at heritage sites. Digital media as the
   innovation in interpretive media could be an effective way to inform and
   educate visitors compared to the traditional media types. However, the
   literature indicates that the existence of the digital media has not
   been fully utilized at cultural heritage sites specifically in
   Indonesia. This article presents a study where 50 places of cultural
   heritage sites in Central and East Java were sampled. The results reveal
   that only 8\% of those heritage sites provide the digital media by using
   audio and video as the non-personal interpretive media for tourism.
   Since interpretive media is proven to influence visitors at cultural
   heritage sites, it is suggested that the electronic non-personal
   interpretive media ought to be made available at cultural heritage
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce BRIC, a novel custom multi-chip digital
   computer architecture for simulating in real-time a model of human brain
   in form of a spiking Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network
   (BCPNN). The design is conceptually dimensioned for available technology
   in 20152020 with the estimated size of a pizza box, consuming less than
   3 kWs of power, delivering 800 Teraflops/sec (single precision multiply
   operation) and 30 TBs of memory. To the best of our knowledge, this will
   be the smallest and lowest power real-time brain simulation engine if
   manufactured. The silicon and computational efficiencies come from use
   of 3D memory stacking, innovation in algorithm and architectural
   customization. The chip will be programmable allowing experimentation
   with variants of the BCPNN brain model.}},

Abstract = {{Students worldwide find very difficult to learn sciences. Therefore
   there is a need to find innovative ways to motivate students and help
   them learn. One possible way is the inclusion of technology in the

   digital natives. This article addresses the specific use of simulators
   as a means to improve the learning of Physics. The aim of this work is
   to design, develop and test a virtual reality simulator that allows
   experiencing / feeling various forces of physics such as the friction
   force, the aerodynamic force and the gravitational force. To give more
   realism to the man-machine interaction the simulator uses a haptic
   interface.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents an idea of expansion of the existing modes of
   collaboration between science with focus on e-science, libraries which
   services are currently going through a new phase of transformation into
   services based on use of federated digital information resources and
   finally, higher education system which seeks quality information
   resources for their use in the teaching process. All three sides have a
   historical background of mutual collaboration. Influence of information
   and communication technology on all three sides has sped up their
   development and provided them with new tools for creation, organization,
   storage and exchange of knowledge. All three sides still haven't used a
   full potential of networked environment and internet services for the
   benefit of even richer collaboration and designing of new ICT supported
   services in science, libraries and teaching at higher education
   institutions that would enable richer scientific, library and
   educational experiences. The results of this collaboration should be
   network intensive collaboration based on selected and verified digital

Abstract = {{Within the last years additive manufacturing established itself in the
   industrial environment as cutting-edge technological possibility to
   reduce time-to-market and manufacturing costs and to take in account
   even the chance of reducing resources consumption.
   The paper figures that the digital development and production process
   chain also continues by stepping from virtual to physical world by using
   additive manufacturing means. This means, after all kind of
   sophisticated simulation based part and product optimisation, there is a
   time where you need parts to have a hand on, to test and verify them and
   even produce them in a new way to face actual economical and ecological
   challenges.
   The additive manufacturing technology bears also a paradigm shift: from
   manufacturing-driven design to design-driven manufacturing. Based on a
   longtime practical in-house experience state-of-the-art applications
   with already proven practical relevance (among them is the bionic
   handling assistant awarded with the German Prize for Achievements in
   Technology and Innovation) highlight this new freedom of design.
   Subsequent the current state of additive manufacturing as possibility
   for serial production will be discussed. There shows up both: real
   usable potentials and existing restrictions, too. The results of
   different research studies on PA-based specimen and parts manufactured
   by laser sintering (SLS) regarding mechanical properties,
   reproducibility, long-term behaviour and cost deployment will be
   presented. They pinpoint the huge progress of the last years but also
   further research needs to overcome mentioned obstacles for a continued
   and broader industrial application.}},

Abstract = {{Additive Manufacturing technologies have been a revolution to R\&D
   process efficiency and are in place for many years now. The technologies
   have very much matured ever since and thus seem to pave their way to
   direct parts business.
   Looking back to traditional manufacturing methods, the industrial market
   has developed highly productive and flexible Machine Tools over time to
   comply with the requirements of a wide spectrum of industrial
   applications. These machines have set standards and thus set the
   expectation benchmark of industry customers.
   Additive Manufacturing opens up an enormous additional potential for
   industrial applications, however competing with traditional production
   methods. Electro Optical Systems (EOS) is gearing its portfolio and
   market activities clearly towards manufacturing applications. We will
   show, which activities EOS are taking to go this road. The example of
   handling and robotics industry illustrates which additional value Laser
   Sintering can achieve.
   In this context, the gripper technology is a front runner for innovative
   solutions - lightweight and integrated functionality are key value
   drivers for handling \& robotics. Existing applications are intensively
   profiting from this new technology: From gripper weighing less than 20g
   and being able to can handle 10kg parts to high-speed pick and place
   solutions being fully integrated into today's automation environment.
   Additive Manufacturing is opening up economically valuable production up
   to lot size one - metal implant parts for human bodies are another
   perfect example for this mass individualization approach.}},

Abstract = {{The most recent series of Xilinx FPGAs in 28nm host a wide range of the
   most advanced technologies. 3D-IC technology has allowed for a doubling
   of logic capacity in a single device, commensurate with going to the
   next process node, with the added advantages of reduced power and
   improved yield. New levels of programmable systems integration are
   enabled through the co-integration of digital FPGA die with dedicated
   analog die such as high-speed analog SerDes on a single interposer. Such
   heterogeneous integration delivers an industry leading 2.8Tb/s of
   off-chip serial connectivity.
   This talk reviews what's driving Moore scaling and how it impacts FPGA
   technology scaling relative to ASSPs and ASICs. It goes on to cover such
   items as process selection, 3D-IC technology, analog features, as well
   as power reduction strategies and the migration steps to 20nm and 16nm.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel approach for the time efficiency study of payment
   process at Point-Of-Sale (POS). A wide range of payment methods from
   cash and standard cards to contactless cards, RFID stickers and mobile
   payments (NFC and remote) was analysed. Transactions were timed by means
   of digital chronography of video material recorded in the biggest chain
   of convenience stores in Poland. Our results confirm that cash is a
   significantly faster payment method than traditional payment card with a
   magnetic stripe or EMV chip. However, the innovative payment methods,
   such as contactless cards and NFC mobile payments, are competitive to
   cash in terms of time efficiency. Contactless cards used in offline mode
   and without printing paper slips are the first popular electronic
   payment method in history faster than cash. Our results could be applied
   to optimise the payment process at POS as well as to develop innovative
   and efficient payment solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language (ODNZSL),(1) launched
   in 2011, is an example of a contemporary sign language dictionary that
   leverages the 21st century advantages of a digital medium and an
   existing body of descriptive research on the language, including a small
   electronic corpus of New Zealand Sign Language. Innovations in recent
   online dictionaries of other signed languages informed development of
   this bilingual, bi-directional, multimedia dictionary. Video content and
   search capacities in an online medium are a huge advance in more
   directly representing a signed lexicon and enabling users to access
   content in versatile ways, yet do not resolve all of the theoretical
   challenges that face sign language dictionary makers. Considerations in
   the editing and production of the ODNZSL are discussed in this article,
   including issues of determining lexemes and word class in a
   polysynthetic language, deriving usage examples from a small corpus, and
   dealing with sociolinguistic variation in the selection and performance
   of content.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the advance of wireless communication, sensing and
   mobile technologies has provided unprecedented opportunities to
   implement new learning strategies by integrating real-world learning
   environments and the resources of the digital world. With the help of
   these new technologies, individual students are able to learn in real
   situations with support or instructions from the computer system by
   using a mobile device to access the digital content via wireless
   communications. With such an innovative approach, the learning system is
   able to detect and record the learning behaviors of the students in both
   the real world and the digital world with the help of the sensing
   technology. Such a new technology-enhanced learning model has attracted
   the attentions of researchers from both the fields of computer science
   and educational technology. It not only supports learners with an
   alternative way to deal with problems in the real world, but also
   enables the learning system to more actively interact with the learners.
   In this invited talk, various strategies of conducting mobile and
   ubiquitous learning activities in practical applications are
   demonstrated; moreover, several issues concerning this innovative
   approach, including the development of learning contents and systems,
   the design of learning activities, and the investigation of learning
   perceptions and achievements, are presented..}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the possibility of implementing a solution for
   efficiently using supercapacitors to power a CubeSat. The system
   achieves a full powered CubeSat only by using supercapacitors and no
   other energy backup method. There are presented both advantages and
   disadvantages of such implementation. The article shows how much energy
   and power is available for the entire system for a specific amount of
   time. The data was collected using COTS parts, digital oscilloscopes and
   DAQ systems. There was also created a demonstrative structure (both CAD
   and real) to simulate and test the real life integration of a
   supercapacitor within a CubeSat. The data figures only a small part of
   implementing a supercapacitor power system within a CubeSat, further
   research needed to be made in each individual case of CubeSat that will
   be developed using such power system method. The article provides some
   suggestions about the electronic parts that can be used to develop such
   system, and some approximations for being able to compute fast power and
   energy values when comparing different supercapacitors, or other parts
   that would directly influence the usage of such system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the ways loosely connected online groups and formal
   science professionals are responding to the potential for collaboration
   using digital technology platforms and crowdsourcing as a means of
   generating data in the digital information commons. The preferred
   approaches of each of these groups to managing information production,
   circulation and application are examined in the light of the
   increasingly vast amounts of data that are being generated by
   participants in the commons. Crowdsourcing projects initiated by groups
   in the fields of astronomy, environmental science and crisis and
   emergency response are used to illustrate some of barriers and
   opportunities for greater collaboration in the management of data sets
   initially generated for quite different purposes. The paper responds to
   claims in the literature about the incommensurability of emerging
   approaches to open information management as practiced by formal science
   and many loosely connected online groups, especially with respect to
   authority and the curation of data. Yet, in the wake of technological
   innovation and diverse applications of crowdsourced data, there are
   numerous opportunities for collaboration. This paper draws on examples
   employing different social technologies of authority to generate and
   manage data in the commons. It suggests several measures that could
   provide incentives for greater collaboration in the future. It also
   emphasises the need for a research agenda to examine whether and how
   changes in social technologies might foster collaboration in the
   interests of reaping the benefits of increasingly large data resources
   for both shorter term analysis and longer term accumulation of useful
   knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{As distributed memory systems grow larger, communication demands have
   increased. Unfortunately, while the costs of arithmetic operations
   continue to decrease rapidly, communication costs have not. As a result,
   there has been a growing interest in communication-avoiding algorithms
   for some of the classic problems in numerical computing, including
   communication-avoiding Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). A
   previously-developed low-communication FFT, however, has remained
   largely out of the picture, partially due to its reliance on the Fast
   Multipole Method (FMM), an algorithm that typically aids in accelerating
   dense computations. We have begun an algorithmic investigation and
   re-implementation design for the FMM-accelerated FFT, which exploits the
   ability to tune precision of the result (due to the mathematical nature
   of the FMM) to reduce power-burning communication and computation, the
   potential benefit of which is to reduce the energy required for the
   fundamental transform of digital signal processing. We reintroduce this
   algorithm as well as discuss new innovations for separating the distinct
   portions of the FMM into a CPU-dedicated process, relying on
   inter-processor communication for approximate interactions, and a
   GPU-dedicated process for dense interactions with no communication. (1)}},

   underwater wireless sensor networks}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Seaweb is an acoustic communication technology that enables
   communication between sensor nodes. Seaweb technology utilizes the
   commercially available telesonar modems that has developed link and
   network layer firmware to provide a robust undersea communication
   capability. Seaweb interconnects the underwater nodes through digital
   signal processing-based modem by using acoustic links between the
   neighboring sensors. In this paper, we design and investigate a global
   positioning system-free passive localization protocol by integrating the
   innovations of levelling and localization with the Seaweb technology.
   This protocol uses the range data and planar trigonometry principles to
   estimate the positions of the underwater sensor nodes. Moreover, for
   precise localization, we consider more realistic conditions namely, (a)
   small displacement of sensor nodes due to watch circles and (b)
   deployment of sensor nodes over non-uniform water surface. Once the
   nodes are localized, we divide the whole network field into circular
   levels and sectors to minimize the traffic complexity and thereby
   increases the lifetime of the sensor nodes in the network field. We then
   form the mesh network inside each of the sectors that increases the
   reliability. The algorithm is designed in such a way that it overcomes
   the ambiguous nodes errata and reflected paths and therefore makes the
   algorithm more robust. The synthetic network geometries are so designed
   which can evaluate the algorithm in the presence of perfect or imperfect
   ranges or in case of incomplete data. A comparative study is made with
   the existing algorithms which proves the efficiency of our newly
   proposed algorithm.}},

Title = {{A Basic Analysis of Entry and Exit in the US Broadband Market, 2005-2008}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF NETWORK ECONOMICS}},

Abstract = {{We conduct a basic analysis of entry and exit in the US broadband
   market, using a complete FCC census of providers from 2005 to 2008.
   There is a tremendous amount of (simultaneous) entry and exit in the US
   broadband market. Most entry is from existing providers expanding into
   new geographic areas. Entry and exit vary widely across the various
   modes of provision, which argues against treating broadband as a
   homogenous service in theoretical or empirical work. The highest entry
   rates also generally have the highest entrant shares. Entry rates
   display positive autocorrelation, and the same is true for exit. There
   is also positive correlation between the entry and exit rates at various

   the broadband types in the height of entry and exit barriers. We discuss
   some implications these results may have for both policy purposes and

Abstract = {{The four year curriculum of the Electrical Engineering program includes
   a fairly diverse set of classes covering topics including electronics,
   electromagnetics, signal processing, power \& energy, digital systems,
   as well as communication and control systems. While these topics
   constitute the core components in the technical education of a future
   electrical engineer, a major missing component is the holistic, system
   understanding of these individual topics.
   This paper describes a class addressing the integration of the technical
   topics in addition to defining the overall architecture, the modularity
   of complex systems, as well as the interfaces between the different
   components to satisfy design requirements. The new class is a
   project-based, one credit-hour class with a single weekly meeting in a
   laboratory environment. The paper describes the assigned projects as
   well as their proposed solutions. The paper also includes assessment
   data including student feedback from the first class offering.
   Assessment shows a great student enthusiasm towards the class. It also
   shows that the class improved the student's conceptual knowledge,
   knowledge retention, and problem solving skills.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for digital learning content has been increasing in the last
   years and the advent of the Learning Objects (LO) concept has the goal
   of mitigating some of the difficulties related to authoring such kind of
   digital content, by proposing a reusable model and an open metadata
   standard classifications for them. Nevertheless, digital learning
   content authoring is often an expensive and time-consuming task that
   requires many distinct professional skills. One attempt to overcome it
   is the adoption of Learning Object Repositories (LOR), in order to
   smooth LO manipulation experiences for teachers and content authors.
   Some of its keys characteristics are: to promote LO dissemination and
   reuse to users in a unified spot; and, to serve LO through flexible
   searches and enforce a metadata standard classification. This paper
   proposes an innovative repository model to support LOR and their use in
   web-based courses in the context of an specific LMS, the Moodle
   environment. The model is flexible, enhances digital content searches
   and can be fully integrated with an institutional LMS. Moreover, it
   offers a social environment for peer evaluation and, more important,
   information about the student performance, resulting in an efficient
   evaluation of the available contents.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the Digital Culture BA degree: an engineering-arts
   undergraduate curriculum that combines competency-based education (CBE)
   and knowledge-oriented education (KOE) structures and related Pull-Push
   approaches. The degree has been offered for three years at Arizona State
   University, has 200 enrolled students and is continuing to grow. The
   degree embeds nine knowledge-oriented concentrations, each offered by a
   relevant participating department, within an interdisciplinary CBE
   context. The CBE part of the degree provides customized access to 40
   interdisciplinary digital culture courses from 12 different academic
   units by connecting these courses through a set of core competencies.
   Access to courses is not determined by fixed prerequisites but rather by
   having one of several possible combinations of lower level competencies.
   This flexible curriculum is attractive to students, promotes integrative
   collaborative learning that inspires innovation, and prepares the type
   of engineering-arts experts and complex problem solvers that are
   currently needed in creative industries. This type of degree also
   presents several important challenges for educators and administrators.
   To address these challenges we developed project based assessment
   approaches, custom web-based software for advising a very diverse
   student body, as well as online tools for facilitating peer critique and
   feedback in large creative classrooms.}},

Abstract = {{Issues surrounding wireless communications have arisen as a result of an
   increase in popularity and usability. The complexity of modulating
   signals over carriers is considered to be a significant challenge and
   Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex has proven to be a popular
   technology. The discovery of the wavelet transform, while mainly used in
   image processing applications, has led to a recently proposed,
   innovative new modulation technique called Orthogonal Wavelet Division
   Multiplex. This paper looks at the application of different families of
   wavelet as applied to digital terrestrial television.}},

Abstract = {{A software tool dedicated to the analysis of power signals containing
   harmonic and interharmonic components, unbalance, voltage dips and
   voltage swells is presented. The software tool is a virtual instrument,
   which uses innovative algorithms based on time and frequency domains
   analysis to process power signals. In order to detect the temporary
   disturbances, edge detection is proposed, whereas for the harmonic
   analysis Gaussian filter banks are implemented. Considering that a
   signal recovery algorithm is applied, the harmonic analysis can be made
   even if voltage dips or swells appear. The virtual instrument input data
   can be recorded or online signals; the last ones being get through a
   data acquisition board. The virtual instrument was tested using both
   virtually created and real signals from measurements performed in
   distribution networks. The paper contains a numeric example made on a
   synthetic digital signal and an analysis made in real-time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative approach for integrated ultra-low
   current wireless receivers for UHF bands in a 180-nm CMOS technology.
   The classical method of slow periodic switching off of the receiver was
   picked up, essentially enhanced and applied to a superheterodyne
   receiver topology. A novel fast sampling pulse operation method for
   ultra low power integrated receivers is presented meeting both short
   reaction time and very low power consumption requirements. In addition,
   the receiver was designed for radio channels with strong interferers.
   The presented ASIC comprises both an analogue front-end and two digital
   31 bit correlating decoders. The current consumption of the fabricated
   prototype is 2.4 mu A at 3 volts supply voltage with a reaction time of
   485 ms.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last years an innovative packaging technology for space
   applications based on Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics (LTCC) has been
   developed under the patronage of the German Space Agency (DLR). This
   technology is characterized by small hermetically sealed modules that
   hold elementary (sub-) functions of RF-systems. This design philosophy
   ensures a high reusability and thus an efficient product development.
   The modular circuit concept facilitates lower costs and reduced weight
   for satellite communication applications compared to standard
   technology. The KERAMIS (R) technology has been developed in a series of
   funded research projects resulting in specific experiments for
   verification in space. Each experimental board consists of a multilayer
   PFTE substrate with mounted LTCC modules on top and combining RF-,
   DC-and digital functionality. As these experiments consist of several to
   dozens of LTCC modules the second level interconnections between ceramic
   substrate and PTFE form a very important part of the package. Here,
   interconnects using LGA and wirebond processes have been developed that
   both provide operation up to Ka band frequencies. In order to verify the
   technology a demonstrator system incorporating multiple synthesizers and
   amplifiers has been developed, qualified and launched into space as part
   of the German TET-1 On-Orbit Verification (OOV) mission. In this paper,
   a wrap-up of the package technology is given and verification results
   acquired since the start of the mission in July 2012 are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time, a transmitter lineup
   consisting of a multi-stage dual path asymmetrical Doherty power
   amplifier (PA) with an innovative method to condition the phase and
   amplitude of the input signals presented to the Carrier and Peaking
   amplifiers to achieve optimum performance. The final stage PA has been
   designed using a new generation of Freescale Airfast (TM) LDMOS power
   transistors. Asymmetrical Doherty PA using this transistor shows more
   than 15.5 dB gain and 48\% efficiency at 8 dB output back-off (OBO).
   Additionally in dual path configuration a lineup efficiency of greater
   than 43\% at 8 dB OBO is achieved. The corrected adjacent channel power
   ratio (ACPR) values are better than -52 dBc after digital pre-distortion
   (DPD) for a wideband LTE signal. The amplifier line-up targets next
   generation cellular infrastructure systems operating in the 2.6 GHz
   band, and to the authors knowledge, exhibits the highest reported lineup
   performance for this application.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative squaring Algorithm is proposed which solves the problem of
   finding the Squaring large binary numbers. The foundation of the
   algorithm lies in an ancient Vedic algorithm. The resulting n-bit
   squaring architecture translated into hardware. With the proposed
   architecture using retiming technique the optimizations for large binary
   number is achieved. The essential idea of retiming is to relocate latch
   boundaries to balance the delay of each stage. In this paper, we used a
   method for finding a feasible retiming to optimize a CDFG to meet a
   smallest iteration period. The production data rates and predictable
   execution time is model by CDFG graph. The proposed squaring algorithm
   is significant savings in time when compared with a special case of
   formula based on Dwandwayoga which means duplex. Duplex of a digit is
   calculated based on Urdhva-tiryagbhyam. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm is measured in terms of power and time and it is much better
   than the Dwandwayoga {[}8, 17] squaring algorithm. The design is
   simulated using NCsim from cadence and synthesize the design using RTL
   Compiler from the cadence EDA tool. The design is implemented using the
   90nm standard cell technology Libraries.}},

Abstract = {{Today, material performance is regarded as one of the richest sources of
   innovation. Accordingly, architecture is shifting to practices by which
   the computational generation of form is directly driven by material
   characteristics. At the same time, there is a growing technological
   means for the varied composition of material, an extension of the
   digital chain that foregrounds a new need to engage materials at
   multiple scales within the design process. Recognising that the process
   of making materials affords perspectives not available with found
   materials, this paper reports the design and assembly of the fibre
   reinforced composite structure Composite Territories, in which the
   property of bending is activated and varied so as to match solely
   through material means a desired form. This case study demonstrates how
   one might extend the geometric model so that it is able to engage and
   reconcile physical parameters that occur at different scales.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of signal parameters from noisy sampled data is an
   essential problem in digital signal processing. In this paper, we
   discuss the numerical solution of the following parameter estimation
   problem. Let h(0) be a multivariate exponential sum, i.e., h(0) is a
   finite linear combination of complex exponentials with distinct
   frequency vectors. Determine all parameters of h(0), i.e., all frequency
   vectors, all coefficients, and the number of exponentials, if finitely
   many sampled data of h(0) are given. Using Ingham-type inequalities, the
   Riesz stability of finitely many multivariate exponentials with
   well-separated frequency vectors is discussed in continuous as well as
   discrete norms. Furthermore, we show that a rectangular Fourier-type
   matrix has a bounded condition number, if the frequency vectors are
   well-separated and if the number of samples is sufficiently large. Then
   we reconstruct the parameters of an exponential sum h(0) by a novel
   algorithm, the so-called sparse approximate Prony method (SAPM), where
   we use only some data sampled along few straight lines. The first part
   of SAPM estimates the frequency vectors using the approximate Prony
   method in the univariate case. The second part of SAPM computes all
   coefficients by solving an overdetermined linear Vandermonde-type
   system. Numerical experiments show the performance of our method.}},

Abstract = {{Sonography techniques use multiple transducer elements for tissue
   visualization. Signals detected at each element are sampled prior to
   digital beamforming. The required sampling rates are up to 4 times the
   Nyquist rate of the signal and result in considerable amount of data,
   that needs to be stored and processed. A developed technique, based on
   the finite rate of innovation model, compressed sensing (CS) and
   Xampling ideas, allows to reduce the number of samples needed to
   reconstruct an image comprised of strong reflectors. A significant
   drawback of this method is its inability to treat speckle, which is of
   significant importance in medical imaging. Here we build on previous
   work and show explicitly how to perform beamforming in the Fourier
   domain. Beamforming in frequency exploits the low bandwidth of the
   beamformed signal and allows to bypass the oversampling dictated by
   digital implementation of beamforming in time. We show that this allows
   to obtain the same beamformed image as in standard beamforming but from
   far fewer samples. Finally, we present an analysis based CS-technique
   that allows for further reduction in sampling rate, using only a portion
   of the beamformed signal's bandwidth, namely, sampling the signal at
   sub-Nyquist rates. We demonstrate our methods on in vivo cardiac
   ultrasound data and show that reductions up to 1/25 over standard
   beamforming rates are possible.}},

   years ago. They are known as ``digital natives{''}. They have been
   exposed to different learning environments. It became evident that

   professors to keep teaching the Signal Processing content, however
   getting better results, like less failure rate or more motivation. This
   matter is explored through a detailed explanation of interactive
   teaching applied to a Sub-Nyquist sampling lab, followed by an

Abstract = {{The theory of sampling signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI) has
   shown that it is possible to perfectly recover classes of
   non-bandlimited signals such as streams of Diracs from uniform samples.
   Most of previous papers, however, have to some extent only focused on
   the sampling of periodic or finite duration signals.
   In this paper we propose a novel method that is able to reconstruct
   infinite streams of Diracs, even in high noise scenarios. We
   sequentially process the discrete samples and output locations and
   amplitudes of the Diracs in real-time. We first establish conditions for
   perfect reconstruction in the noiseless case and then present the
   sequential algorithm for the noisy scenario. We also show that we can
   achieve a high reconstruction accuracy of 1000 Diracs for SNRs as low as
   5dB.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for the reverse
   engineering of signal acquisition chains. We investigate how signals are
   transformed through a chain of signal acquisition and reconstruction
   stages. The signals, at different stages in the chain, are modelled
   using the theory of sampling signals with Finite Rate of Innovation
   (FRI). The model allows us to determine the chain structure and
   corresponding acquisition history from unknown query signals and to
   retrieve important parameters relating to the acquisition chain.}},

Abstract = {{There are several possible applications for the use of unmanned aerial
   vehicles. Among these, monitoring areas inaccessible to humans has been
   studied with emphasis. In parallel, mosaic construction techniques for
   digital reconstruction of these areas are the focus of researchers
   seeking to innovate and streamline this process. The purpose of this
   work is to unite the ability to fast traversal of an area covered by a
   system with multiple UAV and the need to obtain images in the process to
   compose mosaics to monitor interested regions. For this reason, the
   development of a tool for generating paths is required. It is from there
   that we can control the UAV to complete the task of scanning the area
   while decreasing the associated cost and time spent.}},

Abstract = {{Now-a-days, it is a very common trend for youth to go for regular
   gymnasium for muscular body building or eliminating extra fat. Most of
   the equipments used for these purposes are generally for indoor
   exercises. Thus there is least scope of rigorous outdoor exercise in
   open air environment. An attempt has been made by the present authors to
   develop a concept model of Ergometer which is to be installed in open
   space like park After a small user survey and brain storming, it was
   decided that the intended design should be unique in look; aesthetically
   appealing; compatible for both adult Indian male and female; easy to use
   and most interestingly, it would be motivational factor for people to
   continue their exercise for longer duration. People would feel happy
   because more battery (inbuilt) recharging would happen if they go for
   intense and longer duration exercise. Those batteries would be used in
   night for illuminating the park Innovative concept model of the
   Ergometer was evaluated and subsequently, design was modified by
   providing more human-centric inputs (various adjustable features for
   anthropometric compatibility; easy reach towards handle, clearance
   dimensions, inputs for riding comfort etc.) through proactive virtual
   ergonomics techniques using digital human modeling and simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In 2008 five United States institutions collaborated to archive the U.S.
   federal government Web presence: the Library of Congress, the Internet
   Archive, the California Digital Library, the Government Printing Office,
   and the University of North Texas (UNT). Their objective was to document
   the changes coincident with the shift in leadership of the U.S.
   executive branch. The five partners identified key resources from the
   U.S. .gov Top Level Domain and completed crawls from September 2008
   until March 2009. The resulting End of Term (EOT) 2008 Web Archive, a 16
   TB dataset, was distributed to partners interested in providing local
   services and access to the archive. The UNT Libraries investigated
   Portable Document Format (PDF) files, a class of content many
   information professionals associate with the traditional notion of
   ``discrete documents{''}. Over four million unique PDF documents were
   extracted from the Archive and a series of metadata and information
   extraction processes were conducted for each document. Additionally,
   derivative raster images of the first page of each document were
   created. These metrics were ingested into a database for further
   analysis, which brought to light previously hidden characteristics of
   the federal government's Web-published content. The paper discusses the
   overall workflow and describes the tools used to extract document
   features. Findings suggest opportunities for the development of
   retrieval tools that will provide new ways of selecting content and
   building collections from large Web archives.}},

Abstract = {{The US National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), through the
   Digitization Planning Branch in the Office of Innovation, is developing
   flexible and appropriate agency-wide standards for digitization in order
   to advance NARA `s goal of making its holdings more available.
   Recognizing that there is no single answer to the question ``what format
   should I use,{''} this effort uses the One Touch and Fit For Purpose
   concepts to document file format and attribute choices that will meet a
   variety of known and expected uses for the digitized material.
   Focusing on a collection of use cases, this paper examines the essential
   components of the effort: characterizing customer groups including file
   creators and file consumers, defining the intended uses for digitization
   products, designing digitization products to satisfy these needs, and
   finally, packaging the standards information at an appropriate level of
   complexity for a variety of user communities. The effort reflects a
   broader agency-wide approach to systematic digitization and acknowledges
   the growing effectiveness of distributed digitization including
   utilizing commercial partners, crowd-sourcing and other community-driven
   initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Phase retrieval and phase diversity are wavefront sensing techniques fed
   by focal-plane data. In phase retrieval, the incoming wavefront is
   estimated from a single (near-) focal image of an unresolved source. In
   phase diversity, from at least two images of the same (complex) object
   recorded in presence of a known optical aberration (eg. defocus), both
   the unknown incoming wavefront and the observed object can be derived.
   These two techniques have many advantages: the hardware is limited to
   (or can be merged in) the usual imaging sensor, the number of estimated
   modes can be continuously tuned and both are among the very few methods
   enabling the measurement of differential pistons/tip/tilts on segmented
   or divided apertures. The counterpart is that complexity is reported to
   digital processing, which is either iterative and long, or fast but
   limited to a first-order phase expansion. Based on an innovative
   physical approach and mathematical inversion, new simple, analytical and
   exact algorithms have been recently derived for phase retrieval and
   diversity. Conjugated with recent detector and processor advances, these
   algorithms can be implemented in adaptive/active optics loops, or even
   provide a purely-digital on-the-fly alternative. In this paper, for the
   first time, we present experimental validation of these algorithms with
   the cophasing of a segmented mirror.}},

Abstract = {{Bringing public services to the doorstep of the people at the grassroots
   level is a difficult enterprise of any government. The difficulty arises
   out of corruption, bureaucratic inertia and vested-interest politics.
   The government of Bangladesh through an institutional innovation breaks
   this cycle of difficulties and ensures the services easy and affordable.
   This innovation captures a variety of modern public administration tools
   and strategies like application of ICTs, cost-cuts, and hands-on
   NPM-modeled public services. This institutional innovation is ``Union
   Information and Services Center (UISC){''} established at all Unions
   Parishad-the lowest tier of governance in Bangladesh. A number of
   government services are provided by the UISC which is run by local
   entrepreneurs, hosted and monitored by Union Parishad, supported and
   supervised by central administration and assisted by many non-profit
   organizations. The UISCs are benefitting local people and leave a number
   of positive implications which includes among others corruption-free
   public services at the doorstep Of rural people at an affordable cost,
   bridging the widening digital divide and preparing an IT-savvy
   community, generating entrepreneurship and employment, and empowerment
   of women at the rural settings.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, the capital projects are managed in three stages (design,
   construction, operation) with different stakeholders, who would pass
   only the specified minimum of information from one team to the next. The
   increasing complexity of underground infrastructure has forced the
   industry to extend the managing of projects for the complete lifespan.
   At the new lifecycle project approach, the collaborating stakeholders
   can harmonize their efforts for the utmost interest of a successful
   project. For underground works, the impacts of typical risk factors
   shall be reviewed, as geotechnical, environmental, contractual and
   financial risks - risks at selection of the best design, construction
   and operation methods - safety hazards of working underground. The
   authors review the steps of risk analysis: setting-up digital risk
   register and recording risk factors by category, description,
   probability, impact and mitigation, identifying contingency plans and
   required actions. The stakeholders of the project determine the
   consequences of major risk factors, and get to an agreement on balanced
   risk sharing. For effective prevention and monitoring of the noted
   risks, innovative digital solutions: real time data monitoring, 3D and
   4D modeling, resource-loaded scheduling, and specialized collaboration
   software are available. The conclusion summarizes practical
   recommendations to stakeholders for collaboration and joint risk
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The growing worldwide demand for development of underground
   infrastructure requires efficient project delivery models and balanced
   contracting practices. Traditional project delivery methods do not work
   well for large and complex underground works. The process from design to
   commissioning often takes several years. Onerous contract conditions,
   unbalanced risk sharing, frequent changes, cost, and time escalation can
   often result in inefficiency, adverse contractual relationships, even
   litigation between the parties. The paper provides a brief review of
   recently applied positive advancements in contracting and project
   delivery. The new elements can be characterized by two major aspects.
   The first is integrated leadership and improved collaboration between
   all the prime participants having equal rights and responsibilities in
   one incentive multiparty agreement. The second is extensive application
   of innovative digital technologies for design, collaboration, and
   management. The authors evaluate these new trends and provide
   recommendations in conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{in this article we present a system capable of creating, managing and
   presenting digital portfolios. Our system innovates by using roles and
   states during its creation phase. This allows for high quality elements
   in the portfolio and promotes the students' reflection over them before
   full integration. The system also complies with the existing standards
   for e-portfolios. Moreover, it adds an extension to integrate previous
   created portfolios from different educational levels. In the article we
   show the need for such extension and describe how the system deals with
   integration of such diverse portfolios into a single one.}},

Abstract = {{The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is an open access digital
   library portal for researchers in astronomy and physics, operated by the
   Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) under a NASA grant,
   successfully serving the professional science community for two decades.
   Currently there are about 55,000 frequent users (100+ queries per year),
   and up to 10 million infrequent users per year. Access by the general
   public now accounts for about half of all ADS use, demonstrating the
   vast reach of the content in our databases. The visibility and use of
   content in the ADS can be measured by the fact that there are over
   17,000 links from Wikipedia pages to ADS content, a figure comparable to
   the number of links that Wikipedia has to OCLC's WorldCat catalog. The
   ADS, through its holdings and innovative techniques available in ADS
   Labs,(1) offers an environment for information discovery that is unlike
   any other service currently available to the astrophysics community.
   Literature discovery and review are important components of science
   education, aiding the process of preparing for a class, project, or
   presentation. The ADS has been recognized as a rich source of
   information for the science education community in astronomy, thanks to
   its collaborations within the astronomy community, publishers and
   projects like ComPADRE. One element that makes the ADS uniquely relevant
   for the science education community is the availability of powerful
   tools to explore aspects of the astronomy literature as well as the
   relationship between topics, people, observations and scientific papers.
   The other element is the extensive repository of scanned literature, a
   significant fraction of which consists of historical literature.}},

Abstract = {{Planetariums have a long history of experimentation with audio and
   visuals to create new multimedia experiences. We report on a series of
   innovative experiences in the Gates Planetarium at the Denver Museum of
   Nature \& Science in 2009-2011 combining live performances of music and
   navigation through scientific visualizations. The Life Out There
   productions featured a story showcasing astrobiology concepts at scales
   ranging from galactic to molecular, and told using VJ-ing of immersive
   visualizations and musical performances from the House Band to the
   Universe. Funded by the NASA Astrobiology Institute's JPL-Titan Team,
   these hour-long shows were broken into four separate themed musical
   movements, with an improvisatory mix of music, dome visuals, and spoken
   science narrative which resulted in no two performances being exactly
   alike. Post-performance dissemination is continuing via a recorded
   version of the performance available as a DVD and online streaming
   video. Written evaluations from visitors who were present at the live
   shows reveal high satisfaction, while one of the Life Out There concerts
   was used to inaugurate a new evening program to draw in a younger
   audience demographic to DMNS.}},

Journal = {{E \& M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{14-29}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents basic, empirically-grounded, overview of the current
   state of creative industries in the Czech Republic with particular
   emphasis on the principles of spatial differentiation. Creative
   industries are associated with their positive role in creating
   innovations and jobs as well as with their benefits for urban
   regeneration. The main aim of the text is to contribute for solving
   major existing problem with relatively weak empirical evidence of the
   topic of creative industries in the Czech Republic. Creative industries
   are defined using basic theoretical-methodological foundations followed
   by a brief outline of position of creative industries in the perspective
   of national economies of European countries. The core empirical analysis
   presented in the text draws on a unique data set compiled from the
   annual survey among the Czech-based firms in productive sectors in 2009
   by the Czech Statistical Office. These data cover employment and
   financial indicators such as production, value added and wages
   disaggregated to particular industries according to NACE 2-digit
   classification. The first part of analyses findings using simple
   descriptive statistics and the second one uses multiple regression
   analysis to enhance the explanatory value of this text. There are also
   some basic conclusions for policy making implication for regional
   support of creative industries within the paper. The stress is put on
   necessity for spatial specification of policy making strategies. There
   is absolutely different position and role of the creative industries in
   metropolitan regions (and mainly in Prague) and in small regions or
   peripheral regions. Briefly, support and development of creative
   industries is not likely to be the remedy for all the regions in the
   Czech Republic.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an example of NA, a valuable tool for designing an
   efficient teacher training program associated with ICT in education. The
   purpose of a Needs Analysis is to review the teachers' learning needs in
   the training program; including the professional development of teachers
   by using advanced ICT tools. The purpose of this NA is to identify the
   current or perceived digital skills, interests and cognitive attitudes
   of a number of teachers involved in a project at the national level,
   named The School, an active member of the Information Society'. This
   interesting project shows a new potential of technology for innovative
   and successful teaching approach with the potential to supply teachers
   with new digital, skills for teaching practices. Project mentioned is a
   national initiative, developed by specialists in the education and IT
   experts. NA offers important dates for general survey of the project. NA
   was planned to reveal the following objectives: diagnosing the
   impediments encountered by teachers, during this complex and continuous
   integration ICT process; identifying the level to which various subjects
   could benefit from the advantages of technology; indicating the type of
   ICT influence on designing the teaching strategies; defining the
   expectations of teachers with regard to the future teacher training
   program. Also, the purpose of NA is to determine the value of different
   Romanian ICT programs. NA has not only an informative purpose, it is
   structure of reference for improving other initiatives in the area of
   teacher training, including curriculum design. Our results show that
   Internet, wiki pages, and on-line collaborative groups can be useful
   tools for research, teaching, and communication. Teachers have
   competence in computer usage, acknowledging the fact that pupils become
   very familiar with technology.}},

Abstract = {{The mixture of learning sequences taking place face- to- face and
   online, known as ``Blended Learning{''} (BL), is a trend in foreign
   language acquisition, in full swing nowadays. By contrasting the
   innovations of blended learning to those of the traditional approaches,
   this paper tries to discriminate, within the inventory of teaching
   strategies, between structural changes and cosmetic ones, in order to
   identify) the elements that truly promote the learning of foreign
   languages by the generation shaped in the spirit of the digital
   technology, as opposed to techniques focusing on attractiveness and/or
   games, which only manipulate the people's desire to purchase things, but
   are no more than a secondary, if not complementary factor in reaching
   the proposed learning objective.
   Using an Austrian theoretical model we have tried to prove that the e-
   learning component is indispensable for foreign language learning today,
   in both stages of BL, i.e. face- to- face, and online, wondering whether
   the large- scale use of e- learning in teaching foreign languages
   nowadays is going to be the future path towards securing success in
   creating and developing linguistic competencies.}},

Abstract = {{Implementing the digital technology in our everyday lives has determined
   a structural mutation in the way we receive information. This new
   pattern of thinking is more obvious in the young generation, for whom
   any activity becomes inconceivable in the absence of gadgets. Certain
   theorists call these people Digital natives{''}, and describe them in
   contrast to Digital immigrants{''}, i.e. those users of the digital
   technology, who were trained in the traditional educational environment.
   We have added a third category of ``non- digitals{''} to the above
   model, in order to provide a more accurate account of the challenges of
   teaching today.
   Starting from the hypothesis that the teacher needs, particularly in
   his/her new, multi- faceted role in modern teaching, certain
   competencies, similar to those of his/ her students, in order to convey
   to them the learning contents effectively, irrespective of the subject
   taught, this paper tries to examine the extent to which the possible
   relationships, that are established between a teacher and his/ her
   students, on the criterion of the digital competence, so far a
   complementary, yet an omnipresent, and indispensable skill in the
   educational environment of today, can impact on the educational
   approaches in the teaching of foreign languages.
   The main benefit that the teaching of foreign languages derives from the
   digital technology, most likely is the access to resources of the target
   language and culture in real time. The judicious use of this facility
   within the education process represents the innovative pre- requisite to
   improving the students' performance in foreign language learning. We
   wonder when the ``Digital Competence{''} will become a skill that is not
   only necessary, but also compulsory, for teachers of foreign languages!}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, there are major issues facing Romanian education system.
   Policy makers and/or innovative teachers can bring hope and success.
   This paper will present past achievements and current trends concerning
   the implementation of the digital technologies for education within the
   ODL Department of the University of Bucharest. Chapter 1. After 14 years
   of design, implementation and management of the ODL study programs, the
   ODL Department reached a stable situation with indisputable achievements
   that are presented in the first chapter of the paper. The framework for
   ODL in Romania is legally defined by H.G.1011/2001 and ARACIS Quality
   Standards. In fact, RO-ODL is a blended learning system: All study
   programs provided by the ODL Dept are accredited by Romanian Agency for
   Quality Assurance in Higher Education. Meanwhile, we have implemented
   the ICTStrategy of the University of Bucharest that was approved by
   University Senate (2003). This strategy had 3 levels: digital literacy,
   ICT based curriculum and computerization of institution and processes.
   Real achievements will be presented (virtual campus, eL learning
   resources etc). The chapter two presents the actual context ``Digital
   Agenda 2020 for Europe{''} which is not surprising at all if we consider
   forecasts made 30 years ago by visionary people. The chapter 3 presents
   the digital technologies under implementation within ODL Department. Our
   objective is to be already prepared for virtual university concept
   (UNIBUC-Virtual) if such decision will be taken in due time. Subjects as
   cloud computing, Learning' Management Systems, eL learning resources,
   blended learning, video-lectures, video-conference systems, on-line
   assessment, free of charge productivity tools will be presented within
   the context build by ODL Department of the University of Bucharest.}},

Abstract = {{ICT and Internet have allowed the creation of new educational objects in
   an innovative and original way, in particular in the fields of the
   retrieval and study of cultural heritage and art. The connectionbetween
   the digital and cultural domains brought a new approach to learning
   which reveals in activities where space and time vanish, giving rise to
   a new relationship between an individual and culture.
   The digital world, offering many potentialities and chances, enters in
   the museum, bringing substantial changes permitting new experiences of
   living and perceiving exhibition places, stimulating interest,
   curiosity, imagination and emotions of the users. This is possible
   through the use of innovative ways to communicate with people using a
   more extensive advertising that can reach a wide audienceand through the
   creation of attractive and smart websites that allow access to
   collections through interactive guided tours in all languages,
   consultation of databases, 3D reconstructions of environments,
   educational section dedicated to children and students, online meeting
   with experts and assistants.
   The paper describes an overview of the current state of the websites of
   the main Italian museums, archives and libraries that make available to
   users online information and learning resource. The study of these sites
   and their functionalities allow us an analysis about methodological and
   pedagogical implications of the impact that ICT tools and the related
   educational models have on the Cultural Heritage Education.
   Finally, the contribution investigates how new technological tools can
   be used to create open access-museums for disabled people and which are
   the technological device and techniques necessary to develop appropriate
   frameworks and to outline the future directions to support Cultural
   Heritage Education.}},

Abstract = {{The environment of teaching and learning civilization and culture has
   changed from the formal traditional classroom into the non-formal online
   museums. Our study will aim at analyzing the way in which civilization
   was e-framed in the virtual project ``A History of the World in 100
   Objects{''}, run by BBC Radio 4 and the British Museum in 2010. The
   British Museum won the 2011 Art Fund Prize for this innovative platform
   whose main content was created by the contributors (museum curators,
   university professors, and students-visitors). Our theoretical framework
   will be framing theory and critical discourse analysis. The research
   questions will focus on the content of this digital museum: (I) the
   types of objects belonging to the 20 periods of e-civilization; (2) the
   salience of countries of origin for the 100 objects; (3) the salience of
   social practices framed in the non-formal teaching of
   e-civilization/culture; and on the visitors' response: (I) the types of
   attitudes expressed in the forum comments; (2) the types of messages
   visitors decoded from the analysis of the objects; (3) the (creative)
   value of such e-resources.}},

Abstract = {{A nation's culture lies in the soul of its digital games. Nowadays, most
   of the teenagers use digital devices. Digital games represent an
   innovative method in sharing global cultural awareness among teenagers.
   What are the differences in students' choices of digital games? Is there
   a relation between students' digital game choices and their gender or
   their culture? How much are digital games indispensable for students?
   How much of their time is spent using digital machines? And most
   importantly what are their metaphors? Metaphors help people talk about
   their inner thoughts and sometimes the unspeakable ones. This research
   study aims to find out the digital game metaphors that Turkish and
   Romanian students use; and the relationship between these metaphors and
   their cultural values. An online questionnaire was elaborates in English
   and translated into two different native languages: Turkish and
   Romanian. The questionnaires were distributed to lyceum (high-school)
   students; ages between 15 and 17, and 401 students answered the
   questionnaires. This study has shown that some of the metaphors that
   students use do not change according to culture, while some were
   remarkably different. Differences between two different digital game
   cultures were explored, and recommendations were provided in the
   article.}},

Abstract = {{The paper critically examines the experience in implementing an
   innovative pilot project from students and learning facilitators'
   perspective. It highlights examples of modeling innovative practice
   through research and teaching with emergent technologies in a frame of
   Let's play as architects in the city! project launched in 2012 as
   optional subject-matter for the third and fourth grade of elementary
   school. Developed by a group of architects (Grupul De-a arhitectura) and
   implemented in partnership with the University of Bucharest and
   Architects' Order, the project has an interdisciplinary approach and
   involves architects, teachers and University faculty and students.
   Project aims to make primary school students acquainted with basic
   concepts from architecture and urbanism by direct observation,
   neighborhood exploration and creative use of data gathered through a
   variety of ICT tools.
   Firstly the paper explores young students' textual engagements with
   mobile technologies and the changing nature of literacy in the context
   of being involved in an engaging complex activity. Project activities
   provide contextual learning experiences and rich exploration and
   discovery of the connected nature of information in the real world.
   Specific assignments reinforce skills development, use of mobile
   technologies and articulation to school curriculum: reading, writing,
   math, technological education, civic participation, arts and digital
   skills.
   Secondly the paper investigates the perceptions of learning
   facilitators' on the use of mobile technology for project
   implementation. Architects and teachers will provide narrative
   information on the balance between planned and unplanned in using new
   technology for classroom and outdoor activities with elementary school
   students, between types of emerging collaboration encouraged by use of
   mobile technologies. Instructors will reflect not only on strengths but
   also on the challenges in implementing this integrative learning
   approach.
   Thirdly, the evaluation of project implementation during the pilot phase
   will allow changes aiming at making of the extended phase a platform of
   quality education. Experiences gained in the frame of Let's play as
   architects in the city! could provide genuine examples about ubiquitous
   learning, where learning opportunities and experiences are dramatically
   changing (Burbules). Therefore we expect to stimulate research efforts
   that focus on key areas like mobile learning, new literacies (e-texts)
   and engaging faculty and students in the pursuit of digital perspectives
   to research and teaching.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging technologies are transforming the workflows in pervasive
   healthcare enterprises. Pervasive Healthcare is a one of the developing
   technology within the pervasive computing paradigm. The presence of
   pervasive computing, consisting of wireless network gives innovative
   medium for data transmission of medical applications. We currently use a
   various wireless technology in healthcare domain. In the existing
   technology of e-Health has less security of Electronic Medical Records
   (EMR) and cannot access the medical records in wireless medium. An EMR
   is a digital version of the traditional paper-based medical record for
   an each patient's record. The EMR represents a medical record within a
   faculty can access the data, such as a doctor or a patient or
   administration. The accessing of information from the remote database
   should be high security; it should be a secured access of data by
   authorized persons. We propose a Pervasive Mobile Healthcare solve these
   problems and provide user to access the multimedia medical record from
   anywhere and anytime with security using Elliptical Curve
   Cryptography(ECC) algorithm, which includes authentication and access
   control. The authentication is allows the types of users who is
   authorized to use the application. Security is provided through the
   process of Encryption and decryption of data. This secured system will
   provide security in delivering the EMR of patients. Implementation here
   is done by using Android software and for database MySql is used in
   Server system. A Wi-Fi enabled mobile is used to receive or transmit the
   secured medical data as well as image retrieval. The novelty of my
   application deals with mobility where the users can able to access the
   secure information. The mobile application develop for real world
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Bioinspiration can fuel conceptual leaps for the creation of membranes
   with selective elasticity capable of responding synergistically to
   multiple environmental conditions. Recent advances in new methods
   designed to produce elastomeric substrates with variable densities,
   geometries, and flexibilities through digital fabrication can be pivotal
   for technological shifts in this frontier. However, pioneering
   opportunities of integrating nano and microengineering design and
   fabrication to advance the field of self-regulated membranes with
   multifunctional capabilities remains largely unexplored. Researchers
   face crucial challenges in this endeavor. While material science moves
   swiftly into establishing new elastomeric composites, often these
   advances are aimed towards applications under the millimeter scale. As
   such, innovations frequently prove inadequate for building applications
   primarily due to insufficient climatic and structural endurance. Another
   major barrier in the development of multifunctional elastomeric
   membranes in architecture pertains to fabrication. Scalability obstacles
   derived from the gap between 3d printing technologies and microscale
   manufacturing are significant. SABERs research provides a framework to
   discuss an interdisciplinary and multiscale design approach to challenge
   scalability barriers. The research discusses key potential opportunities
   in digital fabrication of lightweight building envelopes with selective
   elasticity. Programming selective matter can prove significant for
   future building resilience.}},

Abstract = {{The object of the particular research is involvement of students in
   informative stock-building of a regional museum during research
   practice. The aim of the research is to carry out evaluation of this
   form of involvement and its advantages: using discourse analysis (Jean
   Liotard); putting forward particular indicators; as well as applying
   several communication theories (Nikolai Nikishin, Yuri Lotman, Peter van
   Mensch); and regarding virtual museum as a special communication system
   based on non-verbal communication of visitors with exhibits. Possible
   benefits of the museum in this evaluation are of minor importance. The
   most significant aspect is to reveal student's (museum employee's during
   the research practice) as `sender's' role in cognition and non-verbal
   communication with the addressee or the museum visitor. It is
   demonstrated in coordinated and still independent work, frequently
   oriented towards self-initiative, creative solutions based on particular
   knowledge and simultaneously initiating acquisition of new information,
   as well as promoting development of skills. These skills include
   communicating with an interviewee; carrying out content analysis of
   media text, identifying features of stereotypical thinking; creating
   brief but still informatively capacious description of an exhibit.
   The use of digital tools during the study process is completely related
   to scientific activities of academic staff in the implementation of
   research projects oriented towards innovations as well as provision of
   stable feedback If the research is carried out in tight relationship of
   scientists and students; everyone wins: students help academic staff
   (thus create conditions for their own research), carry out creative
   work, make own discoveries, because materials necessary for research are
   already collected and accordingly supplied; while academic staff
   develops students' professional competences by coordinating practical
   work, following their theoretical knowledge, skills and abilities,
   promoting creative solutions and thus educate new generation of
   scientists tempered in performing preparatory actions and open for
   innovations, elaboration and implementation of own creative research
   projects.}},

   the calibration of a satellite-communication phased arrays. The
   procedure is aimed at providing the optimized control voltages to be
   applied to the digital beamforming network so that the array synthesizes
   a well-controlled pattern whatever the operating conditions (working
   frequency, steering direction, required sidelobe profile). Towards this
   end, the calibration problem is suitably reformulated an optimization
   one, which is then solved by an evolutionary strategy. The procedure is
   numerically validated on an arrangement comprising 36 digital phase
   shifters, and suitable experimental measurements are also added to
   assess the features and potentialities of the proposed technique.}},

Title = {{An Object-Oriented Simulator for 3D Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Imaging
   System}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an innovative imaging modality
   that provides 3D reconstructed images of breast to detect the breast
   cancer. Projections obtained with an X-ray source moving in a limited
   angle interval are used to reconstruct 3D image of breast. Several
   reconstruction algorithms are available for DBT imaging. Filtered back
   projection algorithm has traditionally been used to reconstruct images
   from projections. Iterative reconstruction algorithms such as algebraic
   reconstruction technique (ART) were later developed. Recently,
   compressed sensing based methods have been proposed in tomosynthesis
   imaging problem. We have developed an object-oriented simulator for 3D
   digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging system using C++ programming
   language. The simulator is capable of implementing different iterative
   and compressed sensing based reconstruction methods on 3D digital
   tomosynthesis data sets and phantom models. A user friendly graphical
   user interface (GUI) helps users to select and run the desired methods
   on the designed phantom models or real data sets. The simulator has been
   tested on a phantom study that simulates breast tomosynthesis imaging
   problem. Results obtained with various methods including algebraic
   reconstruction technique (ART) and total variation regularized
   reconstruction techniques (ART+TV) are presented. Reconstruction results
   of the methods are compared both visually and quantitatively by
   evaluating performances of the methods using mean structural similarity
   (MSSIM) values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative architecture for radiation-hardened
   FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). This architecture is based on the
   use of MTJs (Magnetic Tunnel Junctions), magnetic nanostructures used as
   basic elements of MRAM (Magnetic Random Access Memory). These devices
   are totally immune to radiations and can be used as a reference memory
   to perform ``scrubbing{''} techniques, which consist in regularly
   reloading the configuration of the FPGA to fix the radiation induced
   errors that may have occured. This approach allows hardening the
   circuits at low cost in terms of area, while reducing the standby power
   consumption and offering new fonctionalities, like dynamic
   reconfiguration. A silicon demonstrator was implemented, including a
   2-inputs LUT (Look Up Table) and tested using a digital tester, giving
   encouraging results.}},

Abstract = {{Low-power applications, such as sensing, are becoming increasingly
   important and demanding in terms of minimizing energy consumption,
   driving the search for new and innovative interface architectures and
   technologies. Carbon Nanotube FETs (CNFETs) are excellent candidates for
   further energy reduction, as CNFET-based digital circuits are projected
   to potentially achieve an order of magnitude improvement in energy-delay
   product at highly scaled technology nodes. This paper presents an
   overview of the first demonstration of a complete sub-system, a sensor
   interface circuit, implemented entirely using CNFETs. The demonstrated
   sub-system is an all-digital capacitive sensor to digital converter. The
   CNFET sensor interface is demonstrated by using the CNFET circuitry to
   interface with a sensor used to control a handshaking robot.}},

Abstract = {{In Malaysia, although the government has promoted technology inclusion
   of rural area, the consideration of readiness for technology is being
   neglected. Research effort on technology readiness in Malaysian rural
   area is low. This research argues that low technology readiness may
   worsen the disparity of e-inclusion in Malaysia. Hence, this research is
   performed to provide evidence of the extreme importance of the
   investigation of readiness to technology implementation before its
   inception. The aim of the study is to assess the readiness level in
   Malaysian rural areas according to different age groups. Kampung Tengah,
   Melaka, Malaysia was chosen as a case study, and a survey study design
   was adopted. Data from 150 respondents of four different age groups was
   gathered and being analyzed with Kruskal Wallis Test. The results
   display significant differences among different age for optimism,
   innovativeness and insecurity. The results have indicated that there is
   a need to increase the technology readiness based on different age
   group, and different age groups require different strategies for
   e-inclusion initiatives. Further work will be performed in this
   community to gather technological and ICT requirements to conceptualize
   the value chain and implementation strategy for the inception of
   technology. The value chain can be further integrated and enhanced with
   e-inclusion initiatives towards the implementation of ICT-based
   initiatives such as e-learning.}},

Abstract = {{The current manual registration system applied by the Majlis Bandaraya
   Shah Alam (MBSA), Jabatan Agama Islam Selangor (JAIS), and local
   cemetery visitor in searching death information and grave cemetery
   location are still operated manually. This paper demonstrated the
   potential of GIS, GPS, Google earth and other ICT technologies in
   developing a digital Muslim cemetery information system in Section 21,
   Shah Alam. This proposed system (Islam-21) was developed based on the
   standard System Development Lifecycle (SDLC); i) to conduct user
   requirements analysis, ii) to design and develop the system and iii) to
   test the performance of the system. Although only 57 per cent from 30
   respondents strongly agreed the need of the proposed system, the system
   was essential in fulfilling the user's requirement particularly in
   giving grave direction and death information. The Islam-21 allowed the
   user to perform database query for grave or death searching, provided
   user with map direction of the detailed spatial death information. The
   future implementation of this innovative prototype might be increased
   among the people of Malaysia, thus its functions have being enhanced by
   applying interactive and dynamic web-based 3D database information and
   visualization for public service improvement.}},

Abstract = {{As industry is a symbol of the Economic Times, Creative Culture is the
   symbol of the Information Age. Creative Culture Industry doesn't rely on
   traditional investment of physical assets or resource consumption;
   rather, innovation and imagination are the raw materials at its core.
   There is an inextricable interaction between the Creative Culture
   Industry and the successful development of metropolis in the Information
   Age. The government's strategic choice regarding the fostering of
   Creative Culture Industry will make a great impact on the future
   sustainable development of metropolis.
   City is the crystallization of human civilization in space; people enter
   into city for better life. More and more Creation Communication and
   Wealth come into being in city, Especially in Metropolis. As the
   philosopher Aristotle had said more than two thousand years ago:
   ``People come to city for life, live in city for better life.{''} In
   human history, urbanization is linked closely with economic development,
   culture, and education, general health status, access to social services
   as well as the people's participation in cultural and political affairs.
   {[}1] Since the beginning of the new century, more and more cities and
   metropolis have begun to attach importance to the industry of creative
   culture.
   It has become a new bright spot of metropolitan development and is
   becoming an international trend of global economic development. John
   Hawkins-the leader of Creative cultural industry has said: ``There are
   two forms to make human life more creative, the first one is by the
   city, the second is by digital media.{''} {[}2]. He pointed out: when we
   talk about city, someone may find it very noisy or seriously polluted.
   Indeed, some of the city's overcrowded, people feel very tired. However,
   a complex modern city may become a source of creativity. The reasons are
   as follows: Firstly, a complex modern city can attract creative
   individuals and businesses; second, it can generate a creative
   environment; furthermore, it can expand the area of learning; in
   addition, it optimizes the local resources. {[}3].
   This article will present research on the strategic choices of
   government with regard to the Creative Culture Industry to develop the
   metropolis (including medium-size cities). Further, the integration of
   the Creative Culture industry}},

Abstract = {{with the development of digital signal processing, the field of speech
   signal processing has more attention. Speech Signal is the necessary
   method to achieve human-computer interaction and communication
   technology. Acoustics and perception of speech practical projects
   curriculum is widely set up in prestigious universities abroad. This
   paper shows a practical projects curriculum which is innovative to join
   the independent researching component with basic knowledge. The students
   complete a series of small independent speech signal processing
   practical projects curriculum to fully stimulate students' interest in
   the related research areas which will enable students to deeply
   understand the latest knowledge of speech signal. High-level talents
   will be trained by these practical projects. Analysis shows that the

Abstract = {{Network coding has recently received significant attention as an
   innovative approach that improves the spectral efficiency of wireless
   communication systems. The multiple access relay channel (MARC) where
   multiple users communicate with a common destination via a relay, is one
   of the important network coding applications in wireless cooperative
   communications. In this paper, selective relaying (SR) and maximum
   likelihood (ML) detection approach which combat performance degradation
   due to error propagation in digital relaying based wireless networks
   have been applied to the MARC model. Simulation results for Rayleigh
   fading channels show that both SR and ML detection schemes outperform
   the noncooperative system that involves direct transmissions and
   overcome the diversity gain reduction due to error propagation.}},

Abstract = {{The product life cycle management (PLM) system focuses on tracking and
   managing the information of whole product life cycle, with possible
   feedback of information to product life cycle phases. It provides
   opportunities to reduce the inefficiency of life cycle operations and
   gain in term of competitiveness. Our research consist of the effective
   management of product life cycle activities by using product
   data/information/knowledge which are accumulated in the closed-loops of
   product life cycle with the support of product embedded information
   devices (PIEDs), multi-agent systems (MAS) and product data \& knowledge
   management (PDKM). In this article we propose an approach based on three
   organizations: physical product, product Agent, and PLM system. The
   product Agent can gather product life cycle information from each
   product with a mobile device such as a personal digital assistant (PDA)
   or a fixed reader with built-in antenna. He sends information gathered
   at each site (e. g retail sites, distribution sites...) to a PLM system.
   From the PLM's point of view, the product is allowing itself to manage
   information resources relevant layers to itself in a distributed manner
   is a logical and practical approach.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), a lot of machines can
   nowadays emulate human being ability to understand and speak natural
   language. However, ASR problematic could be as interesting as it is
   difficult. Its difficulty is precisely due to the complexity of speech
   processing, which takes into consideration many aspects: acoustic,
   phonetic, syntactic, etc. Thus, the most commonly used technology, in
   the context of speech recognition, is based on statistical models.
   Especially, the Hidden Markov Models that are capable of simultaneously
   modeling frequency and temporal characteristics of the speech signal.
   There is also the alternative of using Neuronal Networks. But another
   interesting framework applied in ASR is indeed the hybrid Artificial
   Neural Network (ANN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) speech recognizer
   that improves the accuracy of the two models. In the present work, we
   propose an Arabic digits recognition system based on hybrid Artificial
   Neural Network and Hidden Markov Model (ANN/HMM). The main innovation in
   this work is to use an optimal neural network to determine the optimal
   class, unlike in classical Kohonen approach. The numerical results are
   encouraging and satisfactory.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a Self-Interest-Driven (SID) incentive scheme
   to stimulate cooperation among selfish nodes for ad dissemination in
   autonomous mobile social networks. As a key innovation of SID, we
   introduce ``virtual checks{''} to eliminate the needs of accurate
   knowledge about whom and how many credits ad provider should pay. A
   virtual check is included in each ad packet. When an intended receiver
   receives the packet for the first time from an intermediate node, the
   former authorizes the latter a digitally signed check, which serves as a
   proof of successful ad delivery. Multiple copies of a virtual check can
   be created and signed by different receivers. When a node that owns a
   signed check meets the ad provider, it requests the provider to cash the
   check. Both ad packets and signed checks can be traded among mobile
   nodes. We propose the effective mechanisms to define virtual rewards for
   ad packets and virtual checks, and formulate the nodal interaction as a
   two-player cooperative game, whose solution is obtained by the Nash
   Bargaining Theorem. Extensive simulations are carried out to compare SID
   with other existing incentive algorithms under real world mobility
   traces.}},

Title = {{A spatial exploration of factors affecting digitalization of farmers'

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aimed to examine organizational digitalization of
   farmers' associations (FAs) by conducting internal and external analyses
   of the contextual and geo-spatial attributes of the organizations, and
   further explored the role such associations play as key change agents in
   activating agricultural innovations and development in Taiwan.
   Design/methodology/approach - Unlike previous digitalization studies,
   which employed user data such as attitudes and behaviors as the major
   determinants, the present study focused on the spatial and
   organizational characteristics of FAs. An exploratory spatial analysis
   was conducted using a geographic information system to discover whether
   the organizational characteristics, local agriculture development, and
   neighboring FAs affect the organizational decision and adaption on
   information services. Research data from three national surveys were
   analyzed with a spatial regression model.
   Findings - Results showed that geographical neighborhood, in association
   with organizational characteristics, significantly affects the decision
   and level of organizational digitalization, while the development and
   characteristics of regional agriculture exert no significant influence.
   Practical implications - In the development of information and
   communication technology (ICT) diffusion policies for promoting
   organizational digitalization, it is important to highlight regional
   initiatives and complementary public efforts to guarantee an equitable
   access to ICT in areas with variances in economic development. In
   neighborhood FAs, greater development of economic and labor scales and
   ICT human capital also contribute to higher levels of organizational
   digitalization.
   Originality/value - Based on the study results, suggestions are provided
   for future research considering spatial forces in agricultural
   information studies and practical applications.}},

   Classroom Video Data}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{52-64}},
Abstract = {{The possibilities inherent in the collection and use of video footage
   point to an important innovation for classroom research. Unfortunately,
   researchers often experience uncertainty about incorporating video into
   their methodological approach as it can present a potential minefield of
   operational, technical, and ethical issues that require consideration
   and negotiation. Nevertheless, with the increased emphasis on the use of
   digital technologies, the timing is right to engage in more in-depth
   discussions about the role of video data in education research. In
   contributing to this discussion, this article unpacks several issues
   connected to the use of video technology as a tool for data collection
   and analysis. This article focuses on addressing some of the barriers
   faced by education researchers such as making sampling decisions,
   maintaining research authenticity, and grappling with ethical issues
   that arise. In terms of the advantages for researchers, this article
   highlights the suitability of video technology for classroom-based
   research because it provides a permanent and detailed record, which can
   be analyzed from multiple perspectives. These issues are explained
   through the experiences of an education researcher, who used video as
   the main data source for documenting and examining the practices of two
   effective primary science teachers in Perth, Western Australia.}},

   generation of droplets}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{4750-4754}},
Abstract = {{Microfluidic chips have been developed to generate droplets and
   microparticles with control over size, shape, and composition not
   possible using conventional methods. However, it has remained a
   challenge to scale-up production for practical applications due to the
   inherently limited throughput of micro-scale devices. To address this
   problem, we have developed a self-contained microchip that integrates
   many (N = 512) micro-scale droplet makers. This 3 x 3 cm(2) PDMS
   microchip consists of a two-dimensional array of 32 x 16 flow-focusing
   droplet makers, a network of flow channels that connect them, and only
   two inputs and one output. The key innovation of this technology is the
   hybrid use of both soft-lithography and direct laser-micromachining. The
   microscale resolution of soft lithography is used to fabricate
   flow-focusing droplet makers that can produce small and precisely
   defined droplets. Deeply engraved (h approximate to 500 mu m)
   laser-machined channels are utilized to supply each of the droplet
   makers with its oil phase, aqueous phase, and access to an output
   channel. The engraved channels' low hydrodynamic resistance ensures that
   each droplet maker is driven with the same flow rates for highly uniform
   droplet formation. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, water
   droplets (d approximate to 80 mu m) were generated in hexadecane on both
   8 x 1 and 32 x 16 geometries.}},

Abstract = {{The chapter presents the experience of the company Innovation in
   Information and Documentation Systems Ltd. (ANOBIUM). It is a nonprofit
   Special Employment Centre focused on the social integration through
   employment of physical, sensory, intellectual, and mentally disabled
   persons. Its activity is based on Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT), offering services such as the digitization, the
   destruction or the custody of documents, the dynamization of website and
   website positioning in search engines, as well as the consulting in both
   fields the documental archives, and the production and the spreading of
   analyses in specific fields as CSR and business policies for work
   integration. The ANOBIUM case shows that ICT can be used as a niche of
   employment in order to develop the activity of Social Enterprises, and
   that ICT incorporates multiple benefits that can be used to achieve the
   social objective pursued by Social Enterprises. Also, ANOBIUM uses ICT
   to increase the impact and the spreading of the activities of other

Abstract = {{Test compression has become a requirement for many designs to meet the
   required test quality levels in reasonable test times and with
   acceptable test cost. This session will cover some of the tradeoffs and
   options available from the broad spectrum of test compression solutions.
   The first talk will address the difficulty when testing large numbers of
   logic blocks and processor cores of maintaining high test quality
   without a requisite increase in test cost stemming from the need to
   allocate substantially more pins for digital test. Simply adding more
   chip-level pins for testing conflicts with packaging constraints and can
   potentially undermine other cost-saving techniques that rely on
   utilizing fewer pins such as multi-site testing. What is needed instead
   is a DFT strategy optimized for complex SOC designs that use multicore
   processors-a strategy in which the architecture and automation elements
   work in tandem to lower test cost without compromising test quality or
   significantly increasing automatic test pattern generation (ATPG)
   runtime. This presentation highlights an optimized DFT architecture,
   referred to as ``shared I/O{''} of DFTMAX, a synthesis-based test
   solution that has been used successfully in multicore processor designs
   as well as complex SOC designs. Using this approach, they were able to
   reduce scan test pins significantly with similar or even less ATPG
   patterns, without compromising test coverage, and achieve over 2X
   reduction in wafer level scan test time. The second talk will present
   many DFT techniques to reduce test time and improve coverage in the
   context of core wrapping. Some of these methods include using external
   scan chains with separate compression logic inside each place-and-route
   block instead of having `chip-top' scan compression logic for all
   external scan chains from different place-and-route. In addition, some
   tradeoffs of using dynamic launch-on-shift/launch-on-capture (LOS/LOC)
   instead of static will be covered. Some other methods will be covered
   for preventing decompressor logic from feeding X'es during
   launch-on-shift test patterns and the benefits of control test-points to
   reduce ATPG vector counts. The final presentation will cover various
   methodologies for reducing the test data volume on different chips. Some
   work to achieve a higher compression ratio in the future will also be
   discussed. As with any good engineering solution, there are some
   constraints and tradeoffs that also need to be considered with those
   choices.}},

Title = {{Simulation and prototyping of FCS for sport aircraft}},
Journal = {{AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{475-486}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The presented paper aims to describe the general idea,
   simulations and prototyping process of an assisting flight control
   system (FCS) for light sport aircraft (LSA). The proposed FCS framework
   is intended to simplify piloting, reduce pilot workload, and improve
   system's reliability and handling qualities of manual flying.
   Design/methodology/approach - Assisting flight control strategy
   integrates mechanical and digital FCS into a synergic platform,
   combining the high reliability of mechanical controls with the
   computation and actuation power introduced through a single line digital
   FCS. Concepts drawn from classical control theory along with flight
   envelope protection algorithms have been used throughout the design of
   the flight control laws. A prototype of the assisting FCS has been
   subjected to validation trials during series of hardware-in-the-loop
   simulations.
   Findings - Despite controversies between the pilots' perception of a
   modern aircraft and limitations imposed by the legacy airworthiness
   codes, it has been shown that a pilot assisting and workload reducing
   control system can be successfully implemented on board of a LSA while
   satisfying the expectations on a state-of-the-art equipment meeting
   required level of safety defined by the current legislation.
   Research limitations/implications - A transition between specific flight
   modes as well as nonlinearities in the FCS may lead to unfavorable and
   unpredictable forms of aircraft-pilot interactions. The number of
   accessible flight control modes should be therefore limited to the most
   significant ones.
   Practical implications - Sport aircraft are mostly flown by a single
   pilot, who could benefit from the pilot assisting FCS as the system has
   the potential to supervise the aircraft's safe operation in various
   flight conditions.
   Originality/value - Introducing an assisting FCS on board of a LSA
   through an innovative approach which utilizes hidden and unused
   resources of modern digital automatic FCSs while respecting the
   limitations imposed through the weight and cost sensitive nature of the
   LSA market.}},

Abstract = {{The fast advance in networked and ubiquitous computing leads to
   remarkable innovation also in data storage technologies. The classical
   local/remote storage dichotomy has been enriched due the introduction of
   new hardware and networking technologies such as plenty of different
   kinds of solid-state storage devices (e.g., USB pen drives) as well as
   several advanced distributed serverless storage facilities such as
   peer-to-peer file sharing networks and cloud-based storage services
   (SaaS). Such sample technologies can be considered as the endpoints of a
   wide range of storage facilities that, although characterized by
   important technological differences, share several crucial security
   issues. Indeed, such kind of storage, (here referred to as
   ``nomadic{''}) could undermine data security and privacy within large
   organizations even if they adopt strong security policies.
   This paper faces the problem of enforcing security policies within a
   security domain whose nodes are not permanently connected each other,
   mainly concerning of the protection of data stored on nomadic data
   stores. The authors survey some solutions available in literature that
   could potentially fit this scenario with the aim of defining a framework
   to secure such storage facilities in terms of file system engineering.
   To this end, two practical scenarios leveraging on nomadic storage
   facilities are discussed: (1) the deployment of USB storage devices to
   asynchronously share sensitive data, and (2) facing assurance
   requirements in managing large projects conducted by cooperating
   independent communities of software developers (such as the so called
   Open Source Community) by means of Distributed Revision Control Systems.}},

Abstract = {{SA Photonics has developed a family of compact Fiber Optic Gyroscopes
   (FOGs) for platform stabilization applications. The use of short fiber
   coils enables the high update rates required for stabilization
   applications but presents challenges to maintain high performance. We
   are able to match the performance of much larger FOGs by utilizing
   several innovative technologies. These technologies include source noise
   reduction to minimize Angular Random Walk (ARW), advanced digital signal
   processing that minimizes bias drift at high update rates, and advanced
   passive thermal packaging that minimizes temperature induced bias drift
   while not significantly affecting size, weight, or power. In addition,
   SA Photonics has developed unique distributed FOG packaging technologies
   allowing the FOG electronics \& photonics to be packaged remotely from
   the sensor head or independent axis heads to minimize size, weight, and
   power at the sensing location(s). The use of these technologies has
   resulted in high performance, including ARW less than 0.001 deg/rt-hr
   and bias drift less than 0.004 deg/hr at an update rate of 10 kHz, and
   total packaged volume less than 30 cu. in. for a 6 degree of freedom
   FOG-based IMU. Specific applications include optical beam stabilization
   for LIDAR and LADAR, beam stabilization for long-range free-space
   optical communication, Optical Inertial Reference Units for HEL
   stabilization, and Ka band antenna pedestal pointing and stabilization.
   The high performance of our FOGs also enables their use in traditional
   navigation and positioning applications. This paper will review the
   technologies enabling our high-performance compact FOGs, and will
   provide performance test results.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Health departments of Iran have attempted to encourage nursing
   staff to incorporate research findings into practice since 2005.
   Consequently, significant changes have occurred in nursing area
   including holding computer skills courses, digital library workshops,
   establishing web sites in hospitals, and developing information
   technology (IT) training in nursing students' curriculum to increase
   accessibility to best practice information and opportunity for nurses
   and students to use research-based information in their clinical
   decision. So a question has raised, what information resources are used
   by nursing staff and students in hospitals? The paper aims to discuss
   these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 412 nurses and students working
   in hospitals connected to web and digital libraries participated. They
   are evaluated with a questionnaire.
   Findings - The results indicated that the students and the nurses
   preferred experiential knowledge to research-based information in their
   clinical decisions and they had little tendency to high-level evidence.
   Results showed that lack of skill in using library was the most
   important deterrent in using research-based information.
   Originality/value - It could be concluded that provision of the
   infrastructures for using research-based information in clinical
   decisions was not sufficient. In addition to infrastructures, the paper
   must invest on organizational, system-wide approaches such as
   organizational culture, information literacy culture, acceptance of
   innovation, role of clinical librarians and advanced nursing
   informatics, and social marketing in evidence-based practice to
   facilitate the use of higher-level evidence in practice.}},

   design combining with the design effects and technical methods. It
   focuses on the novel characteristics of digital printing compared to the
   traditional printing through case studies. It is summarized in three
   aspects: digital re-creation of traditional elements; diversification of
   digital art effects; digital optical illusion and 3D simulation. The
   application examples of digital printing techniques are presented.
   Hopefully this paper can provide some useful references and innovative
   thinking to fashion designers in digital printing design.}},

   Analysis. The empirical results show a strong relationship between
   advocacy and growth, albeit not on inflation rates, suggesting that an

   This is an innately pressing mission for the new government to mitigate
   the impact of the double-digit inflation that has prevailed since the

Abstract = {{The development of innovation through businesses of the ICT sector
   changes, as ever, the way a society functions. Inventions generated in
   the ICT sector are used in other economic sectors, as well as in the
   areas of social life. The phenomenon significantly hampers a thorough
   analysis of the importance of ICT sector in a multi-dimensional
   development of information society (IS). Therefore, capturing the
   category of information society is still a challenge to scientific
   cognizance. One of the characteristics of modern society is the ability
   to use the computer network systems, in particular the Internet, for the
   rapid exchange of information, or making purchases. Today is
   characterized by preparation, competence and ability to use information
   systems to purchase transmission services and remote processing of
   information. These new categories, forms and phenomena also allude to
   scientific cognizance. The answer to this is a constant search for ways
   to capture the categories of information society (IS).
   There is a consensus in the search of rational and yet in-depth analysis
   of the IS development process, in which the leading role in the IS
   development is granted to ICT industry. Thus, it is very often the basis
   for the analysis of the potential and the level of information society
   development. In studies concerning the ICT sector, not only the data on
   production are used, but also other characteristics describing the
   sector, including patent activity which indicates the direction of
   technological development today and in the future. This article raises
   the hypothesis that the convergence of the identified IPC classes, most
   strongly exploited by both, the European Union countries and one of the
   leading global companies of the ICT sector, suggests that the
   development of information society is not only highly correlated with
   the ICT sector, but also significantly depends on an identifiable,
   relatively small number of technological areas. As a result of the
   adopted research procedure, it was found that the leading technologies,
   which constitute the material basis of the IS development are digital
   computing, data processing equipment, arrangements for program control,
   processes or apparatus specially adapted for the manufacture or
   treatment of semiconductor.}},

Abstract = {{Context-awareness is one of the main aspects of pervasive computing
   environments. Recently, some social networking systems have also started
   to exploit context information. These two paradigms serve different
   purposes. Pervasive computing systems have been designed mainly to
   address the needs of individual users, thus neglecting the social nature
   of humans. On the other hand, social computing focuses on exploiting the
   social relations between users, on promoting their interactions and on
   supporting the sharing of digital resources among them. However, the
   recent development and popularity of social networking systems has
   happened in isolation from the developments in pervasive computing. This
   paper elaborates on the role of context in both pervasive and social
   computing environments and introduces the approach of the SOCIETIES
   project that integrates full scale pervasive functionality in social
   networking systems to develop the next generation of social media
   systems. Finally, it discusses the new research challenges that emerge
   in pervasive social media regarding community context-awareness and the
   respective benefits that the end users may experience.}},

Abstract = {{Now, security and authenticity of data is a big challenge. To solve this
   problem, we propose an innovative method to authenticate the digital
   documents. In this paper, we propose a new method, where the marks
   obtained by a candidate will also be encoded in QR Code (TM) in
   encrypted form, so that if an intruder tries to change the marks in the
   mark sheet then he can not do that in the QR Code (TM), because the
   encryption key is unknown to him. In this method, we encrypt the mark
   sheet data using the TTJSA encryption algorithm. The encrypted marks are
   entered inside QR code and that QR code is also printed with the
   original data of the mark sheet. The marks can then be retrieved from
   the QR code and can be decrypted using TTJSA decryption algorithm and
   then it can be verified with marks already there in the mark sheet.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper describes an ongoing mobile library project for the
   National Library of Norway. The purpose is to develop a visual web
   service prototype providing mobile access to the library's growing
   repository of digital data.
   Design/methodology/approach - The author has set up several test
   databases and developed a number of Android applications (apps) for
   testing purposes: image presentation; library's digital exhibition ``in
   the pocket{''}; traditional free text search; location based search;
   barcode scan for ISBN search / QR encapsulation; and voice/spoken
   search.
   Findings - These six approaches were found to be promising using mobile
   technology. Cloud technology has changed the mobile phone from a voice
   transmitter to a multi-purpose device connected to the network. Library
   resources may now be distributed in the cloud, with global mobile
   access, to really achieve a global library network.
   Originality/value - The applications developed here are innovative and
   unique, and will add to the general body of use cases.}},

Abstract = {{SCD has developed a new 1920x1536 / 10 mu m digital Infrared detector
   for the MWIR window named Blackbird. The Blackbird detector features a
   Focal Plane Array (FPA) that incorporates two technological building
   blocks developed over the past few years. The first one is a 10 mu m
   InSb pixel based on the matured planar technology. The second building
   block is an innovative 10 mu m ReadOut Integrated Circuit (ROIC) pixel.
   The InSb and the ROIC arrays are connected using Flip-Chip technology by
   means of indium bumps. The digital ROIC consists a matrix of 1920x1536
   pixels and has an analog to digital (A/D) converter per-channel (total
   of 1920x2 A/Ds). It allows for full frame readout at a high frame rate
   of up to 120 Hz. Such an on-chip A/D conversion eliminates the need for
   several A/D converters with fairly high power consumption at the system
   level. The ROIC power consumption at maximum bandwidth is less than 400
   mW. It features a wide range of pixel-level functionality such as
   several conversion gain options and a 2x2 pixel binning. The ROIC design
   makes use of the advanced and matured CMOS technology, 0.18 mu m, which
   allows for high functionality and relatively low power consumption. The
   FPA is mounted on a Cold-Finger by a specially designed ceramic
   substrate. The whole assembly is housed in a stiffened Dewar that
   withstands harsh environmental conditions while minimizing the
   environment heat load contribution to the heat load of the detector. The
   design enables a 3-megapixel detector with overall low size, weight, and
   power (SWaP) with respect to comparable large format detectors. In this
   work we present in detail the characteristic performance of the new
   Blackbird detector.}},

Abstract = {{The DRS Tamarisk (R)(320) camera, introduced in 2011, is a low cost
   commercial camera based on the 17 mu m pixel pitch 320x240 VOx
   microbolometer technology. A higher resolution 17 mu m pixel pitch
   640x480 Tamarisk (R)(640) has also been developed and is now in
   production serving the commercial markets. Recently, under the DARPA
   sponsored Low Cost Thermal Imager-Manufacturing (LCTI-M) program and
   internal project, DRS is leading a team of industrial experts from
   FiveFocal, RTI International and MEMSCAP to develop a small form factor
   uncooled infrared camera for the military and commercial markets. The
   objective of the DARPA LCTI-M program is to develop a low SWaP camera
   (<3.5 cm(3) in volume and <500 mW in power consumption) that costs less
   than US \$500 based on a 10,000 units per month production rate. To meet
   this challenge, DRS is developing several innovative technologies
   including a small pixel pitch 640x512 VOx uncooled detector, an advanced
   digital ROIC and low power miniature camera electronics. In addition,
   DRS and its partners are developing innovative manufacturing processes
   to reduce production cycle time and costs including wafer scale optic
   and vacuum packaging manufacturing and a 3-dimensional integrated camera
   assembly. This paper provides an overview of the DRS Tamarisk (R)
   project and LCTI-M related uncooled technology development activities.
   Highlights of recent progress and challenges will also be discussed. It
   should be noted that BAE Systems and Raytheon Vision Systems are also
   participants of the DARPA LCTI-M program.}},

   Hochenberger to obtain the privileged position of a military book
   printer in the 1770s, hence at the time when it was difficult for new
   companies to win recognition against the obsolete system of privileges.
   After the first, unsuccessful attempt in 1779-1780, he applied for the
   privilege again with a `filed printing press on a cart', which was
   labelled by both the author and the historian Josef Dobrovsky as
   Hochenberger's `own invention'. The attempt to obtain the privilege is
   analysed on the background of the stiffness of the existing system of
   privileges and on the basis of the thesis of the French book historian
   Frederic Barbier that at the end of the 18th century there was `the
   second book revolution', which however unlike the first (Gutenberg's
   invention) and third (digitisation) was not characterised by technical
   progress but by the spreading and democratisation of printed
   communication. On this background, Hochenberger's attempt is all the
   more remarkable in that field printing presses fulfil the need of
   administering the new `people's armies and communicating with the
   growing number of the soldiers that do not fight as mercenaries for
   money but for their `country' and `nation'.}},

Abstract = {{NACE Test Method TM0172, ``Determining the Corrosive Properties of
   Petroleum Cargoes{''} {[}1] is a simple and valuable test to determine
   whether refilled products, such as motor fuels, are sufficiently dosed
   with inhibitor to prevent corrosion in the event that water enters the
   product stream. This test is based on optical examination of the area of
   the coupon affected by corrosion after a specified exposure to a
   hydrocarbon/water mixture. Letter ``grades{''} from A to E are
   subjectively determined by the technician performing the test.
   Experience has shown that if enough inhibitor is present to produce B+
   or better results as defined in this standard, general corrosion in
   flowing pipelines may be controlled. Grade ``B+{''} or better represents
   a practical absence of corrosion (less than 5\% area).
   For the purposes of confirming a practical absence of corrosion, the
   subjective evaluation by a technician is adequate. However, as this test
   may be applied to less refined, uninhibited products where larger areas
   of corrosion may be observed, the letter grading does not provide
   discrimination within very wide ranges of corrosion affected area
   (20-25\% of coupon area). Pipeline integrity managers interested in the
   relative susceptibility to internal corrosion caused by uninhibited
   hydrocarbons may be interested a higher level of corrosion
   discrimination and precision.
   Enbridge Pipelines proposed a digital image analysis technique in 2009,
   and this technique has been developed, refined, and successfully
   employed by Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (AITF). This paper
   discusses the development of this technique, as well as comparative
   results using both the original letter grading system and the digital
   analysis method. Other observations regarding the application of the
   TM0172 method on a variety of hydrocarbon categories are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In signal processing applications, large energy gains can be obtained by
   accepting some degradation in the output signal quality. Filters are at
   the core of many such systems. In this paper, we demonstrate the
   potential of a new paradigm for achieving favorable quality-energy
   trade-offs in digital filter design that is based on directly accepting
   timing errors in the datapath under aggressively scaled V-DD. In an
   unmodified design, such scaling leads to rapid onset of timing errors
   and, consequently, quality loss. In a modified filter implementation,
   the onset of large errors is delayed, permitting significant energy
   reduction while maintaining high quality. Specifically, the innovations
   in the design include techniques for: 1) run-time adjustment of datapath
   bitwidth, and 2) design-time reordering of filter taps. We tested the
   new design strategy on several audio and image processing applications.
   The designs were synthesized using a 45nm standard cell library. Results
   of SPICE simulations on the entire designs show that up to 70\% energy
   savings can be achieved while maintaining excellent perceived
   signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Compared to a traditional filter design,
   the area overhead of our architecture is about 2\%.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, a consensus within the UK and across Europe has
   emerged: that the considerable wealth of knowledge and expertise in
   universities and colleges can and should be harnessed to make a more
   direct contribution to the economy and society than through graduates
   alone, and that government support should stimulate this. At the same
   time, we have experienced an explosion of new web technologies, an
   increasing amount of business conducted online and a digital world where
   information is king, but where the kingdom is widely accessible, global
   and multifaceted, and the use and context of that information is often
   more significant than the information itself. In this technology-driven
   world, open innovation, crowd-sourcing and open access to research are
   among the key areas of innovation creating new opportunities for
   universities and businesses alike.
   The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) Business and Community
   Engagement (BCE) Programme was designed in 2007 to help UK institutions
   rise to these challenges and opportunities through the effective use of
   technology, by supporting and developing their strategic management of
   relationships with external partners (commercial, public sector
   including charities and trusts, cultural, social and civic
   organisations), and providing resources to enable this.
   This chapter describes the context and development of the JISC Business
   and Community Programme 2007-10 and discusses the key achievements.}},

Abstract = {{E-tourism is essentially the digitalization of the whole touristic
   industry and infrastructure. Some of the advantages of e-tourism are the
   reduction of seasonality, the more successful communication with the
   customers and the raise in reservations and sales in general. The use of
   the Internet has forever changed the structure and the principles of the
   touristic industry. The consumers-tourists are now capable of easily
   choosing their destination, of comparing prices and managing their
   financial exchanges. Information and Communication Technologies and
   Internet, if wisely used, can prove to be highly innovative strategic
   tools in the hands of the tourism entrepreneurs, that would help them
   upgrade the position of their facilities.
   The aim of the research is to study the use of ICT by the Greek
   touristic industry and more precisely by non-coastal touristic units.
   The field of the research is the Municipal district of Loutraki Pellas.
   The research was realized in October 2012 and it was based on structured
   questionnaires that were completed by the means of personal interviews.
   The total of the 16 hotels located in Pozar participated in the
   research. The questionnaires are structured on five units of both open
   and closed-type questions. The conclusions are showing that:
   The touristic businesses in Greece, even in small peripheral places,
   seem to be using Information and Communication Technologies.
   The online reservation system is being used by the most of the units and
   it is expected that they will be double in five years' time. The use of
   e-marketing is on satisfactory levels and the majority of the
   respondents believe that e-marketing is absolutely necessary for the
   well-being of an enterprise.
   It seems that most of the touristic units are not familiar with the
   electronic customer relationship marketing systems (E-CRM). The
   cooperation with electronic travel agencies and the participation in
   social networking sites are useful tools for the efficient communication
   of a touristic unit with a potential costumer. Online reservations have
   contributed to the rise of costumers' arrivals and this fact gives to
   the touristic industry a measured optimism, even though we are in the
   middle of the financial crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Despite rapid changes in the ways in which university courses are being
   delivered, lectures have remained a common feature of many courses. The
   lecture is problematic for many reasons, not the least being that it
   does not encourage interaction. The current project attempted to address
   this problem by implementing `digital ink' into lecture sessions. The
   approach used in this study is innovative because the handwritten
   component of the content was written on top of content created in
   advance and presented in PDF form. The response from students was
   overwhelmingly positive. During the course of the implementation, a
   number of teething problems were encountered; suggestions for overcoming
   these problems and future enhancements are also discussed. Digital ink
   provides a potential avenue for increasing interaction in lecture
   sessions whilst not limiting the capacity for capturing all aspects of
   the session.}},

Abstract = {{Cinema remains current and saleable by constantly revolutionising the
   mode of its distribution. Film Auteurs are affected by these changes,
   using the contemporary ``tools of their trade{''} to their advantage.
   This chapter focuses on two Auteurs' use of digital technologies. Jean
   Luc Godard, one of the most innovative filmmakers of the last fifty
   years is a recent convert to digital film, having denounced the medium
   previously. Mike Figgis has been an advocate of digital filmmaking until
   recently, when he has been more circumspect. These filmmakers employ
   techniques indebted to Sergei Eisenstein and Bertholt Brecht. The
   ``active{''} variant of third text understandings applied represent a
   ``para-formalistic discourse{''} where the audience is made aware of the
   film's artifice, projecting the audience into an ontological virtual
   space where they are compelled to confront conditions around them. A
   tentative advocacy of the digital as an aid to enhancing this experience
   is here advanced.}},

Abstract = {{For several years governments invested significant resources in the
   digital management of democratic processes. Furthermore, e-government
   has moved away from the digitalization of document processes and
   decision-making within the administration towards a new model that
   involves citizens in the co production and sharing of information. These
   processes require management of a large amounts of information, which
   raise questions about the protection of individuals and social control.
   Reputation could be the answer to many problems. People understand that
   the way they behave online will impact their ability to maintain an
   online presence as well as perform all sorts of transactions in the
   future. In the same way, citizens who help their local community would
   being recognized for the role they play in generating different kinds of
   wealth for society. A reliable system of ``civic reputation{''} is
   needed to foster collaboration but also for protecting individuals and
   avoid social control. In the past year, a plethora of reputation systems
   have been launched to serve as the connective tissue of reputation and
   trust across the web. But no one has risen as standard for use in
   e-government process. This uncertainty prompts a number of key
   questions: it is possible to rank trustworthiness in the digital public
   sphere for e-democracy processes? Will a single system of reputation
   work across multiple platforms? And what procedures are in place to
   ensure the accuracy of the reputation, the ability to address mistakes
   and the necessary acknowledgments to reward who is actively involved in
   civic engagement? This paper analyzes innovative practices in the
   evaluation of ``civic reputation{''} to support the participation of
   citizens in a reshaped public sphere, and suggests digital badges and a
   new badging framework as a solution to these problems.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the advancement of e-Government has been used to promote its
   development. However, over the past decade, debate on models and ways to
   understand and monitor this advancement has centered on the use of a
   ``maturity model,{''} that states that governments evolve through a
   sequential set of phases or stages. The effectiveness of these models on
   estimating or describing e-Government advancement has been questioned,
   but more importantly, the information they provide has been of little
   use for policy-makers and public officials, especially for leaders and
   project managers at the institutional level, where e-Government actually
   occurs. Literature also discusses other models that evolved to focus on
   the provision of e-services through government portals but their design
   makes self-evaluation and peer-comparison difficult, if not impossible.
   Other models, have recognized appropriately the complexity of
   implementation at the micro-level, but have failed to propose an
   appraisal method that allows for scaling at a national or regional level
   while still being feasible in terms of time, costs and opportunity. We
   consider that it is possible to use the quality of information as a
   proxy to measure both progress and overall quality of e-Government.
   Because of the nature of how most government services are delivered
   through a two-way information exchange between citizens and one, or
   several, government agencies, the level of the quality of that exchange
   should be a good way to measure the government's ability to provide its
   services electronically. We propose three main components to describe
   the quality of this exchange: the quality of the interaction; the
   content quality and media quality. We borrow from literature on the
   quality of information to build an e-Government index based on
   informational attributes that are constructed using a proposed
   methodology to observe and measure variables directly from site
   interaction. By revising other indices and relevant literature, we have
   defined a set of design criteria for an improved e-Government index. We
   describe the framework and methodology and discuss its strengths and
   weaknesses. We also report the result of six years of research using
   this framework and methodology; the last three years include a
   national-scale trial conducted in Costa Rica, a country that has adopted
   our proposal as its official e-Government index. We discuss these
   results and their theoretical and practical implications for IT use in
   government operations, public administration and the future of
   e-Government assessments. Using the resulting panel data from this
   study, this paper reviews the index and its implementation, validates
   its claims, explores lessons learned and discusses real and potential
   challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Italian e-Government projects since 2000 have been functional to
   implementing at the national level the objectives set out in the Lisbon
   Agenda, eEurope 2002, eEurope 2004, i2010, and the European Digital
   Agenda. The European context has to be gauged to the peculiarities of
   the Italian administrative system. The latter suffers from structural
   weaknesses, scattered and fragmented interventions, poor rationalization
   of public spending, working conditions often undermined by external
   factors, and difficult social situations. So innovation in the Italian
   public sector is not merely the sum of all smart technological factors
   but is rather achieved by integrating organizational processes and
   traditional best practices, which often need to be redesigned in light
   of the possibilities afforded by new tools, and it must also be
   supported by a strong regulatory framework. Several municipalities (such
   as Ravenna) are pursuing the objective of computerizing and automating
   their services with a view to implementing e-Government services, and in
   a scenario where not all the administrative government agencies are at
   the same level of innovation, traditional and paper services need to be
   managed in combination with paperless e-services. This work focuses on
   how online registry office certificatess {[}??], can be issued and
   delivered, how these documents should be presented to other
   administrative government agencies that rely on paper, and how they can
   be made to have legal validity using a digital seal. We will key in on
   five critical questions that came up in the course of implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Public private service networks (PPSN) and complex adaptive systems
   (CAS) have gained a lot of research attention recently. Combining these
   two streams results in conceptualizing organizational networks as
   complex systems. Such complex network consists of many different actors
   that make use of a variety of different technologies. This complex
   network is susceptible to cascades of information, norms, and
   coordinated actions. Nowadays due to the explosion of digital
   connectivity, a significant improvement in communication and information
   technologies is occurred which influence the shape of PPSN. The inherent
   complexity and unpredictability of the information society demands new
   kinds of network coordination that focus on rapid joint responses and
   collective actions instead of centralized predictive planning. In such a
   network private and public organizations have to adapt these
   developments through `nonlinear innovation'. Policy-makers are looking
   for way to direct the development of these networks. Our aim is to
   improve the understanding of PPSN by reviewing the contemporary
   literature in PPSN and complexity systems. Finally we discuss the CAS
   characteristic in PPSN and illustrate that a complex system lens can
   help to conceptualize PPSNs. By modeling PPSN as CAS the effect of
   policy-intervention should be evaluated and the evolution of PPSN should
   be understood.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient and effective delivery of cross-border and cross-sectoral
   e-Government public services is crucially dependent on interoperability,
   provision of which directly contributes to the achievement of the goals
   of the Digital Agenda for Europe in particular and the Europe 2020
   Strategy in general. In this context, main issues, knowledge units, best
   practice, and legal base of interoperability must be done fully
   understandable for all (staff of local, regional, and national public
   administrations, national institutions and agencies, managers of
   e-Government projects, public service developers, policy makers, etc.)
   who are involved in defining, designing, and implementing Europe-wide
   public services. However, at the moment there are no known learning
   courses on interoperability in the EU member countries. The LLP Leonardo
   da Vinci project ``ELGI -e-learning for e-Government{''} addresses this
   issue and aims at the development of an innovative e-learning course for
   acquiring knowledge concerning interoperability. The e-course is
   intended to be useful for three main target groups: decision makers
   responsible for the process of legislating in the field of e-Government,
   public administration staff who are/will be users of public services,
   and contractors or, in other words, organizations involved in
   development and delivery of public services. The current paper presents
   work-in-progress related to the design of the mentioned e-course. It
   covers all main aspects of the design starting from steps that were
   undertaken to create an information base needed for production of the
   e-course content and finishing with the detailed specification of the
   e-course structure. Therefore, the paper specifies the information base
   of the e-course, course aims, target groups, organization of learning
   process, modules, and topics. Moreover, each topic is presented in terms
   of its content and learning outcomes. The e-course will allow target
   groups to acquire all the actual knowledge on interoperability in one
   place.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Libraries have evolved from a digital counterpart of traditional
   libraries to highly dynamic environments conceived to provide a
   community with the data and services needed to accomplish its tasks.
   This trend is particularly frequent in the context of scientific
   research communities, whose members are scattered among multiple
   organizations across the world, with requirements that are very large,
   multidisciplinary, and evolving with innovation. The realization of such
   Research Digital Libraries calls for innovative approaches, capable of
   handling the inherent complexity of such systems while keeping their
   realization and maintenance costs under sustainable thresholds. Digital
   Library Infrastructures have been recently proposed as suitable
   candidates for the realization of Research Digital Libraries. They build
   on service-oriented infrastructure technologies to offer an environment
   where organizations can share and exchange their data and service
   resources to grow in synergy, exploiting an economy of scale approach.
   This chapter describes the peculiar challenges that designers,
   developers, and administrators have to face when realizing Research
   Digital Libraries, and presents the concepts and technologies of Digital
   Library Infrastructure as possible solutions to these issues.}},

Abstract = {{The chapter presents the concept of Enterprise 2.0 in a library
   environment. This concept describes the use of Web 2.0 tools and
   approaches by organizations in order to foster internal functions, e. g.
   communication, collaboration, innovativeness. Various aspects of this
   concept are tackled including implementation of Web 2.0 technologies for
   business purposes in a library. Importance of intrapreneurship for
   implementation of Enterprise 2.0 is suggested. Short theoretical reviews
   on both intrapreneusrhip and Enterprise 2.0 are followed by some general
   conclusions on the relationship between these two concepts based on the
   research results gathered in libraries in Serbia. Results from the
   ongoing European study on awareness and implementation of Enterprise 2.0
   are also presented. The chapter is a valuable companion for anyone
   interested in the practical aspects of Enterprise 2.0 implementation in
   a library and presents an addition to librarianship theory by
   introducing a new idea on the relation between Enterprise 2.0
   implementation and intrapreneurship.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, technological innovation has led to new pedagogic
   sites, such as online discussion forums and virtual 3D worlds. In these
   sites students and teachers use language and other meaning-making
   resources to engage in educational argumentation. However, there have
   been few studies which have systematically explored the role of
   lexicogrammatical and other semiotic resources in the making of meaning
   in these contexts. This is because the main body of research
   underpinning claims around the affordances and limits of online
   argumentation is located within sociocognitive paradigms. By drawing on
   the tools of systemic functional linguistics and, where relevant,
   systemic functional-multimodal analysis, this article therefore offers a
   fresh perspective. I show how such tools can illuminate both the
   overarching textual shape and structure of online discussion forums and
   the ways in which meanings are made through language and other semiotic
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{For a regular Digital Peak Respiratory Flow Metter, a strain gauge or
   similar probe is used to detect the strength of the blowing. The signal
   is then be analyzed by computer. In this innovative Self-Power Peek
   Respiratory Flow Meter, however, a generator is used. The generator is
   ``one stone for two birds{''}: it serves as the digital signal generator
   to present the air flow data; it also provides the energy source to
   re-power the batteries. This allows people to use the equipment whenever
   and anywhere without worry of recharge or change batteries. Another
   advantage of the machine is its reliability. The blowing chamber is
   separated from the generator by magnetic (shaft-less) coupling,
   therefore, the moisture from blowing has no way to corrode the electric
   circuit or contaminate the instrument. Because of this innovative
   instrument is ``Green{''}, ``Digital{''} and easy of use, the
   application would be expanded. The Coreless Permanent Magnet Disk
   Generator technology (AFPM) is utilized to eliminate the cogging torque.
   Moreover, energy saving circuit design also implemented to make the
   self-power instrument a reality.}},

Abstract = {{The construction industry is facing an increasing pressure to optimize
   its performance reducing costs and minimizing its impact on the
   environment. The built environment is a very demanding human and dynamic
   environment facing rising challenges to develop more innovative and
   efficient solutions. New technologies, growing client expectations and a
   shift in design thinking are motivating radical improvements in the
   construction sector towards more integrated systems through
   computational fabrication processes.
   A RapidConstruction System was developed based on extrusion-based
   technologies to enable the construction of eco-efficient buildings with
   complex forms and geometries. The optimization of this new system will
   enable to integrate the concept of material space, material composition
   information of building heterogeneous components with geometry
   information, assigning different spatial features according to
   requirements. This new 3D digital processing system was used to
   fabricate functional graded structural components with different
   material compositions, so its functional requirements can vary with
   location. The development of this multi-material deposition system is
   ongoing to enable the fabrication of more efficient structures regarding
   thermal, acoustic and structural conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Underutilized crops do not benefit from the same research effort as
   major crops even if they are locally essential for food security.
   Knowledge and resources developed on major crops could be transferred to
   the lesser studied ones in order to analyze and exploit the genetic and
   agronomical potential of these crops.
   Fonio, so-called by farmers and consumers, includes Digitaria exilis
   Stapf. and D. iburua Stapf. as well as wild related species (D. ternata
   and D. longiflora) and Brachiaria or Panicum genera. It is an indigenous
   staple crop in western Africa regarded as a valuable source of income,
   especially for small scale farmers. Recent progress in post-harvest
   technologies, which has long hampered the development of fonio
   cultivation, has increased its economic potential. The need to
   characterize its genetic resources and adaptive potential to the
   changing climate, and more generally, fast evolving environmental
   pressures, is therefore more important.
   We shall discuss how the study, conservation and uses of fonio genetic
   resources can take advantage of methodological advances in other plant
   genetic research. Several issues are addressed, which are not only
   related to biotechnologies but also to the combination of biological and
   social science approaches. The genetic structure of crop on-farm
   diversity results from the interplay between numerous factors, including
   historical, social, cultural, economic, biological and environmental
   factors. Molecular resources can now be developed rapidly. Combined with
   innovative and multidisciplinary approaches, this will lead to an
   accurate estimation of fonio evolutionary history (including
   domestication), as well as an evaluation of the genetic resources and
   their dynamics.
   These approaches will allow a better understanding of on-farm diversity
   of fonio, the development of sound collecting and ex situ conservation
   strategies and appropriate crop improvement to ensure food security.}},

Abstract = {{Digital museums are replacing traditional museums to inspire individual
   growth and promote culture exchange and society enrichment. However, the
   benefits of using the traditional museum to inspire visitors and promote
   the local economy may be compromised in the digital museum. This study
   attempts to offer insights on digital museum adoption from user and
   system perspectives. We extended the technology acceptance model (TAM)
   by incorporating computer self-efficacy and personal innovativeness as
   individual variables and media richness as a system characteristic. We
   launched a full-scale study with 441 users of 3 weather museums in
   Taiwan. We had 327 valid responses, a 74\% response rate, from our
   target population. We conducted a regression analysis to investigate the
   potential influence of independent variables on the adoption of digital
   museums. Our results showed that both user and system characteristics
   have a positive influence on perceived usefulness (PU). A proper
   consideration of these three constructs can increase a user's PU and
   perceived ease of use (PEOU), thereby establishing a more positive
   attitude regarding the use of digital museums. Academic and practical
   implications concerning their adoption from user and system perspectives
   were drawn from these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Jet Propulsion Laboratory has developed an innovative Grayscale Optical
   Correlator (GOC) architecture using a pair of Digital Light Processor
   Spatial Light Modulator (DLP SLM) as the input and filter devices and a
   CMOS sensor for correlation output detection {[}1-5]. In order to
   achieve ultra high-speed Automatic Target Recognition (ATR), we have
   developed custom Electronic Interfaces to maximize the system data
   throughput rate for both the DLP and CMOS. The high-performance
   Electronic Interface System (EIS) is capable of achieving sustained 1000
   frames per second (fps) at 1920x1024 data frame size. In this paper, we
   will first overview the new GOC architecture. We will the depict the
   detailed design of the EIS for the DLP SLM and CMOS. The innovation of
   JPL's high-performance digital/optical ATR system is in its
   implementation of a high-speed, high-resolution DLP display, and a
   high-speed CMOS camera sensor with an advanced I/O interface and
   high-speed parallel on-board processing capability.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents an innovative methodology for the 3D surveying and
   modeling of floating and semi-submerged objects. Photogrammetry is used
   for surveying both the underwater and emerged parts of the object and
   the two surveys are combined together by means of special rigid
   orientation devices. The proposed methodology is firstly applied to a
   small pleasure boats (approximately 6 meters long) - hence a free
   floating case - and then to a large shipwreck (almost 300 meters long)
   interested by a 52 m long leak at the waterline. The article covers the
   entire workflow, starting from the camera calibration and data
   acquisition down to the assessment of the achieved accuracy, the
   realization of the digital 3D model by means of dense image matching
   procedures as well as deformation analyses and comparison with the craft

Abstract = {{Time Correlated Single Photon counting (TCSPC) with picosecond timing is
   a key method in many areas of applied physics. One of the most important
   areas is that of fluorescence lifetime measurement in biophysics and the
   life sciences. Precisely timed photon counting for the purpose of
   coincidence correlation is now also emerging as the most common approach
   to quantum state interpretation in experimental quantum optics.
   Therefore, time-correlated single photon counting electronics,
   traditionally mostly used in time-resolved fluorescence research are
   facing new challenges in different emerging areas. Consequently such
   instruments are undergoing a fresh cycle of innovation, some of which we
   try to highlight here. The new picosecond TCSPC system we present
   provides several interesting new features resulting from a high speed
   monolithic integration in one of the fastest semiconductor technologies
   available today.
   The result is a high timing resolution by direct digital conversion and
   a very short deadtime. Apart from conventional histogramming over a very
   long time span, we can implement continouos single photon recording
   modes hat allow picosecond timing of all photon events with respect both
   to a sync signal as well as on a virtually infinite time scale. Multiple
   timing channels can also be operated indpendently and in parallel, e. g.
   for picosecond correlation analysis between signals from multiple photon
   detectors.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore whether librarians are
   familiar with technological innovations and are ready to accept them.
   The objectives are: to what extent does the Technology Acceptance Model
   (TAM) explain librarians' perceptions of mobile services (m-services);
   and to what extent do differences in gender, age, workplace, role, and
   smart phone use explain librarians' perceptions of m-services?
   Design/methodology/approach - The research was conducted in Israel
   during the first semester of the 2012 academic year. It encompassed
   three groups of Israeli librarians: academic, public, and special.
   Researchers used two questionnaires to gather data: a personal details
   questionnaire, and a mobile technology questionnaire.
   Findings - This study supported the two core variables model (perceived
   ease of use and usefulness) of TAM that may predict librarians'
   behavioral intention to use m-services in the library. However, it added
   two more components to the model: personal innovativeness and smart
   phone usage.
   Practical implications - Library directors may try to implement more
   m-services on their web sites. These services should be simple,
   attractive, and efficient. They should also try to expose librarians to
   the benefits and ease of use of m-services.
   Originality/value - The findings emphasize the importance of the TAM
   that may predict librarians' behavioral intention to use m-services in
   the library and may lead to further research in this field.}},

   foundry (low-cost, high-quality, high-efficiency) industry, no longer is
   an advantage. The other hand, the industry has also been realized to
   cartoons of the United States and Japan and therefore positive efforts

   Secondly, the computer animation at this stage of the development of
   animation industry in Taiwan is the weakest that is, the ability of the
   financial, legal, and international marketing. Due to the creation of
   the marketing practices of the finished product is difficult to both

Abstract = {{Advancements in medical image visualization in recent years have enabled
   three-dimensional (3D) medical images to be volume-rendered from
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans.
   Medical data is crucial for patient diagnosis and medical education, and
   analyzing these three-dimensional models rather than two-dimensional
   (2D) slices would enable more efficient analysis by surgeons and
   physicians, especially non-radiologists. An interaction device that is
   intuitive, robust, and easily learned is necessary to integrate 3D
   modeling software into the medical community. The keyboard and mouse
   configuration does not readily manipulate 3D models because these
   traditional interface devices function within two degrees of freedom,
   not the six degrees of freedom presented in three dimensions. Using a
   familiar, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) device for interaction would
   minimize training time and enable maximum usability with 3D medical
   images. Multiple techniques are available to manipulate 3D medical
   images and provide doctors more innovative ways of visualizing patient
   data. One such example is windowing. Windowing is used to adjust the
   viewed tissue density of digital medical data. A software platform
   available at the Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC), named Isis,
   was used to visualize and interact with the 3D representations of
   medical data. In this paper, we present the methodology and results of a
   user study that examined the usability of windowing 3D medical imaging
   using a Kinect (TM) device compared to a traditional mouse.}},

Abstract = {{In 1973 The Center for Art Conservation Studies (CASS) was established
   at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). This was in response
   to demonstrations that were conducted during January-March 1972 in
   Venice for UNESCO, Venice in Peril, International Fund for Monuments,
   and the Italian Petroleum Institute (ENI). The feasibility investigation
   explored in-situ pulsed holography, holographic interferometry, and
   laser ablation divestment for applications in art conservation practice.
   During subsequent decades scores of UCSD graduate and undergraduate
   students as well as conservators, conservation scientists, academics,
   and engineers who resided in CASS as ``Visiting Scholars{''} contributed
   to advancing the understanding and performance of radiation technologies
   in the arts. Several technologies in addition to those involving optical
   wavelengths were also investigated to aid in art conservation and
   conservation science. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Nuclear
   Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were employed to detect and map moisture within
   masonry. Lead isotopic analyses revealed authenticity and provenance of
   Benin bronzes. Inside-out x-ray radiography facilitated the detection of
   defects in stone. Ultrasonic imaging was introduced for the mapping of
   fresco strata. Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (PAS) was used to characterize
   varnish layers on paintings. Digital image processing was introduced in
   order to detect and visualize pentimenti within paintings as well as to
   perform virtual restoration and provide interactive museum displays.
   Holographic images were employed as imaginary theater sets. In the years
   that followed the graduation of students and the visits of professional
   collaborators, numerous other applications of radiation ablation began
   appearing in a wide variety of other fields such as aircraft
   maintenance, ship maintenance, toxic chemical remediation, biological
   sterilization, food processing, industrial fabrication, industrial
   maintenance, nuclear decontamination, dermatology, nuclear weapons
   effects simulation, and graffiti control. It was readily apparent that
   the customary diffusion of advanced technologies from science and
   industry into the art conservation field had been reversed. In this
   paper we trace the migration and adaptation of radiation divestment
   developments in art conservation to numerous applications in science,
   industry, and consumer products. Examples described include the
   robotized hybrid ``Flashjet{''} aircraft paint stripping system, the
   ``Novotronic{''} anthrax remediation installation in the Pentagon
   Building, the InTa automated graffiti removal system employing a carbon
   dioxide TEA laser, the Bellalite body hair removal product incorporating
   flashlamp technology, and the Foodco line of optical radiation products
   for the sterilization of food products. The Foodco products are also
   applied to the sterilization and/ or pasteurization of beverages and
   beverage containers. A similar device has been adapted to seafood
   irradiation in order to increase shelf life, as well as for the ablative
   removal of skin and scales. The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, to
   etch logos and identification information into the sidewalls of
   pneumatic tires, also developed a flashlamp-based ablation technology.
   The founders of the CYMER Corporation applied UV irradiation technology
   to the manufacture of high-performance integrated circuits (viz., memory
   chips, etc.) In several instances former CASS students and Visiting
   Fellows consciously adapted the above-learned art conservation
   methodologies to still other purposes.
   Thus, these examples of technology transfer may be termed: ``Art in the
   service of Science.{''} Alternatively, it is evident that many
   associated innovations developed from independent activities,
   unconnected serendipity, or through the normal diffusion of information
   and knowledge across disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{Photonic technologies play a leading innovative role of research in the
   fields of Cultural Heritage (CH) conservation, preservation and
   digitisation. In particular photonic technologies have introduced a new
   indispensable era of research in the conservation of cultural artefacts
   expanding from decorative objects, paintings, sculptures, monuments to
   archaeological sites and including fields of application as diverse as
   materials characterisation to restoration practices and from defect
   topography to 3d artwork reconstruction. Thus the last two decades
   photonic technologies have emerged as unique answer or most competitive
   alternative into many long-term standing disputes in conservation and
   restoration of Cultural Heritage. Despite the impressive advances on the
   state-of-the-art ranging from custom-made system development to new
   methods and practises, photonic research and technological developments
   remain incoherently scattered and fragmented with a significant amount
   of duplication of work and misuse of resources. In this context, further
   progress should aim to capitalise on the so far achieved milestones in
   any of the diverse applications flourished in the field of CH. Embedding
   of experimental facilities and conclusions seems the only way to secure
   the progress beyond the existing state of the art and its false use.
   The solution to this embedment seems possible through the new computing
   environments. Cloud computing environment and remote laboratory access
   hold the missing research objective to bring the leading research
   together and integrate the achievements. The cloud environment would
   allow experts from museums, galleries, historical sites, art historians,
   conservators, scientists and technologists, conservation and technical
   laboratories and SMEs to interact their research, communicate their
   achievements and share data and resources. The main instrument of this
   integration is the creation of a common research platform termed here
   Virtual Laboratory allowing not only remote research, inspection and
   evaluation, but also providing the results to the members and the public
   with instant and simultaneous access to necessary information, knowledge
   and technologies.
   In this paper it is presented the concept and first results confirming
   the potential of implementing metrology techniques as remote digital
   laboratory facilities in artwork structural assessment. The method paves
   the way of the general objective to introduce remote photonic
   technologies in the sensitive field of Cultural Heritage.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite Low Noise Block-down convertors (LNBs) have been evaluated for
   use in amplitude and intensity interferometry. LNBs have been found to
   have a high performance to cost ratio which is beneficial for any sensor
   system. They are investigated here for a diversity of applications from
   the derisking of subsystems for next generation aperture synthesis
   imagers having hundreds of channels ({[}1]) to a platform for the
   investigation of phase recovery in intensity interferometry and
   experimentation in entangled photons. Measured noise temperatures of
   LNBs were found to lie between 170 K and 300 K which is higher than
   typical manufacturers' specifications. A twin channel interferometer
   system was developed using satellite receiver feeds and LNBs at the
   front-end, other amplifiers, mixers, filters and local oscillators at
   intermediate stages, and 8-bit USB ADCs sampling synchronously at 100
   MHz and a PC for data processing. LabVIEW was used to digitally
   demodulate the sampled data and process it into the first and second
   orders of coherence. Measurements of the first order of coherence from a
   standard low energy discharge lamp indicated interference fringes were
   commensurate with range and spacing of the two receivers and the source.
   The relationship between the measured first and second order of
   coherence agrees within the experimental error. Variations of the first
   and second orders of coherence with range, R, follow the relationship
   1/R and 1/R-2. The system has the potential for investigations into
   phase extraction for intensity interferometry and for the study of
   digital demodulation schemes for aperture synthesis amplitude
   interferometry with hundreds of receiver channels for next generation
   security screening systems. A twin, triple or quadruple channel
   polarimetric LNB interferometer could be used as basis for high
   precision investigations in to entangled photons and quantum
   communications.}},

Abstract = {{Support material is often utilised in additive manufacture to enable
   geometries that are not otherwise self-supporting. Despite the
   associated opportunities for innovation, the use of support material
   also introduces a series of limitations: additional material cost, cost
   of removal of support material, potential contamination of biocompatible
   materials, and entrapment of support material within cellular
   structures. This work presents a strategy for minimising the use of
   support material by comparing the geometric limits of an additive
   manufacture process to the build angles that exist within a proposed
   geometry. This method generates a feasibility map of the feasible build
   orientations for a proposed geometry with a given process. The method is
   applied to polyhedra that are suitable for close packing to identify
   space-filling tessellated structures that can be self-supporting. The
   integrity of an FDM process is quantified, and using the associated
   feasibility map, self-supporting polyhedra are manufactured. These
   polyhedra are integrated with non-trivial geometries to achieve a
   reduction in consumed material of approximately 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective when designing an innovative medical device (MD)
   is to improve the patient's condition and autonomy. Normally, therefore,
   there must be a strong focus on continuous interaction with the human
   element. Despite this interaction, value analysis (VA) tools are in fact
   used very little at the design stage.
   We describe the procedure we have devised and the characterization
   studies that result when applying VA to the design of a radically
   innovative temporomandibular joint (TMJ) prosthesis.
   From needs analysis to general availability of the device, there are
   three main phases in developing an MD: design, clinical validation and
   production/marketing. In the design phase, functional and technical
   specifications are defined from which digital and/or physical prototypes
   are created.
   Our multidisciplinary team defined and prioritized service functions
   after first analyzing clinical need. Next it specified the performances
   of a healthy TMJ which had to be reproduced, and then devised the
   experimental methods to achieve this characterization.
   A finite element (FE) model of the jaw was created and validated. Using
   simulations, the FE model compared strains and displacements in the
   healthy and the implanted mandibles. We then considered the influence of
   the implant geometry, the connections between implant and bone tissue to
   guide our decisions when creating innovative technical solutions. A new
   patent is currently under analysis and registration. (c) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Wireless technology has completely transformed the way we live, but
   health care is yet to enter the digital age at least at remote areas. By
   harnessing innovation in the wireless space along with cloud computing
   and pervasive technologies such as ubiquitous sensing and data analytics
   we can fundamentally shift the paradigm in health care delivery and
   dramatically improve the health care services at rural areas.
   Ultimately, we have the opportunity to create a new
   ``infrastructure-independence{''} model of health care, which translates
   into the right care, at the right time, wherever people need it. Also
   putting cloud computing with it makes the health data to be monitored at
   any comfortable places or devices. Wireless health encompasses
   end-to-end solutions that facilitate continuous access to health care
   information, expert advice, or therapeutic intervention enabled by
   remote sensing, ubiquitous telecommunications networks, and smart
   systems and platforms.}},

Abstract = {{A crucial component of the nation's K-economy envisions the availability
   of digital content exchange or content infrastructure. The idea of
   providing and presenting information via electronic means and formats
   truly fascinates managers of information agencies worldwide. This
   phenomenon obviously affects the thinking and perception of the managers
   and administrators of libraries, museums, archives and galleries.
   Presently, cultural institutions are actively connecting their
   collections to these emerging knowledge networks. They are creating
   innovative network services based on the digital surrogates of their
   current collections in a rich, interactive digital environment. A recent
   study has been made on the digitisation of cultural heritage resources
   in cultural institutions in Malaysia, namely the National Library,
   National Archives, National Museum and the National Art Gallery. The
   four institutions are currently very active in building their digital
   content and exploring initiatives to deliver the information, however
   the extent of sustainability of those resources in unknown. The aim of
   this paper is investigates the digital preservation strategies that are
   adopted by Malaysian cultural institutions. A multiple case studies
   approach is used to examine the potential risks to digital cultural
   resources in four (4) selected Malaysian cultural institutions. Data is
   collected through structured interviews with information professionals
   who are involved in digitisation works in the selected cultural
   institutions. Findings reveal that digital cultural heritage resources
   in Malaysia is at risk in terms of digitisation policies, selection
   criteria, cost, staffing, technology, storage, metadata management and
   copyright. This study is very significant to professionals who are
   involved in archiving the digital cultural heritage as it can be a guide
   for managing risks in preserving valuable digital resources. The result
   of this study can be a practical tool for managing risks not only for
   digital cultural heritage but also to all documents in digital format.
   It also provides an insight to other researchers to seriously
   investigate other risks of digital cultural resources besides the risks
   that have been identified in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Using engaging and entertaining teaching tools inside the classroom has
   become imperative in order to ensure, amongst others, engagement for the
   scholars of today. These scholars are familiar with a vast array of
   digital technologies and are able to engage with multiple sources of
   information at the same time. Traditional teaching methods are not
   enough to keep these scholars engaged and as such, traditional teaching
   methods must be supplemented by engaging learning methodologies and
   interactive learning tools. Many of these learning tools have their
   origins in Web 2.0 and have enjoyed wide-spread adoption in the
   education arena because of their potential as contemporary education
   technologies. These technologies are not restricted to enriching course
   content alone and can also stimulate and encourage engagement of
   students in the classroom. For this research project, the use of YouTube
   (c) is described to encourage student engagement and how this innovative
   teaching tool can enhance students' engagement with the subject-matter.
   The research findings will be supported with outcomes from student
   questionnaires. The main inspiration for this paper is the research and
   analysis of an innovative method of teaching, being the use of YouTube
   for student engagement in the classroom, which has been applied for the
   first time Department of Information Systems at the University of Cape
   Town for the INF 2004F course. This will have practical implications for
   higher education institutions on a global scale as it will assist in the
   decision making process as to whether to adopt YouTube.}},

Abstract = {{CTI is an accredited private higher education institution (university)
   with the Higher Education Council (HEC) in South Africa. Its head office
   is in Fourways, Johannesburg. CTI has 12 campuses nationwide and offers
   higher certificates and degrees in business and information technology.
   The BCom and BSc degrees were rolled out to all 12 campuses from January
   2013. All first year students received 10 `' Samsung tablets with their
   textbooks and course materials in digital format. We've worked closely
   with all role-players to ensure that all pillars for successful
   implementation of the e-book tablet project are in place. Timeous
   completion and conversion of course materials and e-textbooks for the
   start of the academic year in 2013 took extra time and focus of a
   dedicated project manager and multi-disciplinary team members. Several
   aspects were focused on during the conceptual, preparation and planning
   phases in 2012 (phase 1). This phase included aspects such as the
   student pilot project to establish the most suitable tablet to procure
   for students and lecturers, upgrading of infrastructure on campuses,
   student and lecturer training and supported materials, guidelines and
   rules for user standards. Phase 2 started in January 2013 with the
   implementation of a design research project which includes several
   planned interventions to ensure continuous development and support of
   lecturers and students with the focus on enhancing the academic
   experience of students. This phase will implement qualitative and
   quantitative methodologies which will include sharing of experiences
   using different digital media, tools and instruments to gather data from
   lecturers, students and other role-players. Data will be analysed and
   compared with different theoretical frameworks for using integrating
   innovative technologies in learning environments, such as Rogers (1995),
   Russell (1996) and Gladhart (2001). Changes in teaching and learning
   practices will be discussed by way of using the technology integration
   matrix and other measurements to determine the development and movement
   of teaching and learning practices towards emerging pedagogies for the
   information age. More detail of research methodologies, actions and
   interventions as well as data gathering methods during project will be
   focused and shared.}},

   (relative advantage and compatibility) constructs, drawn diffusion of
   innovation theory, to the adoption rate of socially orientated
   instructional technologies, in an Open Distance Learning (ODL)
   institution. The study is based on a purposive sample of 241 students
   who are registered for a second-year course at Unisa. A predictive
   analysis confirms that a socially orientated instruction strategy has a
   more predictive influence on the adoption rate of socially orientated
   instructional technology, than compatibility and relative advantage.
   Results indicate that the instructional designer should focus more on
   incorporating socially orientated pedagogic principles when designing a
   learning experience, in order to influence students' usage of socially
   orientated instructional technology in an ODL environment.}},

Abstract = {{JiFUNzeni blended learning approach is a sustainable approach to
   provision of professional development (PD) for those in challenging
   educational contexts. JiFUNzeni approach emphasizes training regional
   experts to create blended learning content, working with appropriate
   technology while building content repositories. JiFUNzeni approach was
   field tested though a design-based research intervention conducted in
   rural western Kenya. The field test included design, development and
   implementation of a blended learning course for teachers' professional
   development utilizing appropriate technologies including tablets powered
   by solar energy, open educational resources and open source software.
   One year after the intervention, there were follow-up interviews
   conducted with eight of the ten teachers and two PDTs who participated
   in the research. The findings from the follow-up interviews shared in
   this paper revealed that: teachers still used cooperative learning and
   activity-based learning strategies in their teaching. The PDTs on the
   other hand designed, developed and implemented one other jiFUNzeni
   blended learning course for twelve teachers in one school in Korogocho
   in Nairobi city. Implementation by PDTs of jiFUNzeni approach confirmed
   that they had learned through a sustainable way of delivering
   professional development in challenging educational contexts. The PDTs
   utilized the instructional design approaches learned through their
   participation in the research in designing blended learning content,
   while they also innovated new ways of developing self-study content as
   an important creative addition to what they had previously learned. Two
   teenage children participated in digital content development by advising
   the PDTs on more efficient ways of applying technology attesting to the
   fact that digital natives are important reciprocal supporters to digital
   immigrants and vice versa.}},

Abstract = {{Higher education institutions (HEIs) are striving to provide effective
   learning experiences to address the needs of a digital generation of
   learners. Blended learning has emerged as a solution to address these
   needs and has been adopted by various HEIs. However, not all academic
   staff members adopt blended learning when it is introduced by their
   institutions. Although the blended teaching and learning approach offers
   various advantages to academic staff, negative perceptions held by
   academic staff may affect its adoption. The purpose of this case study
   was to investigate the perceptions of and identify challenged facing
   academic staff that affected the adoption of blended learning in a
   faculty of education at a developing university in Southern Africa. The
   study employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Innovation
   Diffusion Theory (IDT) in a qualitative exploratory research design. The
   investigation made use of focus group interviews with lecturers in a
   faculty of education and individual interviews with heads of academic
   departments, as well as the dean of the faculty. Data gathered pointed
   to a variety of perceptions hindering academic staff from adopting
   blended learning. Amongst these were perceptions pertaining to
   e-learning or blended learning policy, faculty support by management,
   computer skills of students and lecturers, as well as inadequate access
   to computers by students. These seemed to be challenges that the Faculty
   of Education has to deal with and overcome before academic staff can
   successfully adopt blended learning. It was not the aim of this study to
   generalise the findings. In fact, the research was unique in that it
   applied known knowledge to the new context of a small Southern African
   university, which is a developing community. It is hoped, however, that
   lessons learned will make a contribution to the field of higher
   education and that developing universities will benefit from the
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of fostering graduate skills in creativity and innovation
   is acknowledged by higher education institutions (HEIs) and employers.
   However, the lack of practical guidelines and a scaffold to guide
   educators in the design and redevelopment of their courses is a
   significant impediment to the goal of embedding creativity within the
   curriculum. This paper reports on the findings from a project funded
   through the Office for Learning and Teaching, Higher Education Division,
   Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research
   and Tertiary Education in Australia, which aimed to address these
   challenges by developing a framework and supporting online tool to
   scaffold educators and students through a creative problem solving
   approach. Following a design-based research (DBR) methodology, the study
   employed a mixed-methods approach involving multiple iterations to
   design, develop, trial and implement a creative problem solving (CPS)
   framework and tool, which has been trialled in ten courses across
   different disciplines and HEIs across Australia. The outcomes from these
   trials have informed the development of principles and practical
   guidelines for application in the classroom in a range of contexts, both
   nationally and internationally. The findings reported in this paper
   focus on the DBR process and the experience of trials of the CPS tool in
   one of the ten courses included in the study; a first-year undergraduate
   course offered in the School of Communication, International Studies and
   Languages at the University of South Australia. Educator and student
   evaluations conducted at the conclusion of each offering of the course
   show the benefits of the CPS approach, with educators stating that
   students who use the CPS tool demonstrate much greater creativity and
   divergence in the approaches they adopt in their digital media research
   assignments, and many students reporting greater confidence in their
   ability to generate ideas for their research and to come up with
   alternative and sophisticated solutions to creative problems. The
   evaluations also identified several usability issues, which were
   addressed through the multiple iterations and trials that informed each
   stage of the redesign of the tool. The final section of this paper
   discusses the implications of the findings from this project and the
   benefits of design-based research as a methodology informing the design,
   development and implementation of technology enhanced learning
   innovations.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray mammography is the current gold standard for breast cancer
   screening. Microcalcifications and other features which are helpful to
   the radiologist for early diagnostics are often buried in the noise
   generated by the surrounding dense tissue. So image processing
   techniques are required to enhance these important features to improve
   the sensitivity of detection. An innovative technique is demonstrated
   for recording a hologram of the mammogram. It is recorded on a thin
   polymer film of Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) as photo induced isomerization
   grating containing the interference pattern between the object beam
   containing the Fourier spatial frequency components of the mammogram and
   a reference beam. The hologram contains all the enhanced features of the
   mammogram. A significant innovation of the technique is that the
   enhanced components in the processed image can be viewed by the
   radiologist in time scale. A technician can record the movie and when
   the radiologist looks at the movie at his convenience, freezing the
   frame as and when desired, he would see the microcalcifications as the
   brightest and last long in time. He would also observe lesions with
   intensity decreasing as their size increases. The same bR film can be
   used repeatedly for recording holograms with different mammograms. The
   technique is versatile and a different frequency band can be chosen to
   be optimized by changing the reference beam intensity. The experimental
   arrangement can be used for mammograms in screen film or digital format.}},

Abstract = {{The field of medicine has integrated with law and regulation in the form
   of forensic medicine. While the field of medicine, as a whole, is
   leaping forward by integrating computer solutions, Forensic
   Medicine-particularly in developing regions such as Sri Lanka-is lacking
   innovative computer integrations. The process of forensic facial
   reconstruction in particular, is still at its infancy in Sri Lanka, and
   is yet to utilize the advanced technologies of other countries. Hence
   introducing a more efficient multimedia based technique to the local
   forensic officials in order to improve the efficiency and the accuracy
   of the reconstructions is the aim of this study. In contrast to the
   facial reconstructions conducted in other countries, this study
   introduces a novel semi-automated method of computer aided digital
   sculpting to the field of forensic medicine. The adopted process
   involved, acquiring a 3D model of the skull and digitally sculpting
   muscles in a 3D environment, followed by adding different facial
   features to improve identification. The research also encompassed a
   tissue thickness analysis and a facial component analysis, both of which
   were conducted for the first time on Sri Lankans since both were needed
   to improve the accuracy of the final output. This procedure was
   attempted on cases of the age category 20-30 and of medium weight. The
   outputs and the process were evaluated with different parties such as
   general public, forensic officials, lawyers and CID all of which yielded
   true positive results. The ultimate goal of conducting the study was to
   understand and overcome the challenges faced in developing this novel
   application for the Sri Lankan Forensic officials and to establish the
   first unit for facial reconstruction in Sri Lanka.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the main infrastructure for implicating mobile
   learning in medicine and present a sample mobile learning application
   for medical learning within the framework of mobile learning systems.
   Mobile technology is developing nowadays. In this case it will be useful
   to develop different learning environments using these innovations in
   internet based distance education. M-learning makes the most of being on
   location, providing immediate access, being connected, and acknowledges
   learning that occurs beyond formal learning settings, in places such as
   the workplace, home, and outdoors. Central to m-learning is the
   principle that it is the learner who is mobile rather than the device
   used to deliver m learning. The integration of mobile technologies into
   training has made learning more accessible and portable. Mobile
   technologies make it possible for a learner to have access to a computer
   and subsequently learning material and activities; at any time and in
   any place. Mobile devices can include: mobile phone, personal digital
   assistants (PDAs), personal digital media players (eg iPods, MP3
   players), portable digital media players, portable digital multimedia
   players.
   Mobile learning (m-learning) is particularly important in medical
   education, and the major users of mobile devices are in the field of
   medicine. The contexts and environment in which learning occurs
   necessitates m-learning. Medical students are placed in
   hospital/clinical settings very early in training and require access to
   course information and to record and reflect on their experiences while
   on the move.
   As a result of this paper, this paper strives to compare and contrast
   mobile learning with normal learning in medicine from various
   perspectives and give insights and advises into the essential
   characteristics of both for sustaining medical education.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, cloud applications are integrated into work,
   daily-life, and the academia. Our goal was to examine the use of cloud
   applications for educational purposes and identify key skills necessary
   in the 21st century. The study included 114 lecturers (N=45) and
   students (N=69) from two higher education institutions. The Mix Method
   Research model was applied in the collection and analysis of
   online-questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Findings indicated
   that in the context of higher education, it seems that cloud computing
   is not only a model for delivering ICT services, but it may changes the
   way lecturer perceive their teaching and students perceive their
   learning. In addition to the necessary skills that were indicated in the
   20th decade, we identified four new skills and competences needed for
   work, citizenship, and self-actualization in the 21st century. Those

Abstract = {{Academic Networks, established as knowledge communities, have become a
   cornerstone for the sustainability of Public Health strategies; they
   enhance learning by sharing and building partnerships for strong
   alliances. A knowledge community builds and complements the research,
   training, services, and public policy agenda in a globalized and
   interconnected society. Today, the development of Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the wide range of work provided by
   the web 2.0 facilitates building knowledge communities, which advocate
   the convergence of social and digital elements, giving rise to the
   possibility of creating new structures for sustainability and knowledge
   scaling.
   A knowledge community formed by the ICT facilitates construction,
   dissemination, and the exchange and transfer of collectively produced
   knowledge, thus innovating on the classic standards to produce and
   transfer hierarchical knowledge, thus transcending from a rigid, lineal,
   vertical structure to a flexible, horizontal, collaborative one.
   This work analyzes two experiences that enabled academic networks built
   in knowledge communities through the use of the ICTs: 1) Leadership and
   Development Initiative in the field of Eco-Health; and 2) VBDs in
   Latin-America and the Caribbean Project, which resulted in the creation
   of a collaborative network via the Eco-Health ETV website and the
   Regional Public Health Competencies Framework in the Americas,
   consequently shaping a network funded by the Pan-American Health
   Organization. In both cases, we took advantage of the benefits generated
   by the collaborative efforts provided by the new technologies and placed
   the ICT as a key agent serving the Public Health in that Region.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative detector systems for non-destructive material analysis and
   for medical diagnosis are an important development to improve the
   performance and the quality of examination methods. For a number of
   years now photon-counting X-ray detectors are being developed to process
   incoming X-ray photons as single events. These detectors facilitate a
   higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than conventional,
   non-photon-counting, scintillator based detector systems, which detect
   X-ray photons indirectly through conversion into visible light.
   The Medipix is a pixelated photon counting semiconductor detector which
   features adjustable energy thresholds allowing energy selective,
   multispectral X-ray imaging. The Medipix chip is under continued
   development by the ``Medipix2 Collaboration{''} and ``Medipix3
   Collaboration{''} at CERN {[}1]. The Medipix electronic offers 256 x 256
   pixels with a pixel pitch of 55 x 55 mu m(2) and can be hybridized with
   different sensor materials like Si, CdTe or GaAs.
   The newest member of the Medipix family is the Medipix3 (ASIC in 0.13 mu
   m CMOS technology) providing up to eight separate 12-bit counters per
   pixel. It offers a couple of different working modes {[}2], which are
   useful for X-ray imaging applications. A Medipix3 CT X-ray measuring
   station was built up for small animal X-ray imaging and non-destructive
   material analysis {[}3]. The combination of the low energy threshold
   (similar to 4 keV) of the Medipix3 with its multispectral capability
   enables tomographic investigations on objects with low absorption
   contrast.
   The advantage of photon counting, multispectral detectors like Medipix3
   for material sciences will be presented here as well as a comparison
   with a scintillator based CT.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I follow up on my previous article about information
   systems as a reference discipline for new product development (Nambisan,
   2003) and assess the extant research on this topic. To facilitate the
   assessment, I develop a framework that considers information
   technology's ( IT's) dual roles as operand resource and as operant
   resource and its impact on innovation process and on innovation outcome.
   My analysis reveals the advance that has been made in understanding IT's
   role as operand resource in innovation and the considerable opportunity
   that exists to explore IT's emerging role as operant resource in
   innovation. I also comment on the need for IS scholars working in this
   area to make careful choices regarding their research topic and
   theoretical perspectives to enhance the potential impact on and
   contribution to the product/service innovation literature.}},

Abstract = {{Pervasive digitalization has brought new disruptive changes in the
   economy. At the core of these disruptive changes is digitally enabled
   generativity. In this paper, I argue that scholars must offer new
   theoretical models and insights that guide management practices in the
   age of generativity that can extend, or perhaps supplant, the prevailing
   emphasis on modularity. To that end, I suggest that information systems
   scholars must attend explicitly to the generative materiality of digital
   artifacts by drawing on the sociomaterial perspective, which has emerged
   as a robust intellectual tradition of the IS community. This paper is a
   provocation for those IS scholars who are willing to stretch the
   boundaries of their intellectual imagination beyond the comfort of IS
   journals and conferences, and offers a promising path forward.}},

   stage is a very important problem. However, it is hard for colleges and
   universities to afford the environment that is completely oriented to
   engineering practice and to provide various training opportunities for
   the students. Based on the research and exploration in the past years,
   research projects are used to drive teaching innovation in the paper.
   Research contents, objective, problems to be solved and approach adopted
   are presented. Research scheme and guarantee measures are also
   explained. Taking the development of Common Rolling Bearing Digital
   Three-Dimensional Model Library for example, the approach is discussed
   in detail.}},

   developed a procedure that reduces inconsistency in interviewee
   responses, removes outliers, and verifies conformability, in order to
   reduce the error and yield robust estimation results.
   Findings - The results show that the authors' method performed better in
   the empirical cases of digital media broadcasting and internet protocol
   television in terms of sum of squared error compared with an existing
   survey-based method, a regression method, and the guessing-by-analogy
   method. Specifically, the authors' method can reduce the error by using
   the conformability and outlier tests, while the consistency factor
   contributes to determining the final estimate with personal estimates.
   Research limitations/implications - The procedure proposed in this study
   is confined to the presented logistic model. Future research should aim
   to extend its application to other representative diffusion models such
   as the Bass model and the Gompertz model.
   Practical implications - The authors' method provides a better quality
   of forecasting for innovative new products and services compared with
   the guessing-by-analogy method, and it contributes to managerial
   decisions such as those in production planning.
   Originality/value - The authors introduce the concepts of conformability
   and consistency in order to reduce the error from personal biases and
   mistakes. Based on these concepts, they develop a procedure to yield
   robust estimation results with less error.}},

Abstract = {{Amazon.com Inc. has announced in July of 2010 that first digital book
   sales exceeded that of printed books. This vertiginous growth in
   adoption of this new modality book causes doubts among professional
   librarianship. The purpose of this paper is to a review of literature
   which would help make clear what is a digital book describing the
   history, layout, the development of reading devices, and reflect on
   their benefits and weaknesses. Discusses the attitude of professional
   librarianship in front of changes and challenges of the digital book,
   and questions the end of the paper book. The applied method was
   bibliographic literature review research into consisted domestic and
   international scientific journals in information science, besides the
   consultation books, blogs, portals and websites. Conclusion is that
   models of the printed book and electronic exist alongside. It was
   evidenced that the opportunity is arising for publishing for expansion
   of certain types of books. In that context the Information Professionals
   must consider the technological innovations naturally, given
   opportunities that the new media may provide, emphasizing importance of

Abstract = {{We will show the capabilities of optical modes known as optical vortices
   in order to perform mode-division multiplexing (MDM) propagation with a
   different approach. In particular, we will propose optical vortices not
   only as an alternative way to increase the fiber capacity, but also as a
   cost-effective and ``green{''} solution able to reduce power dissipation
   in high capacity systems with respect to solutions based on coherent
   detection and computationally complex digital MIMO processing, employed
   in MDM with usual LP modes.
   Two different proposals based on the all-optical spatial mode
   demultiplexing and on a non-linear MIMO receiver can allow to employ
   direct detection and to exploit optical vortices in very simple systems
   useful for short and medium distances links, where the cost reduction
   and energy sustainability are mandatory.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical alloying method process has been innovatively used to
   prepare Cu-Cr coating on the inner wall of steel pipe. The effect of the
   rotating speed on thickness, microhardness and friction coefficient of
   the Cu-Cr coating was investigated. The coating thickness was measured
   from all samples using optical microscope. The microhardness was
   analyzed by Digital Microhardness Tester. The friction coefficient was
   tested by high speed reciprocating friction testing machine. The results
   show that the coating thickness is 26, 29 and 31 mu m at the rotating
   speed of 200, 250 and 300 rpm. The microhardness of the Cu-Cr coating
   prepared at 200, 250 and 300 rpm are about 760, 780 and 830 Hv. The
   friction coefficient of the Cu-Cr coating prepared at 200 rpm are about
   0.25, 0.40 and 0.38 at the frequencies of 3, 4 and 5 Hz. The friction
   coefficient of the Cu-Cr coating prepared at 250 rpm are about 0.30,
   0.29 and 0.20 at the frequencies of 3, 4 and 5 Hz. The friction
   coefficient of the Cu-Cr coating prepared at 300 rpm are about 0.10,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on a novel direct wafer bonding technique; Si
   (111) wafers to polycrystalline silicon carbide carrier wafers. The
   purpose of this work is to provide a platform for 3C-SiC epitaxial
   growth above the wafer bonded Si (111) wafers. We have demonstrated
   reduced wafer bow, confirmed by optical microscopy together with a
   digital camera. 3C-SiC epitaxial layers have been grown by conventional
   chemical vapor deposition techniques above Si/SiC structures. All of
   these 3C-SiC epitaxial layers are highly crystalline in nature. In the
   future, the realization of thick, bow-free 3C-SiC layers suitable for
   power device fabrication is achievable.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated biomedical sensors are used in biomedical devices which
   monitor vital bio-signals such as ECG, EMG, AAP, etc., whose maximum
   frequency range up to few MHz. Such integrated systems require analog to
   digital converters with Megahertz conversion rate. This paper presents a
   novel architecture of asynchronous pipelined analog to digital converter
   with emphasis on elimination of external clock for integrated biomedical
   sensor based applications. The main innovative feature of the proposed
   pipelined ADC is that it operates without any external timing signal and
   behaves like a combinational logic for a given analog input. Complete
   digital conversion is obtained by asynchronously propagating the partial
   conversions and the residues through the various stages. The only
   requirement for the ADC is an external trigger signal from the sensors.
   The proposed 8 bit ADC implemented in UMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology has
   a sampling rate of 5 MHz, with power dissipation of 30 mW and has an
   active area of 0.8544 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{The article presents a mechatronic system for the production of highly
   secured documents that allows for the realization of R\&D tasks directed
   at the improvement of the level of security of electronic and physical
   RFID tags. The structure of the system allows for the application of
   special, low cost, flexible production systems enabling free use of
   developed innovative technologies, structures, components, formulas and
   procedures.
   The system is based on two technological lines. The first of them
   enables the manufacture of multilayer (glued), graphically and
   electronically non-personalised products that vary in size and shapes in
   the conditions of low cost experimental production. The second line
   allows for the introduction of unique graphic information in form of
   overprints assigned to suitable data entered into the microprocessor
   memory. Adequate verification systems compare the compatibility of the
   electronic record with the alphanumeric information and the conformity
   of digital graphics with the graphics in form of the overprint visible
   in certain lighting conditions. The additional application of the
   two-sided lamination results in the increased mechanical and physical
   endurance and resistance to non-authorised changes of graphic and
   alphanumerical information.}},

Abstract = {{In the trend of e-government development and the emphasis on enhancing
   government intelligence capability, Taiwan provides publics and
   industries with active service process by integrating government
   information, building innovative technology (e.g. cloud technology,
   Internet of Things, IoT). The fields of medical health insurance and
   social welfare are the primary developing focuses of e-government.
   Government intelligence service strategy includes building multiple
   service environments, active deliver government information,
   centralizing resource for effective management, improving jointly
   interaction and trust, and effectively connecting social networks. The
   application of digital identification card already use in Taiwan few
   years. A investigate shows in this study. June 20th 2012, the amount of
   issued citizen digital identification card has reached up to 2960000
   cards. This study expects there would be more service affairs to be
   transformed to web services. For achieving the goal of effectively
   improving the utilization rate and the amount of issued cards, this
   study aims to take the effect on publics into prior consideration. This
   study mainly analyzes the applied services of citizen digital
   identification launched by the government in order to realize the
   numbers of users, the average usage times per year, and applied items of
   follow-up conducting publics to explore the importance of and public's
   satisfaction toward applied service performance. The descriptive
   statistics, cross-analysis, important performance analysis (IPA) method
   and recommended relevant strategies are adopted in this study. Although
   the government has achieved the initial goal concerning the effects of
   volume of circulation and the critical items (e.g. an income tax report)
   on public satisfaction and benefits, this study suggests that it would
   be more beneficial in mid and long term to encourage the integration of
   citizen digital identification with B2C e-business, ID and health
   insurance card, and digital permit with, taking European Union's ID as
   reference. The expectation is to let citizen digital identification
   application gradually embed in citizen's daily life (e-butler). The
   results of this study can provide government with useful references for
   continuous improvement strategies with citizen digital identification.}},

Abstract = {{The Beijing 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Sailing Competitions (referred
   to as OPSC hereafter) were held at Qingdao during August 9-23 and
   September 7-13 2008, respectively. The Qingdao Meteorological Bureau was
   the official provider of weather support for the OPSC. Three-dimensional
   real-time information with high spatial-temporal resolution was obtained
   by the comprehensive observation system during the OPSC, which included
   weather radars, wind profile radars, buoys, automated weather stations,
   and other conventional observations. The refined forecasting system
   based on MM5, WRF, and statistical modules provided point-specific
   hourly wind forecasts for the five venues, and the severe weather
   monitoring and forecasting system was used in short-term forecasts and
   nowcasts for rainstorms, gales, and hailstones. Moreover, latest
   forecasting products, warnings, and weather information were
   communicated conveniently and timely through a synthetic, speedy, and
   digitalized network system to different customers. Daily weather
   information briefings, notice boards, websites, and community short
   messages were the main approaches for regatta organizers, athletes, and
   coaches to receive weather service products at 8: 00 PM of each day and
   whenever new updates were available. During the period of OPSC, almost
   one hundred people were involved in the weather service with innovative
   service concept, and the weather support was found to be successful and
   helpful to the OPSC.}},

Abstract = {{Digital photoelasticity is an important optical metrology follow-up for
   stress and strain analysis using full-field digital photographic images.
   Advances in digital image processing, data acquisition, procedures for
   pattern recognition and storage capacity enable the use of the
   computer-aided technique in automation and facilitate improvement of the
   digital photoelastic technique. The objective of this research is to
   find new equations for a novel phase-shifting method in digital
   photoelasticity. Some innovations are proposed. In terms of
   phase-shifting, only the analyzer is rotated, and the other equations
   are deduced by applying a new numerical technique instead of the usual
   algebraic techniques. This approach can be used to calculate a larger
   sequence of images. Each image represents a pattern and a measurement of
   the stresses present in the object. A decrease in the mean errors was
   obtained by increasing the number of observations. A reduction in the
   difference between the theoretical and experimental values of stresses
   was obtained by increasing the number of images in the equations for
   calculating phase. Every photographic image has errors and random noise,
   but the uncertainties due to these effects can be reduced with a larger
   number of observations. The proposed method with many images and high
   accuracy is a good alternative to the photoelastic techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Technological innovation moves at lightning speed, often before general
   or specialized populations are ready or equipped to handle the changes
   that it brings with it. Licensing programs in education, whether they
   are graduate or undergraduate, bring with them their own challenges for
   utilizing innovative technology, and the first outcry of those who are
   leery of it is, ``how will this affect the preparedness of our students
   to pass their licensing tests?{''} In this meta interpretation, a
   qualitative synthesis was conducted on studies that focus on innovative
   technology use for delivery of instruction, student engagement, and
   programmatic change. The study eligibility criteria included
   institutions of higher learning with teacher preparation programs that
   utilized different types of digital technologies over the last decade.
   All studies analyzed through an iterative and ideographic process were
   qualitative. Main results demonstrated that long lasting changes brought
   about by technological innovation in teacher preparation programs
   require a mixture of cultural and institutional changes, commitment from
   those within the program, and active and engaged leadership.
   Implications demonstrated that the process for change is a long and slow
   one, but well worth the effort. The latter part of this chapter proposes
   a theory-based cycle for change. If any type of innovation is to be
   useful and fulfill the promise with which it is presented, attempts at
   creating a system by which to manage it may be the only way to salvage
   its potential and make it truly shine.}},

Abstract = {{A network of 45 spatially distributed time-lapse cameras was used to
   carry out a continuous observation of snow processes and snow cover
   properties throughout three mid-latitude medium elevation mountain
   catchments in hourly intervals during the winter seasons of 2010/2011
   and 2011/2012. A simple technical modification was conducted to enable
   the deployment of the standard digital cameras in any location. Image
   analysis software was applied to extract information about snow depth,
   surface albedo and canopy interception from the digital images.
   Furthermore, the distributed design of the camera network made it
   possible to identify the elevation of the snow rain interface for any
   precipitation event which is very helpful for the interpretation of
   winter flooding events resulting from snow melt. Exemplary data for all
   these analyses is presented to show the potential fields of application
   of this innovative approach. Study results prove that the application of
   digital time-lapse photography is an appropriate technique to observe
   the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of seasonal snow covers
   in a mountainous environment.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The development of new global health academic programs
   provides unique opportunities to create innovative educational
   approaches within and across universities. Recent evidence suggests that
   digital media technologies may provide feasible and cost-effective
   alternatives to traditional classroom instruction; yet, many emerging
   global health academic programs lag behind in the utilization of modern
   technologies.
   Objective: We created an inter-departmental University of Southern
   California (USC) collaboration to develop and implement a course focused
   on digital media and global health.
   Design: Course curriculum was based on core tenants of modern education:
   multi-disciplinary, technologically advanced, learner-centered, and
   professional application of knowledge. Student and university
   evaluations were reviewed to qualitatively assess course satisfaction
   and educational outcomes.
   Results: `New Media for Global Health' ran for 18 weeks in the Spring
   2012 semester with N = 41 students (56.1\% global health and 43.9\%
   digital studies students). The course resulted in a number of high
   quality global health-related digital media products available at
   http://iml420.wordpress.com/. Challenges confronted at USC included
   administrative challenges related to co-teaching and frustration from
   students conditioned to a rigid system of teacher-led learning within a

Abstract = {{For a regular Digital Peak Respiratory Flow Metter, a strain gauge or
   similar probe is used to detect the strength of the blowing. The signal
   is then be analyzed by computer. In this innovative Self-Power Peek
   Respiratory Flow Meter, however, a generator is used. The generator is
   ``one stone for two birds{''}: it serves as the digital signal generator
   to present the air flow data; it also provides the energy source to
   re-power the batteries. This allows people to use the equipment whenever
   and anywhere without worry of recharge or change batteries. Another
   advantage of the machine is its reliability. The blowing chamber is
   separated from the generator by magnetic (shaft-less) coupling,
   therefore, the moisture from blowing has no way to corrode the electric
   circuit or contaminate the instrument. Because of this innovative
   instrument is ``Green{''}, ``Digital{''} and easy of use, the
   application would be expanded. The Coreless Permanent Magnet Disk
   Generator technology (AFPM) is utilized to eliminate the cogging torque.
   Moreover, energy saving circuit design also implemented to make the
   self-power instrument a reality.}},

Abstract = {{A fatigue detection system based on EEG and it's realization on FPGA
   were described in this paper, the basic components and the related
   principles of each module were introduced. The difficulties and
   innovations in realization on FPGA were given in details as well as some
   simulation results. This system can be applied to the real-time
   detecting of drivers' fatigue which can provide forewarning in time. EEG
   is a kind of weak bioelectricity which is easily interfered by strong
   noise. The acquired signal passed through a three-stage amplifier before
   AD converter, then the digital signal entered FPGA. There EEG was
   decomposed using DWT, some coefficients were deposed as random noise,
   and the signal was reconstructed to the de-noised one. Then according to
   the relationship between EEG and tiredness, FPGA calculated the fatigue
   criterion and gave out forewarning when the value was too large.}},

Abstract = {{Rapidly programmable micro-mirror arrays, such as the DLP (R) digital
   micro-mirror device (DMD), have opened an exciting new arena in spectral
   imaging: rapidly reprogrammable, high spectral resolution, multi-band
   spectral filters that perform spectral processing directly in the
   optical hardware. Such a device is created by placing a DMD at the
   spectral plane of an imaging spectrometer, and using it as a spectral
   selector that passes some wavelengths down the optical train to the
   final image and rejects others. While simple in concept, realizing a
   truly practical DMD-based spectral filter has proved challenging.
   Versions described to date have been limited by the intertwining of
   image position and spectral propagation direction common to most imaging
   spectrometers, reducing these instruments to line-by-line scanning
   imagers rather than true spectral cameras that collect entire
   two-dimensional images at once. Here we report several optical
   innovations that overcome this limitation and allow us to construct
   full-frame programmable filters that spectrally manipulate every pixel,
   simultaneously and without spectral shifts, across a full 2D image. So
   far, our prototype, which can be programmed either as a matched-filter
   imager for specific target materials or as a fully hyperspectral
   multiplexing Hadamard transform imager, has demonstrated over 100
   programmable spectral bands while maintaining good spatial image
   quality. We discuss how diffraction-mediated trades between spatial and
   spectral resolution determine achievable performance. Finally, we
   describe methods for dealing with the DLP's 2D diffractive effects, and
   suggest a simple modification to the DLP that would eliminate their
   impact for this application.}},

Abstract = {{With the increased prevalence of digital technologies in our everyday
   lives, the questions posed to the contemporary craft practitioner
   regarding creation of an emotionally resonant interaction between the
   digitally enhanced object and its wearer have become progressively more
   prominent in the applied arts. Through examining the notion that human
   biology is a part of material culture, where the body can be shaped,
   customised or altered through surgical intervention and scientific
   innovation, this extended abstract explores how recent developments in
   material science and wearable technologies can be viewed as contiguous
   rather than oppositional to the organic processes of the human body and
   how to bridge the gap between the craft practitioner and scientific
   discovery. More immediately however, this research project challenges
   the perception of smart materials and their application within the field
   of contemporary jewellery in both an artistic and scientific context
   through proposing the development of symbiotic stimulus-reactive
   jewellery organisms. Potential practical applications of these jewellery
   objects exist in the areas of human computer interaction, transplant
   technology, identity management and artificial body modification
   including prosthetics, where such symbiotic jewellery organisms could be
   used to develop visually engaging yet multifunctional enhancements of
   the body.}},

   economies the world over. In recent years' development and applications
   of ICT monitors have increasingly served to displace traditional paper
   based displays, yielding tremendous environmental efficacy. Digital
   e-paper displays enjoy numerous competitive advantages including energy
   efficiency, eye friendliness, resilient durability, and readability, but
   are currently generally only deployed in e-book uses, so enhancing their
   application scope, in addition to relying on their reading comfort, the
   market will no doubt develop appreciable economic and environmental
   benefits. Hence this study deploys the perspective of applications
   innovation, to explore uses of e-paper solutions in MRT advertising
   contexts on the advertising efficacy aspects of both advertising memory
   and advertising attitudes. This research relies on in situ experimental
   methods, at an existing MRT station in Taipei on the island of Taiwan,
   through convenience sampling to select 100 study subjects, who were
   asked to view two encased displays (either a digital e-paper display or
   paper display) with public notice contents, prior to completing the
   study survey and statistical analysis of the valid responses. The study
   findings indicate that, for the general public MRT patrons, digital
   e-paper advertising solutions yielded optimal efficacy for both
   advertising memory and advertising attitude, with significant results
   along the dimensions of both advertising receptiveness and interest.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a way of collecting data in
   people's natural environments in real time and has become very popular
   in social and health sciences. The emergence of personal digital
   assistants has led to more complex and sophisticated EMA protocols but
   has also highlighted some important drawbacks. Modern cell phones
   combine the functionalities of advanced communication systems with those
   of a handheld computer and offer various additional features to capture
   and record sound, pictures, locations, and movements. Moreover, most
   people own a cell phone, are familiar with the different functions, and
   always carry it with them. This paper describes ways in which cell
   phones have been used for data collection purposes in the field of
   social sciences. This includes automated data capture techniques, for
   example, geolocation for the study of mobility patterns and the use of
   external sensors for remote health-monitoring research. The paper also
   describes cell phones as efficient and user-friendly tools for prompt
   manual data collection, that is, by asking participants to produce or to
   provide data. This can either be done by means of dedicated applications
   or by simply using the web browser. We conclude that cell phones offer a
   variety of advantages and have a great deal of potential for innovative
   research designs, suggesting they will be among the standard data
   collection devices for EMA in the coming years.}},

Abstract = {{The Laboratory of Intelligent Control Systems of Aircraft Engines has
   been built around the idea of design implementation and testing of
   progressive algorithms in the areas of identification, modeling, control
   and diagnostics of complex systems. As such complex system a class of
   small turbojet engines suitable for laboratory experiments and
   utilization has been used, the engine MPM-20 derived from turbo-starter
   TS-20 in particular. Such small turbojet engines exhibit similar dynamic
   behavior as normal sized engines and have many properties of complex
   systems like non-linear characteristics, variable cross bindings, broad
   operational range, non stationary parameters and elements of stochastic
   behavior.
   To succeed in application, design and testing of new modeling, control
   and diagnostic algorithms, the field of digital data processing, fusion
   and extreme parameter sensing is a pivotal part of works in the
   laboratory and represents the area of engineering works to implement the
   engine's real time data acquisition system with real-time virtual data
   presentation through virtual dashboard including basic digital
   algorithms that are utilized to operate the engine's auxiliary systems.
   Data and their real-time and offline fusion represent the base for all
   further research in the mentioned areas.
   The first of these is the area of identification and modeling of
   dynamical and static properties of the engine and implementation of
   advanced algorithms in this area. Research can be here divided into two
   basic groups and that is the precision analytical modeling of the heat
   cycle of the engine and all inner parameters of the engine in the form
   of complex offline simulator depicting mostly static dependencies of the
   engine allowing to calculate operational envelope of the engine with
   regard to changing outer operational conditions (atmospheric pressure,
   speed, temperatures, etc.). Such analytical model is built around
   non-linear differential equations, which allow us to implement
   progressive algorithms like ANFIS, which has brought promising results
   in terms of computational times and precision. The other modeling area
   deals with modeling of dynamic engine properties. The concept of
   situational modeling utilizing neural networks and fuzzy inference
   systems along classical modeling approaches through differential
   equations and polynomial interpolations have been researched and
   implemented here. These models serve for the purpose of control
   algorithm design and simulations as well as diagnostic models that are
   being implemented to run as real-time nominal models to compute normal
   engines parameters.
   The area of new control algorithms design and testing is aimed on the
   concept of situational classification of the engine's operation and
   design of situational control system for the engine. Special algorithms
   have been designed for start-up control of the engine, nominal operation
   as well as acceleration and deceleration of the engine. Big emphasis is
   put here on handling of atypical operational states of the engine, like
   different faults and optimization of fuel consumption and thrust. This
   represent a field for implementation of adaptive intelligent algorithms
   in the role of situational classifier and also in the role of individual
   control algorithms. The main emphasis here is put on fuzzy inference
   systems and neural networks in hybrid adaptive architectures where
   advantages of both approaches can be merged.
   The area of diagnostic, back-up and health management system is firmly
   bound to the area of data acquisition and modeling. Dynamic models are
   used for error isolation, back-up of individual engine's parameters
   while health management is being designed around the system of data
   acquisition and fusion together with assessment of engines efficiency
   and analysis of historical data.
   Special areas of research in the laboratory are represented by the areas
   of alternative fuels testing, thermal and magnetic aura measurement,
   where a small turbojet engine represents an ideal object for such
   experiments.
   Experimental and theoretical results of the research done in the
   Laboratory of Intelligent Control Systems of Aircraft Engines are aimed
   to be transferred into education and possibly to practice by
   demonstration of efficiency of the proposed algorithm in real-world
   conditions on the real-world object of the MPM-20 engine. The researched
   algorithms, methodologies and approaches can be generalized and used
   also for other class of engines and other complex systems.}},

Pages = {{4-22}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to estimate the scale of illegal
   file-sharing activity across ten countries and to correlate this
   activity with country revenues. The work aims to elucidate an
   under-explored business model challenge which exists in parallel with a
   music piracy challenge.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study data are drawn from a number of
   sources, including a data set of a survey of more than 44,000 consumers
   in ten different countries undertaken in 2010. Following analysis, all
   findings are validated by a panel of industry experts.
   Findings - Results show that non-legitimate file-sharing activity is a
   heterogeneous issue across countries. The scale of activity varies from
   14 per cent in Germany to 44 per cent in Spain, with an average of 28
   per cent. File-sharing activity negatively correlates to music industry
   revenue per capita. This research finds many consumers are not engaging
   with online business models. Almost one fourth of the population claim
   that they do not consume digital music in either legal or illegal forms.
   This phenomenon is also negatively correlated with sales per capita.
   Practical implications - Results support the need for policy makers to
   introduce strong intellectual property rights (IPR) regulation which
   reduces file-sharing activity. The work also identifies a large
   percentage of non-participants in the digital market who may be
   re-engaged with music through business model innovation.
   Originality/value - This research presents a map of the current
   file-sharing activity in ten countries using a rich and unique dataset
   The work identifies that a country's legal origin correlates to data on
   file-sharing activity, with countries from a German legal origin
   illegally file sharing least. Approximately, half of the survey
   respondents chose not to answer the question related to file-sharing
   activity. Different estimates of the true scale of file-sharing activity
   are given based upon three different assumptions of the file sharing
   activity of non-respondents to this question. The challenge of engaging
   consumers in the digital market through different business models is
   discussed in light of digital music's high velocity environment.}},

Journal = {{PROBLEMOS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{133-144}},
Abstract = {{The article focuses on the new media-based education as an alternative
   to the classical paradigm of education initiated by print culture.
   Therefore, the controversy between two media philosophy models is
   analysed here. One of these models refers to phonetic writing as a
   paradigmatic innovation which appeared in the Antiquity, while the other
   one is related to the emergence of electronic media in the Contemporary
   Age. Although the oral tradition was replaced by writing and handwriting
   culture by print, similarly the domination of the printed word is being
   displaced by the new electronic and digital media, each of these
   communication technologies is treated as a vastly important qualitative
   extension of the previous one. Thus, the article aims to answer the
   question of how these transformations have affected the teaching and
   learning environment, the learning process and students' sensory
   experience. While the Antique education system was focused on the
   development of personality and the issues of reasons and causes, the
   Contemporary Age pays a lot of attention to the structures of electronic
   information as well as to the reflection of their consequences and
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{How will intellectual property law change as the economy becomes
   dominated by services and ideas? This Essay explains why the interest
   groups and other forces that brought about an expansion of property
   rights over the last century or two are reconfigured in an economy
   dominated by ideas. This reconfiguration makes prizes - including
   grants, subsidies, and various contractual promises - more likely and
   more attractive than properly rights as the means of encouraging
   innovation. The theory predicts an increase in the use of subsidies and
   other prizes, rather than patents. These prizes can be of the ex ante
   kind, offered before innovations come about, as well as of the ex post
   sort, used to reward success but also to encourage innovators with the
   promise of future gains. The discussion then moves from patent law to
   copyright, and from machines and pharmaceuticals to the troubled
   newsgathering industry, where the iPrize Revolution is likely to be
   immediate and dramatic because of the low cost of digital delivery.}},

Title = {{Acquiring external knowledge to avoid wheel re-invention}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{87-105}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the underlying
   characteristics that enable the acquisition and appropriation of
   external knowledge, paying special attention to the relationship between
   external and internal networks to support this process.
   Design/methodology/approach - A case study methodology is followed,
   using not only semi-structured interviews but also secondary data to
   triangulate the obtained information. For the interviews, the authors
   have considered not only employees in different strategic positions,
   from middle management to top management, but also participants in the
   main supplier, to obtain a holistic perspective of the knowledge
   acquisition and appropriation in the innovation process.
   Findings - For the improvements of the process of knowledge acquisition
   and appropriation, organizations should configure internal and external
   networks to support this process reorganizing their classical
   structures. Moreover, this process is enhanced by the support of top
   managers and innovation champions, which act as sponsors and
   facilitators of the project respectively, to ensure that the whole
   process runs smoothly. At the end, to deal with new kinds of projects
   that are completely different to previous ones, it is recommended to be
   open to new ways of organizing and structuring participants; hence,
   coordination and socialization mechanisms are important to reach not
   only potential absorptive capacity (associated with knowledge
   acquisition) but also realized absorptive capacity (associated with
   knowledge exploitation). This situation is even more relevant in Web 2.0
   environments, where each participant has autonomy to participate
   actively, be just a passive participant, or cease to belong to the
   community.
   Practical implications - The paper's findings could be useful to
   identify the determinants of knowledge acquisition and appropriation
   because they could guide organizations in the development of external
   and internal networks to support this process, which would be used to
   promote innovation within the organization; and with this
   identification, organizations could take actions based on their
   organizational requirements and goals. It is important to note that
   organizational boundaries are shifting from being closed to be
   permeable, enabling a better interaction with key partners and
   facilitating the knowledge exchange. However, this situation offers new
   challenges for organizations that want to be leaders in the near future
   because traditional organizations should shift their old paradigms,
   having an organizational culture more aligned with Web 2.0 philosophy
   (e.g. collaboration and sharing), which is the paradigm of the new
   digital economy
   Originality/value - This study is a step forward to understand the
   relationship between external and internal networks that act as enablers
   of knowledge acquisition and appropriation. The authors extend the
   knowledge-based view by applying it in a Web 2.0 context, highlighting
   coordination and socialization mechanisms as critical success factors to
   integrate internal and external knowledge. Finally, the inclusion of
   interviews of employees from the main supplier of BBVA in these kinds of
   projects provides a holistic perspective of the process of knowledge
   acquisition and appropriation.}},

Pages = {{226-235}},
Abstract = {{As the world's content becomes further digitized and consumers,
   corporations, and governments turn to cloud computing platforms -
   specifically the data center - for their storage and application needs,
   managing data center waste becomes increasingly important. Less than
   near full utilization rates for the computing resources, rising energy
   costs, and e-waste management are just a few of the reasons why a
   focused attention on practicing sustainable management in the data
   center is essential. This research identifies several key foci of waste
   within the management of data centers, including: power, emissions,
   computing resource lifespan, facilities, and packaging methods.
   Furthermore this research identifies four roadblocks, or challenges,
   facing sustainability improvements within the data center. These
   challenges include: IT prioritization pressures, (lack of) governmental
   regulation, consumption-oriented cultures, and lagging academic support
   and innovation. By first recognizing these forms of waste and then
   coming up with innovative ways to address the technological, regulatory,
   and managerial challenges faced in data centers across the globe, data
   center management can move from a position of lagging to a position of
   leadership in the sustainability movement.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in the performance of VLSI circuits are leading to a number of
   emerging applications of multidimensional (MD) filters. Early progress
   was focused on the numerical design of two dimensional (2-D) transfer
   functions and the challenging stability issues associated with
   low-complexity infinite impulse response (IIR) implementations. However,
   over the last decade or so, important practical advances have occurred
   in the design of 3-D and 4-D IIR filters, leading to some important
   emerging applications. In this tutorial article, some of these
   applications are described, with emphasis on 2-D spatio-temporal
   beamforming and 4-D light field processing. In particular, advances in
   spatio-temporal beamforming for cognitive radio systems and for
   synthetic aperture radio telescopes are considered. In the 4-D case, we
   describe a class of 4-D light field filters for image processing, 4-D
   hyper-fan filters for low-light imaging, depth filtering, denoising and
   the attenuation of distracting objects, with applications in
   computational photography and habitat monitoring. Both analog and
   digital systolic VLSI circuit implementations are described with
   emphasis on recent progress using field programmable gate array
   (FPGA)-based and digital VLSI circuits that can potentially operate at
   radio frequencies in the multi-GHz range. These new innovations open up
   exciting possibilities for real-time MD filters having frames rates in
   the multi-GHz for emerging radio frequency (RF) antenna signal
   processing and imaging systems.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting malicious software or malware is one of the major concerns in
   information security governance as malware authors pose a major
   challenge to digital forensics by using a variety of highly
   sophisticated stealth techniques to hide malicious code in computing
   systems, including smartphones. The current detection techniques are
   futile, as forensic analysis of infected devices is unable to identify
   all the hidden malware, thereby resulting in zero day attacks. This
   chapter takes a key step forward to address this issue and lays
   foundation for deeper investigations in digital forensics. The goal of
   this chapter is, firstly, to unearth the recent obfuscation strategies
   employed to hide malware. Secondly, this chapter proposes innovative
   techniques that are implemented as a fully-automated tool, and
   experimentally tested to exhaustively detect hidden malware that
   leverage on system vulnerabilities. Based on these research
   investigations, the chapter also arrives at an information security
   governance plan that would aid in addressing the current and future
   cybercrime situations.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on the ways in which social technologies facilitate
   informal knowledge sharing in the workplace. Social technologies include
   both common technologies such as email, phone, and instant messenger and
   emerging social networking technologies, often known as social media or
   Web 2.0, such as blogs, wikis, public social networking sites (i.e.,
   Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn), enterprise social networking
   technologies, etc. We know social technologies support informal
   interactions over digital systems and influence informal social
   connections among people within and across organizational boundaries. To
   understand the role of social technologies in informal knowledge
   practices, we pursue a field study of knowledge workers in consulting
   firms to investigate the role of social technologies in their informal
   knowledge sharing practices. Our theorizing from the data is guided by
   the conceptual premises of sociomateriality to better understand the
   ways social technologies are integrated with common knowledge practices.
   Findings highlight five knowledge practices supported by the use of
   social technologies. Building from these findings we offer conceptual
   insights regarding the material performance of different social
   technologies as an assemblage.}},

Title = {{Mobile Health (mHealth) Approaches and Lessons for Increased Performance
   and Retention of Community Health Workers in Low- and Middle-Income
   Countries: A Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mobile health (mHealth) describes the use of portable
   electronic devices with software applications to provide health services
   and manage patient information. With approximately 5 billion mobile
   phone users globally, opportunities for mobile technologies to play a
   formal role in health services, particularly in low- and middle-income
   countries, are increasingly being recognized. mHealth can also support
   the performance of health care workers by the dissemination of clinical
   updates, learning materials, and reminders, particularly in underserved
   rural locations in low- and middle-income countries where community
   health workers deliver integrated community case management to children
   sick with diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria.
   Objective: Our aim was to conduct a thematic review of how mHealth
   projects have approached the intersection of cellular technology and
   public health in low- and middle-income countries and identify the
   promising practices and experiences learned, as well as novel and
   innovative approaches of how mHealth can support community health
   workers.
   Methods: In this review, 6 themes of mHealth initiatives were examined
   using information from peer-reviewed journals, websites, and key
   reports. Primary mHealth technologies reviewed included mobile phones,
   personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones, patient monitoring
   devices, and mobile telemedicine devices. We examined how these tools
   could be used for education and awareness, data access, and for
   strengthening health information systems. We also considered how mHealth
   may support patient monitoring, clinical decision making, and tracking
   of drugs and supplies. Lessons from mHealth trials and studies were
   summarized, focusing on low- and middle-income countries and community
   health workers.
   Results: The review revealed that there are very few formal outcome
   evaluations of mHealth in low-income countries. Although there is vast
   documentation of project process evaluations, there are few studies
   demonstrating an impact on clinical outcomes. There is also a lack of
   mHealth applications and services operating at scale in low- and
   middle-income countries. The most commonly documented use of mHealth was
   1-way text-message and phone reminders to encourage follow-up
   appointments, healthy behaviors, and data gathering. Innovative mHealth
   applications for community health workers include the use of mobile
   phones as job aides, clinical decision support tools, and for data
   submission and instant feedback on performance.
   Conclusions: With partnerships forming between governments,
   technologists, non-governmental organizations, academia, and industry,
   there is great potential to improve health services delivery by using
   mHealth in low- and middle-income countries. As with many other health
   improvement projects, a key challenge is moving mHealth approaches from
   pilot projects to national scalable programs while properly engaging
   health workers and communities in the process. By harnessing the
   increasing presence of mobile phones among diverse populations, there is
   promising evidence to suggest that mHealth can be used to deliver
   increased and enhanced health care services to individuals and
   communities, while helping to strengthen health systems. (J Med Internet

Abstract = {{Innovative designs of transport vehicles need to be validated in order
   to demonstrate reliability and provide confidence. It is normal practice
   to study the mechanical response of the structural elements by comparing
   numerical results obtained from finite element simulation models with
   results obtained from experiment. In this frame, the use of whole-field
   optical techniques has been proven successful in the validation of
   deformation, strain, or vibration modes. The strength of full-field
   optical techniques is that the entire displacement field can be
   acquired. The objective of this article is to integrate full-field
   optical measurement methodologies with state-of-the-art computational
   simulation techniques for nonlinear transient dynamic events. In this
   frame, composite car bonnet frame structures of dimensions about 1.8 m x
   0.8 m are considered. They have been tested in low-velocity mass-drop
   impact loading with impact energies ranging from 20 to 200 J. In
   parallel, simulation models of the car bonnet frame have been developed
   using layered shell elements. The Zernike shape descriptor approach was
   used to decompose numerical and experimental data into moments for
   comparison purposes. A very good agreement between numerical and
   experimental results was observed. Therefore, integration of numerical
   analysis with full-field optical measurements along with sophisticated
   comparison techniques can increase design reliability.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a microfluidic device that has integrated pH
   optical sensing capabilities based on polyaniline. The optical
   properties of polyaniline coatings change in response to the pH of the
   solution that is flushed inside the microchannel offering the
   possibility of monitoring pH in continuous flow over a wide pH range
   throughout the entire channel length. This work also features an
   innovative detection system for spatial localisation of chemical pH
   gradients along microfluidic channels through the use of a low cost
   optical device. Specifically, the use of a microfluidic channel coated
   with polyaniline is shown to respond colorimetrically to pH and that
   effect is detected by the detection system, even when pH gradients are
   induced within the channel. This study explores the capability of
   detecting this gradient by means of imaging techniques and the mapping
   of the camera's response to its corresponding pH after a successful
   calibration process. The provision of an inherently responsive channel
   means that changes in the pH of a sample moving through the system can
   be detected dynamically using digital imaging along the entire channel
   length in real time, without the need to add reagents to the sample.
   This approach is generic and can be applied to other chemically
   responsive coatings immobilised on microchannels.}},

Abstract = {{Theory use and development in research are significant to all
   disciplines. Scholarly literature serves as a venue to share the diverse
   and detailed methods about how theories are used and developed in
   research. This research study, which investigated information behavior
   of digital age youth, applied and further developed radical change
   theory by adopting the theory-to-research-to-theoty strategy. Radical
   change theory guided development of the research questions. The research
   design incorporated radical change theory to provide structure to the
   systematic data collection and analysis. Finally, radical change theory
   was further developed by the study's results. The study's primary
   finding is the development of a typology of youth information behavior
   in the digital age. The typology presents innovative information
   behaviors that operationalize radical change theory's concepts. The
   typology creation contributes to the expansion of the theory and lays
   the groundwork for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Exploring interaction: print and online news media synergies}},
Journal = {{INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{89-108}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to understand the level of synergy between
   print and online activity and to assess the influence of print/online
   synergy on the log of circulation change.
   Design/methodology/approach - In order to meet this aim the authors
   conducted an empirical study of 100 regional newspapers supplying news
   media services in the UK. Two hypotheses grounded in a conceptual model
   were developed. The authors used Pearson correlation and (stepwise)
   regression analysis to test two hypotheses (H1 and H2).
   Findings - H1 provides us with some interesting findings. The first is
   that higher priced newspapers attract more unique Internet users and
   mobile Internet access. Higher priced newspapers who have been in
   business longer and have established brands attract more online readers.
   Also, because these issues are more expensive there is more incentive to
   go online to read the papers for free. Note that this last explanation
   is consistent with the analysis provided for H2, the beta for price is
   negative. The negative coefficient indicates that the circulation change
   of higher priced papers has reduced more. Therefore circulation change
   impacts greater upon premium price newspapers for an elite rather than a
   broad readership. The regression results presented here indicate that
   established firms with premium pricing, providing multiple platform
   distribution and specialist digital editions with free online content,
   have circulations that are reducing less.
   Practical implications - While reducing the rate of circulation decline,
   current levels of online presence are not reversing it. There is a need
   for online presence to be focused on more targeted segments/niches of
   circulation such as ``hyper-local{''} news. This suggests a much clearer
   consideration must be made by newspapers with a premium price for an
   elite rather than a broad readership.
   Social implications - News organizations now find themselves less
   socially relevant as consumers turn towards the Internet for alternative
   sources of ``news{''}. News media firms are having to rebuild their
   brand identity and market positioning in the online marketplace. Higher
   priced newspapers have been in business longer and have established
   brand recognition for providing elite services. This is vital if they
   are to retain their community influence (as trusted sources of locally
   produced news, analysis and investigative reporting into public
   affairs). Commercial influence is determined by their social influence
   and the demise of newspapers would significantly threaten news
   plurality, democracy and public service journalism at the local
   community level.
   Originality/value - The originality of this work concerns its specific
   focus on the influence of print/online synergy on the rate of
   circulation change. The news media industry is an under-researched area
   of Internet scholarship. The study is significant on two counts: first,
   it estimates cross-media synergies based on print and online interaction
   at an aggregated level; and second, it identifies different combinations
   of cross-media exposure over individual media effects. It combines both
   print and online measures of circulation. Of most importance, the study
   is able to show that synergy is complementary and has had a positive
   effect on log circulation change by reducing it by a smaller number.}},

Abstract = {{The novel multibeam ScanSAR takes advantage of the displaced phase
   center multiple azimuth beam (DPCMAB) imaging scheme and intra-pulse
   beam steering in elevation in ScanSAR to achieve the high-resolution
   ultra-wide-swath imaging capacity. This letter proposes an innovative
   two-dimensional (2D) digital beamforming (DBF) space-time preprocessing
   approach for multibeam ScanSAR. According to echo proprieties of such
   imaging scheme, both azimuth ambiguity and range ambiguity problems
   should be resolve before a conventional ScanSAR imaging processor. After
   range compressing in each receive channel, a 2D DBF processor is carried
   out in the range-Doppler domain. The azimuth DBF operation is adopted to
   resolve the azimuth nonuniform sampling problem in multichannel SAR
   systems, while the DBF preprocessing in elevation is carried out to
   separate echoes from different subswaths corresponding to different
   sub-pulses. Imaging results on simulated distributed targets validate
   the proposed 2D DBF preprocessing approach.}},

Abstract = {{In the mid-twentieth century, researches began developing digital
   technology. Digital format, simply stated, is the recording of
   information in a binary code of combinations of digits 0 and 1 {[}1].
   Digital technology enables immense amounts of information to be
   compressed and stored {[}2]. The advent of digital technology has
   encouraged many innovations in the computer industry, medical field,
   science and engineering, and other scientific fields. One of the most
   fascinating innovations of the last century was the development of
   digital three-dimensional (3D) imaging; some of which include images of
   the human body (MRIs, CAT-scans) and 3D digital cinematography.
   Similarly, but at slower pace, manufacturers of nondestructive testing
   equipment have also began to develop 3D imaging technology. Commercially
   available equipment to perform ground-penetrating radar, scanning
   impact-echo, and ultrasonic pulse velocity are already integrated with
   powerful software algorithms to produce two-dimensional (2D) or
   three-dimensional (3D) display of the test results.
   This paper describes the basic features of the ultrasonic test equipment
   developed in the early 2000s, commercially known as Mira and Eyecon.
   These two instruments utilize a patented array of dry point contact
   (DPC) shear wave transducers to produce 2D and 3D tomographic images of
   the reflected waves. This new technology is allowing engineers to obtain
   in situ images of test results to understand the real time state of the
   structure under consideration. This paper also discusses an introduction
   to shear waves (S-waves), a brief description of the DPC transducers,
   the image reconstruction method, and synthetic aperture focusing
   technique (SAFT). Finally, several case studies involving laboratory and
   field applications on different kinds of structures and materials are
   presented. The conclusion section offers a summary of the main features
   and limitations of the Mira and Eyecon systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{If the 1990s was all about the information superhighway and the network
   society, then the first 10 years of the 21st century is perhaps best
   described as the decade of data. Actors in different enterprises worked
   feverishly to develop innovative database and data mining technologies
   for institutional goals such as marketing, social networking, and
   scientific discovery. These researchers and data entrepreneurs follow an
   emerging belief that gathering and mining massive amounts of digital
   data will give objective insight into human relations and provide
   authentic representations for decision-making. On the surface, the
   technologies used to mine big data have the appearance of value-free and
   neutral inquiry. However, as information entrepreneurs use database and
   data mining technologies to purposively organize the social world, this
   seeming neutrality obfuscates domain assumptions and leaves cultural
   values and practices of power unexamined. We investigate the role of
   communication and social shaping of database and data mining
   technologies in the institutional context of genome science to
   understand how various stakeholders (scientists, policy makers, social
   scientists, and advocates) articulate racialized meanings with
   biological, physical, and big data. We found a rise in the use of racial
   discourse that suggests race has a genetic foundation.}},

Abstract = {{Building cities from scratch has continued unabated since the latter
   half of the twentieth century despite some of these planned cities
   achieving global infamy for their failures. These endeavors are, in
   part, due to a persistent belief by governments that newly constructed
   cities can set their nations on a fast path to the future. Today,
   challenges posed both by global climate change and increased
   urbanization have widened this platform from projects almost exclusively
   of developing nations to include those in the developed world. Today we
   talk of the eco-city, a local solution to a global crisis. If completion
   is successfully fast-tracked, the resultant eco-city will position its
   respective nation at the forefront of innovation in what is effectively
   a global race: the resultant city can be exported as a model both
   locally and globally. In this regard, the envisioning and building of
   Songdo in South Korea may not be unique. Songdo is a city underway on
   flat land created from wetland reclamation. As part of the Incheon Free
   Economic Zone (IFEZ), Songdo's development has benefited from
   opportunistic circumstances that has led to its pursuit of becoming a
   Ubiquitous Eco-City. The green infrastructure of the new city is to be
   enhanced by the provision of extra services that combine information and
   communication technologies as well as digital networks to ideally create
   harmony among the environment, society, and technology. Songdo, as
   planned, will position South Korea among a group of leading nations, and
   possibly at the forefront of new city development, potentially producing
   a model for export.}},

Abstract = {{Geographical Analysis (GA), in cooperation with the Wiley-Blackwell
   publishing business, undertook a project to complete the digitizing of
   all back issues of the journal and make those for the period 1969-2001
   free to the academic community; the volumes for 20022005 already were,
   and continue to be, free. This article commemorates the completion of
   this event late in 2010, drawing upon this new resource to highlight
   important contributions made through the journal to the geography and
   spatial sciences community. Besides summarizing publication trends for
   the journal, in the tradition of Fenneman's Venn diagram
   conceptualization of overlaps between geography and its cognate
   disciplines, this article highlights prominent articles published in the
   journal that contributed to the four themes of urban and economic
   geography, transportation geography, spatial statistics, and geographic
   information science.}},

Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION: Is the ovarian reserve in a woman at a given age
   associated with her mother's age at menopause?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: We demonstrated a significant, positive association
   between age at maternal menopause and serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)
   levels and antral follicle count (AFC) in daughters. The rate of decline
   in serum-AMH level and AFC is also associated with age at maternal
   menopause.
   WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The association between
   menopausal age in mothers and daughters has been established through
   several epidemiological studies. This paper shows that early maternal
   menopause is related to an advanced depletion of the ovarian reserve and
   that late maternal menopause is related to a delayed depletion.
   STUDY DESIGN AND SIZE: Cross-sectional data were obtained from a
   prospective cohort study of 863 women. The study comprised 527
   participants from this prospective cohort whose mothers' age at natural
   menopause was known.
   PARTICIPANTS, SETTING AND METHODS: Participants were recruited from
   female health care workers aged 20-40 years employed at Copenhagen
   University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, and were enrolled in the study
   between September 2008 and February 2010. The response rate was 52.1\%.
   Endocrine and ovarian parameters related to reproductive ageing (AMH and
   AFC) were assessed by serum AMH analyses and transvaginal ovarian
   sonography on cycle Day 2-5. Data on reproductive history, including age
   at natural maternal menopause, were obtained through an internet-based
   questionnaire. We used an analysis of covariance model with serum-AMH
   and AFC as outcomes, age as the quantitative predictor and onset of
   maternal menopause as the categorical predictor, with further
   adjustments for BMI, use of oral contraceptives, participants' smoking
   habits and prenatal smoking exposure.
   MAIN FINDINGS: We found a significant effect of age at maternal
   menopause on both serum AMH levels (P<0.001) and AFC (P = 0.005). Median
   serum-AMH concentration declined by 8.6\% per year {[}95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 6.4-10.8\%, P < 0.001] in the group with early maternal
   menopausal age (<= 45 years), by 6.8\% per year (95\% CI: 5.0-8.6\%, P <
   0.001) in the group with normal maternal menopausal age (46-54 years)
   and by 4.2\% per year (95\% CI: 2.0-6.4\%, P < 0.001) in the group with
   late maternal menopausal age (>= 55 years). Median AFC declined by 5.8\%
   per year (95\% CI: 4.0-7.5\%, P < 0.001) in the group with early
   maternal menopausal age (<= 45 years), by 4.7\% per year (95\% CI:
   3.3-6.1\%, P < 0.001) in the group with normal maternal menopausal age
   (46-54 years) and by 3.2\% per year (95\% CI: 1.4-4.9\%, P < 0.001) in
   the group with late maternal age (>= 55 years) at menopause.
   BIAS, LIMITATIONS AND GENERALIZABILITY: Information on `age at maternal
   menopause' was obtained retrospectively and may be prone to recall bias
   and digit preference. The study population consisted of health care
   workers, which implies a potential selection bias. Finally, the
   cross-sectional nature of the data limits the generalizability.
   STUDY FUNDING/POTENTIAL COMPETING INTERESTS: This study was co-financed
   by PhD scholarships where funding was covered by the Danish Agency for
   Science, Technology and Innovation, Copenhagen Graduate School of Health
   Science (CGSHS) and the Fertility Clinic at Copenhagen University
   Hospital, Rigshopitalet. No competing interests are declared.}},

   of technology attributes interpreted by four regional policy approaches.
   An exploratory conceptual model is established, based on diffusion of
   innovations theory and prior digital divide research. Regression
   findings indicate the most significant determinant of technology
   availability and utilization is export commodities value. This is
   followed by published books, tertiary employment, non-state-owned
   employment, and innovation funds of enterprises. The conceptual model is
   discussed in light of these findings and suggestions are offered for

Abstract = {{Watershed models have been widely used to estimate soil erosion and
   evaluate the effectiveness of conservation practices at different
   temporal and spatial scales; however, little progress has been made in
   applying these theoretical model results to the practical. challenge of
   allocating conservation practice funding to meet specific soil loss
   objectives. Black Kettle Creek subwatershed (7,809 ha {[}19,295 ad]) of
   Little Arkansas River Watershed (360,000 ha {[}889,579 ac]) in south
   central Kansas was the focus of an innovative project to target
   conservation practice funding and pay directly for modeled sediment
   reduction. Detailed data (10 m {[}33 ft] digital elevation model
   topography, Soil Survey Geographic database soils, and a manually
   developed land use/land cover layer) were input into the Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool model, and the calibrated model was used to quantify
   soil erosion for each field. Effectiveness of locally relevant best
   management practices (BMPs) was simulated for each field. The simulated
   field-scale effectiveness for implemented BMPs ranged from 9\% to 83\%
   for single BMPs and 67\% to 100\% for selected combinations of BMPs. An
   in-field signup sheet was developed with field-specific sediment
   loss-based payments calculated for each BMP option. BMP implementation
   was 16.7\% of cropland area prior (preinstalled BMPs) to the project,
   and 30.6\% of cropland area (postinstalled BMPs) was added due to
   project-funded implementation. Postinstalled BMP implementation (47.3\%
   of cropland) resulted in 35.8\% sediment yield reduction compared to the
   no-BMPs scenario and 21.9\% reduction compared to preinstalled BMP
   conditions, which was better than initially projected, for this project.
   Inclusion of nontargeted fields and less-than-optimal BMPs had no
   influence on achieving soil loss objectives because payments were based
   on implemented soil loss rather than implemented area. Targeting of
   conservation practices based on payments scaled directly by project
   outcome (in this case, dollars per ton of sediment reduction) using a
   modeling approach allowed flexibility for both adopters (farmers) and
   funders (project staff) while assuring the project objective (i.e.,
   sediment reduction) was met.}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly believed that piracy of information goods leads to lower
   profits, which translate to lower incentives to invest in innovation and
   eventually to lower-quality products. Manufacturers, policy makers, and
   researchers all claim that inadequate piracy enforcement efforts
   translate to lower investments in product development. However, we find
   many practical examples that contradict this claim. Therefore, to
   examine this claim more carefully, we develop a rigorous economic model
   of the manufacturer's quality decision problem in the presence of
   piracy. We consider a monopolist who does not have any marginal costs
   but has a product development cost quadratic in the quality level
   produced. The monopolist faces a consumer market heterogeneous in its
   preference for quality and offers a quality level that maximizes its
   profit. We also allow for the possibility that the manufacturer may use
   versioning to counter piracy. We unexpectedly find that in certain
   situations, lower piracy enforcement increases the monopolist's
   incentive to invest in quality. We explain the reasons and welfare
   implications of our findings.}},

   related certification programs (NSSB Recognizes First IT Certification
   Program 2002). The Internet and Computing Core Certification (IC3A (R))
   certification program is designed for individuals to develop digital
   literacy skills, including fundamental computer and Internet use. The
   particular interest of the study is to explore the relative
   contributions of the Certification Recognition Program (CRP) and
   associated autonomy of participation and achieved literacy for internet
   computing \& technology (ICT), as well as the interactive influences of
   the degree programs and grade levels. Five hundred and ninety six male
   undergraduates majoring in IT were invited to participate in the
   Certification Recognition Program for a calendar year. The certification
   recognition program covers a set of three standardized tests based on
   the IC3A (R) by Certiport(TM). The study found ICT literacy is
   predicated by the students' autonomy of participation (AP) in the
   Certification Recognition Program (CRP), and SP was related to the grade
   level (GL) and the enrolled degree program (DP), indirectly affecting
   ICT literacy as a result of the transiting effect of AP.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of digital anatomy teaching software packages
   challenges anatomy educators on how to best integrate these tools for
   teaching and learning. Realistically, there exists a complex interplay
   of design, implementation, politics, and learning needs in the
   development and integration of software for education, each of which may
   be further amplified by the somewhat siloed roles of programmers,
   faculty, and students. LINDSAY Presenter is newly designed software that
   permits faculty and students to model and manipulate three-dimensional
   anatomy presentations and images, while including embedded quizzes,
   links, and text-based content. A validated tool measuring impact across
   pedagogy, resources, interactivity, freedom, granularity, and factors
   outside the immediate learning event was used in conjunction with
   observation, field notes, and focus groups to critically examine the
   impact of attitudes and perceptions of all stakeholders in the early
   implementation of LINDSAY Presenter before and after a three-week trial
   period with the software. Results demonstrate that external, personal
   media usage, along with students' awareness of the need to apply anatomy
   to clinical professional situations drove expectations of LINDSAY
   Presenter. A focus on the software over learning, which can be expected
   during initial orientation, surprisingly remained after three weeks of
   use. The time-intensive investment required to create learning content
   is a detractor from user-generated content and may reflect the

Abstract = {{In 2011, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker introduced a budget repair bill
   that removed the rights of public sector unions to collectively bargain
   and inspired mass protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol and beyond.
   This article provides a first-hand account of these struggles from the
   perspective of online activists who designed Defend Wisconsin.org, a
   digital organizing tool used widely during the protests. Although only
   one of several such sites, Defend Wisconsin. org was essential for
   organizing graduate students in the Teaching Assistants' Association, a
   union that played a critical role in grassroots mobilizations. Squire
   and Gaydos detail the context for Defend Wisconsin's design, launching,
   and evolution, with particular emphasis on its role in the broader
   ecology of online communities, activists, and resources. They situate
   this effort in a framework of nonviolent resistance and the broader
   peace movement highlighted by Ivan Marovic, a Serbian organizer who
   visited Madison during the protests. Squire and Gaydos conclude by
   contrasting the protests that occurred (particularly online), with the
   characteristics of broader social movements, suggesting lessons that
   grassroots organizers might learn from Wisconsin and revealing where
   there may be digital infrastructure for future organizers to leverage in
   their work.}},

   help business leaders and corporations recognize the crucial role of
   these societal-changing technologies that link people to information in
   the digital age. This study explored the effect of technology on
   organizational learning from the perspective of connectivism. Practices
   of connectivism studied include social software technologies and
   knowledge management practices. Quantitative survey questionnaires were
   sent to 301 companies in the computer industry across Taiwan, resulting
   in 80 valid responses. Hierarchical regression was used to test study
   hypotheses. Hypotheses on the direct effects among innovative corporate
   culture, practices of connectivism and organizational learning were
   supported. Additionally, companies that were younger or in more remote
   locations were found to have higher motivation to innovate, learn and
   adopt new technologies formally.}},

Abstract = {{Service engineering is concerned with applying engineering methods to
   make and scale diverse types of service systems, which range from
   transportation and finance to health care and government. What makes
   modern service engineering uniquely challenging is the need not only to
   consider the technical side of these system designs but also to focus on
   how these systems engage, relate to, and are perceived to contribute to
   the self-actualization goals of their all-too-human cocreators of value.
   Service systems must have a wide-ranging human side. In this article, we
   propose a framework to scope and better define the human side of modern
   service systems. We then explore how to impact the cocreation of value
   in modern service systems, characterized by their digital,
   interconnected, dynamic, and human-intensive nature. In conclusion, we
   relate the other articles in this special issue to this modern service
   system framework, as well as suggesting future research directions. (c)

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have proposed and implemented various innovative
   designs of mobile learning practices, and several pedagogical
   affordances of mobile technologies in different subject domains have
   also been suggested. This study proposes a notion for helping
   instructors design an innovative mobile learning practice in their
   subject domain. The proposed design notion, interwoven learning
   interactions, means that the mobile technologies unobtrusively record
   specific type of social interactions among learners as digital
   information, and the digital information is synthesized with the rules
   and principles of subject content to represent the instructional
   information. When social interaction among peers enables their
   stimulation and exploration of subject content as well as display of
   students' thoughts and reasoning, learning is then constructed on the
   realms of both physical and social experiences linked with the abstract
   learning content. To illustrate the proposed notion, a sample design is
   provided and evaluated. The pilot studies and evaluation results
   illustrate a clearer picture of the design guidelines and offer
   supporting evidences of the claimed learning benefits. Implications are
   provided to shed light on this innovative mobile learning design. (C)

Abstract = {{Colorado State University Libraries (CSUL) purchased the digitized
   United States Congressional Serial Set, 1817-1994 and American State
   Papers (1789-1838) from the Readex Division of NewsBank, Inc. and, once
   funds and records were available, the accompanying MARC records. The
   breadth of information found in the Serial Set is described, along with
   the difficulties in using the print version (incorporated in the
   literature review, which includes citations of announcements of the
   digital collections and reviews of the software). The digital version of
   the Serial Set has its advantages, but there are additional rewards
   (much greater discovery opportunities) when items in the digital
   collection are directly accessible from the library catalog. The
   purchased MARC records, while overall excellent, had problems that
   needed to be corrected before they were loaded into CSUL's Innovative
   Interfaces library catalog. Patron access impact was used as a criterion
   when determining which of the records would be fixed before loading.
   High impact problems were identified and solutions derived for: multiple
   245 (title) fields; 245 s indicator zero with titles beginning with a,
   an, or the; dollar sign used in text; fixed field date; languages;
   subject headings; creating proxy URLs; classification numbers; and
   author authority control (e.g. corporate entries and presidential entry
   errors). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The article describes the implementation of low pass Buttherworth
   digital filter in Self-Excited Acoustical System for measurement of
   stress changes in mechanical constructions and rock masses. The
   Self-excited Acoustical System (SAS) is a kind of a self-oscillating
   system, which uses the auto-resonance phenomena for measurement of
   construction stress changes. The essence of the SAS system is to use a
   vibration exciter and vibration receiver placed at a distance with a
   positive feedback, which causes the excitation of the system. Stress
   changes manifest themselves in small but detectable variations of
   frequency. This phenomenon can be used to indirectly measure stress
   changes in the material. One of the main problem of this innovating
   system is quality of the measured noised signals, which is difficult to
   interpret. To enhance the self-excited system performance the
   preliminary signal filtrating is introduced.}},

Abstract = {{This EMRP (European Metrology Research Programme) project, MetroFission,
   has been looking at solving metrological problems related to a new
   generation of nuclear power plants. The proposed Generation IV power
   plants are designed to run safely, make efficient use of natural
   resources, minimize the waste and maintain proliferation resistance. In
   order to reach these goals, the reactor operation involves higher
   temperatures, high-energy neutron fluence, different types of fuel where
   the minor actinides are included etc. In this multidisciplinary project,
   which has 12 partners in 10 countries, the work has focused on improved
   temperature measurements, investigation of thermal properties of
   advanced materials, determination of new and relevant nuclear data and
   development of measurement techniques for radionuclides suitable for
   Generation IV power plants.
   The improved temperature measurement for nuclear power plant
   applications includes the development of a new Fe-C fixed point. Robust,
   repeatable and versatile cells have been constructed and compared with
   success among the project participants and their melting temperatures
   have been determined. Furthermore, the methodology of self-validating
   thermocouples has proven efficient at several fixed point temperatures
   (Au, Cu, Co-C, Fe-C) using different designs. A practical acoustic
   thermometer has been tested at high temperature (1000 degrees C) with
   success thanks to the use of innovative signal processing methods. Mo/Nb
   thermocouples have been obtained with different sheath materials and
   tested with the aim to achieve for the first time a reference function
   determined with the best possible uncertainties.
   Following reviews of designs and technology proposed for fourth
   generation nuclear plants effort within this project, with regards to
   thermal properties of advanced materials for nuclear design, has
   concentrated on provision of thermodynamic data support the development
   of the sodium cooled fast reactor (ASTRID).
   Data has been critically assessed to represent the potential interaction
   between the Na coolant and the nuclear fuel taken to be based on (U,
   Pu)O-2 but incorporating minor actinides such as Np and Am. Data for the
   fission products and containment materials have also been reviewed and
   new data assessed to represent the interaction between them and the Na
   coolant, in order to permit calculation of phase and chemical equilibria
   for severe accident scenarios. The aim is to publish the data developed
   during this project within a revised version of ``Thermochemical data
   for reactor materials and fission products{''}, last published in 1990.
   Reference metrological facilities and methods have been developed or
   improved for the measurements of normal spectral emissivity and specific
   heat up to 1500 degrees C, and thermal diffusivity up to 2000 degrees C.
   The following actions were notably performed:
   Development of two complementary facilities based on different
   metrological approaches (calorimetric and optical methods) by PTB and
   LNE for the measurement of emissivity of solid materials at high
   temperature.
   Modification of the LNE diffusivimeter with the development and
   integration of a specific inductive furnace, and the adaptation of the
   associated IR detection systems.
   These facilities have now been used for the measurement of
   thermophysical properties of some materials (Ni, MgO and ZrO2), because
   they have thermal properties similar to those encountered in Generation
   IV reactors.
   Regarding neutron cross sections, the current nuclear databases
   concentrate on thermal energies, but new fast reactor designs will
   involve materials exposed to higher energy neutron fields. Advantage has
   been taken of National Measurement Institutes experience in neutron
   fluence measurements to improve high-energy cross-section measurements.
   A secondary fluence standard has been established and used to determine
   the cross sections of actual interest improving nuclear data standards
   in the form of reduced measurement uncertainties.
   The heavier actinides and their decay products have a role in the future
   development and adoption of nuclear power plants in whose fuels they
   will be present in controlled amounts. A list of specific needs for
   improved actinide decay data has recently been outlined in a review by
   the IAEA. Responding to those needs, an objective of the MetroFission
   project was to measure the alphaparticle emission probabilities of 238U
   with certified isotopic composition. The nuclear data from alpha
   spectrometry of 238U sources has been successful, obtaining data that
   will be provided to the international community and that further lower
   the uncertainties of the nuclear data. The quality of the alpha spectrum
   measurement, in terms of energy resolution and peak tailing of the 238U
   alpha spectra, was significantly better than in any previous
   measurement.
   Fission fragments containing more beta-decay isotopes will result from
   proposed fast reactors. Cryogenic detectors have been developed aimed at
   improving the measurement of beta spectra and verifying theoretical
   models. A beta spectrum shape of Ni-63 has successfully been obtained.
   Improvements have been made in the source components and in the source
   production method in order to lower uncertainties. The exchange effect
   has been implemented in the calculation of theoretical beta spectra. The
   measurement of the beta spectrum of (6)3Ni has for the first time
   confirmed the exchange effect at very low energy. The energy threshold
   of the metallic magnetic calorimeter is 180 eV. At this energy, the
   enhancement of the beta emission due to the exchange effect is larger
   than 20 \%.
   Nuclear power plants would benefit from on-site activity measurements of
   radionuclides including low-energy beta emitters that are abundant but
   can prove difficult to assay. Within this project, a primary liquid
   scintillation coincidence counting method called Triple to Double
   Coincidence Ratio (TDCR) has been modified for this purpose. Five
   partners have built miniature TDCR systems, miniaturising the
   instrument's detection chamber by using newer, smaller, more efficient
   photomultiplier tubes. The system also includes replacing the analogue
   electronic modules with digital acquisition systems and signal
   processing in order to significantly improve digital coincidence
   counting (DCC).}},

Abstract = {{High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging is rapidly emerging as an innovative
   approach for digitally representing and reproducing real scenes with a
   wide range of intensity levels, which can be hardly managed by current
   standard methods for image capture and display. In order to protect the
   intellectual property of HDR images, a novel blind multi-bit
   watermarking method exploiting both their peculiar characteristics and
   the properties of the Radon-Discrete Cosine Transform (RDCT) for the
   embedding process, is here proposed. The performed experimental tests
   demonstrate the possibility of marking HDR images without significantly
   altering their perceptual characteristics, while guaranteeing the
   recovery of the embedded information even from Low Dynamic Range (LDR)
   images obtained through the application of different tone-mapping
   operators (TMOs).}},

Abstract = {{Digital audio equalization is used to enhance the listening experience
   introducing corrections in the auditory frequency response. The
   equalizer performance depends on its implementation which includes
   optimal filters with sharp transition bandwidth development and a low
   computational complexity. Starting from a previous FIR implementation
   based on multirate systems and filterbanks theory, an optimized digital
   audio equalizer is derived. The proposed approach employs an
   approximation of the FIR structure using IIR filters, in order to
   improve the filterbanks structure developed to avoid interferences
   between adjacent bands. The effectiveness of the optimized
   implementation is shown comparing it with the previous approaches of the
   state of the art. The experimental results confirms that the presented
   solution has several advantages increasing the equalization performance
   in terms of low computational complexity, low delay, and uniform
   frequency response.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile health (mHealth) leverages the power and ubiquity of mobile and
   cloud technologies to support patients and clinicians in monitoring and
   understanding symptoms, side effects and treatment outside the clinical
   setting; thereby closing the feedback loops of self-care, clinical-care,
   and personal-evidence-creation. However, to realize this promise, we
   must develop new data capture, processing and modeling techniques to
   convert the digital exhaust emitted by mobile phone use into behavioral
   biomarkers. This calls for a modular layered sensemaking framework in
   which low level state classifications of raw data (e.g., estimated
   activity states such as sitting, walking, driving from continuous
   accelerometer and location traces), are used to derive mid-level
   semantic features (e.g., total number of ambulatory minutes, number of
   hours spent out of house), that can then be mapped to particular
   behavioral biomarkers for specific diseases (e.g., chronic pain, GI
   disfunction, MS, fatigue, depression, etc). The techniques needed to
   derive these markers will range from simple functions to machine
   learning classifiers, and will need to fuse diverse data types, but all
   will need to cope with noisy, erratic data sources. We are working to
   build an open architecture and community to speed the rate and
   robustness of innovation in this space, both academic and commercial
   (http://openmhealth.org).}},

   software from National Instruments. Qualitative and quantitative
   assessment data were collected at the end of each month-long course at
   National University. Data from multiple electric circuits classes of
   on-line students show a 13-28\% increase in students' satisfaction with

Abstract = {{The aim of this submission is to show a sequence of activities
   integrating technology in a new approach to calculus taking place at the
   first mathematics course for engineer students at Tecnologico de
   Monterrey, Mexico. Different specialized software is used to focus the
   learning process on a global image including derivative and
   antiderivative. The first scenario of motion over a straight line offers
   the platform to deal with these notions related to the meaning of
   position (function/antiderivative) and velocity (derivative). From
   there, the transference to other real context scenarios is provided. The
   sequence favors the development of this approach since it deals
   simultaneously with both calculus notions. In classroom, technology is a
   mediator to identify, at an early stage of the course, important
   calculus' results (theorems) about the relationship between function and
   derivative. The sequence guides a symbolization process that rests in
   signs that students show through body gestures and visual images. The
   learning goal is to interpret the graph of a function in terms of its
   derivative graph; this way, process of visualizing the antiderivative is
   becoming an important fact at the first contact with calculus, where the
   Fundamental Theorem of calculus takes a special place as background
   knowledge throughout the course.}},

Abstract = {{The limited resources in the traditional labs have restricted the
   effective and innovative circuit design projects from freshmen Circuits
   1 class to Capstone ideas. The limited number of measuring and
   signal-generating instruments makes it difficult for students to engage
   in these projects when they need to share these instruments or schedule
   to use them at a specific time. Furthermore, it is a challenge for
   students to learn how to use various instruments including power
   supplies, multi-meters, oscilloscopes, and function-generators if not
   used in conjunction with each other. Likewise, it is also highly
   unlikely that students will acquire all of this rather expensive
   equipment and design a lab environment at their residence. Under such
   constraints, students cannot gain the necessary hands-on experience.
   Moreover, students have a tendency to play a minimal role in
   group-assigned projects, leading to minimal outcomes, which further
   weaken their accountability and curiosity. This will seriously reduce
   the students' aptitude for circuit designs and weaken a vast majority of
   other necessary engineering and technology based skills. A new approach,
   in which each student owns a circuit design station, is possible with a
   new compact device, which has incorporated many of these devices into
   one unit. Students can conduct many circuit designs spontaneously using
   their own remote lab. They can assemble and test various analog,
   digital, or mixed signal circuits including those from classroom
   textbooks. This paper will show that students can now set up a
   convenient remote laboratory to design and test low-power circuits. This
   lab environment is the newly launched Analog Discovery from Digilent.
   Analog Discovery is a low cost and portable test and measurement device,
   which provides various instruments including two oscilloscope probes,
   two arbitrary waveform generator, two power supplies, a voltmeter, a
   logic analyzer, and a pattern generator in a single module. This unit
   communicates with the WaveForms software and receives power from a
   standard USB port. This paper will introduce the course outline and
   present a very simple lab assignment, which students would typically
   test during the first few days of an introductory class. This example
   demonstrates the flexibility and ease-of-use while designing or testing

Abstract = {{Advances in web services and open network interfaces enable development
   of new user-oriented applications in different areas of digital life.
   Among them, digital entertainment is one of fastest growing networked
   application domains. Technologies like CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)
   and HTTP streaming opened the way for new models of TV and video
   consumption over the Internet. Thanks to emergence of new networking
   technologies and cooperation paradigms the distinction between
   traditional TV and the Web is slowly blurring, creating new category of
   TV entertainment which is more interactive, delivered over multiple
   screens and inviting users to participate and collaborate.
   This paper presents research on selected social and interactive TV
   services, focusing on innovations related with incorporation of network
   interfaces and web protocols. Two use-case scenarios are investigated:
   one of them explores telco 2.0 interfaces for interactive videos, and
   the other allows users for social exchanges while watching live sports
   events. The evaluation results by qualitative user study are presented
   for the second use-case. A technical architecture is introduced, focused
   on seamless integration into a typical WebTV platform of telco operator.
   As important contribution of the paper, some new emerging network
   protocols and features (like telco 2.0, WebRTC, Web Sockets, HTML5
   video) are evaluated as potential enabling technologies for future
   social and interactive TV.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of Facebook use among students and teachers has
   created a new learning culture by providing innovative ways for teachers
   to enable learners to engage actively in different learning activities.
   This paper investigates the potential use of Facebook, to support
   faculty in implementing a social constructivist approach to facilitate
   student-centred learning. To alleviate problems arising from poor
   student engagement in large classes, 240 students from An-Najah National
   University, Palestine, enrolled in four sections of an undergraduate
   Educational Technology course, were encouraged to participate in a
   number of formative activities through Facebook. The contributions of
   learners during the semester were analyzed. Students were also asked to
   evaluate their experience through a questionnaire. The results show that
   Facebook's technological affordances provide valuable support for
   pedagogical change. Facebook is an engaging and enjoyable tool for
   digital native learners to be active participants in constructing their
   knowledge through social interaction. Despite being heavily immersed in
   Facebook, students are not familiar to use this technology in their
   learning. Therefore, to take full advantages of this technology,
   academics should recognize the inherent value of Facebook and rethink
   its deployment in ways that foster student engagement, interaction and
   collaboration in a more constructivist and effective learning
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{With the growth of web enabled services and e-commerce, tremendous
   amount of information is now readily available on the Internet. A large
   proportion of this is classified information, which has to be protected
   against unauthorized access. Password or PIN can be used in conjunction
   with digital signature, for verification of the identity of users.
   This paper proposes a dynamic handwritten signature verification based
   access control system that can be employed in the legal, banking and
   commercial domains for designing secure information retrieval systems.
   The dynamic handwritten signature in this system is captured by using a
   digital tablet or PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) with contact
   sensitive acquisition system. After preprocessing, the signature data is
   compared with the templates of authorized signatures by employing an
   innovative neuro-fuzzy pattern recognition system based on sensing the
   pressure variable and total time required for executing the signature
   for uniquely identifying the potential user. The error in matching is
   used to arrive at the decision regarding permission or denial of access
   to the classified document.
   The neuro-fuzzy technique applied in the dynamic signature system is
   based on evolving fuzzy neural network. This technique has been tested
   on signatures drawn from signature verification competition database
   obtained from the internet. Encouraging results show that this technique
   is a good candidate for the development of practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technology is transforming business in many sectors, including
   restaurant systems and service processes. Customers may recognize the
   replacement of paper-based menus with digital ones as a first step of
   this process. Intelligent restaurant systems are an interesting
   application area for merging and extension of cognitive capabilities
   with both intra-cognitive and inter-cognitive communication. An
   intelligent restaurant system Smartmenu, developed by Centria and
   Delitaz Ltd., is an example of innovation which is based on merging and
   extending of cognitive capabilities. These kinds of systems may change
   the everyday life in restaurants in the future. The system covers the
   whole order process of a restaurant including the applications of the
   customer, the waiter, the kitchen and the cashier. The first pilot
   systems were recently tested in several restaurants in Finland. Piloting
   included also questionnaires and interviews analyzed by usability
   experts. In the future, Smartmenu may be extended to include also
   service robots in the system. The first demonstrations of using service
   robot in a restaurant environment were already carried out.}},

Abstract = {{There is not always a clear difference in cognition between whir and
   noise, mood of music or tone in the era of modern music. In the
   cognizance of being as individuals there is a problem of visual memory
   in relation to the sound; for example: clatter of horses or gurgling
   brook, or sigh that can be interpreted as a beginning of the pain, sex
   or fatigue, etc. This paper presents a novel approach to using software
   sources that are active conductors in acceptance of many cognitive
   skills, and various software programs that play important role in
   innovative music creation, musical compositions and sound. All music
   refines and links natural and artificial forms, as per requirement,
   analogically and digitally, so that modern cognition in the era of IT
   actually just links cognitive knowledge that we know from before. The
   connection between software technology and cognition is addressed, and
   the importance of designing a new program which will help cognition
   improvement and development.}},

Abstract = {{The University of Western Sydney (UWS) draws on a diverse population of
   students, many of whom come from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. In
   a bid to improve digital access for students in an increasingly blended
   learning environment, UWS distributed over 11,000 iPads to first year
   students and academic staff at the start of 2013. The School of Medicine
   at UWS implemented several different strategies to see which would best
   foster student engagement and effective iPad use:
   Student centred collaborative learning
   Student creation of digital content
   Interactive exercises during lectures, and
   A student-centric approach to course administration
   As the start of the year coincides with the start of first semester in
   Australia, these initiatives were introduced as soon as the students
   commenced study in medicine. Action based research based on observation
   of students' behaviour and student surveys was used to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the strategies. It is anticipated that these
   innovations offer cumulative benefits for student satisfaction beyond
   the advantage of each individual strategy. For example, providing
   regular updates of course information encourages students to retain
   their device at all times, which ensures widespread iPad availability
   for interactive exercises in lectures and small-group collaborative
   learning. This paper discusses the implementation of these strategies
   and early results from student feedback.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid proliferation of the concept of New Media and the attendant
   frequently controversial interpretations and research results motivate a
   scholarly overview of the possibilities of implementing the respective
   achievements in the teacher training process. Consequently, several
   issues have to be addressed: why is the respective term New Media
   written differently (it can appear either as a compound word, or as two
   separate words) in the Hungarian language? Why is the ICT term
   frequently substituting the professional vocabulary of instruction
   technology considered inappropriate? In light of the availability of
   such terms as Web 2.0 and community media why do we need the adjective:
   ``New?{''} Hungarian research efforts into the theoretical and
   technological background of education have not yet provided a definite
   answer concerning the role of this fashionable, yet polysemic concept
   carrying several meanings. The present essay aims to outline an approach
   incorporating content arrangement considerations in addition to the
   prevalent technological perspective.
   While the New Media phenomenon has impacted several disciplinary fields
   and due to innovation efforts e-books or tablet machines enjoy a
   gradually increasing educational use, it has not yet fully been
   recognized in the daily routine of the teaching process. Despite the
   relatively limited presence of such equipment in schools the new
   generation of students demand the use of hi-tech electronic devices and
   new media tools they are accustomed to at home in the classroom as well.
   Although the fast proliferation of the concept and the relevant device
   system in educational institutions is far from certain, it is beyond
   doubt that in addition to digital (ICT) competences teachers will be
   required to have additional skills exceeding contemporary computer
   literacy requirements. New Media interpreted as technology mostly
   entails devices and tools facilitating digital, network-based
   connections promoting interactivity and creativity via tablet machines,
   smart phones, smart community TVs in addition to the Internet and the
   Web 2.0 applications.
   Yet, Manovich's view(1) emphasizing the new forms of content arrangement
   especially a data base oriented approach complementing and superseding
   the narrative-oriented perspective is rarely taken into consideration.
   While this theory regarding content as the compilation of unique
   components into a data base could trigger the broadening of scholarly
   perspectives, it is yet to be fully accepted by the professional
   community. Consequently, for Manovich New Media is not seen as new
   devices, or the world of networks and the related communities, but as a
   data base culture operating via Human Computer Interface. Thus the
   concept of New Media cannot solely be interpreted in a technological
   manner as it includes components related to content arrangement.
   Consequently, the primary focus is not on the methodological aspects of
   device application, as the inquiry is concerned with the logic behind
   digital data base oriented content arrangement complementing the
   traditional, linear narrative of the conventional instruction process.
   Thus New Media, as a sort of dramaturgy, can trigger the development of
   new narrative technologies significantly improving the methodological
   arsenal of teachers as the structure of a given lesson is elaborated
   according to a specific organisational principle determining the
   respective steps and phases of the class in other words, the dramaturgy
   of the lesson. Consequently, my presentation focuses on the application
   and methodology of the tangible and network-based aspects of New Media
   along with the exploration of novel forms of content arrangement.}},

Abstract = {{AcessaSP program is one of the biggest digital inclusion program in
   Latin America. It provides Internet access to poor population through
   infocenters located in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. AcessaSP began
   its operation in July 2000 and there are currently 737 infocenters fully
   implemented in 555 municipalities. AcessaSP digital inclusion program
   offers presential activities and a virtual environment dedicated to a
   community of more than 2.5 million registered users assisted by 1,116
   monitors. Besides offering the opportunity to internet access, the
   program also contribute to the social, cultural, economic and digital
   learning development of low income citizens in the State. Since 2003, a
   periodical survey called ``PONLINE{''} is carried out in order to feed a
   database related to the users profile, needs, expectancies, habits and
   attitudes in relation to the program and the use of Internet. It is also
   used as a management tool for monitoring, improving and innovating the
   process.
   An important phenomenon has been observed in AcessaSP environment in the
   last few years: the emergence of mobility. For this study approach,
   mobility issue is considered from two factors: the growth and expansion
   of wireless connections and the broad access to mobile platforms, such
   as smartphones. These two characteristics are facilitating the emergence
   of new learning spaces and timing, which leads to the need of a wider
   and deeper understanding of this challenging scenario in terms of new
   uses and literacies. For these reasons, AcessaSP is investing in a
   strategy named ``Acessa sem Fio{''} (Wireless Acessa), in which wireless
   connections are provided in cities with the program's infocenters.
   Though, there is a lack of systematic information regarding the impact
   of this shift from physical to virtual concept. It is still poorly known
   how mobility can affect the program users' appropriation and interaction
   with Internet. In this sense, this study aims to offer a framework to a
   qualitative researcah to better understand user's habits and attitudes
   regarding wireless connection to Internet. Relevant outcomes are
   expected to be revealed in order to collaborate to a better
   understanding of this new scenario, mainly those ones related with the
   new role of infocenters in AcessaSP communities' life. The framework can
   also provide requirements for designing digital inclusion public
   policies in order to popularize and democratize the World Wide Web with
   wireless connection. This can be the basis of further research on public
   policies for wireless digital inclusion.}},

Abstract = {{This research makes innovative use of technology to enhance students'
   learning experiences in Project Work, by providing interaction through
   technology to make individual and group thinking more visible.
   Technology has evolved significantly, which provides opportunities to
   test new methods of teaching. The idea is to use technology creatively
   to deconstruct and redefine the classroom, in order to enhance learning
   experiences for students and to encourage thinking out of the box.
   The hypothesis is that meaningful virtual instructions, routines or
   systems would improve students' learning experience and cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Digital recruitment is increasingly becoming a popular avenue for
   identifying human subjects for various studies. The process starts with
   an online ad that describes the task and explains expectations. As
   social media has exploded in popularity, efforts are being made to use
   social media to recruit for new career opportunities. Particularly,
   LinkedIn and Twitter have enabled an emerging trend for matching
   individuals with possible opportunities based on their interests. This
   makes finding more relevant jobs easier for both employees and
   employers. There are, however, many unanswered questions about how best
   to do that.
   In this paper, we propose an innovative Twitter-based recruitment system
   for a smoking cessation nicotine patch study. The goals of the paper are
   to (1) provide the system specification and design, (2) propose the
   approach we have taken to solve the problem of digital recruitment, (3)
   present two new algorithms, one for Twitter user ranking and the other
   for digital recruitment using social media, and (4) present the
   promising outcome of the initial version of the system and summarize the
   results. This is the first effort to introduce a practical solution for
   digital recruitment campaigns that is large-scale, inexpensive,
   efficient and reaches out to individuals in real-time as their needs are
   expressed.
   A continuous update on how our system is performing, in real-time, can
   be viewed at https://twitter.com/TobaccoQuit.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of a Regional Platform of Innovation for future tourism,
   we define a model and a decision support system for semantic analysis of
   social networks embedding networks of opinions, aiming at representing
   and understanding territorial uses coming out from digital marks. The
   territorial and touristic observatory we develop behind a digital
   platform is designed to complete usual tools of economic intelligence,
   helping in governance and in the identification of touristic products
   and services of tomorrow, so as to foster the rise of territorial
   economy. In the early stage of the project, the contributions we present
   are (1) a social semantic graph structure, (2) the definition of
   semantic degree centrality, (3) a process and definitions for
   interfacing semantic networks of opinions with social semantic networks
   of uses, and (4) a first use case experimentation. Public deployment is
   planned for 2013 and economical impacts will be measured on next years.}},

Abstract = {{The Content-Centric Networking paradigm aims at improving the Quality of
   Service of the Internet by providing innovative features to better
   handle digital content distribution. A major step towards the success of
   this novel paradigm is to analyze and compare its performance with
   respect to the most popular ways in which content is disseminated in
   today's IP Internet. In this paper we give clear answers to this
   critical issue by proposing a methodology to assess how the innovative
   design of Content-Centric Networking behaves as opposed to the solution
   proposed by Content-Distribution Networks.
   We develop a novel optimization model to study the performance bounds of
   a Content-Centric Network, by addressing the joint object placement and
   routing problem. We further introduce three comparative models that well
   describe 1) a Content-Distribution Network, 2) a traditional IP-based
   network, and 3) a Content-Centric Network whose caches are pre-populated
   with given contents. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the
   first that studies the performance bounds of Content-Centric Networks by
   means of an optimization model.
   Finally, we discuss the numerical results showing the performance bounds
   of this revolutionary paradigm. We discover that: 1) a Content-Centric
   Network with small caches can provide significant performance gains
   compared to a traditional IP-based network; 2) for large amounts of
   caching storage, the benefits of using sophisticated cache replacement
   policies are dramatically reduced and 3) in some scenarios, a
   Content-Distribution Network with few replica servers can perform better
   than a Content-Centric Network, even when the total amount of available
   caching storage is exactly the same.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach in determining the diameter of
   cylindrical object based on the available two triangles formation
   technique. The proposed hardware-software system is useful to be
   implemented on an unmanned aerial vehicle platform in the agriculture
   field for row detection and navigation techniques based on simultaneous
   localization and mapping technique as it offers a lightweight system,
   hassle-free computation and yet a practical and efficient approach. This
   approach is proposed purposely for small-scaled unmanned aerial vehicle
   where substantial devices or equipments is unwelcome due to its enormous
   weight and size. The most efficient way to detect and measure the
   diameter size of the trees in the agriculture field is by applying the
   precise laser range finder as well as combines it with other possible
   sensors such as vision sensors in many approaches before. Unfortunately,
   the available commercial product of a laser range finder is found to be
   expensive, bulky and all the data is acquired through a universal serial
   bus communication protocol which proves to be impractical for on-board
   UAV detection and navigation implementation as computer and robust
   processors is necessitated. Thus, in our innovative research, a
   non-intrusive infrared sensor is used as it offers a narrow beam for
   edge detection of the cylindrical object (treated as the tree). This
   sensor is mounted on a digital servo motor to imitate the rotational
   operation of the available laser range finder in the market. Series of
   experiments are executed on varying diameter of cylindrical objects, and
   the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach are carried out. It is
   found that, this technique is usable in determining the size of the
   cylindrical objects with a minimal and acceptable error as well as the
   outcome is comparable with other approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic 3D extraction of building roofs from remotely sensed data is
   important for many applications including city modeling. This paper
   proposes a new method for automatic 3D roof extraction through an
   effective integration of LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data and
   multispectral orthoimagery. Using the ground height from a DEM (Digital
   Elevation Model), the raw LIDAR points are separated into two groups.
   The first group contains the ground points that are exploited to
   constitute a `ground mask'. The second group contains the non-ground
   points which are segmented using an innovative image line guided
   segmentation technique to extract the roof planes. The image lines
   extracted from the grey-scale version of the orthoimage are classified
   into several classes such as `ground', `tree', `roof edge' and `roof
   ridge' using the ground mask and colour and texture information from the
   orthoimagery. During roof plane extraction the lines from the later two
   classes are used to fit roof planes to the neighbouring non-ground LIDAR
   points. Finally, a new rule-based procedure is applied to remove planes
   constructed on trees. Experimental results show that the proposed method
   successfully removes vegetation and offers high extraction rates.}},

Abstract = {{The demise of mixed-signal and RF circuit design in nanometer CMOS
   technologies was predicted, analyzed and well documented since the
   advent of 65nm technologies. {[}1-3]. Poor device matching, low
   intrinsic device gains, gate leakage, nonideal and poor quality
   passives, and myriad reliability constraints, such as electromigration
   and voltage limitations, have been identified as potential barriers to
   continued mixed-signal and RF embedded design. Not surprisingly, most of
   these problems also significantly impact logic gate and memory design.
   Many design techniques have been proposed to address these issues. The
   most prominent of these, with the declining cost and improving
   performance of logic gates, is the use of digital signal processing as a
   standard practice to correct for nonideal circuit properties such as
   mismatch, distortion and even noise. This practice has led to
   significant innovation on many levels, from the direct calibration of
   active and passive devices {[}4-8], to complete rearchitecting of entire
   systems {[}9-10] to move the analog/digital boundary closer to the

Abstract = {{Modern radar systems, especially those devoted to surveillance and
   defense mission, are able to accomplish different functions, change
   their operating modes and adapt the achievable performance according to
   the conditions and the peculiar environmental features (number and types
   of threats/tracks), in order to provide the optimal capabilities to
   cope/deal with. Those systems are, hence, demanded for high performance
   and high flexibility, allowing to save resources from not primary
   functions to be exploited to boost performances (resolution, search
   volume, detection range, renewal time, track refresh rates and
   initialization, etc..) of other proper functions according to the
   current needs of operation.
   Naturally, the required flexibility has significant impacts on the radar
   systems and involves the design of the overall components/sub-systems of
   the radar chain, and accordingly also the antenna front-end.
   Multi Functional Radars systems essentially exploits Active
   Electronically Scanned Antennas (A-ESA) with a large number of Transmit
   Receive Module (TRM) -from several hundreds to thousands -where phase
   and amplitude control of each TRM excitation enables the steering of the
   beam in the scan domain. A significant improvement of the antenna
   flexibility can be achieved by means of a (full) Digital Beam Forming
   (DBF) scheme, where the output of each TRM is digitized and the
   numerical outputs are properly combined in order to simultaneously
   generate the desired antenna patterns, such as in the case of multiple
   simultaneous beams (at the same reference frequency) covering different
   pointing directions to allowing a faster scan of the surveillance
   volume. More generally, a full level of digitalization at element level
   provides the highest level of degrees of freedom enabling, in principle,
   simultaneous generation of any pattern supported by the antenna array
   aperture, hence providing to the radar system a number of advanced
   spatial processing features such as adaptive digital beam forming,
   adaptive angle estimation, space-time processing against clutter.
   Unfortunately, DBF scheme, when implemented at element level requires a
   significant increase of HW components and of complexity of the radar
   architecture, since the number of receivers and, accordingly the number
   of A/D converters, explodes from few units (analog beam forming) up to
   hundreds or even several thousand (as in performance military radars).
   This leads typically to unacceptable solutions due to the HW costs of
   the overall architecture. In addition, it is also worth noting that the
   highest degree of freedom provided by the full level of digitization may
   turn out to be unnecessary since many practical applications require a
   limited re-configurability, i. e. for instance a side lobe cancellation
   or a beam pointing scan only into an assigned and limited angular
   region. A trade off-solution which introduces a controlled degree of
   flexibility, keeping under control the cost and the complexity of the
   radar HW architecture, is to adopt a DBF layer over-posed to the
   conventional analog beam forming, where the array elements are grouped
   into sub-arrays, whose outputs are combined together by means of analog
   beam forming networks (BFNs) and digitized. Then digital data are
   properly combined by a processing HW to produce the simultaneous desired
   beams. Sub-array architecture allows, indeed, to reduce the number of
   digitizers in the order of 5\%-10\% of the number of elements (e. g.
   40-200 digitisers with a 2000 element array), introducing a proper
   degree of flexibility and spatial re-configurability. Naturally,
   determining the optimal sub-array layout and, thus, the digital sampling
   of the radar antenna outputs (DAR -Digital Array Radar) ensuring an
   adequate sampling to achieve acceptable low sidelobes (for simultaneous
   beams) and beam correction is crucial in order to provide an
   architectural solution satisfying the performance specification while
   keeping the number of digital channel acceptable. Different strategies
   have been proposed in the open literature and explored in real radar
   equipments. This paper focuses on new approaches for clustering very
   large arrays of interest for civil and military applications, taking
   into account HW constraints, costs and weights. In particular the
   proposed tools and algorithms have been adopted to design the S Band and
   X Band innovative radar front-end.}},

   between 2017 and 2019. Essential to the efficient design of the array
   are a single very wide-bandwidth log-periodic antenna and low cost,
   medium range RF over fibre system. This results in a system design that
   can have minimal electronics at the antenna and all the digital
   processing for the entire array in a single, large processing
   ``bunker{''}. This is very cost effective, flexible in configuration and
   easiest operationally for ongoing maintenance. Further, there is the
   opportunity to house other parts of the SKA-low telescope: e.g.
   correlator, master clock, telescope management and post processing
   facilities. The aim is to have individual solar powered antennas to
   minimize interference issues and save infrastructure costs. The
   beamforming will be entirely in the digital domain using devices
   predicted for 2017/8. Considerable flexibility is given by the
   innovative use of high speed commercial data switches, which enables
   selectable station sizes and tuning for specific science experiments.
   The entire system uses technologies that are available or projected in
   the near future.}},

Abstract = {{So far, pulse-triggered flip-flops (pulsed-FFs) are mainly used in
   high-performance digital circuits, thanks to their small data-to-output
   delay. However, they suffer from a poor robustness to local variations
   occurring at ultra-low-voltage (ULV). Thanks to an innovative pulse
   generator, the operability of an energy-efficient pulsed-FF was
   validated at ultra-low operating supply voltage. Measurements of delays
   and correct functionality are performed in 28nm FDSOI technology. Then,
   the effect of back bias voltage, a key point in FDSOI technology, is
   studied and it is shown that our pulsed-FF reaches a minimum operating
   supply voltage of 170mV.}},

Abstract = {{Current practices in government and private offices to register a
   service are time-consuming and prone to fraud. As a consequence,
   government offices are unable to provide high-quality services to
   citizens; while private offices make less productivity and profits from
   their services. This paper presents an innovative registration system
   for Malaysian when applying services at government and private offices.
   Referred to as Secure and Fast Auto Filling Form System (SAFe), the
   proposed system retrieves the customers' information from their MyKad
   and transfers the information to a digital application form. For
   security measures, the fingerprint verification of the authentic
   customers is required before their formation can be retrieved from
   MyKad. The proposed system is developed using the Visual Basic software
   and a commercial smartcard reader. Results of the performance evaluation
   show that SAFe shortens the time to complete the registration securely.
   Therefore, SAFe can improve the service quality and productivity of
   government and private offices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the evolution of the design industry globally in the
   context of Porter's Competitive Advantage of Nations theory, \& its
   migration through resource exploitation, investment, innovation \&
   wealth creation stages. The paper posits a further stage of economic
   development \& reviews design's role at each juncture. Taking industry
   case illustrations across Africa, Asia, Europe \& the US, the paper
   explores innovation, design utility \& value across these differing
   stages, \& identifies discrete design challenges within each scenario
   relating to infrastructure, cost bases, knowledge, strategic value, IP
   \& entrepreneurship. A key element in each study is the recognition of
   emergent client sectors, the diversification of expertise, strategic
   partnerships, routes-to-market, challenges \& evolving business models,
   \& how these relate both to existing theories of design agglomeration \&
   to new drivers exemplified by globalization, long tail economics \& the
   digital economy. The paper culminates in an exploration of design \&
   innovation policy within each specific context, \& examines the
   implications of such policies going forward, particularly on design
   businesses, \& in doing so, proposes a model for evaluating such

Abstract = {{This paper presents and discusses organisational barriers and
   opportunities arising from the dissemination of design led innovation
   within a leading Australian airport corporation. This research is part
   of a greater action research program which aims to integrate design as a
   strategic capability through design led innovation within Australian
   businesses. Findings reveal that there is an opportunity to employ the
   theoretical framework and tools of design led innovation in practice to
   build collaborative idea generation by involving customers and
   stakeholders within the proposal of new to world propositions. The
   iterative gathering of deep customer insights also provided an
   opportunity to leverage a greater understanding of stakeholders and
   customers in strengthening continuing business partnerships through
   co-design. Challenges to the design led approach include resistance to
   the exploratory nature of gathering deep customer insights, the testing
   of long held assumptions and market data, and the disruption of an
   organisational mindset geared toward risk aversion instilled within the
   aviation industry. The implication from these findings is that design
   led innovation can provide the critical platform to allow for a business
   to grow and sustain internal design capabilities necessary to challenge
   prevailing assumptions about how its business model operates to deliver
   value to customers and stakeholders alike. The platform of design led
   innovation also provides an avenue to support a cultural transformation
   towards anticipating future needs necessary for establishing a position
   of leadership within the broader economic environment.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional video cameras have problem with preserving spatial and
   temporal resolution synchronously due to hardware factors such as
   readout and analog-to-digital (AID) conversion time of sensors. To
   overcome this problem without more hardware cost, we propose a new video
   acquisition system which employs compressive sensing theory to improve
   the imaging efficiency. Compressive Sensing (CS) is an innovative theory
   which allows us to combine signal acquisition and compression together,
   thus capturing compressed signal directly. In this paper, we explore the
   advantage that video volumes could be sparsely represented under
   over-completed dictionary. With this characteristic, we can reconstruct
   the original video with far fewer measurements than conventional Nyquist
   sampling rate. Experimental results validate that we can obtain
   promising recovery with limited measurement. Also, we gain frame rate
   improvement without spatial resolution reduction.}},

Abstract = {{The effort to find new sources of energy became a challenge for all
   scientific and technological areas in the world. Use of renewable
   resources in distributed generation is one of the considerable options
   for the increasing energy demand. Conventional energy systems transform
   into Smart Grid concept by the integration of innovative smart energy
   devices with the conventional electricity grid infrastructure. Smart
   meters, as being one of the upcoming technologies of Smart Grid, have
   become popular since Distribution Network Operators prefer to apply
   Time-of-Use rates. These devices need economical and reliable
   communication system. Power Line Communication (PLC) has several
   advantages for achieving it. In this study it is aimed to improve
   narrowband Power Line Communication system performance by noise
   measurement and analysis, while at the same time contributing to the
   planning process of Frequency Shift Keying applications in Turkey.
   Different types of impulsive noise sources were selected. Between these
   selected impulsive noise sources, a solar grid tie micro inverter is
   particularly focused on. Because there is limited noise measurement
   campaigns exist related to it. Measurements were carried out using Data
   Acquisition card. Data recorded and analyzed using a digital signal
   processing program. Each of these loads' probability density function
   and cumulative distribution function expressions were given. Results
   were discussed according to allowed maximum disturbance levels. Between
   these noise sources solar power inverter produced higher noise amplitude
   in the whole frequency range. Except solar inverter, Frequency Shift
   Keying appeared applicable some carrier frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Digital innovations have now made it possible for healthcare
   organization to transform their task to use digital devices to access
   medical information, monitor vital signs tests, and carry out wide range
   of tasks to provide quality care. The tendency of information security
   incidents might increase due to this transformation. One of the
   solutions is by embedding employees with knowledge regarding information
   security. Previous literatures have examined knowledge management (KM)
   in general and omitted healthcare informatics perspective. However,
   knowledge sharing between employees in healthcare organization can be
   challenging as their background and expertise domains differ. The
   purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of key resistance
   factors in knowledge sharing towards information security culture in
   healthcare organization. Based on the secondary data collected, the key
   resistance factors identified are behavior, lack of trust, lack of
   communication, low security awareness, personality differences, cultural
   differences, lack of top management commitment, and openness to
   experience. A conceptual model was proposed to represent the key
   resistance factors identified. This in-progress study will proceed in
   testing the proposed conceptual model in selected healthcare
   organizations in Malaysia.}},

Abstract = {{Marching along the DARPA SyNAPSE roadmap, IBM unveils a trilogy of
   innovations towards the TrueNorth cognitive computing system inspired by
   the brain's function and efficiency. Judiciously balancing the dual
   objectives of functional capability and implementation/operational cost,
   we develop a simple, digital, reconfigurable, versatile spiking neuron
   model that supports one-to-one equivalence between hardware and
   simulation and is implementable using only 1272 ASIC gates. Starting
   with the classic leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, we add: (a)
   configurable and reproducible stochasticity to the input, the state, and
   the output; (b) four leak modes that bias the internal state dynamics;
   (c) deterministic and stochastic thresholds; and (d) six reset modes for
   rich finite-state behavior. The model supports a wide variety of
   computational functions and neural codes. We capture 50 + neuron
   behaviors in a library for hierarchical composition of complex
   computations and behaviors. Although designed with cognitive algorithms
   and applications in mind, serendipitously, the neuron model can
   qualitatively replicate the 20 biologically-relevant behaviors of a
   dynamical neuron model.}},

Abstract = {{Marching along the DARPA SyNAPSE roadmap, IBM unveils a trilogy of
   innovations towards the TrueNorth cognitive computing system inspired by
   the brain's function and efficiency. The non-von Neumann nature of the
   TrueNorth architecture necessitates a novel approach to efficient system
   design. To this end, we have developed a set of abstractions,
   algorithms, and applications that are natively efficient for TrueNorth.
   First, we developed repeatedly-used abstractions that span neural codes
   (such as binary, rate, population, and time-to-spike), long-range
   connectivity, and short-range connectivity. Second, we implemented ten
   algorithms that include convolution networks, spectral content
   estimators, liquid state machines, restricted Boltzmann machines, hidden
   Markov models, looming detection, temporal pattern matching, and various
   classifiers. Third, we demonstrate seven applications that include
   speaker recognition, music composer recognition, digit recognition,
   sequence prediction, collision avoidance, optical flow, and eye
   detection. Our results showcase the parallelism, versatility, rich
   connectivity, spatio-temporality, and multi-modality of the TrueNorth
   architecture as well as compositionality of the corelet programming
   paradigm and the flexibility of the underlying neuron model.}},

Abstract = {{In today's global knowledge-based economy, knowledge, its creation,
   accumulation and distribution, through institutions of human,
   organizational and social capital, plays an increasingly crucial role as
   the key factor in innovation and economic development. The production,
   distribution and processing of knowledge (especially scientific and
   technological) is increasingly performed within the domain of
   computational information and communication technologies (ICTs). Even
   though there is an asymmetric distribution of ICT resources,
   particularly between developed and developing countries the emergence of
   Free Open Source Software (FOSS) is a means to bridge the `digital
   divide'. This paper examines the use of FOSS for mapping and measuring
   the National System of Innovation (NSI) in Ghana and generating evidence
   based policy. Findings indicate the value of FOSS in mapping and
   measuring for evidence based policy and the crucial role of ICT in the
   NSI.}},

Abstract = {{Shifts in technological paradigms simultaneously disrupt existing
   industrial organization and raise opportunities for entrepreneurial
   companies. Analyzing the process of paradigm shift requires a systematic
   framework involves a variety of factors related to market conditions,
   industrial organization, and the broader technical environment. This
   research develops a typology as an analytical framework covering
   technological paradigm, trajectory and regime, and applies it to the
   photographic industry. The development of digital optical technologies
   disrupted existing film material and chemistry technologies in a
   paradigm shift from analog film cameras to digital cameras. This finding
   is in contrast to the dichotomy that technological competence can only
   either be disrupted or accumulated. A case study shows that separating a
   firm's sustainable competence from the disrupted aspect is critical
   during periods of technological change. Depending on its technology
   strategy, a firm could turn from technological innovator to
   technological defender when its technological competence is disrupted.
   Additionally, changes in the technological regime increase innovation
   opportunity, which attracts fiercer technological competition, thus
   decreasing appropriability. In the new paradigm, collective innovation
   has emerged as a new pattern in technological trajectory. The proposed
   typology is designed as a generic framework and should be applicable to
   technological changes in other industrial sectors.}},

Abstract = {{We establish an algorithm that explains the evolutionary patterns of
   artifacts and construct a mobile phone phylomemetic tree using a very
   simple statistical method with the principles of biological evolution.
   Based on the results, we find that the change of an artifact and
   society's relationship to that artifact follow a certain pattern. First,
   the evolution of an artifact's characteristics takes a direction that
   differs depending upon the characteristics involved. In addition, the
   outcome of this evolution is connected to the general human perception
   of consumers. Second, each of an artifact's characteristics evolves
   sequentially rather than simultaneously. Furthermore, characteristics of
   one artifact that are held in common with those of other artifacts, such
   as a digital camera and PDA, have an effect on the speed of that
   artifact's evolution. Finally, producers that launch many evolved
   artifacts end up in a leading position in the marketplace.}},

Abstract = {{The incessant pace of innovations in the information and communications
   technology sector (ICT) has transformed the scope of several industries.
   On the one hand, consumers are increasingly able to decide whether or
   not new technologies are worth adopting. On the other hand, ICT
   manufacturers, seeking to expand their market shares, encourage the
   continuing purchase of newer versions of their products regardless of
   their elapsed technology life cycle. These phenomena have prompted the
   advent of competing ICT platforms, which include mobile telephony,
   broadband Internet, terrestrial digital TV and cloud computing. Yet, the
   diffusion of newer platforms still requires suitable conditions to
   prosper as, for example, an appropriate technological environment. In
   the case of developing countries, such as Mexico, socio-economic factors
   also play an important role. In this paper we analyze users' intentions
   to adopt available ICT platforms. Although a considerable proportion of
   Mexicans already make use of newer technologies, some are still attached
   to older ICT platforms, such as analog radio and television. There are
   several public policy implications for this situation, among which the
   necessity to encourage the rapid diffusion of more efficient ICT
   technologies as well as the urgent deployment of an appropriate
   supportive infrastructure stand out.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are sensing the environmental
   conditions and give input to electronic control systems. MEMS are
   miniature systems which usually combine tiny mechanical structures with
   electronic circuits. Typical MEMS structures have a size of a few
   micrometers. MEMS sensors make system reactions to human needs more
   intelligent, precise, and at much faster reaction rates than humanly
   possible. Today MEMS sensors can be found in nearly every motor vehicle,
   smart phone or laptop. Due to continuous product innovations, the
   sensors find their way into more and more applications in automotive and
   consumer electronics. According to IHS iSuppli an amount of 4.3 billion
   micromechanical sensors were sold in 2011 with an impressive increase to
   9.8 billion sensors in 2015 - a growth rate of 23\% per year! These
   growth rates are only possible with continuous efforts to improve the
   performance and to decrease the size, power consumption and costs of the
   sensors.
   Historically, these improvements have lead to the breakthrough to
   industrial mass production for MEMS. This was achieved over the last 20
   years by intense and successful development activities combined with the
   experience of volume production of billions of sensors.
   Since then, MEMS technology has enabled accelerometers, gyroscopes,
   geomagnetic sensors, barometric pressure sensors, inkjet nozzles or
   micro-mirrors for Digital-Light Processing (DLP) projection systems.
   Driving future applications in consumer electronics will be
   Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), Augmented Reality (AR) and in-door
   navigation.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is the innovative software solution
   for many fields in this digital era. information Technology has changed
   to the world of business application. An ERP software solution integrate
   operations. processes and information flows in an enterprise, to manage
   the resources of an organization such as human, material, money and
   machine effectively. This study introduces the fuzzy weighted average
   (FWA) approach to evaluate and select the suitable ERP system in order
   to help the company to increase many benefits. The combination of
   qualitative and quantitative criteria is adopted in this method to make
   right decision when choosing an ERP system. The centroid ranking method
   is applied to rank all the final fuzzy evaluation values from the
   provided model. A numerical example is used to test the model. The
   proposed model can help companies to evaluate ERP systems and select
   their best systems to support the business.}},

Abstract = {{The early stage of open innovation diffusion also hinders the use of
   traditional research methods in business economics. A suitable research
   method though relatively new in business management research is
   agent-based modeled simulations (ABMS). The aim of the paper is
   therefore also to develop an open innovation ABMS to explore the
   relative effects of innovation openness and initial capability endowment
   on firm innovation economics in a competitive context. In this respect
   the ABMS is applied as a data generating methodology of organizational
   behavior and industry dynamics. The ABMS acts as a combination of
   digital role play and experimental design. It is found that design and
   use of ABMS contribute to enlargement and testing of the usefulness and
   applicability of ABMS in social science.}},

Abstract = {{The economic importance of the wine industry worldwide is driving the
   development and application of innovative methods and technologies for
   monitoring vineyards. The harvest can significantly vary from year to
   year and also within the vineyard due to soil conditions, disease,
   pests, climate and variation in vineyard management practices. Current
   practices for yield and quality estimation are destructive, expensive,
   inaccurate and largely subjective. These factors make the production of
   high quality grapes for wine making challenging. Image analysis has the
   potential to provide an inexpensive, non-destructive way of capturing
   precise information about the entire vineyard.
   This paper presents a review of recent research relevant to the
   application of digital image analysis to the management of vineyards
   focusing on the key challenges for in-field, on the vine, ground level
   image capture and analysis. The applications explored are:
   Yield Estimation: Historically efforts have primarily been focused on
   the objective estimation of harvest yield. In order to estimate yield
   using image processing the grapes must be detected, segmented from the
   background and the number of clusters counted and the size of the
   cluster determined and this is typically how most estimation methods,
   using images, are approached. However for accurate yield forecasting
   berries within the cluster must be counted and the size of each berry
   determined. This is difficult to achieve due to the occlusion of
   berries. Many of the most successful grape detection methods have been
   developed, independently of the work on yield forecasting, for the
   automation of vineyard management activities such as harvesting and
   smart spraying rather than for yield estimation.
   Quality Evaluation: Berry quality can be linked to visual properties
   such as the size, weight and colour of the berry. These properties have
   been proven to be indicators for ripeness and level of phenolics,
   flavonoids and sugar. To date most of the work in this area has focused
   on the processing of images of individual grapes in the laboratory. In
   the natural environment approaches must be able to cope with difficult
   and variable lighting conditions and with factors such as occlusion of
   the grapes within the cluster and by the canopy.
   Disease Detection: While some work has been undertaken towards the
   detection of powdery and downy mildew and botrytis in grapes there is
   still significant scope for improvement. Detection in the field is
   difficult as the grapes may be covered by bloom and disease can exhibit
   different signs and symptoms depending on the grape variety and the
   stage of development of the disease. Moreover, more than one disease
   might be present. Current work does not address the issues of more than
   one disease or identification of the disease at various stages in its
   development. The most successful work to date has not been on in-field
   images.
   Grape Phenology: The phenology of the grape vine is complex.
   Understanding the phenology of a given plant system is important in
   determining the ability of a region to produce a crop and knowledge of a
   plant's growth stages is advantageous as management practices (such as
   irrigation, pest and disease control and pruning) can be applied at
   optimum times in the vines growth cycle. Additionally, information
   regarding growth stages can be useful in forecasting crop yields and
   even quality.
   The information gathered from automated, fast, accurate image analysis
   from in-field images could be used to design, train and validate
   simulations and forecasting models of vineyards and grape phenology.
   This type of research is at the forefront of climate research in which
   novel methods are required to monitor spatio-temporal physiological
   responses of food sources to changes in the environment.
   The use of image processing to enhance vineyard practices and forecast
   the success and or quality of wine grapes is in its infancy. While much
   of the work to date is promising we have not yet achieved the ``vineyard
   of the future{''}, where image analysis (image and video) is a powerful
   tool that is adopted by viticulturists to inform the management of their
   vineyards.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the dilemma zone (DZ) have been realized since the
   concept of the dilemma zone was proposed in 1960. The dynamics are a
   reflection of the dynamical characteristics of the driver-vehicle
   complex, and can be characterized by the dynamical features of the
   dilemma zone contributing factors which include the minimum
   perception-reaction time (PRT) and the maximum deceleration and
   acceleration rates. To date, the dynamics of these contributing factors
   have not yet been well modeled and quantified despite being continuously
   explored by researchers over decades. In the absence of the quantitative
   knowledge about these contributing factors, the dilemma zone with
   assumed constant parameter values, and the Type II dilemma zone defined
   from a probabilistic perspective (i.e. a zone in which at the onset of
   yellow interval more than 10\% and less than 90\% drivers would choose
   to stop) were widely used in practice as alternatives in estimating the
   dilemma zone. However, both alternatives are compromised in ways, being
   still incapable of reflecting the dilemma zone dynamics. In fact, the
   incapacity of modeling and quantifying the dilemma zone dynamics was due
   to the lack of reliable and robust vehicular trajectory data during the
   yellow intervals. The availability of video-capture based software VEVID
   enabled the collection of high-frequency time-based trajectory data from
   high-definition digital video and hence offered technical preparedness
   for modeling the dilemma zone dynamics. The most significant innovation
   of this paper lies in the proposal of the dynamical dilemma zone model
   by incorporating the quantitative dynamics into the traditional dilemma
   zone model. The dynamical contributing factors were identified,
   quantified, and eventually formulated. Particularly, the models for the
   contributing factors were developed and validated using separate
   datasets. The validation results indicated that the models for the
   dynamical contributing factors are effective in predicting the minimum
   PRT and the maximum acceleration and deceleration rates under various
   speed conditions. Specifically, the minimum PRT is a function of
   individual vehicle's speed; and the maximum deceleration and
   acceleration rates are functions of both the individual vehicle's speed
   and the intersection approach's 85th percentile speed. The final
   evaluation compared the dynamical dilemma zone with the traditional
   dilemma zone model, and the Type II dilemma zone model calibrated based
   on the same trajectory data used for developing the dynamical dilemma
   zone model. As expected, the evaluation results indicated that the
   dynamical dilemma zone model estimated the dilemma zone more accurately
   than the traditional dilemma zone model and the Type II dilemma zone
   model. This innovation brings advancement in empirical understanding and
   theoretical modeling of the dynamics of DZ and hence provides
   theoretical support for developing more efficient and effective dilemma
   zone protection strategies in the future. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This presentation reports on the development and results of a
   proof-of-concept of three innovative mobile apps that capture multimodal
   evidence of student achievement within the marking key. A mobile
   assessment app was developed for each of the following curriculum areas:
   Mathematics, English and Physical Education. These curriculum areas were
   chosen as they were core subjects and the multimodal evidence gathered
   would be different for each. Using a collaborative action research
   methodology, the researcher (developer) and classroom teacher (user)
   collaborated on the development of three proof-of-concept mobile
   assessment apps. The apps went through a number of development cycles.
   The digital marking keys were developed using the teacher's existing
   rubrics and were based on the new Australian National Curriculum. The
   teacher had significant input on the design of the user interface and
   the types of digital media collected as evidence of achievement.
   These innovative mobile apps have grown out of the researcher's doctoral
   and postdoctoral work in the field of digital assessment. This research
   involved both sides of the assessment process, the student task or
   performance and the assessment of this task or performance. The
   introduction of tablets - especially the iPad2 - with the capacity to
   capture all types of digital media (text, drawing, video, audio and
   photos), presented the researcher with the opportunity to develop these
   innovative apps. Building on the experience of developing digital
   assessment rubrics, the idea of seamlessly capturing multimodal evidence
   of student achievement within the marking key on a mobile device was
   born. These apps also provide the ability to PDF student feedback,
   including images as email attachments.
   This presentation will highlight the features the teachers found most
   useful within the different curriculum areas. The response to this type
   of evidence-based mobile assessment from the teacher's perspective and
   the development of additional features will be discussed. Future
   directions for development and research will conclude the presentation.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this paper are: firstly, find out if the use of ICT,
   EXe-Learning and CmapTools, has brought interactivity between students,
   between students and teacher and among students and ICT. Secondly, check
   if it has caused a lot of motivation among students. Thirdly, if the use
   of ICT has promoted active and discovery learning and that learning has
   been significant. It also aims to characterize the determinants that
   have influenced in the process of creating this innovation project.
   This experience arises from the creation of a teaching team seminar
   conducted during the current 2012-2013 whose main objective was to study
   the use of authoring tools as EXe-Learning and CmapTools for the
   creation of digital resources in the Bilingual Program.
   Traditionally it has been considered that the factors favoring
   educational innovation are organizational culture, the readiness for
   change, the connection with the needs of users, the existence of
   individuals or groups of entrepreneurs and ease of exchange and
   contrast.
   We understand the need to promote innovation as improvement of teaching
   practice and the quality of education in the education system of Murcia
   and thus helps to promote the creation of innovative educational
   projects in secondary schools of the Region of Murcia.
   The education system of today's society is subject to great changes in
   various kinds: processes shift from conventional environments training
   to other areas; widespread demand that students receive the skills
   needed for lifelong learning; commercialization of knowledge, which
   simultaneously creates opportunities for new markets and skills in the
   sector, etc.
   Change and innovation are linked to the key concept of school
   organization, and as any project of innovation and educational change
   need some organizational structure as a prerequisite to materialize an
   improvement in educational processes. From this point of view, we can
   determine that based on these processes of innovation and change are a
   number of variables in the area of the school as an organization that is
   expressed through the culture of the school and will influence the
   success or progress or failure of proposed changes.
   Some studies, in accordance with relevant specialists consulted on the
   issue, as {[}1] and {[}2], consider that educational change and
   innovation in education are similar and equivalent concepts.
   Moreover, analyzing the term educational innovation from the
   etymological point of view we can define this as the introduction of
   something new and different in the education system ({[}2]).
   Educational innovations that may arise in any educational institution
   are varied and they can be applied in different ways.
   In addition, the project eXe develops a freely available open source
   application to help teachers in the publication of web content without
   the need to be proficient in HTML or XML format. The resources created
   in eXe can be exported in IMS Content Package, SCORM 1.2, or IMS Common
   Cartridge or as single and independent websites.
   In conclusion, after the completion of this teaching team seminar it has
   been verified that the use of ICT, EXe-Learning and CmapTools, has
   brought interactivity between students, between students and teacher and
   among students and ICT and it has been increased motivation among

Abstract = {{Computing has saturated every aspect of the architectural profession yet
   despite all the conveniences and efficiencies it provides, contemporary
   designers still face challenges in addressing their fundamental task -
   to exercise creative oversight with integrative awareness in the design
   of the built environment. That computing has become a critical component
   in digital modeling, representation, and fabrication does not ensure
   designs are anything more than existent in the theoretical, virtual
   realm. When posited within an iterative design environment, virtual
   designs often require additional steps to adequately contextualize the
   work such as through physical models, photomontages, and printouts.
   Though very potent, these interim steps tax resources, most notably
   invaluable time which could otherwise be spent on design development.
   Unfortunately computing power has, in a rather perverse turn, encouraged
   designers to focus their energy on representation as opposed to
   enhancing a design's robustness and comprehensiveness. As a response to
   this, an augmented reality platform entitled ARIDD (Augmented Reality in
   Design Development) has been developed that empowers designers by
   allowing them to visualize their digital designs into the real world in
   real time. By quickly allowing designers to import their digital models
   on this platform and represent the idea atop real world, adjustable
   conditions, this augmented reality tool significantly reduces the effort
   and resources required to represent an idea and instead allows for
   greater opportunities to refine an idea.}},

Abstract = {{Universities and business schools across the world are addressing the
   topic of inclusion primarily via financial barriers. MOOCs, Coursera and
   other buzzwords are the hot topics of the day. Participants around the
   world certainly benefit from lowering financial hurdles. Yet, from our
   experience, the contribution of MOOCs to increasing skill levels in
   developing and emerging countries is severely constrained by
   technological boundaries.
   Many prospective students of E-Learning in Africa, Asia, Latin America
   and the Pacific Islands incur substantial challenges. In many countries,
   internet is only available from satellite connection, and it is
   expensive and slow. Fibre optic cables are not the norm in Central
   Africa or in the Pacific Islands. This implies that fancy web based
   trainings and sophisticated interactive modules will simply ``time
   out{''}.
   Yet it is exactly those prospective students of E-Learning in emerging
   and developing countries who stand to benefit most -after all the
   quality of local universities and business schools offering professional
   trainings may not always be up to international standards. Access to
   international best practice E-Learning would be a superb way to let the
   participants catch up.
   To address this problem, Frankfurt School of Finance \& Management
   (Frankfurt School) developed the highly innovative, technologically
   highly accessible LinkEd platform to provide affordable part-time
   training opportunities to international development finance
   practitioners, eager for education but often hampered by the limited
   access to it. But how is it possible to combine high quality online
   education with low technical and infrastructural requirements? The
   LinkEd strategy is to mix modern and traditional online learning
   approaches allowing participants with and without high speed internet to
   follow the courses.
   Provide education and training opportunities for developing and
   developed countries
   Provide highly specialized and relevant knowledge on development finance
   Offer affordable and flexible six-month courses
   Constant development and improvement of the e-learning tools
   Offer an international network of partner institutions hosting the final
   examination, giving the participants the possibility to receive a
   Frankfurt School Certification
   In 2010, the pilot of the first ``Certified Expert in Microfinance{''}
   (CEMF) was launched in India and became international one year later.
   With its international setup, the CEMF course has been offered for the
   fifth time starting September 2013. In 2012, the ``Certified Expert in
   SME Finance{''} started and in 2013 the ``Certified Expert in Risk
   Management{''} was added to the portfolio. Since its beginning, the
   LinkEd portfolio has been expanding and until today (10/2013) the
   concept has attracted around 900 participants from more than 100
   different countries. However that was not enough, in March 2014 the
   Frankfurt School will launch a new course on Climate and Renewable
   Energy Finance.
   Summarizing, what makes LinkEd successful? The fact that we offer an
   alternative and affordable way of education to participants from all
   over the world. The fact that we offer the flexibility to learn along
   side of a full time job. The fact that high qualified trainers and
   experts develop and support the courses. The key factor of the success
   is to link all of this into one concept: LinkEd}},

Abstract = {{MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are online courses with the option
   of free and open registration that are usually followed by thousands of
   students from all over the world at the same time. MOOCs need new kinds
   of certification and accreditation.
   On the other hand, Mozilla Open Badges provides a method to create
   verifiable certifications of knowledge, skills, and achievements, no
   matter where they are learned or obtained. Nowadays, people learn things
   online and out of school all the time. Mozilla Open Badges helps to
   solve the problem of certification in the digital society, making it
   easy for any organization to issue and manage digital badges, and to any
   student to display them across the Web. Moreover, badges can be used to
   ``gamify{''} education.
   In this paper, based on our experience in the creation of some MOOCs, we
   show how Mozilla Open Badges can be integrated with a MOOC to show
   progress and learning achievements.}},

Abstract = {{The XXI century has brought a range of digital resources, enabling
   multimedia, mobile and flexible strategies, able to characterize the
   contemporary education, assuming fluidity, interactivity and
   accessibility to information, constituting the agenda of knowledge
   school. The traditional forms of learning lose space and meaning in a
   permanent innovative context and becomes indispensable the appropriation
   of Information Technology and Communication (ICT) by teachers,
   contextualizing the school ambience in order to explore various tools,
   such as: blogs, webquests, virtual communities, conceptual maps, virtual
   libraries, social networks and virtual environments of
   teaching-learning. The Innovate Project focuses on the integration of
   ICT in the planning and development of innovative pedagogical practices
   in basic education, promoting new teaching choreography in contemporary
   educational scenario. The choice of series / year Basic Education was
   given deliberately, considering the school communities involved, the
   predisposition of pedagogical coordination of schools and teachers to
   interact with and about the proposal and the technological
   infrastructure of schools for the development of the work. We opted for
   two schools of Basic Education, the public system in Santa Maria-RS: a
   Basic Education state school located in the social environment of the
   university and a school belonging to the Military College System of
   Brazil. Teacher education programs have involved its focus on
   professional basic education, being included in the curriculum
   disciplines that aim at theoretical and practical knowledge of ICT in
   education. The methodological assumptions underpinning the research is
   connected-training (MACIEL, 2006), considering ICT as mediating
   activities, with the goal of fostering new choreography teaching within
   the basic school and seeking coherence with public policies that
   encourage the inclusion of ICT in public schools as promoting
   significant learning in the direction of a free and good quality public
   education, interpreted by us as pedagogical excellence. The proposed
   actions and studies involving undergraduate, specialization, master's
   and doctoral students, research professors and Basic Education teachers.
   Search results include training qualified students who already work, in
   addition to researchers and teachers; in-service teachers training in
   the involved schools and the improvement of student learning in Basic
   Education. The project took place during the school year being renovated
   to provide continuity in training teachers' activities in schools.}},

Abstract = {{The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights posits that
   everyone regardless of socioeconomic class, race, ethnicity,
   nationality, age, religion, and gender has the right to education.
   In the developed as well as the underdeveloped nations of the world,
   personal, familial, community, and societal advancement and prospects
   for prosperity are heavily predicated on the quotidian accessibility to
   quality educational systems and opportunities. The access to and
   successful completion of a quality education is seen virtually to have
   transformative - if not total transcendent powers. Yet, there is a
   growing denial globally of this fundamental human right.
   Today, the cultural, socio-economic, schooling and achievement gaps and
   the digital divide between affluent and disadvantaged children are not
   only challenges to global education but are also threats to
   international development, prosperity and security.
   Understanding the dialectical relationship between socio-economic
   development and the access to and completion of a quality education,
   Houston Preparatory Academy (HPA), a not-for-profit U.S.-based
   educational organization founded in 1991, created in 1998, a
   multi-university, cross-national collaboration to address and develop
   programmatic and research methods to understand, rethink, enhance and
   provide high-quality educational opportunities that would longitudinally
   combat inequality and injustice in impoverished communities in the U.S.
   and Mexico.
   Today, HPA, via its U-Prep initiative, effectively addresses the issues
   connected to the lack of educational opportunities for students from
   poor and immigrant families in Houston, Texas in the U.S.
   Since 2006, it has provided educational and social services in
   Renacimiento, Guerrero, Mexico. Guerrero is the area of origin of over
   73,000 persons who migrated to the U.S. annually. Since its inception,
   U-Prep has been a proven and effective model. However, steadily
   escalating levels of violence in Mexico in 2011 forced U-Prep to
   reconsider its mission, methods and program. U-Prep had to create a new,
   innovative approach to practice, service and research that preserved the
   high quality of its program while considering the safety of its
   teachers, interns and students.
   As an adaptive measure, U-Prep broadened, intensified, and adjusted its
   already developed approach to Global Learning and implemented it using
   face-to-face engagement and practice coupled with existing,
   cost-effective, internet-based computer resources (Skype, E-mail,
   texting). U-Prep created math, literature and English curricula based on
   multi-disciplinary research and proven best practices in education and
   transformed teacher-centered pedagogy into an empowering approach to
   education that is at once personal, cyber-friendly and student-centered.
   U-Prep highlights cross-cultural competence, understanding and respect
   to harness and mobilize talent, potential, initiative, creativity and
   change. College-age U-Prep students are offered internship opportunities
   for local and international leadership, commitment and service.
   Therefore, using Global Learning delivered through existing assistive
   technologies, U-Prep is able to defend the global right to a quality
   education by providing a dynamic, comprehensive, community-based,
   culturally competent, child-centered educational model that continues to
   enhance educational opportunities and supportive social services for
   students and families in the U.S. and Mexico.}},

   propose a program of Innovative Methodologies for Teaching Undergraduate
   UNESP. Eighty-five teachers participated in this discussion of different
   areas of knowledge, in eight hours meeting. They presented four
   investigative questions related to innovative actions in the process of
   teaching and learning at university, teaching methods in undergraduate
   courses and their specific areas of knowledge, teaching and pedagogical
   potential of Digital Communication and Information Technologies (DCIT),
   and conditions required to the incorporation of new technologies in
   teaching political projects of undergraduate teaching. The questions
   were answered and initially registered individually, then discussed in
   small groups. A summary of the group discussions was presented to all
   participants in the closing session of the meeting. As results stand
   out: the broad participation of teachers, assessing methodologies and
   innovative actions in public higher education, as well as the richness
   of the dialogue between teachers from different areas of knowledge. From
   investigative questions presented, we obtained the following guidelines
   for the preparation of the Program: inclusion of all segments of the
   university in this discussion (teachers, students, and staff); need for
   a common definition for the participants who are the methodologies and
   innovative actions in higher education in order actions that may
   converge to a common goal, evaluation of the innovative actions,
   especially those relating to DCIT are designed as educational tools and
   not as a solution to structural, curricular and pedagogical higher
   education problems; wide dissemination and training of teachers,
   students and staff in the management of digital technology tools and
   equipment available, the spaces already in place at the university, such
   as class councils, councils course, advisory committees of teaching,
   research and extension, local and central collegiate bodies should
   constitute continuous forums for dialogue between teachers, students and
   staff in order to evaluate the teaching methods used and the
   incorporation of new technologies. The systematic data will be sent to
   teachers and guide the next steps of Prograd on vocational training of
   excellence, based on assumptions scientific, social and ethical issues
   that accompany the activities of teaching, research and extension
   education.}},

   qualifications of Tourism, the present paper proposes some uses of the
   ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), applied successfully
   during the last three years on several subjects, which allow to support
   the innovation processes of teaching at the university. With that we try

   Our offer is based on methodologies addressed for learning and rested on
   the use of the ICT, and orientated to the European EEES-space of Top
   Education and to the needs of the companies of the 21st century. The
   methodological proposed model is based on the support Internet 2.0,
   since the different tourist organizations continuously managing

Abstract = {{``Since ancient times, tribes of all cultures have gathered `in a
   circle' to meet, discuss and explore what is in the best interest of the
   group... They did this through drumming and storytelling...{''}
   (http://www.drumcafe.com). This paper explores innovative ways of
   learning, addressing pedagogy and teacher presence in teaching and
   learning. Key questions: 1). How does an instrumental music teacher
   impact individuals and groups of students? 2). What techniques does she
   use to promote learning and leadership? 3). Do students' and other
   academic teachers' beliefs change as a result of empowering pedagogy,
   mentoring and peer-to-peer learning that occur in this music program?
   Our teaching and learning goal at The College of Staten Island High
   School for International Studies (CSIHSIS) is: to integrate innovative
   pedagogy with challenging international academics and arts education.
   As Director of Music, my responsibility is to construct a sustainable
   innovative instrumental program that is replicable and scalable,
   utilizing challenging curriculum and student-centered pedagogy. Learning
   goals are: tolerance, global citizenship, leadership that enhances
   academics. Learning outcomes are aligned with The Asia Society's
   International Studies School Network, Graduate Profile which involves:
   engaging learners as peer leaders, learning by doing, problem-solving,
   and reflective thinking.
   Tribal drumming concepts inform the research and conceptual framework
   for this music program. Rhythm is central to communication. Drums are in
   all cultures. Using one's body to create rhythm is natural to humans.
   The pedagogy, peer-to-peer facilitation can be disorienting for some
   teachers and/or learners. A scan of music faculty indicates that some
   feel their presence and persona are compromised in peer-to-peer
   facilitated teaching and learning. Others find it refreshing because
   students who are empowered become stakeholders in their own learning and
   learning community, preparing them for college and careers.
   According to the 1999 President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities,
   when young people are involved with the arts, something changes in their
   lives. Further, President Obama has called for American schools to align
   student achievement with the demands of the global economy. ``Students
   need a value system that respects global peers and cultures different
   from their own; critical thinking skills; cross-cultural leadership
   skills; to understand complexity and adapt to rapid change. The future
   is here. It's global, multicultural, multilingual, and digitally
   connected. If we put the world into world-class education, not only will
   we be more successful and innovative in the global economy, but we will
   also lay an important foundation for peace and a shared global
   future.{''} (http//asiasociety.org).
   By hands-on problem-solving, critical reflection and discussion about
   music-making, an in-depth understanding of the artistic experience
   unfolds. Citing peer-learning and teacher-student mentoring as stimuli,
   teachers observe more academic, social and emotional growth in the music
   students in comparison to those students who do not participate in the
   drum circle experience. Enrollment statistics demonstrate that the
   program is expanding and enhancing academic achievement. The music
   program services 100\% of the freshman.}},

Abstract = {{This paper will propose an innovative method to transform information
   systems (IS) and computer science education on a global scale. This
   method will introduce the use of virtualization and cloud computing
   combined with open source software (OSS) in higher education. This will
   allow for those studying IS and computer science to work independently
   on projects anywhere in the world from a baseline image that has been
   developed with information assurance (IA) controls. Additionally, this
   will allow professors and course developers to deploy their own
   customized virtual machines (VMs) to be used with the course. These VMs
   will host their own customized scripts, software applications, digital
   books, and more. This will help revolutionize online and on ground
   education in computing. For countries with limited resources, these VMs
   will allow for a more cost effective way to deploy training and perform
   collective research from any location given adequate internet
   connection. Provided will be a process for developing, deploying,
   managing, and retiring the VMs in the academic setting.}},

Abstract = {{The current economic recession being experienced by the major European
   economies has highlighted the importance of entrepreneurship as a
   possible solution to this adverse situation. From the field of knowledge
   and in particular from the University, is necessary to prepare study
   plans with a greater weight of transverse knowledge and skills useful
   for the workplace and professional. Only then university graduates will
   get better insertion in the labor market. This paper presents the
   experiences of the Economics and Business Administration Department from
   the University of Alcala with Telecommunications and Electronic
   Engineering and Industrial grade students in teaching activities
   developed throughout the course, designed to introduce students in
   business concepts and especially encourage entrepreneurship, giving
   students the tools and sources of information necessary for the
   implementation of their own projects and business innovation
   Given the profile of engineering student with little business and
   legislative notions, all activities that have been developed are
   intended to facilitate their learning in business plan development,
   focusing on the process difficulties but also on the advantages and
   benefits of undertaking a business initiative. The knowledge and skills
   that are transmitted are an interdisciplinary and complementary
   integration, given the dimensions that entrepreneurship concept
   embraces, such as accounting, finance, human resource selection,
   environmental analysis or design business strategy. However, the
   ultimate goal of all activities is the acquisition of strategies that
   stimulate student effort and promote their ability to learn by oneself.
   To achieve the above objectives, students must develop a business plan
   that loops through all the steps needed to create a company and all the
   business basic functions, from production to promotion of goods or
   services. They must orally present the business plan relying on all the
   resources they require, such as web pages creation, recording digital
   media advertisements or business dramatization. The assessment of all
   activities usefulness has been collected through a questionnaire to more
   than 250 engineering students.
   Finally an Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is carried out with the results
   obtained of conduct the same study on a sample of social sciences
   students who are more familiar with this type knowledge and skills. The
   hypothesis to be tested is that this type of work is best rated and
   provides a greater knowledge to engineering students.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present work carried out by GreTICE, a University of
   Girona research group specialising in information technology and
   communication in education, which is involved in the design and creation
   of a serious game called ``Legends of Girona{''} to be used in the
   classroom as a teaching resource. This game has been created in
   collaboration with GiLab (Graphics \& Imaging Laboratory), which is also
   based at the University of Girona. The game is aimed at pupils between
   the ages of 10 and 16 (i.e., from late primary school to the first cycle
   of secondary school.
   The project evolved from CONTIENE (Content Intelligent Applications of
   Virtual Reality. Technical perspective and global illumination -
   TIN2007-68066-C04-01) which was funded by the Ministry of Education and
   Science (MEC) as part of the National Plan for information technology.
   This project developed into a new one, TIN 2010-21089-C03-01 entitled
   ``Digital content for serious games: creation, management, rendering and
   interaction{''} (CICYT-MEC).
   In educational terms, the objective of the project is to study the use
   of videogames as an entertaining teaching resource. We conducted a study
   into the preferences of young children and teenagers in order to get
   data that would be useful for the design of the game. From the analysis
   of the responses, a comprehensive report was prepared that indicated how
   the game could be improved.
   The chosen theme was the Legends of Girona, based on traditional stories
   from the city. The main character in the game is able move between
   present-day Girona and medieval Girona, and takes part in different
   adventures in the context of each legend. This idea allowed us to
   develop a motivating proposal (with adventures, movement in open spaces,
   interaction with the scenario, etc.) that meets educational objectives
   that are both general (decision-making, problem-solving, resilience,
   concentration, etc) and curriculum-specific (history of medieval Girona,
   French invasions, etc.). With these ingredients, we began to write a
   script that would form the backbone of the game.
   Based on the script, the technical team began to make a number of
   decisions regarding, for example, the game engine, the 3D representation
   of present-day and medieval Girona and the application of the advances
   they have made in their research into lighting applied to video games.
   From that point forward, the pedagogical team and the technical team
   have worked in parallel and in constant coordination leading to the
   completion of the graphic design and 3D modelling of characters and
   scenes, the 3D reproduction of Girona, the character movements,
   soundtrack, recorded dialogues and the implementation of all these
   elements into the game engine.
   After a process of internal testing and reviews, we carried out a small
   survey to test the degree of satisfaction among players who tested a
   beta-version of the game. The initial assessments are very positive.
   The full text of the paper gives more details on the analysis of the
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of the competences acquired by the students in the
   context of a university education system is needed to enable professors
   to develop teaching-learning processes tailored to students' needs.
   Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to analyse in depth the
   profile of the acquired competences of the bachelor students in several
   subjects related to the Business Administration area taught in the
   Faculty of Economics and Business of the University of Barcelona.
   This paper explains an experience in assessing bachelor student's
   competences by applying a digital platform called Evolute developed by
   Tampere University of Technology in Finland {[}1-4]. This is an
   ICT-based digital platform designed for the self-assessment of personal
   and social competences, and it uses different models of competences for
   a range of specific work role profiles. Each competence model is based
   on a specific ontology according to the target domain {[}5]. In
   particular, we apply an evaluation tool called Cycloid, which was
   specifically designed for self-evaluating the project managers' generic
   and specific competences.
   The authors of this research have previous experience in implementing
   Cycloid in different subjects in the area of Business Administration.
   Specifically, in previous editions of INTED 2012, INTED 2013 and
   EDULEARN 2013 conferences, the results of its implementation in the
   subjects of Business Administration, Operations Management and Strategic
   Management respectively were presented {[}68]. In this new edition, we
   now present the results obtained by comparing differences based in the
   course level and the respondents gender.
   Results show that there exist significant differences in the
   self-evaluation of competences depending on the respondent gender, for
   example in competences like self-confidence, innovativeness, conceptual
   thinking, language proficiency, optimism, understanding others,
   communications, relationship building or stress tolerance. Additionally,
   students of different courses level -first year students vs. third year
   students-consider to be different in competences such us maintaining
   order, innovativeness, responsibility, conceptual thinking, language
   proficiency, achievement orientation, understanding others, developing
   others, communications, conflict management, relationship building, etc.
   Tools as the Cycloid benefits the three parties involved: students,
   university managers and organizations, and should be applied along the
   Bachelor as a transversal project and adapt the programs to achieve
   graduate students with higher levels of social and personal competences,
   as demanded by the labour market.}},

Abstract = {{In 2008 a research in the field of TE-CLIL (Technology-Enhanced Content
   and Language Integrated Learning) was started in Catholic University.
   The title of the research was: Adding Value to CLIL through New
   Technology. It lasted until 2010 and involved different levels of
   educational field from primary education to higher education. The
   positive result of the research suggested to begin a real practice of
   CLIL classroom 2.0 which involved both university since 2010 and school
   from 2011 {[}1]. The aim of this paper is to report about the results of
   two years of practice in a high secondary school.
   The research in TE-CLIL investigated language and content needs of
   students using the digital competence as a means to improve their
   learning. The study considered the different mindset of young
   generations when approaching the new technology and how their digital
   competence could help them in improving their school learning of
   curricular subjects through the use of a foreign language as the target
   language.
   The practice of CLIL classroom 2.0 was introduced in a high secondary
   school in school year 2011/2012 and it continued the following school
   year (2012/2013). The first year it involved two classrooms of a course
   of Electronics. The year after it involved three classrooms of the same
   course, but of different levels. The technology used was mainly Web 2.0
   for classroom lessons and homework and it wanted to encourage the
   collaboration inside and outside classroom using a blended learning
   approach. Specific spaces for e-learning were created. This paper
   analyses these two years of practice considering the foundation of the
   previous research.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade there has been a growth of virtual education in
   schools, colleges and universities both in public and private
   institutions. Virtual schooling has developed as an alternative to
   traditional in-seat lessons. It is developed for people who have
   difficulties to be physically present at school, e. g. living far from
   school, unsatisfied with local provision, disable, or who prefer to have
   a more flexible day/time to attend lessons and study thanks to the
   asynchronous nature of most of the work.
   The supremacy of USA virtual schooling system seems not to be so certain
   as it was in the past according to the increasing numbers of European
   institutions which have started to teach courses, entirely or mainly,
   through distance online methods. The aim of this paper is to analyse the
   different styles of virtual learning offered in Western countries, with
   a specific interest in the USA and Europe, and to compare the different
   models to find pros and cons of them in a perspective of continuing
   monitoring of the development of virtual education as a growing
   phenomenon which is interesting the educational setting as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{The growing development of technology has altered the role of mobile
   phones which apart from individual communication devices are also
   influential devices for uploading and content. This information creates
   innovative challenges for the mobile industry which needs to be
   developed and regulate constructive and exciting services for the
   consumers in order to improve the functions of the mobile phone as an
   ordinary device. Accepting and utilizing mobile social networks sites
   and other Web 2.0 overhauls is estimated to be in line with a mobile
   technology development. Present mobile web technologies present similar
   user experience like computer since a user can simply create and
   distribute digital data from his/her mobile. However, present services
   and applications do not consist of methods for analyzing this gathering
   user-generated inputs (e. g. data, annotations), user exchanges (e. g.
   grading) and social connections (e. g. associations). Information pulled
   out from this huge user contribution and communication can recommend
   modified added-value services allowing more well-organized mobile usage.
   Our objective is to sketch this information investigation gaps in
   available services and going one step more to recommend possible
   solutions. Aspiring at social networks, we talk about new methods for
   investigating users' actions and replica users' social associations. The
   objective from this idea is to pull out the fundamental knowledge from
   users' classification activities, users' created content and users'
   social associations within a social network. We present our points with
   investigative example services.}},

Abstract = {{The ``Ed2.0Work - European network for the integration of Web2.0 in
   education and work{''} project is a three year Education, Audiovisual \&
   Culture Executive Agency co-financed project with the following aims:
   center dot To support the development of innovative ICT-based content,
   services, pedagogies and practice for lifelong learning.
   center dot To encourage the best use of results, innovative products and
   processes and to exchange good practice in the fields covered by the
   Lifelong Learning Programme, in order to improve the quality of
   education and training.
   center dot To promote European co-operation in fields covering two or
   more sub-programmes - KA3.
   center dot European-wide stakeholders' communities promoting digital
   competence and other key transversal competences for life and
   employability.
   During the project an analysis on the state of the art in Web2.0 usage
   in education has been carried out. In this paper we present the results
   of the analysis of 506 academic papers retrieved from the academic
   database SCOPUS. The study had the intention of analyzing what are the
   most common topics on the subject of web 2.0 usage for educational
   purpouses, what sort of empirical approaches have been carried out in
   this matter, what are the main conclusions of the papers analyzed and
   lessons that can be learned from them.
   As summary of results we can point out that:
   -there is a predominant educational level in which the papers are
   focused: higher education
   -the existence of studies focused on analyzing the use of web 2.0 in non
   formal and informal educational processes it is testimonial
   -the main focus of the papers analyzed is to analyze how students use
   specific web 2.0 resources (i.e. facebook, twitter, ...) for educational
   purpouses
   -there are few experiences based of the analysis of the usage of web 2.0
   by teachers and educators in educational processes

Abstract = {{The creation and dissemination of new computer media for Health \&
   Safety training in the workplace today is particularly significant. Many
   categories of users are in fact excluded from the benefits of distance
   learning and are often involved only in brief and sporadic training
   sessions in the traditional classroom. This often happens to those
   categories of workers, such as labourers, construction craftsmen,
   drivers, farmers and general shift or seasonal workers, for which are
   organized training sessions generally every five years, in line with the
   provisions and obligations imposed by law. During which there is often
   not the opportunity to delve into the issues of most interest to users
   nor to illustrate in detail the updates on the topics studied. These
   categories are those most in need of training and refresher courses as
   they operate in sectors with higher levels of risk.
   In the light of these premises, the aim of the research is to create a
   new IT tool multi-device ``ERGO-Trainer{''} in order to respond to these
   needs, allowing not only to remove all the technological barriers, but
   also shifting the focus of the training/information from the traditional
   environment to that of an individual's own workplace.
   The product will be available from their workstation as well as from
   their mobile device, while retaining multimedia and interactive
   features. It is precisely the mobile device which represents the main
   medium to reach these workers, the so called blue-collar workers, who do
   not normally work behind a desk and so do not readily have access to a
   computer. Being out-of-office, typically these workers do not regularly
   have a Wi-Fi connection or, more often than not, an economical and
   reliable 3G connection for their mobile device.
   The product will therefore be available in off-line mode using Apps for
   Android and IOS operating systems that together cover more than 80\% of
   the market.
   It is intended that, after an initial online connection to do the
   assessment and to download customized content on to their device, users
   have the opportunity to work off-line benefitting from a tracking system
   directly on the device. The system, when under Wi-Fi coverage, allows
   the sending of tracking information to a central server for collecting
   data and monitoring users progress,
   This aspect will make the ERGO-Trainer a research project for product
   innovation, and can be used in different contexts: informative,
   training, user assistance, etc.}},

Abstract = {{With a growing emphasis on the digital economy, the use of technology in
   learning, on-line learning and e-learning is increasing due to
   advantages in flexibility, cost and improved experiences fit for modern
   mediated working practices. A study by Cegos demonstrated that learners
   want to see more technology driven learning developed with an emphasis
   on collaborative learning techniques. In a global educational
   environment experiencing rapid technological change, the effective
   transfer in learning approaches and techniques between higher education
   and vocational educational and training is increasingly important. This
   paper introduces a new project which aims to promote key competences in
   delivering vocational technology enhanced collaborative learning
   throughout Europe. Within the project, which involves participants from
   Wales, Bulgaria, Sweden, Greece and Cyprus, Higher Education
   Universities are working with the vocational training industry to
   develop postgraduate education that targets the vocational training
   industry - a Postgraduate Certificate in Technology Enhanced Learning
   (TEL) for the vocational training industry. Using this approach,
   participants from the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector
   will gain skills and qualifications that address how training
   organisations can make use of technology to enhance their training
   products and access the greater market reach that technology provides.
   The strength of the project partnership for this development lies in its
   equal combination of grass roots private VET business organisations and
   Higher Education organisations with experience of using TEL for learning
   and who have delivered VET online across European borders. All the five
   participating countries provide partners with education or training as a
   primary business activity. Three of the countries' project partners from
   Sweden, Bulgaria and Greece are stakeholders from the target audience
   and the other partners are Universities that all have experience of VET.
   The development of the program will benefit from collaborative
   participation. The combination of equal grass roots involvement with
   that of highly experienced postgraduate and online learning at the
   tertiary level will make the development of the course, its piloting and
   evaluation more rigorous and likeliness for successful outcome. This
   paper outlines the nature of the project and describes the model that
   will be used as the basis for this development.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from two projects in a professional
   development program for teachers. The courses in the program are
   web-based and require a close connection between practice and theory.
   The students are partly students at the college, partly teachers in
   elementary and lower secondary schools. In the paper they are named
   ``teachers{''} while their students are named ``students{''}. The
   participants' own professional practice is linked to the courses and
   used as the testing arena. The paper discusses how the teachers' new
   knowledge may be put into practice in the classrooms in the elementary
   and lower secondary school. Theories about The teacher as researcher and
   Educational design research have inspired this work. The two projects
   are guided by the following questions:
   How may students' self-assessments contribute to improve teachers'
   feedback on written texts? How may the use of a wiki as a publishing
   tool for book reviews in the course contribute to enhance the teachers'
   digital competence and their readiness for using new technologies in
   their own classrooms?
   The first project explores innovative teaching programs in writing and
   especially dialogical assessment in lower secondary schools. It
   highlights how the teachers may get important feedback about their
   comment practice through the students' self-assessments in the writing
   process. The aim is to develop new knowledge about teachers' comments on
   students' written texts. Texts from 60 teachers' classes in the lower
   secondary school constitute the empirical material from the project. All
   student self-assessments and teachers' comments and reports about the
   writing process are collected on the web. Most students'
   self-assessments emphasize to measure skills. But self-assessment may
   also be included in a process where the dialogue between student and
   teacher is crucial. In such a dialogue the teacher may get feedback on
   what the student has understood and been able to take advantage of from
   the teacher's comments. New methods for self-assessment based on
   knowledge of theory and on hypotheses about possible improvements are
   tried out. The experiences have led to reflections and new cycles of
   design. The project shows that teachers can improve their comments on
   different levels by ``listening to{''} and studying the students'
   self-assessments.
   The second project explores teachers' reflections on challenges and
   benefits of using a wiki tool in their own teaching in the elementary
   school. The reflections are made on the background of the teachers' own
   work in the course, using a wiki for publishing reviews about children's
   books. Research has shown that many teachers are not likely to use ICT
   in their teaching, in spite of clear guidelines concerning this in the
   Curriculum for the elementary school. The aim is thus to develop
   knowledge about ways to enhance the use of new technologies integrated
   in the subjects. Reflection texts from 65 teachers constitute the
   empirical material from the project. The results show that the teachers
   have different reasons for not using new technologies. Their reflections
   nevertheless indicate that the practical experience they get through the
   working methods in the course, generate multiple ideas for using a wiki
   with their own students.}},

Abstract = {{Our project addresses the digital divide that now prevails in many
   schools in Europe. Teachers are often the digital immigrants trying to
   keep up with the students who are the digital natives. Searching and
   gathering information is a natural process in their everyday lives. Our
   project intends to utilize this strong interest and channel it into
   innovative methods to transform the way we teach courses in mutual
   subjects as History, English, Art, Religion, Biology, Politics, Science,
   and Media Literacy.
   ``New media{''} that can be used for teaching purposes are not mere
   prolonging of ``old media technologies{''} (typing, searching for
   references, publishing), they also bring in new ways of learning. Thus
   technologies such as iPads must be connected to a continuous development
   of didactics and pedagogies. This put the role of the teacher and
   interaction with the pupils and their prerequisites at core; both in
   working with majors and ``classical classroom style{''}, as well as in
   other assignments or ubiquitous learning processes.
   This changes previous ideas of the presentation, documentation,
   representation, examination and evaluation of knowledge. It challenges
   our thinking of when and where learning is supposed to take place and
   issues of power and the role of the teacher as expert. No area or aspect
   of learning is secluded from this ongoing technological and cultural
   change. Still much is to be developed and in need to have research. One
   dimension concerns implementation and usage of new technologies in
   schools and the altered role for teachers and new ways to design
   learning. There is a strong need for systematic monitoring the
   implementation of the use of ``smart and digital{''} teaching tools in
   actual school situations.
   Kassel Germany and Sollentuna Sweden are the two regions in this
   cooperation. Eight teachers from each partnership will explore the
   implications of using digital tablets i.e. iPADs as a pedagogic
   instrument in classroom situations. Each year there will be a workshop
   in both countries where all participants gather together with guest
   lecturers. Between the workshops each teacher will have assignments to
   practice in their respective classrooms. By creating a blog every
   participant will continuously communicate the results of their
   implementation of methods taken up in the workshops.
   Germany and Sweden are similar as social societies yet different in
   educational structures. This dynamic should contribute to strengthen the
   European perspective in the project.}},

Abstract = {{The present transformations and challenges that Knowledge Society
   demands, as well as the main implications that Information and
   Communication Technologies have over higher education, universities and
   specially over professional development of teachers of this educational
   level, have a deep impact not only on their professional profile,
   functions and roles, but also, on their training and professional
   competences and skills.
   This paper aims to show the current status of a research project with
   some preliminary reflections derived from the initial quantitative and
   qualitative data analysis of an on-line survey, a series of interviews
   in depth, participant observations (face to face, blended and virtual),
   as well as four discussion groups carried out at the end of 2012 with
   higher education teachers and educational managers from twenty public
   and private Universities in Mexico. The study aims to carry out a
   descriptive, comprehensive and critical evaluation of training needs of
   Higher Education Teachers' Digital Competence for the Knowledge Society,
   from different professional perspectives and diverse information
   sources, as well as from current and emerging training scenarios (face
   to face, blended and virtual). It is part of a previous research carried
   out in 2010 which the main purpose was to identify the main professional
   functions and digital competences that higher education teachers should
   develop to be suitably integrated as Teaching Professionals for the
   Knowledge Society.
   Based on critical analysis and comparison of different perspectives,
   theories and models found in the scientific literature and international
   reports, a descriptive methodology was used to build up the theoretical
   and scientific framework for the study, portraying an approach of a
   state of the art of the knowledge society and its implications over the
   higher education teachers' digital competences profile. Derived from
   this analysis, we found a series of key elements that allowed us to
   conceive a model of professional development for higher education
   teachers, in which their digital competences are integrated as an
   intrinsic part of its main new roles, ` in and for' the knowledge
   society. The model is based on competence units in the intellectual,
   social, organizational and cultural fields, guided by critical
   reflection, and oriented to innovation, knowledge construction and
   collaboration in a digital society.
   Throughout these key elements we were also able to build a questionnaire
   for teacher digital competences' need assessment that allow them to
   identify their own needs of continuing education and training with
   respect to their digital competences, offering as well, an open,
   comprehensive and flexible framework for decision making on continuing
   training and professional growth. The theoretical conceptions of the
   model were scientifically validated through international experts and
   with teachers in their real context.
   The preliminary reflections presented in this paper will serve as the
   basis of a deeper analysis and comprehension of all the data collected
   for the purpose of the main study, which is the identification of
   teachers' training needs with respect its digital competence, for its
   later synthesis, structure and prioritization. These results, in turn,
   will allow us to make a training proposal that meet the needs of
   teachers of the Mexican Higher Education Institutions that participated
   in the study.}},

Abstract = {{Future generations will look back at current assessment practices at all
   levels of education and wonder why it took so long to replace
   paper-based assessment processes with multimodal digital processes.
   Handwritten evidence of achievement is still practiced at all levels of
   education, while marking is still predominantly done by pen and paper.
   The presenter has been researching in this area of digital assessment
   for the past 10 years and will discuss what is involved in the
   digitization of the assessment environment. The presenter will also
   explore how the digitization process can contribute towards enhancing
   the transparency of the marking process and its alignment with learning
   outcomes.
   Assessing live performances, be they individual or group, is one of the
   most challenging tasks teachers face, because the nature of performance
   is in the moment. Authentic evidence of student assessment tasks (
   performances) can now be captured and embedded in mobile tablet apps.
   The evidence collected can be a combination of pictures, videos, audios,
   handwritten or typed text. The feedback and feedforward can be formative
   or summative and can be customized to meet the needs of the student and
   teacher. This presentation will showcase an innovative mobile assessment
   app that brings together the unique features of iOS devices, Filemaker
   GO and best practices in assessment. The app is currently in its fourth
   year of development.
   A third-year university pre-service teachers live performance activity
   is used to demonstrate this innovative mobile assessment app. Three
   content experts in drama, music and visual arts carried out the
   assessment. The app allowed their judgments to be recorded via the app
   in the cloud. The app also allowed the performance to be recorded and
   included peer-assessment. Touch does matter as the app eliminates all
   the busy unproductive activities involved in the marking process. These
   activities include the writing of student names, collating of sub-marks
   and manually distributing the results. The instructional rubric provides
   educative feedback and the captured video evidence of achievement is
   seamlessly recorded within the app and stored remotely. In addition, the
   cognitive load is greatly reduced for the markers as the app interface
   mirrors what they have been accustomed to in the paper environment. The
   whole assessment process becomes paperless and seamless, from the
   recording of marks and video, to students receiving an email of their
   marks as a PDF with the video of their performance embedded. The session
   will conclude with a discussion on how these types of apps might augment
   and enhance the assessment process through ways not achievable by
   traditional marking methods.}},

Abstract = {{Education has embraced social media. We tweet back and forth with our
   students. We tweet from field trips. We tweet for the eyes of potential
   students. We have Facebook groups for our courses. We tag each other,
   have tumblr collections from student events. This has opened up
   fantastic ways of engaging with our students.
   As people have begun to bemoan the declines in lecture attendance, or
   asserted commonplaces about attention spans, Social Media has allowed us
   to be radically interactive, and be context-specific about where
   traditional academic hierarchies of communication are and aren't in
   place. This is to be welcomed, to be pushed further, and innovated with
   respect to.
   But, students are beginning to see a collapsing of lines that can make
   them uncomfortable. They may want to complain on twitter about a boring
   lecture, or use images as their Facebook profile picture that they would
   rather their lecturers didn't see. Much of this can be cleared up by
   them getting to grips with the systems: there s much scope here for
   staff and student development (which often shows just how flawed and
   problematic the digital native/immigrants taxonomy is). However, this
   still leaves an area of ambiguity, an area of problematic
   self-construction for students, and I would see this as ethically
   interesting, maybe even difficult, for staff.
   This paper seeks to explore the extent to which a flourishing of social
   media on a Higher Education course deepens and enriches the learning
   experience, but also brings into play a set of grey areas, where a
   collapsing barrier between social, academic, personal and private
   identities should give staff some pause for thought, amidst their
   enthusiasm and fervour.}},

Abstract = {{Oakhill College is a private Catholic secondary school in suburban
   Castle Hill, part of the Sydney greater metropolitan area. It has 1700
   students, all boys, other than 260 girls in Years 11 and 12. Oakhill
   College is steeped in tradition and breaking from a traditional model of
   teaching has been a challenge.
   When the Australian Government introduced the Digital Education
   Revolution initiative in 2009 the college embraced the opportunity to
   purchase 1000 Notebooks stored in charging trolleys within classrooms.
   Essentially, they failed. Android Tablets started being issued to
   students on a 1: 1 basis in 2012, also with little success.
   The main obstacle to including technology in the classroom was the lack
   of pedagogical change. The majority of teachers and leaders continued to
   focus on control of the classroom as their paramount concern.
   In 2013 the Innovative Learning Team (ILT) was formed, with one of its
   main tasks to plan the future direction of the school in terms of
   student-centred learning and the technology to support it. The research
   involved visiting other schools, literature review, auditing current
   school infrastructure and surveying the school community.
   The ILT recommended pedagogical change at Oakhill to be driven by (1) a
   clear message and modelling of good practice from the Principal and his
   leadership team (2) tapping into an existing grassroots movement of
   innovative pedagogy to help facilitate personalised professional
   development across all staff and (3) changing the physical and virtual
   structure of classrooms to enable more modern pedagogical practices of
   connected and collaborative student-centred learning to occur more
   easily.
   Early stages of implementation have shown this has been an effective
   strategy so far, although stronger resistance than expected by a few
   staff has resulted in some mandatory requirements being set.}},

Abstract = {{This research study examines application of the consensual assessment
   technique (CAT) as a way of assessing creativity and innovativeness in
   21st century technology-pervasive learning environments. Combining the
   emerging technology of ambient intelligence (AmI) with the next
   generation technology of wireless grids, an ambient and emergent 21st
   century learning environment is generated, experienced, and imagined.
   Using a case study approach, research is conducted with students and
   faculty in a postsecondary, virtual distributed educational environment.
   Quantitative and qualitative data are gathered based on the use
   experience of study participants with WeJay social radio, an early stage
   pre-standards wireless grid software application. Multiple methods of
   data collection are used to gather information from participants on
   their use experience. Content analysis and descriptive statistics are
   used for the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data,
   respectively, contributing to emergent insights.
   Through content analysis, idea artifacts are extracted contributing to
   development of a glossary of terms and definitions. The CAT is employed
   as a way of assessing the creativity and innovativeness of ideas
   generated during the use experience; and extending the assessment to
   four other dimensions of the creativity construct - meaning, value,
   transformativeness, and satisfaction. This research adheres to CAT
   processes and procedures, with the use of two or more judges and
   Cronbach's coefficient alpha for reliability. This empirical study makes
   a contribution to the research literature in demonstrating the potential
   for application of the CAT in a number of domains including: AmI,
   wireless grids, digital learning environments, and emerging
   technologies. Further, a key contribution to the literature is made
   through recommendations for adaptation of the CAT to emerging
   technology-pervasive learning environments which are characterized by
   awareness, autonomy, collaboration, and real time data analytics
   potential. Finally, this study invites use of the consensual assessment
   technique in future, larger studies with wireless grids, emerging
   technologies, and autonomy and awareness-based learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{With the enhanced role of technology in academic circles and increased
   access to digital resources, it's much easier for students to cheat than
   ever before. There has been a noticeable increase in academic dishonesty
   and plagiarism. Cut, copy, paste culture is rife in campuses all over.
   While technology has promoted plagiarism, is it capable of providing a
   solution too? Does the onus fall on students alone or are the tutors and
   curriculum designers also to be blamed?
   This paper explores answers to questions on challenges students face in
   completing assignments, reasons that compel students to plagiarise,
   nature of plagiarism and how far do the plagiarism detection software
   like Turnitin help in keeping a check on plagiarism. Questionnaires and
   interviews are used to gather the perspectives of undergraduate level
   Omani EFL students and their tutors on plagiarism with specific
   reference to the role of technology in promoting as well as checking it
   at a tertiary level institution in the Sultanate of Oman. It is
   concluded that there is a profound need to promote academic integrity
   through awareness workshops, sessions on referencing, and exhaustive
   practice in summarising and paraphrasing. It is suggested that care
   should be taken in designing the assignments in a way that prevents
   plagiarism.
   The paper ends with certain hands on approaches adopted by the course
   designers of ESP (English for Special Purposes) courses and tutors to
   prevent and tackle plagiarism.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to review and illustrate the need for
   adequate teacher preparation and standards specifically for the online
   classroom. It examines the current literature, several institutions of
   education and government in a thematic approach which summarizes each
   theme. The explored themes are: 1.) modern ``digital native{''}
   generation of students; 2.) nuances of the online classroom; 3.)
   effective online teaching; 4.) technology today; 5.) teacher preparation
   programs. Observations were synthesized to make objective
   recommendations for the future of online learning. This research
   produced numerous and detailed findings most importantly that a great
   deal of both student and teacher training is required regardless of
   expertise or demographics. Virtual courses should be assessed by
   different quality standards without excessive degradation or
   valorization. Although such changes have been proposed by many experts
   in the field it is rare that such unique standards are taught in teacher
   preparation courses nor implemented in practice. It was also found that
   the instructor must take on a facilitator approach role in a very
   student-centered approach requiring a shift in the student's role from
   passive to active. Effective practices begin with an organized and sound
   pedagogical philosophy which is enhanced but not hindered by innovative
   and thoughtful uses of technology. While the annual online enrollment
   continues to skyrocket, the current quality of virtual teacher education
   is abysmal and adequately trained professionals are scare.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel way of providing continuous education, available from
   any computer, based on multimedia material to support the study of the
   subject General Pathology or Pathophysiology, at the degree of
   Physiotherapy. For future perspectives the target were also to implant
   this way of teaching as an adjunct to traditional and that transcends to
   other degrees, for facilitating the study. Depending on the content, to
   develop new digital resources to complement the subject or matching
   resources with the created new technologies. At last, we decided to
   offer the project material in multiple languages and ways, in order to
   give more coverage in teaching.
   Materials: This idea has its roots in the subject of `Information and
   Communication Technologies' taught at the degree of Physical Therapy and
   has been asked for development, concept maps, video recordings,
   presentations, hypermedia environment, blogs, wikis, exelearning and
   other web 2. 0 tools that will be increasingly used also in the other
   subjects involved in this project depending always on the content. The
   materials for the audio-visual content are the necessary for the design
   and the preparation of the final tools, session recording, reviewing and
   editing these ones. For the audio content the required for the
   preparation of text, audio recording, reviewing and editing. For the
   exercises in interactive context (Virtual Classroom): the necessary for
   the collaborative project design, development, implementation and
   evaluation of the pupils. And the required for the hypertext multimedia
   content design, development and implementation.
   Results: The adaptation and improvement of study digital materials. We
   expect that the improvement in the assimilation of concepts and skills.
   The facilitation for the online resources access. The facilitation of
   the explanation by the teacher, and additionally we expect to adapt all
   these tools to several kind of disabled people and also to adapt them to
   other languages included Valencian.
   Conclusion: The future of the study in General Pathology in
   Physiotherapy can improve with the new proposed multimedia tools.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture is the mainstay of Sri Lankan rural sector which occupies
   75\% of total population. Farmers face constraints in gaining access to
   information and knowledge that could improve their livelihoods to
   maximize crop productivity. Information and Communication Technology
   (ICT)-based farmer education serves as a means for effective transfer of
   knowledge, information and technology to farmers while being engaged in
   their cultivations and enabling them to apply the knowledge directly to
   improve their farming output. To bridge the existing knowledge and
   information gap for farmers, University of Colombo Institute for
   Agro-technology and Rural Sciences, Sri Lanka has built the e-learning
   program (Online Diploma in Agro-technology) for farming community in Sri
   Lanka both in local language and English, which is an ICT-based
   agricultural education system to improve productivity, income and
   socio-economic status by disseminating a fresh expert agricultural
   advice to farmers. Agricultural experts generate lessons based on
   relevant information and knowledge on all agricultural practices
   received in the form of text and digitally converted lessons developed
   on online Learning Management System in Moodle. In 2009, a prototype was
   implemented with 60 farmers all around the country. Participants were
   trained for on-line learning mode. Learner support was provided through
   online tutors. Quality was ensured according to quality standards
   developed by Commonwealth of Learning. This is the first-ever attempt by
   the university system of Sri Lanka in providing an opportunity for
   farming community to pursue further education with ICT to be competitive
   in the Knowledge-Economy. At present around 500 farmers are following
   the program.
   In this article, an analysis of registered farmers' who followed the
   course regarding corresponding effect of following of e-learning program
   is reported. Data were gathered on a pre-tested questionnaire, formal,
   informal discussions and participatory observations. Results were
   analyzed using statistical methods (Percentile and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank
   Test). The built system provided a platform for rural youth who are
   involving in agriculture to have access to meaningful education using
   alternate modes of delivery. Farmers are particularly interested in this
   as our operation is designed in local language without having any fixed
   learning times of the day. Through this it was possible to reach the
   people who have never dreamt of education through online modes. At the
   beginning of the course they had no competency with computer usage and
   ICT applications even some of them never had touched a computer before
   taking up the course. Therefore, it was a major challenge to train them
   for ICT. After an orientation on ICT and Internet usage it was possible
   to train them and ICT was rapidly accepted by farmers. Now they are able
   to use Internet without any difficulty, all of them have e-mail
   accounts. The analysis showed that about 80\% of farmers have followed
   the e-learning program which increases yield, income, knowledge, skills
   and social status. There was a significant relationship existed between
   following the course with income and empowerment of the farmers. On an
   average 75\% of the farmers studied with this course showed a good
   follow-up with positive impacts. ICT based education can be considered
   as a good method of giving information and knowledge for people who are
   not benefited from formal method of education such as farmers to improve
   their socio-economic status.}},

Abstract = {{The global trend of implementing new learning technologies together with
   various faculty policies regarding the use of e-learning tools are
   pushing teachers to apply digital solutions as part of their courses and
   their teaching practices in general. This may, however, cause resentment
   for two main reasons: lack of digital literacy and lack of time. To
   successfully deal with these two issues, we devised a stipend scheme to
   motivate students to get involved in the process of preparing and
   running blended e-learning courses together with their teachers. In the
   role of assistants, such students perform various tasks ranging from
   organizing study materials to filling up test banks to moderating forum
   discussions. In this way, teachers get help in both of the
   above-mentioned areas: they save time by transferring part of the
   workload on these assistants, and they save effort and also avoid much
   frustration by letting the more technology-savvy students deal with
   demanding technology-related issues. The program has been running for
   several years and has been quite successful in promoting innovation and
   new ways of teaching and learning round the faculty.}},

Abstract = {{We are living in an enchantingly, incredibly and probably irrevocably
   tangled world today. Never in the history have so many people been
   connected with so many people in so many ways over so many things as
   they are right now-at this very moment. This is the realm of the digital
   communication because of which we laugh together, cry together and also
   virtually live for each other. This immense potential and possibilities
   of digital technology is consequently giving shape to New media
   communication - a new genre of application which is gradually coming in
   vogue. Digital communication has not only managed to tame speed in
   communication but it has also succeeded in transcending the boundaries
   between written and spoken language. This primarily is because by using
   New Media there is a propensity to digitally develop and edit most of
   the professional and business communication. In doing so, the
   communicators are using visually-stimulating graphics and linking them
   to the gestures and intonations that we see in spoken language. The
   advantage of using such new options to communicate is that it saves time
   and money along with enabling the communicator to target many receivers
   at once. But sometimes these techniques may not work due to issues like
   digital divide. This is especially true of ambivalent and developing
   contexts like India. In such instances, communication has to be designed
   to suit the audience or in other words-get customized. However,
   customized communication too is a widely used notion; what has to be
   pushed forth in contexts like India is the need to address demographic
   uniqueness of micro environments. Customizing the tools of communication
   is a huge challenge both in terms of resources involved as well as
   content creation and transmission. Further, new and faster ways of
   communication may also damage a communicator's reputation and
   productivity if the communicator will end up conveying the wrong message
   in a hurry. Digital options of communication like the electronic mail,
   forums, electronic bulletin board systems, chat, and so forth, tend to
   expose a communicator to many strangers rather rapidly. This in itself
   is a hazard and too many opinions on a particular communique can easily
   confuse a communicator who is not seasoned enough to handle this. At the
   same time, we must realize that man is essentially a gregarious being.
   Social relationships and responsibilities are indispensible for human
   survival and progress. Communication enables man to ever remain a
   capable and sensitive social being. Communication also has the potential
   to make man more responsible as well as conscious and aware. However, it
   is not possible to ignore that we can communicate without the help of
   technology any more.
   Technology aided, enabled and enhanced communication is now the dominant
   order of the day. New technologies can improve the quality of life of
   all through innovative teaching - a package that is conveniently being
   referred to as `infotainment'. It will, at this stage, be perhaps
   redundant to deliberate on how our communication has progressed from the
   traditional family and community sessions centred around star-gazing,
   log-burning, grass-picking social gatherings, storytelling sessions and
   the like to the omnipresent and indispensible ICT borne and aided
   communication, or how the mobile phone and the internet have come to
   almost replace the longhand written, perfume sprayed letters that use to
   connect human existence on a plethora of. platforms ranging from
   politics to intimate relationships But at this stage, we need to
   ardently realize and take stock of the possibilities that will once
   again bring back the flutter of the lashes, the arched eyebrows and the
   naughtiness of winks into our communication borne and vectored by
   technology -especially the digital device. Here, one need not refer to
   the animation and graphics options available at the computers and mobile
   platforms that the generation `Y{''} has adapted so well. Such
   innovation in digital communication thus would primarily be an attempt
   to incorporate and capture the subtle humane flavor that will add
   intrinsic value to our communication and the way we relate to each
   other.
   We must now toy with possibilities of innovations in technology-aided
   and enabled communication that would merge the traditional with the yet
   to be. Improvement cannot be confined to mere notions of bit and bytes,
   mother boards, RAMs and configurations. In an era when the young
   generation is extremely digital-friendly, the role of new forms of media
   in children's and adolescents' cognitive and emotional development must
   not be overlooked. Educating today's generation of learners requires an
   understanding of the new digital environment into which they were born.
   But digitalization cannot remain the sole concern of Information
   Technology driven thought process. We need to constantly remember that
   we are progressively moving towards a realm where quality of life and
   living will be by and large determined by how well we connect with the
   world at large. Connecting is a fundamental principle of communication
   and holds equally good for digital media as well. What becomes specific
   are the efforts required to make this connection happen at the pulsating
   humane level. Where the virtual communication takes cognizance of the
   human tears and smiles in the same manner as a thinking, emoting,
   intuiting, and a sensitive communicator would do in an instance of
   interpersonal communication. However, this is expected to happen in
   addition to the entire bonanza that digital communication is already
   offering. It is, as mentioned earlier, not just the technologies that
   concern us, rather the social change that is concomitant as well as the
   consequential which must be our prime concern. Simultaneously, the need
   to pay attention to capture the subtle human factors which will lead to
   the real time `connect' between the communicator and the target
   population - especially in the domains of education in developing
   contexts like India will also become important for us. Once this package
   is on the offer, the use of digital communication for education and
   development will become indispensible especially in developing contexts
   like the Asian subcontinent.}},

Abstract = {{The modern urban environment interlinks social and morphological
   transformations that determine powerful mutations in the landscape. In a
   time of ``dematerialization{''}, to enhance the value of the place
   identity is a Communication Design aim: the current necessity is to find
   some new suitable languages and tool able to describe the contemporary
   city in its complexity. It is argued the strategic necessity of
   Communication Design projects able to give back meaning to places
   through the creation innovative interfacing between the visitors and the
   places. The model of formats, before designed for traditional media, are
   changing their structure and are implemented to give answer to the new
   models of digital communication. New media and digital devices, as smart
   phones and tablets, allow new access to information fruition; in fact
   the contents are becoming even more dynamic, interactive and
   participative. Since many years the Communication Design, Multimedia
   Format Research Unit of Indaco Department (Politecnico di Milano) is
   developing researches and projects in order to implement formats and
   systems to communicate urban spaces.
   Among several European and international design projects we might
   mention those most oriented to represent the sense of places and guide
   to experiential exploration (e.g. digital touristic guide, sound tours,
   emotional maps, Augmented Reality applications, etc.). These projects
   use experimental, traditional and artistic forms in order to communicate
   the city transformations. We can map and analyze the selected project
   through functional features, properties and communicative aims. Our
   research has led to the identification of a strong tendency to media
   convergence. The method used to map communication design projects for
   urban space and their features were applied in the didactical laboratory
   and Master thesis.
   An interesting example of master degree project for place exploration
   was applied on Lomellina, a non-tourist area of the Lombardia region in
   Italy. The project used interesting visual representation of the
   selected area in order to organize an unconventional tourist guide.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we give account of an experience which has been carried on
   starting from a master degree dissertation and then transferred upon a
   Bac level third year class in ``Innovative Instruments for Design
   Representation{''} during the first semester of academic year 2012-2013.
   As a preliminary path, the students have been given a workshop where
   different techniques and semantic results in picture taking has been
   shown and discussed.
   Document or interpretation? The debate is still alive and more heated
   than ever, especially given the new opportunities offered by the advent
   of digital - from the eighties - which actually coincided with the death
   of historical photography: it is missing the negative - The real ``deus
   ex machina{''} of the photographic representation has disappeared and
   has been replaced by a sequence of numerical data.
   There is no more similarity between reality and its representation, as
   both were attributable to the negative, the image has been transformed
   from loyal into disloyal. The digital technology has also brought a
   great revolution constituted by the merger between the still camera and
   the camera: the decisive moment and the whole motion share the same
   instrument.
   Between documents and interpretation in the work of contemporary
   photographers of architecture today it preveals the category of the
   story, achieved through the series of images in sequence.
   The goal of this experience is to let the students learn to build up a
   set of pictures which could give a complete coverage of the outstanding
   details of each architecture they have to deal with. This is important
   for two different aims: survey for preservation and preparation of a
   data set for semantic analisys, towards a possible project in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Technological reality and broadband penetration varies in each country.
   Therefore, we consider an added value conducting this experience in
   Latin America, an area in which technological development is less than
   in Europe and the Western world. Thus, we created a digital newspaper
   (De la Urbe Digital), using necessarily technological tools (led by the
   Internet) and with the active and essential participation of students.
   The used methodology for this innovative experience is constructivism,
   formulated in the 80s and 90s of the twentieth century. We consider this
   the most appropriate methodology to reshape the teaching of journalism,
   communication sciences and, in general, the social sciences in
   university. Thanks to constructivism, we readily adapt the actual
   conditions of practice as the proper academic environment. In this way,
   and always in a technological focus, we applied the axiom of learning by
   doing, implicit in the construction of a practical and theoretical
   knowledge.
   From this experience, different conclusions emerge. On one hand,
   published press and audiovisual resist to disappear separately, although
   in the Internet environment multimedia integration is the natural
   expression of content. The resistance came from both teachers and
   students. Moreover, technological content should be integrated in a more
   active and practical way to determine what means require digital
   journalist training and market trends. In Europe this adaptation is
   faster than in Latin America.}},

Abstract = {{Labor market insertion for graduates in Economics and Business
   Administration has become one of the greatest threats in the current
   economic recession. One solution to this threat is to start a business
   on their own, that is, the so-called Entrepreneurial Economy. This paper
   presents the experiences of the University of Alcala Business Department
   teachers, with undergraduate students of Economics and Business
   Administration in teaching activities developed in previous courses in
   order to encourage entrepreneurship and to equip students with the tools
   and information sources necessary for the implementation of new business
   projects. Specifically, the sample size amounts to 100 students studying
   their first year of degree.
   All developed activities are intended to facilitate the learning of
   business creation process characteristics and disseminate experiences,
   resources, virtual simulators and web links that facilitate
   entrepreneurial dynamics. That is, tasks affect those resources and
   procedures to better disclose the benefits of undertaking a business
   initiative. These experiences, from the educational point of view, are
   an interdisciplinary and complementary integration; given the range of
   dimensions that entrepreneurship concept embraces ( accounting, finance,
   human resources, environment analysis, business strategy, etc.).
   Furthermore, entrepreneurship simulators treatment, enterprise databases
   and web tools will impact both professional development and motivation
   in grade students. The ultimate goal of all activities is to implement
   strategies to stimulate effort, promoting the ability to learn on their
   own and with others, and develop thinking and decision skills to
   facilitate student autonomy, trust and personal initiatives.
   Specifically, students over a semester must prepare a business plan that
   loops through all the steps required for business creation and all basic
   business functions, from production to promotion of goods or services.
   They must present orally the business plan relying on all the necessary
   resources, such as web pages creation, digital media commercials
   recording or the business dramatization. Thus, students speaking and
   communication skills are improved. Regarding students assessment, a
   co-evaluation process has been developed, where the students assess
   their own work, the work as a whole and specifically played by each
   workgroups member. This will involve students get a 360 degrees
   assessment culture. Finally, some of the most innovative projects
   presented by the students and the experiences of students who have
   decided to move the business plan from paper to reality are related.}},

Abstract = {{By increasingly complementing traditional classes with innovative
   computer-based tools, institutions encourage students to foster the
   active assimilation of additional knowledge in order for meaningful
   learning to occur. Yet, despite an increase in examining the
   effectiveness of computer-based learning tools and traditional methods
   both individually or comparing one another, research has not fully
   addressed which factors determine the assimilation of additional
   contents when traditional and innovative methods are complementarily
   used. In this study, we analyze the effect of three variables in the
   learning process: the prior knowledge gained from lectures, the
   students' attitude toward using an innovative tool, and the effective
   use of this tool. The study of the effects of these factors on the
   assimilation of complementary knowledge is particularly relevant in the
   multimedia environment. Specifically, video podcasts, which are defined
   as video files that are distributed in a digital format through the
   Internet using personal computers or mobile devices, are evolving
   rapidly in higher education due to their pedagogical possibilities such
   as providing supplementary materials to improve learning. The aim of
   this study is to provide useful insights about the complementarity
   between traditional and innovative methods in teaching practice.
   Specifically, we explore the value of video podcasts in the learning
   process, investigating the above-mentioned factors that may account for
   the assimilation of additional knowledge when video podcasts are used as
   complementary tools to lectures. Drawing on the absorptive capacity
   theory and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, we develop a
   combined conception of the process by which students improve their
   capacity to assimilate learning material provided by video podcasts.
   After designing and creating an enhanced video podcast that contains
   supplementary material to lectures related to an specific course in a
   Business Management program, students were asked to fill in a survey. We
   reported data from 179 participants. Analyses were conducted using
   LISREL 8.80, and the usual steps for doing structural equation modeling
   were followed for the development of a model that represents the
   hypothesized relationships. The results showed that all hypothesized
   relationships were supported. Findings demonstrated the positive effects
   of prior stored knowledge and effective use of video podcasts on
   students' capacity to assimilate additional knowledge presented in video
   podcasts. It was also found that the attitude toward using video
   podcasts positively affects the effective use of this tool. In this
   paper we also discuss the results and the main contributions to research
   and practice.}},

Abstract = {{The value of design has grown far beyond its traditional role as merely
   a contributor to the well being of society and has been recognised as
   key to the global innovation process and a key to sustainable long term
   economic development. For many organisations, design has increasingly
   become a strategic enhancement tool. These developments are significant
   because designers and their education become a focus in newly introduced
   economic agendas and National Design Policies in many countries (e.g.
   Denmark, India, Singapore). This has led to a process of benchmarking
   design education in various countries to ensure that higher design
   education is preparing the designer needed for the 21st century.
   Throughout this process similar findings emerged and specific to digital
   media design education it was revealed that digital media design
   graduates are arguably not sufficiently prepared to bridge the gap
   between university and industry {[}1], {[}2], {[}3], {[}4].
   While universities are under increasing pressure to demonstrate that
   their graduates are ready to proactively navigate the world of work
   {[}5], it is clear that there are ongoing issues that need to be
   addressed in order to enable digital media design students to add value
   to industry and business. In response, some recommend stronger links to
   industry to better prepare students for the demands of the market {[}1],
   {[}6], {[}7], {[}8]. At the same time critical voices question how much
   should market/industry dictate pedagogy {[}9], {[}10].
   In context of these ambiguous views the question if integrating industry
   into the undergraduate digital media design learning environment result
   in better preparing students for industry practice was explored. In this
   process various strategies of how industry and also community could be
   involved were identified and are part of a newly developed alternative
   learning and teaching approach in design education-the POOL Model
   framework. The framework was implemented and tested in the Bachelor of
   New Media Arts' digital media design major at the School of Creative
   Arts at James Cook University. Findings from a research period of two
   years are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{During the last century the world experienced many changes and
   developments, which contributed to the sprout of technological
   expansion. It would not be perverse to assert that the reflections and
   the impacts of such expansion are evident in every aspect of life and
   are influencing especially the production tools and the New Economy.
   These changes sprouting all over the World and being based on
   information and communication technologies have without doubt started to
   effect academic institutions and the concept of education. In order to
   design and conduct a sustainable and student oriented education one has
   to apply ICT's on the class design.
   The new generation is called the ``digital natives{''} and they are the
   ones who are very accustomed with new technologies. That is what makes
   the innovative and sustainable education design an essential part of the
   new educational system. The concept called ``innovation{''} has taken
   off to be heard and applied across every aspect of daily life, and is
   seen in literature under the headline of ``innovation in education{''}.
   Deriving from the basis of the philosophy on innovation in education,
   with an objective to reach the students from the digital age, a class
   with content compatible with web 2.0 technologies was decided to be
   created and developed.
   In this pronouncement, the data obtained from the classes attending
   Yeditepe University, Social Sciences Institute, Integrated Marketing
   Communications MBA Program will be shared, commented and the limitations
   will be further highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{The field of education is experiencing a rapid shift as internet-enabled
   distance learning becomes more widespread. Often, traditional classroom
   teaching pedagogical techniques assume competencies and application
   expertise that may or may not be present in a group of students. A
   traditional college undergraduate entry-level class might see a student
   attrition rate of 5-10\% or higher, some simply from the students
   inability to use required business office software applications to do
   the required work. Colleges and Universities have a vested interest in
   ``biting the bullet{''} and ensuring that their students are literate in
   the use of business applications software for word processing,
   spreadsheets, presentations and database access. This is because: a) the
   students are effectively part of the institutions networks as end-users,
   and b) because preparing students for life after college is an implied
   and accepted part of the role of the educational institution.
   Various faculty at Mount Olive College and Triton College are addressing
   the challenge of technology/business applications literacy by
   implementing a new e-learning solution. A customized, self-paced,
   web-based end user digital security awareness tutorial has been created.
   This interactive learning activity reinforces student retention by
   providing questions at the end of each learning module to enhance
   retention. As students become proficient at using security best
   practices, their proficiency, confidence, and student engagement in
   learning the class material increases. Since more classes require the
   use of computing technology in completing assignments, students enhance
   their progress throughout their undergraduate program and increasing the
   probability of program completion. Faculty at Mount Olive College and
   Triton College have developed a research tool in order to study student
   perceptions of the online tutorial's effectiveness.
   The course instructor is able to shift their time and energy from
   ``putting out fires{''} to focusing on higher-level feedback on
   assignments and administrative functions. Since more classes require the
   use of application software in completing assignments, students take
   this newly acquired problem solving approach to other situations and
   courses, enhancing their progress throughout their undergraduate program
   and increasing the probability of program completion. This survey has
   been developed to study and quantify the student perception of the
   usefulness of the MS Office 2010 tutorial.}},

Abstract = {{In which ways ICTs are effectively used in the classroom by teachers and
   students? For which purposes? At what extend their could change teaching
   and learning experience? These are the main questions that the paper
   aims to answer in order to identify several models of innovation in
   educational systems. To reach these purposes, the paper presents
   ``Cl@ssi 2.0{''} project, launched within the wider ``National Plan
   Digital School{''} by the Italian Ministry of Education in 2009 and
   lasted three years. The project has proposed to finance the set up of
   technologically advanced classes (called Cl@ssi 2.0) in the secondary
   school in order to create teaching and learning environments suitable
   for constant and diffused use of technology in everyday school life and
   to verify, at the end of three years, which impact may occur on
   educational processes. The paper focuses on data collected from
   logbooks, a monitoring quali-quantitative instrument, administered
   online in each of three years, trough which Cl@ssi 2.0' s teachers have
   reported their personal experiences, describing the use of ICT in
   classroom and expressing opinions and judgments on their impact on
   teaching and learning processes. The longitudinal analysis provides
   documentary evidence of the evolution of the project allowing to
   identify if, and in which way, the continuous use of technologies has
   produced different results in comparison with the first steps of the
   project. The paper focuses particularly on the impact of ICT on three
   dimensions strictly related each others: 1) teaching styles and
   practices; 2) classroom climate and relationship between teachers and
   students as well among peers; 3) students' learning modalities and
   achievements. The essay ends underlining that, besides the presence of
   ICT in classroom is an important condition to activate some changes in
   ``traditional{''} ways in which teaching and learning processes have
   occurred, nevertheless it isn't sufficient to produce alone a real
   innovation in schools. Such innovation's potential derived by
   technology, in fact, requires to take into account also organizational
   and institutional dimensions as well to carefully consider features and
   attitudes of involved teachers and students.}},

Abstract = {{The present project is a proposal to design and develop multimedia
   materials to be implemented in the new educational degree in
   Physiotherapy (Universitat de Valencia, Spain). These materials have
   been developed from a multidisciplinary perspective in the field of
   Health Sciences. Different departments of this field such as
   Physiotherapy, Nursing, Social Psychology, and Physical Education have
   contributed to design and develop this innovative project. Today, it's
   widely known that information and communication technologies (ICTs) in
   the European Network of Health Sciences in Higher Education have become
   and acquired a relevant role for professional, social and educational
   objectives.
   The origin of this project takes place in the web 2.0 that has been
   already used successfully as an educational tool in the subject (ICTs)
   in the degree of Physiotherapy. From this previous experience, we have
   tried to implement the contents to achieve two specific or main
   objectives:
   1) Firstly, we have developed these new digital resources to complement
   and adapted them to the different subjects.
   2) On the other hand, in this project we have take into account the
   existing resources and adapt them to the new technology. The materials
   developed for the different subjects are the following:
   Psychology of Disability. In this subject we have developed a specific
   glossary of terms and basic concepts of Psychology using podcasts.
   Biomechanics and Applied Physics. In this subject, we have elaborated an
   interactive auto evaluation questionnaire to enable the students to
   consolidate the acquired knowledge.
   Kinesitherapy. We have used some videos following a logical structure to
   allow the physiotherapist to develop and even evaluate chronologically
   their work taking into account the difficulties of the exercises.
   Hydrotherapy. For this discipline, we have also designed some video
   recordings so as to show different approaches
   General Pathology. In this subject, an interactive questionnaire has
   been adapted, using audio visual resources to evaluate the basic
   concepts of the subject.
   Physiotherapy in the Respiratory System. Related to this subject, we
   have designed an interactive webquest, where students can get their
   first experience with this subject.
   First Aid Techniques for Physiotherapy. Some audio-visual recording
   materials have been developed to show the adequate techniques learned
   during the academic year.
   The results obtained have provided us enough useful information to
   design a blog to gather information from the different courses mentioned
   above so as to carry out different interactive activities.}},

Abstract = {{The topic of the impact of Web 2.0 ecologies on the learning contexts of
   PhD candidates is of particular interest for innovation in higher
   education teaching and learning. However, this theme results so far
   underesearched in literature, in particular in the Italian higher
   education setting.
   The present paper reports selected findings from an exploratory study
   investigating how individual doctoral researchers cope with competing
   institution-led and self-organized, analogue and digital opportunities
   for learning. This article is based on preliminary results of an online
   questionnaire which was delivered between September and October 2012
   across three Italian universities. The questionnaire aimed to describe
   the components (people, resources, tools, people and related
   interactions) of the emerging learner-centered ``ecology of
   resources{''} {[}1], characterizing individual doctoral students
   variously dealing with their needs of support and striving to achieve
   their being `independent researcher'. The surveyed Italian doctoral
   students seem to be usual adopters of social media in their everyday
   life, but there are also signs that they are currently adopting tools
   and services available in the open Web to undertake activities usually
   required in their doctoral programs. The research participants show a
   pragmatic attitude towards the Web 2.0 services and state to be prompted
   to use such tools mainly by `occasional, practical needs' related to
   their research activity. Although very few respondents actually curate
   an `academic' presence in social media, they generally credit the social
   Web with a wider, still unexploited potential to improve some research
   tasks. Finally, it is worth noting that the provision or lack of
   specific research training on these emergent tools plays a key role in
   the indicated motivations. This early portrait of the emerging learning
   ecologies of current doctoral researchers sparks cues for reflecting on
   the extent to which the design of formation of future scholars should
   take into account changes occurring in learning spaces, also in the
   light of new forms of networked scholarship being pioneered in the
   social Web.}},

Abstract = {{Attending to the Bologna Process and the European Higher Education Space
   criteria as well as their common goals to improve the European Higher
   Education and the employability of our students, a new educational
   experience has been developed. This innovative experience consists of
   carrying out a series of competitive strategies among the students of
   the subject ``Digital Electronics{''} that belongs to the matter
   ``Industrial Electronics{''} in the Degree of Electronics and
   Automation{''} given at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (UPV).
   The motivation of this experience is to make the students acquire some
   specific skills such as ``the ability to solve problems with initiative,
   making decisions, creativity, critical thinking and communication and
   knowledge transfer{''}. All these skills must be acquired in the
   Industrial Engineering matters. In this way, the students that are
   attending the subject in the present year (2012-2013) have been involved
   in a competition experience in order to build the most energy-efficient
   prototype to a specific application.
   The idea is to develop a competition on equal terms between the
   participating groups, based on a set of basic standards and
   specifications for the prototype to be built. In the particular case of
   the developed experience in this course, students were invited to take
   part in groups of 4 people. They were told that the aim of the
   competition was to build a solar energy generation prototype, managed by
   a microcontroller and based on the same mini Solar panel model. Thus,
   they were given a term of two months to construct the model. Next, the
   models will be exhibited and the competition will start by checking the
   efficiency of each presented prototype. These prototypes will be ranked
   later according to their efficiency and then, the best three ones would
   be rewarded with electronic and computer equipment besides the
   assessment attending to their efficiency, originality, presentation and
   applicability. This assessment will be done, not only by the staff of
   the course, but also considering the opinion surveys to the students
   that take part in the competition.
   This experience is based on other more basic carried out in previous
   courses and seems to be kindly accepted by the students that are taking
   part massively in it and it is a very good indicator of the interest in
   this activity. Moreover, in order to complement the activity assessment,
   students are told to fulfill a survey to assess its suitability and
   interest to achieve the intended objectives. In the end, the feedback
   received on previous experiences has been very positive and this
   encourages us to continue with this kind of activities in the classroom.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of the Laboratory Prototypes of the Politecnico di
   Milano {[}1] is part of the much broader initiative promoted by
   humanitarian organization Build Our Nation, for the design of a village
   in support of socially marginalized women in Congo.
   The project involved students from four Schools of Engineering and
   Architecture from three different countries (Scotland, Spain, Italy) and
   the results have been demonstrated in an intensive workshop held at the
   Venice Biennale 3 to 14 September 2012.
   Here were exposed physical models used for the project, developed at the
   Laboratory Prototypes, on a regional scale and detail as a means of
   innovative facilitated communication of the project.
   The main aim of creating a settlement for the complete autonomy of the
   inhabitants, from the standpoint of both environmental and production,
   has been developed with two integrated solutions (in them the physical
   model is found to be particularly useful): first, the direct
   construction by women taking up their duties, using construction
   products popular in the area and essentially based on different
   processes of bamboo, second, the creation of jobs for women in the same
   territory by developing the entire production cycle, from cultivation to
   the construction of buildings.
   The innovative use of bamboo and in particular node assembly for the
   construction of the buildings have been well illustrated in the workshop
   of the Biennale through three physical models which will be detailed
   here.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of demand for information, both digital and analog,
   stimulated by the students of the Architectural Preservation subject
   (School of Architecture, Polytechnic University of Valencia) has led to
   the project described in the following lines.
   The first results of the educational innovation carried out in the
   academic year 2011/2012 are reflected in the framework of the project
   called ``REScursos{''}. As a preliminary stage, the teacher determines a
   first diagnosis and prognosis of the teaching process supported by
   digital tools. In this case the aim is to provide students with the
   proper skills in order to manage bibliographic references, both digital
   and analog. This process generates a directory of web resources,
   organized and structured according to the requirements of the subject,
   in collaboration with the students themselves. In fact, recently it
   became common the use of digital tools and platforms associated with the
   analog teaching, so that the student can be directed and guided in the
   acquisition of skills and abilities. On another level, the configuration
   of ``REScursos{''} itself, tries to combine suggestions made by students
   with information provided by teachers.
   In this way, a double objective is achieved: on the one hand to perform
   a structured range of digital resources, and on the other establish a
   more efficient organization in the management of bibliographic
   references. Therefore, the project intends to give an answer to the
   growth of demand for digital resources, asked by the students of
   Architectural Preservation. This means that, in all this process, the
   student acquires a dynamic role, providing resources and proposing web
   pages, always monitored by teachers and colleagues.
   Finally, the aim of the project is not to replace digital resources for
   analog ones, but, on the contrary, it shows how the traditional
   bibliographic resources require an in depth knowledge that sometimes can
   be provided only by the web and its real-time updates. The advantage of
   the directory is based on the unlimited possibility of feedback from the
   subject. In this way, outdated pages can be replaced by others, proposed
   by students or teachers, generating a useful system of resources that
   can be refreshed over the years.}},

Abstract = {{The unbelievable speed of technology development initiated a massive
   scale fancy of technical innovations after the pioneering industrial
   revolution. It is the very first time people recognized that the
   positive sectors of new technology benefit their life and at the same
   time, however, its disadvantages had brought a controversial debate with
   respect to the interest balance which asked for scholars and
   legislators' attention as well. Digital right management (DRM), as a
   kind of technical tool which protects and manages intellectual property
   information and material during the process of creation, communication,
   distribution and exploitation of the digital content, is posing an
   immense influence especially on physical copyright regime and
   traditional scrupulous balancing of interest between authors and the
   general public. The situation that the general public explore copyright
   materials happened in digital environment seems much knotty to deal with
   than that in physical world.
   DRM scheme strictly controls the public's access to and further use of
   digital content as a result that right holders are able to overstep the
   boundary of their specific right which is protected by copyright.
   Lacking of standardization is acknowledged by scholars and professional
   insiders as the crucial problems nowadays nagged by DRM technologies and
   the matter to be solved promptly by DRM software designers and
   legislators. Previous researches have explored the relationship between
   DRM technology and the general public's access to the copyrighted works
   and other information knowledge in digital environment as well as the
   current legal dilemma encountered by various countries' legislation, but
   little attention has been paid to the part of DRM technology or
   technological protection measure which is DRM's main element in
   worldwide modern education development.
   This paper aims to clarify erroneous remarks about DRM scheme in the
   context of digital educational environment based on literature analysis
   and comparative research adopted. The objective of the paper is to state
   the deficiencies about the present practices on balancing the
   relationship between the copyright holders' benefit and the public'
   demand of information. As the influence from digital technology on
   copyright system has not completely revealed and copyright system itself
   has not yet fully responded to these impact, either. The existing
   situation that unbalanced interest under educational system and chaotic
   applicability of copyright provisions is treated the requisite stage
   towards a perfect copyright world. These findings highlight the
   potential attention of educational access to digital copyrighted works
   in spite of DRM's excessive obstructing.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The chapter provides the reader with an overview of the impact
   technology has on literacy education and makes a case for utilizing the
   technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework for
   incorporating instructional technology in the reading clinic. The focus
   then shifts to how instructional technologies can be utilized to enhance
   literacy learning during a one-on-one tutoring program.
   Methodology/approach The author describes the changing nature of
   literacy instruction and the need for 21st century skills for teacher
   candidates and the students they serve. Pedagogical possibilities and
   instructional expectations are shared through discussion of the
   technology activities used by teaching candidates participating in
   school-based reading clinics.
   Practical implications In addition to descriptions of how teacher
   candidates utilized technology within their reading clinic instruction,
   the author notes affordances and challenges of integrating technology in
   oneon-one instructional settings. Instructional uses of eReaders,
   laptops, and iPads for literacy learning are noted in the chapter for
   possible replication in other reading clinic programs. Future directions
   for additional research are included.
   Social implications The chapter suggests how the university reading
   clinic can provide opportunities for teacher candidates to work
   collaboratively with students to incorporate technology into literacy
   learning activities. Working with technology in a tutoring environment
   serves as a foundation for incorporating digital literacy instruction in
   teacher candidates' future classrooms and ensuring that students have
   the 21st century skills necessary for college and employment.}},

Abstract = {{Broadband Wireless Access is a strategic opportunity for mobile
   operators which aim to provide connectivity in digital divide areas, in
   order to accelerate speed of deployment and save in installation costs.
   This paper presents an innovative approach to access the end user,
   relying on infrastructural integration of femtocellular technology with
   existing cabled network. Usually, the adoption of Femtocell Access
   Points, operating in the licensed cellular bands typically designed to
   be used in SOHO, improves the radio coverage and the building
   penetration of the existing mobile networks, based on macrocells. In the
   proposed solution, the peculiar functionality of femtocells is further
   improved using a MATV/SMATV cabled infrastructure which facilitates the
   signal connection inside the building. The potentiality of the solution
   is even more evident, taking into account the growing interest towards
   the possible deployment of new mobile technologies, like LTE in both the
   last portion of the UHF band V and the GSM frequency band, resulting
   from the re-farming process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the influence of digital technologies on media
   networks, in particular how they affect the traditional gatekeeping
   model. Wireless communications are the hot point of all digital
   technologies, and their application to the transmission of the Olympic
   Games is a milestone for the global creative industries every two/ four
   years. The authors argue that the research and innovation (R\&I)
   industries' involvement with the media industries needs to be
   reconsidered within the framework of an updated media gatekeeping model.
   To investigate this research question, results are reported from a case
   study examining the gatekeeping processes in the 2008 Olympic Games in
   Beijing, and the subsequent Olympics up to 2016. Results show the need
   for a new gatekeeping model that takes into consideration the impact of
   digital technologies, especially wireless communications. Additionally,
   new decision models regarding innovation investment in the global media
   industry are suggested by the impact of R\&I on the media gatekeeping
   model itself.}},

Abstract = {{``The Times They Are a-Changin{''} as Bob Dylan sang. In the electronics
   industry, many changes have been observed such as the shift from
   ``integral to modular{''} and from ``closed to open{''}. As a result of
   these changes, Japanese electronics firms (e-firms) have lost not only
   their profitability but also their competitiveness. Now, they are no
   more than the followers who are struggling to catch up with the winners
   of the ``modular and open{''} way, e.g. Microsoft, Intel, Google, HP,
   Dell or Samsung.
   But ``The Times They Are a-Changin{''} again! Several phenomena
   occurring in the smart-phone/tablet and cloud computing markets are
   signs of new era in the electronics industry. It is not a simple
   recurrence of the shift to ``modular and open{''} or ``integral and
   closed{''}. Indeed, it is another type of change, namely
   ``productcentric to human-centric{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is opening avenues for
   disseminating content in innovative and effective manners to learners.
   The overarching construct namely technology, pedagogy and the digital
   content are key elements for the successful integration of ICT in school
   settings. In this paper we investigate pedagogy and more precisely the
   readiness of educators to adopt technology in their teaching. A
   questionnaire was administered to 118 mathematics educators working in
   95 secondary schools. The results reveal that mathematics educators in
   Mauritius are regular users of computers at home and are much willing to
   integrate this tool in their teaching process if a conducive environment
   is provided in the schools, including facilities, training and
   motivation. Furthermore educators strongly perceived ICT affordances for
   learning benefits and believed that students can learn mathematics
   better with ICT tools.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroaesthetic Resonance evolved from a mature body of research
   investigating `Aesthetic Resonance'. Music Making, Digital Painting,
   Robotic control and Video Game control via movement alone is catalyst of
   the work where motivated fun through ludic engagement is core.
   Innovation of apparatus and methods in non-formal rehabilitation via
   matching digital media plasticity to human performance plasticity are
   foci. System adaptions according to abilities offer a generic solution.
   Performance art learning ( stage and interactive installations - where
   solo and multiple `actors' participated) is a thread in the work. A
   published patent and commercial product resulted alongside intervention
   models for in-action and on-action reflections, actions, and
   evaluations. This paper addresses the issues of innate aesthetic value
   by philosophically and contextually questioning `what is art' and
   `artistic value'.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of optical recognition technologies to
   augment the physical design space and its aesthetic drivers with a
   myriad of design performance variables available through advanced
   environmental analysis simulations to create an integrated and
   collaborative high-performance design platform. By utilizing various
   hardware and software systems, this design platform can capture critical
   physical information to be translated into a 3D digital environment
   where the digital model can be interpreted and various analysis
   information can be extracted. Once the essential 3D visual information
   and measured analysis data is generated it can then be displayed back
   into the design platform in near real-time to be visualized, evaluated,
   negotiated, and acted upon. This has the greatest benefit to the design
   process because these decisions are occurring at the moment of design
   where they have the highest probability of affecting decisions that have
   the greatest impact on cost, energy use, and overall project design.}},

Abstract = {{The institutional commitment to research that was hitherto left to
   individual researchers and few research centres came with the University
   Strategy, `Shape Our Future'. The Strategy, with clear mission and
   vision of research excellence, provided support for the development of a
   policy framework, subsequent research, output management infrastructure,
   and associated processes. This paper has reviewed these developments and
   emerging challenges posed by resource intensive paper based processes
   that need to be addressed inline with increasing aspirations for digital
   scholarship. Efforts to address these challenges are largely to reduce
   intensity of resource use inline with digital scholarship aspirations
   that embrace information and communication technology (ICT). However,
   the dynamism of developments and innovations in ICTs are characterized
   by high frequency of system obsolesce that could be costly to emerging
   resource poor Universities, particularly proprietary systems. This leads
   to the need of embracing the use of open source ware by investing in
   human resource development for capacity building and sustenance of
   digital scholarship.}},

Abstract = {{The University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) completed a
   project to transform traditional, print-centric library space into an
   open, technologyenabled learning commons. The library's print collection
   was dramatically reduced to create a new Collaborative Learning Commons
   in areas formerly occupied by bookshelves. Removal of books, journals,
   and shelving was carefully planned based on the needs of students,
   researchers, and clinicians. Following the print collection reduction,
   the new physical commons development included changing walls, replacing
   flooring, adding electrical and network connections, installing advanced
   technology resources, and using innovative furnishings to promote
   collaboration. The major accomplishments of this project include
   repurposing of library space to serve modern health science student
   needs through the creation of vibrant meeting and workspaces, expansion
   of access to educational technologies, and increased access to library
   scholarly information resources via a significant investment in
   electronic resources.}},

Abstract = {{The Drake University Virtual Language Studies (VLS) program was an
   innovative, network-based instructional and mentorship program, focusing
   on language and culture learning. In short, the VLS curriculum contained
   an integrated mix of formal instruction and non-formal approaches and
   activities to foster language and culture development and set the stage
   for a lifetime of language and culture learning in Russian and Chinese
   languages at multiple academic levels.
   The VLSconsortial infrastructure involved multiple major technology
   systems-Adobe Connect for virtual classrooms, Moodle for course
   management, and WordPress for online publishing, community-building, and
   electronic portfolios.
   The VLS approach focused not only on linguistic ability, but also on the
   broader set of complex skills, strategies, dispositions, and integrated
   understandings that a digitally connected world makes possible and that
   language and culture learning in the 21st Century requires.
   VLS provided a model that supports study in less commonly taught
   languages at smaller and medium size colleges and universities, and that
   can also inform distance education or self-directed on-line study of
   languages in a broad range of institutions, organizations, and agencies.}},

Pages = {{241-260}},
Abstract = {{How people learn informally and contextually within cultural
   institutions has been researched considerably. Various learning theories
   that are appropriate for museum visitors have been thoroughly discussed
   and broadly published. Falk and Dierking's Contextual Model of Learning
   (CML) introduced in the 1990s has had a tremendous influence on the
   theory of museum education. The focus on object-centered learning has
   been shifted to visitor-centered learning in the field of museum
   education. Museum educational professionals and researchers believe that
   this shift empowers museum visitors to construct and customize their
   museum learning experiences at their own pace and style. Moreover,
   utilizing technology to promote exhibitions and to deliver information
   about museum collections has become a common strategy for museums. In
   2008, Falk and Dierking further explained the relationship between their
   CML and technology currently being adapted by the museum to enhance
   visitors' informal learning experiences. However, there is a need to
   examine how technology can be used to enhance visitors' learning
   experiences in a museum. Hence, this chapter poses the following
   questions: 1) How has technology been incorporated into museum galleries
   to enhance visitors' understanding of exhibitions since 50s? 2) What
   digital technologies have been adopted by cultural institutions to
   better serve diverse visitors, and what can this technology offer museum
   visitors for their informal learning? 3) What are the challenges and
   concerns for utilizing digital technology?
   To answer these questions, this chapter first reviews the development
   and the historical uses of technology in cultural institutions with
   sample cases. Secondly, this chapter examines the relationship between
   technology and Falk and Deirking's CML. In the end, this chapter
   discusses the benefits, challenges, and concerns that museums might face
   when using technology in exhibitions. Through the historical review of
   museums utilizing technology in exhibitions and the museum learning
   theory of the CML, this chapter provides a few thoughts for museum
   educators to keep in mind when they are planning to integrate
   ever-innovative technology into museum education. The use of technology
   in the museum should be able to enhance and customize visitors'
   meaningful learning.
   Technology was first implemented in exhibition design and gallery
   interpretations in the 1950s. Since then, the development and
   instructional use of technology in museums has increased significantly.
   With the recent trend in visitor-centered initiatives being encouraged
   by museum professionals, cultural institutions are arranging exhibitions
   and displays, offering activities and programs, as well as developing
   materials to better augment visitors' on-site and off-site learning
   experiences. The most ubiquitous augmentations are the utilization of
   different digital technology and virtual museum (Mediati, 2011). For
   instance, Lu (1999) pointed out that museums installed flat-screen
   televisions for presenting exhibition and art object information while
   Chao and Lai (2008) found that museums used personal portable electronic
   devices for interpreting articles and developed interactive computer
   programs for inviting audiences' active discovery learning. Recently,
   Buffington (2008) and Lopez, Daneau, Rosoff, and Cogdon (2008) indicated
   that distance learning and virtual exhibitions through museum websites,
   podcasts, and electronic networking are becoming more common.}},

Abstract = {{The box-type or single-wall construction was a widespread form of
   owner-built shelter in America, from the earliest plank-wall
   constructions of the Massachusetts Bay Colony to single-wall plantation
   style houses in Hawaii today. That the single-wall was constructed in
   climatic ones as diverse as the snowy windswept high mountain boomtowns
   like Bodie, California and the hot humid coastal plain of Central Texas
   is testimony to the versatility of the single-wall method as basic
   shelter.
   The single-wall, also called the shanty, escaped documentation in the
   popular press and publications by the American Building Culture, which
   focused on the innovations of the balloon and platform frame to the
   point where the single-wall, the most prevalent form of
   ``do-it-yourself{''}' shelter since the log cabin, is virtually
   invisible in the historical record.
   This paper presents a study and digital reconstruction of a
   post-civil-war single-wall type of structure, using surviving examples,
   anecdotes, and recorded anthropological data to illustrate the
   principles and details of this form of construction, and compare them to
   Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian wall and contemporary Structural Insulated
   Panel constructions.}},

Abstract = {{Shanghai is a modern environment in which modernity coexists with
   tradition. Expo 2010 provided a huge contribution to this
   transformation, accelerating its development and improving quality of
   life. Although, the rapidity in which these changes occurred created an
   imbalance that brought out the existing gap between social groups and
   urban areas.
   Local government settled on the Shanghai Smart City project that
   prefigures the pervasiveness of technology in every aspect of urban
   life, in order to create a smart city.
   In this framework of exhaustive renewal, I decided to investigate the
   effects that these changes will have on the citizens both before and
   during its implementation.
   The aim is to understand if the users are ready to accept this umpteenth
   change that will have a great fallout on their lives.
   The data collected during the research phase has been analyzed and
   interpreted in order to find design opportunities useful to develop an
   output along the design phase.
   The final outcome is a computer based platform made to deliver an
   enabling solution that can guarantee to users digital and social
   inclusion in the perspective of the Smart City.}},

   18-year olds have grown up in a digital knowledge focused world. These
   new students have different needs and values. As teachers we are very
   aware of this transformation and explicitly looking for new ways to
   teach, tutor and challenge our students. In this paper we will describe
   the innovative way in which we designed a new international bachelor
   program Industrial Design Engineering (IDE) where designers from all
   over the world are educated to become such open innovators.
   We applied a design driven approach, consisting of four pillars (future
   driven, value driven, participative, and design thinking) We share our
   insights by explaining what and how we did, and why and how this could
   be interesting to translate to other programs or contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous researches provide evidence that Industrial design is key to
   trigger, foster and sustain innovation and can lead to a measurable
   performance growth of the business. Nevertheless, their integration with
   the engineering design process has been difficult since the birth of the
   profession. The lack of dedicated design tools responding to their
   specific needs is one of the most important reasons for this stagnation.
   In this paper we propose an historical and technical approach to trace
   the evolution of digital design tools. It appears they can be classified
   inside two archetypal categories. The first one has been designed to
   address the needs of the engineers such as the reusability of design for
   manufacturing purposes. The second one was made for graphical artist,
   for artistic composition or with the capacity to animate and render
   three-dimensional models. The industrial designer profession use tools
   with qualities from both categories - neither of which have been
   designed for her specific needs. We detail the technical reasons for
   this evolution and we argue it might be possible to solve this issue
   with a holistic consideration of both approaches.}},

Abstract = {{With the arrival of Wi-Fi, WiMax, Zigbee, and other wireless network
   standards, the penetration of Internet in daily life has surged
   significantly. While the usage of Internet access in urban areas is
   steadily increasing in recent years, rural people are still suffering
   from the effect of the digital divide, mainly due to the poor coverage
   by Internet service providers in remote areas. This chapter aims to
   provide a cost-effective reliable broadband Internet access solution for
   rural people in the form of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) whose coverage
   can be easily extended in a multi-hop fashion. Starting from a general
   description of the WMN architecture and protocol developments, this
   chapter focuses on the primary design issues and challenges for making
   Internet pervasive through WMN's that demand innovations in protocols at
   different layers and perfect integration. The brief discussion on the
   research works and related experimental testbeds shows that WMN with its
   unique features seems to be a promising solution to provide next
   generation Internet access to areas that are too remote to receive it
   via cable or DSL, or where upgrading the landlines to broadband is
   highly cost-prohibitive. Finally, this chapter concludes introducing
   various open issues and research challenges still to be addressed and
   resolved in coming days to make this solution commercially viable.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid uptake of technology offers potentially innovative approaches
   to promoting mental health amongst young people, addressing a
   significant public health challenge. The advent of Web 2.0 has seen a
   shift from text heavy content to the development of communities that
   foster connectivity. This area of research, its potential to engage
   young people at risk of isolation, and the mental health benefits it may
   have, has received little attention. This chapter considers evidence
   regarding technology's role in mental health promotion, particularly for
   marginalised young people. Results are presented from an Australian
   study, ``Bridging the Digital Divide,{''} which investigated technology
   access and utilisation by young people experiencing marginalisation.
   Finally, Australian policy regarding the digital divide and Internet
   safety is reviewed. The authors conclude that policy responses should
   move beyond just access and safety and explore innovative ways of
   ensuring safe and supportive online communities accessible for all young
   people.}},

Abstract = {{The confluence of collaborative and social technologies, with the
   phenomenon of digital natives, creates new opportunities for learning
   environments, which, in turn, demand innovative instructional design
   strategies. An ecological approach to instructional design can yield
   rich learning environments that provide learners with authentic
   experiences. These learning experiences can be challenging, engaging,
   and effective, and provide students with deep appreciation of underlying
   processes, principles, and relationships. It's a learner-centered design
   that features collaboration, authentic experiences, and complex
   environments. Designing for these complex systems requires thinking
   outside the boxes of traditional approaches. The ecological approach
   requires identifying the key contextual factors and interactions that
   are central to understanding and performing complex intellectual tasks.
   This non-linear process involves selecting appropriate technologies and
   social interactions, appropriate levels of scaffolding and support, and
   giving learners increasing levels of responsibility for their own
   successful outcomes.}},

   online groups as a phenomenon distinct from prior work understanding
   collaborative information behavior in face-to-face groups, free and open
   source software groups and Wikipedia groups. The unexpected diversity of
   information resources utilized by completely online group members is
   analyzed through Sonnenwald's Information Horizons theory. Information
   practices of completely online group members are described, and the key
   themes of groups as information resources, the influence of tool change
   on collaborative information behavior online, and the focusing potential
   of collaborative information tools for completely online group work are
   explicated. Future research directions that explore the potential of
   COGs for distributed innovation; new types of collaborative information
   behavior and breaking down the digital divide are reviewed.}},

   international organizations has been summarized. The aim is to increase
   the effectiveness of investment, and for the same purpose, a number of
   new financing mechanisms are devised by funding organization/agencies.
   These innovative mechanisms have been summarized with special focus on
   advantages and disadvantages. The graphic illustrations help in
   understanding fund flow in financing mechanism. These innovative
   mechanisms are further explained with the help of cases. A number of
   innovative financing mechanisms have been presented, which can be
   adopted for ICT projects in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{The digital divide is often conceptualised as inequalities of access to
   technology. While access is obviously a precursor to technology use,
   research consistently shows that the digital divide is not explained
   simply by access to technology; apparent in the evidence of digital
   divides within communities of equitable wealth or within the same
   geographical location. This chapter acknowledges the interplay between
   psychological as well as socio-economic factors as important in the
   adoption of technology. Within this approach we construct a model based
   on the Technology Acceptance Model, the Theory of Planned Behaviour,
   Innovation Diffusion Theory, Hofstede's culture framework, and Social
   Cognitive Theory. The framework for the model is based on a combination
   of an extension of the Technology Acceptance Model, Innovation Diffusion
   Theory, and Social Cognitive Theory. The underlying theoretical
   assumptions are based on Social Cognitive Theory. While some aspects of
   these individual theories have already been applied to understanding the
   digital divide, this chapter develops a more comprehensive psychological
   model of e-adoption than currently exists in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering is seen today as a synonym of innovation, especially for
   providing technological solutions that affect not only daily work and
   entertainment, but education as well. Project portfolio management of
   multimedia production and use emerges today as a challenge both for the
   enrichment of traditional classroom based teaching and for distance
   education offering. In this way, this chapter intends to answer the
   following question: Which are the fundamental aspects to be considered
   in the management of projects on educational multimedia production and
   use? This research presents a proposal of a project management model for
   digital content production and use. The model, the methodology and the
   implementation will be named EduPMO, an abbreviation of Educational
   Project Management Office. Therefore, the model, the methodology, and
   the implementation should be understood as related but independent
   entities. This interdisciplinary investigation involves different
   topics, going from metadata and interoperability to intellectual
   property and process improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Protecting copyright of a digital content is gaining momentum and has
   been suitably complemented by technological innovations. Literature
   piracy, though not being given much attention, constitutes a major bulk.
   Unlike audio and video, text piracy is not complemented by IT solutions
   except for certain proprietary initiatives. This pursuit embarks on
   review of technological advancements for Text Copyright Protection along
   with issues and challenges for their implementation. Appraisal comprises
   of watermark embedding algorithms and distribution infrastructure. A
   brief discussion over the document structure, watermark composition and
   type, classification of algorithms and future direction is also being
   accomplished. To make approach holistic couple of systems were also
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{The development of Digital libraries and repositories, a worldwide
   vision with enormous political and ideological importance for humanity,
   in an effort to approach cultures and preserve plurality and diversity,
   is directly affected by the provisions of Intellectual Property Law and
   is subject to the consideration of innovation through legislation. Legal
   issues such as these related to software use, database protection, the
   collection, digitization, archiving, and distribution of protected works
   are of outmost importance for the operation and viability of Digital
   libraries and repositories. In this chapter, the authors focus upon some
   of these legal issues and consider an alternative proposal in respect of
   Intellectual Property law for open access to creative works furnished to
   the public through Digital libraries and repositories. The alternative
   proposal pertains to the use of the Creative Commons licenses as a legal
   means to enhance Openness for Digital libraries.}},

   social dilemmas in knowledge management and organizational innovation,
   by focusing on a paramount feature of digital technology, which is
   ``copying.{''} The new ways in which information is produced,
   distributed, and shared in digital environments have in fact changed
   crucial aspects of human life. Whereas, most of the time, scholars
   consider such transformations in connection with the impact of digital
   copies on copyright law, the aim of the chapter is to widen this
   perspective by examining data protection as well as file sharing
   application systems. The new economical scenarios and business models
   proposed by this copy-based technology suggest new ways for balancing
   property rights and ``the right to freely participate in the cultural
   life of the community.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Europe's future sustainable growth and competitiveness depends to a
   large extent on its ability to embrace the digital transformation in all
   its complexity. Information and communication technology (ICT) is
   increasingly impacting all segments of society and the economy. The
   European Commission signals {[}1] that by 2015 700,000 to 1 million ICT
   jobs will not be filled in Europe, due to lack of skilled personnel.
   Additional action is needed to boost the overall number and the
   employability and mobility of ICT experts. Therefore the Commission will
   launch a `Grand Coalition on Digital Skills and Jobs'. That is why
   Project B2.2. entitled ``Development of a set of national professional
   competence standards required by employers{''}, which concerns the
   development of 300 standards of professional competence, is particularly
   important and necessary. As part of the project qualification standards
   will be developed for such contemporary innovative and necessary
   professions as ``Multimedia Application Teacher{''}, ``Distance Learning
   Teacher{''}, ``On-line Examiner{''}. The author of the article is
   involved in the project as a subject matter expert and in this paper
   will present concepts relating to the development of qualification
   standards for the new profession of Multimedia Application Teacher and
   concepts of one of the way of preparing such specialist. {[}1]}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, the authors discuss a Knowledge Economy-based approach
   to the inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (PwD). The approach,
   different from the traditional assistance model, considers PwD as active
   and valuable members of the present Knowledge Society, to be included in
   the active workforce. This is discussed with reference to a specific
   operational case study concerning the establishment of the Center of
   Excellence for Technology and Innovation in Favor of Persons with
   Disabilities (CETI-D) conceived by Fondazione Rosselli Americas and
   being implemented by the State of Sao Paulo in Brazil. At the beginning
   of the chapter, the authors discuss the problem of the inclusion of PwD
   as a further aspect of the digital divide phenomenon. Then, the
   principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons
   with Disabilities are presented-some international best practices
   concerning the social inclusion of PwD are also introduced. Later, the
   authors discuss the CETI-D initiative, with the aim of showing how ICT
   can represent a powerful tool for social and economic inclusion.
   Finally, the authors discuss the conditions under which the experience
   of the CETI-D can be replicated in other countries, with a specific
   focus on less developed countries.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of ICT in policies targeted to alleviate poverty,
   specifically in conditional transfer programs (CTP), offers two
   opportunities. On one side, it contributes to improve delivery
   efficiency to beneficiaries, diminishing transfer costs with better
   control over beneficiaries' registry. On the other side, ICT
   incorporation on CTP helps to reduce costs of receiving funds and, from
   a broader scope, it contributes to social and digital inclusion of poor;
   this is especially relevant with the emergence of mobile banking.
   Almost every country in Latin America employs CTP programs as a social
   policy. Approximately 100 million of people are beneficiaries of CTP in
   Latin America, which accounts for about half of the people living in
   poverty in the region. Hence, improving administration of this kind of
   policy implies for the Latin-American countries, not only savings based
   on efficiency, but the opportunity of broaden the benefits.
   The main objective of this chapter is to analyze innovative ICT
   implementation on CTP in three countries in the region: Bolsa Familia
   (Brazil), Oportunidades (Mexico) and Familias en Accion (Colombia).
   These three countries are implementing pilot programs that include ITC.
   These experiences may important insights for future successful
   implementation of ICT for CTP in other countries.}},

Abstract = {{The chapter investigates the employment of digital social media by
   Spanish regional administrations: its presence, the factors that
   determine that presence, as well as the self-perception of those
   responsible for its management. This study raises the following
   questions: What are the key factors that explain the use of social media
   in public administrations? What is the self-perception of those
   responsible for the management of digital social media about its current
   level of development within their organisations? What are the main
   inhibitors-facilitators for the development of digital social media in
   public administrations? What are the next steps to promote digital
   social media in the sphere of public organisations? This chapter is
   based on a questionnaire that was responded to by those responsible for
   the management of digital social media in the Spanish regional
   administrations. This research shows that Web 2.0 tools are more
   oriented to explore potential changes in the relations between the
   public administrations and citizens, than to innovate the functioning of
   public sector organisations. In sum, this chapter offers a relevant
   analysis, although it is of an exploratory character because of the
   almost total absence of systematic studies about the diffusion of
   digital social media within Spanish public administrations.}},

Abstract = {{The federal government of Australia has established an innovative
   although uneven record in shared governance initiatives in a climate of
   political stability and broad social inclusion policies. The
   participatory reform agenda has the potential to increase citizen
   empowerment, improve government transparency and accountability, and
   develop the capacities of the administrative arm. Changes to Australian
   Public Service (APS) practice are now aimed at better support for
   citizen-centric policy formation and, in some examples, shared
   governance. Nevertheless, policy consultations remain at the
   high-risk/high gain end of citizen-government-APS relations. This
   chapter scopes the concept and contexts of policy co-production both as
   a technique of engagement and a desirable outcome in shared governance
   for representative democracies. It assesses policy engagement from the
   perspective of citizens as agents, not targets. Using a constructivist
   approach, the chapter assesses the impact of contextual factors, the new
   participatory reform agenda, and the design features on two
   consultations conducted in 2011: Clean Energy Legislation, and Digital
   Culture Public Sphere. Major factors impacting on policy coproduction
   are found to be context-specific and issue-specific, and outside the
   direct control of public service agencies. Theoretically, the
   constructivist approach combines the literature on modes of e-government
   research, on e-government success factors and participatory media, with
   evidence of institutional reform agendas and the evidence provided by
   the case studies. Methodologically, the data is drawn from public domain
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{The 21st century arrived with new challenges and opportunities. Schools
   are gradually changing too, and this is particularly so because the
   students are different now. Their interests, needs and most of all, the
   ways that they find and process information and the techniques they use
   are completely different. Today's students are individuals and
   personalities. In the 21st century a child wants to be different, not
   wanting to dress the same as others, or look like everybody else, and
   considers technology to be a part of their self-expression, willingly
   trying and using everything new: computers, mobile gadgetry, social
   networks etc. And, getting students involved in an active learning
   process is becoming an ever increasing challenge. Each student requires
   an individual approach and motivation. It can clearly be seen that
   technology can assist teachers in undertaking this impossible mission -
   in providing an individualized approach to each student, independently
   of their sphere of interest, level of knowledge and ability in the
   specific subject being taught. The world is changing so swiftly that we
   can't imagine with any accuracy, what the labour market will be like
   that will greet the current first year students when they finish their
   12th year. However, one thing is clear - technology has arrived and will
   remain in our lives. The quality of education and the preparedness of a
   student for a successful life and work in the modern world are to a
   large extent dependent on how well a teacher is able to change with the
   times and skilfully use these tools in the dialogue with students. The
   importance of further education is increasing each year because people
   need to continually master new technology and have to adapt to a
   changing labour market. Nowadays it's no longer possible to maintain
   one's competitiveness if knowledge isn't being supplemented and that's
   why further education is becoming more and more popular. Learning has
   become the key word in today's era. Everybody is learning young and old.
   The goals of education -both strategic, as well as tactical, are in
   essence developed by the teacher. That's why particular attention is
   being focussed on the education of teachers and the development of their
   professional skills. Creative and even outstanding people are needed for
   a nation to be competitive on world markets and for its economy to be
   competitive. For education to be effective, creative and thinking
   educators are needed - teachers, who can be drawn into the education
   process - into professional development, implemented through further
   education courses. Further education needs to assist teachers in
   becoming integrated in the European and world education systems, which
   require rapid responses, adaptation to new needs and completely new
   situations in real school/university practice. Teachers should ask
   themselves four questions:
   - Should I change?
   - Do I want to change?
   - Am I able to change?
   - How are changes linked to creativity?
   If there's a positive answer the teacher can become competitive among
   his/her colleagues, thereby guaranteeing the attainment of a competitive
   education for the student too.
   Demands are placed on the teacher of today to organize learning in a way
   that in the acquirement of knowledge, the subject of study becomes a
   means of developing the student's thinking, the cultivation of the
   sphere of the senses, as well as the improvement of social skills.
   In this way the problem of the learning environment moves to centre
   stage. What should it be like? How should it be developed?
   Every teacher should be aware of their capabilities. They should review
   their teaching resources, evaluate the most useful teaching methods and
   techniques for the learning of the subject they teach, and to organize
   the most democratic, humane and efficient learning environment. This
   environment is one where the teacher and the student, as well as the
   students between themselves, actively cooperate in the acquisition of
   new knowledge and skills in a process which is based on technology.
   Teacher focussed professional development ensures the quality of a
   modern educational process. In the life-long education context, each
   teacher has to develop their professional and personal competencies, to
   ensure the development of general and professional skills and to make it
   possible for teachers to stand up to new challenges and undertake their
   tasks in a non-traditional, but well argumented way. This is because
   education strengthens intuition, daring and the ability to knowingly
   transform the experiences gained into innovative work. The development
   of a teacher's professional proficiency is the improvement of the
   quality of skills of a teacher's professional activities, which mainly
   takes place in the form of further education courses. In a survey which
   was undertaken in 2008, both students and their parents, as well as the
   teachers themselves pointed out that they need to improve their IT
   skills, which were very weak or even non-existent.
   Currently in Latvia, teachers' professional development is being guided
   in accordance with the central task in education - to create a society
   which learns throughout life, and that's why the continual development
   of competencies has been planned and is expected in the results of
   further education programme goals. If the measure of a teacher's
   professionalism in the 20th century was knowledge, then nowadays a
   teacher's professionalism is determined through competencies, with the
   criteria of measurement being the results of pedagogical activity. The
   effectiveness of a teacher's work is a precondition for education
   quality. Researcher Steven Farr maintains that the role of a teacher in
   the achievement of results in education is greater than the content of
   education or the role of the school. Every teacher has to be able to
   professionally develop the kind of learning environment in which each
   student is provided with the opportunity to utilize all of their
   abilities and potential, to reveal their individuality, to get fully
   involved in all aspects of life, and to develop the ability to be a
   creative, successful and happy person. This means that the teacher needs
   a variety of professional competencies more and more, and IT
   competencies, the skill to utilize, find and develop digital teaching
   resources themselves are an inseparable part of these.
   If the teacher and students can find a common language in the learning
   process, if students are perceived as cooperation partners on the path
   to a common goal (standard), if the selected teaching methods are such
   that they are able to interest and involve them, if the evaluation
   criteria are clear and understandable to everyone, then the learning
   process will most likely be successful and the teachers, students and
   their parents will be satisfied.
   The research problem has been determined by the contradictions observed
   in society between the goals selected in education and their
   implementation in the teaching process, and the ability of teachers to
   utilize the latest technology for effective, creative learning process.
   Attention in the research has been focussed on the current situation in
   Latvia in teachers' professional development on IT issues, gathering
   information about the supply of further education courses and
   researching the necessary improvements in keeping with contemporary
   teaching procedures - both for school pupils and adults.}},

Abstract = {{Universities are the pioneers of e-learning but the process of teaching
   and learning on-line has not yet been sufficiently innovated (at least
   in the context of the Czech Republic where school as a playful
   environment has its roots in the work of John Amos Comenius). My
   contribution suggests a shift from the instructive (linear) approach to
   games, a shift which I believe provides an ample opportunity to develop
   an alternative, more effective educational model based on the teaching
   principles incorporated in digital games as learning systems. Playing,
   using and consuming digital games (in various forms) as a contemporary
   medium of choice for my generation structures students' everyday life.
   It leads to a transformation of our habits and creates a need for a new
   form and content of communication. The aim of interaction here in
   general is to switch over from one-way instruction to active student
   engagement in the subject matter, in cooperation with other
   participants. I want to uncover what the place of games in schooling is,
   how (or why) teachers use them with respect to design of an e-course,
   how so-called serious games affect people, what students think about
   them and what they possibly take away from them.
   Serious games as a learning tool successfully apply several teaching
   principles which I want to identify. I compare e-learning agendas (i.e.
   tools in an on-line learning environment) to the modular structure of
   digital games as complex learning systems. Elements of these dynamic,
   interconnected systems operate under rules and gameplay mechanisms. I
   start from the idea of a teacher/designer and his/her shifted role in
   designing an e-learning course through effective use of ludic principles
   found in modern digital games. We will touch upon ways in which a
   teacher (while designing an ecourse) engages, motivates, evaluates and
   rewards students. Teachers possessing knowledge on how to direct
   transmission of information in class can now design a playful e-course
   accordingly, so that they can exploit digital games' inherent
   educational potential in teaching mediated by e-learning resources.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays digital content, multimedia guides or internet sites are
   present in many museums as part of their dissemination functions. From
   this perspective the implementation of ICTs in museums can be analysed
   as two sides of the same coin: museum management and public use.
   Regarding museum management, the benefits brought by adopting digital
   technologies are undeniable, but not all museums are at the same level
   of practical interest or familiarity with the use of digital technology
   for exhibition and interpretation purposes, or for additional uses (such
   as internet presence, outdoor activities, etc.). In that sense we have
   established a categorisation of museums through the uses they give to
   ICTs.
   On the other side, many e-learning specialists see ICTs as a fundamental
   tool for the transmission of knowledge within the museum scene, and
   especially to allow a greater participation of visitors as an active
   part in the museums' activities. In addition, audience studies from
   museums have demonstrated that the basis of potential public is the
   level of formal education, so people with high level education could be
   the ideal target to explore the opinion of the public about their
   knowledge and uses of ICTs in museums. The aim of this paper is
   presenting the first steps of research about both sides of the
   implementation ICTs in Museums in the Province of Ourense-Northwest of
   Spain-. We carried out this research obtaining a data sample with
   interviews for museum managers and this data was complemented with a
   quantitative study based on queries to young people in high level
   education.}},

Abstract = {{Academic administrators are transforming and instituting innovative
   strategies to adapt to the new challenges of the digital era to survive
   and prosper in upcoming years. The online environment in higher
   education is surging with the expansion of digital knowledge. Online
   information and social media strategies are expanding the diverse
   creativity in multimedia instructional offerings worldwide. Universities
   are partnering with global higher education technology (e-text) and
   service firms to produce sophisticated marketing strategies and online
   tools geared to attract perspective students and enhance learning
   outcomes. Successful online campaigns and creative strategies continue
   to provide alternatives for online higher education. Enrollment trends
   demonstrate that the 21st century student targeted is most receptive to
   personalized web based marketing and digital tools that utilize social
   media, search engines, and online communication leading to existing and
   new information. Colleges and Universities will continue to expand the
   building of highly engaging communities within social media to capture
   the attention of potential students. This multimedia communication
   expansion will provide the primary information needed to determine what
   the potential students want, need, and desire within academic
   institutions. It would also provide a means for conveying the benefits
   of pursuing an education at one's institution through conveying the
   academic, cultural, and extracurricular activities provided toward
   student success at the academic institutions. Another emerging era is
   the development of neuromarketing. Higher education recruitment and
   development may lie in neuroscience research. Neuromarketing is emerging
   as a method of assisting with new marketing strategies by studying the
   brain's neuron responses to emotional visual stimuli. Brain based
   research may provide answers to the decision making process of the
   potential enrollees who access and review digital information. The
   virtual world has become the most effective method in reaching
   perspective students who will become the engines of our future society.
   Those higher education institutions embracing the continuing changes
   will succeed as they recreate engaging programs, understand the
   motivation of prospective students toward advanced education and improve
   utilizing new and innovative strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Digital media convergence we are witnessing today does not change only
   the social role of the media but also the role of each media users. On
   the one hand, members of the media are expecting from media to be
   adjustable and on the other hand media is expecting from users to
   actively participate in the changes. Either media show a preference to
   educate public or public searches guidance and direction in order to
   generate appropriate content for publication from media. Surveys in
   Serbia show that young population is enormously dependant upon the media
   but on the other side there is an indication of a low level of media
   literacy, lack of understanding of the function and role of the media in
   society, and a low level of media activism. We consider that the
   convergence of media from analog to digital and convergence of audience
   from passive to active occurs in two parallel flows without a serious
   and meaningful cooperation between the media and educational
   institutions that media literacy should promote and advance not only in
   media, but also in other educational and scientific fields. Within a
   media reality, thanks to the possibilities of new technologies,
   educational institutions should be designed in a strategic way to
   prepare and engage students for innovative, creative and critical
   approach toward the media convergence and its content. If students do
   not understand that, according to the principles of media literacy, they
   are the key authors, selectors, critics and consumers of information,
   according to their knowledge, interests and experience, and educational
   institutions will not be able to meet the challenges of time ahead of
   us.}},

Abstract = {{The research on the conformity of attitudes of media students with the
   central principles of multimedia literacy in Vojvodina (Serbia) showed
   that the levels of multimedia literacy, critical thinking and
   understanding of the functioning of the media, vary according to the
   specifics of the teaching program, year of study, but also that these
   differences are not always logical and that they are conditioned to a
   great extent by the study programs curricula. We found that the students
   lack the verification of theoretical knowledge through practical work.
   Comparing the results aimed at testing the very level of multimedia
   literacy and essential skills for its implementation, it appears that
   students lack an organized and designed practice for the application of
   knowledge, which is a direct consequence of the traditionally formatted
   curricula at the study programs surveyed. Instead of innovation in the
   very approach to education for media through different meaningful and
   practically oriented curricula, education in the field of multimedia
   literacy is often reduced only to the technical skills and understanding
   of the functions, impacts and opportunities of modern media in society
   are not, except for the theoretical framework, sufficiently practically
   checked or organized and innovatively stimulated. We believe that the
   current gap between traditional teaching practices and the need for
   innovative approaches can be overcome by differently structured
   curricula, teaching and pedagogical techniques and practices relied on
   digital technologies as tools, but also by finding a good balance
   between the necessity of achieving the traditional scientific,
   educational, social and democratic social functions of higher education
   and responsible and innovative use of new digital technology as the
   tools. In this paper, we propose the concept of a practical study of
   media based on a compelling need to respond to the current convergence
   of media systems and future working practices of media professionals on
   modern multi-platforms. Without neglecting traditional educational
   principles, techniques and values of classical, theoretical teaching, we
   suggest innovative teaching practices in media studies, based on the
   principles of multimedia literacy, media pedagogy and interactive
   teaching that should in its concept complement existing tradition, adapt
   it to the needs of modern times, the nature of new media and habits of
   the users. These practices will make future media professionals more
   innovative, able to independently solve practical problems; will direct
   them to lifelong learning, to quickly adapt to changes, to mutually
   connect. The concept that we propose, provides comprehensive testing of
   theoretical and practical knowledge with help and support of all
   participating in teaching and the use of modern technologies. We believe
   that in this way the education for media and about media would manage to
   follow the needs and media pre-knowledge of modern generations that opt
   for media studies.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Multimedia-based Knowledge Transfer entered a new era with the
   emergence of HTML5 and rich web applications. This new era that is
   changing our learning habits, is referred, e.g., by UNESCO, as the Web
   3.0 period of the ``second media age{''}. We articulate a comprehensive
   vision of forthcoming changes in education technology and describe a
   reference model of a mobile multimedia-based learning environment that
   is under development to support community knowledge transfer and
   preparation for higher education. The aim of our project (MMATT) within
   the framework of the Economic Development Operative Program (EDOP 1.2.1)
   of the New Hungary Development Plan is to provide a mobile system of
   complex reusable educational tools for solving multimedia based
   knowledge transfer tasks in different contexts. Designed with the
   assistance of EU funding for teachers, schools, international
   educational institutions, its 21st century solutions represent a
   challenge to closed learning management systems based traditional
   didactic methods. The massively open online course model combined with
   knowledge marketing and collaborative content development methodology
   support effective learning and provide a mobile knowledge transfer
   environment equipped with an innovative toolkit for creative
   communities. Its modules combine didactic solutions for video based
   v-learning with game based, and social learning, build on a groupware
   for collaborative authoring that involve Facebook accounts and cloud
   storage. Its video module is capable of scheduling automated recordings
   combined with synchronized presentations and add-on materials which can
   be used for individual or collective learning. HTML5 based rich media
   user interface support learners to engage with content; topic map based
   graphic editor serves learning path adjustment in the course of study;
   an API management platform for educational Apps and micro payment help
   development communities to work on collaborative projects and share
   knowledge resources.
   The development tool-set is optimized for smart phones and tablets with
   touch surfaces and supports preparation for higher, as well as for
   further education, and groups of special learning needs. Knowledge
   owners can share their digital content creations in learning
   communities; obtain a content brokerage environment for developing them
   further in user groups, and a framework for editing and offering
   marketable content that helps to overcome critical problems and assists
   carrier development with tests, templates and mobile accessible course
   materials.
   The services that support content and resource sharing, just as school
   competitions and e-portfolios, use the logic of cloud computing, and run
   in a central server park; thus the user does not have to install the
   services. Instead, he or she can use it online through a web browser and
   LRS handled activity tracking via the `NextGen SCORM', XAPI. The central
   server park can entirely be clustered in order to assemble the toolkit
   and the relevant resources according to different kinds of usage scaled
   to the growing demands for resources. Since the system is compatible
   with the most commonly used browsers, it can be used on different
   operating systems like Microsoft Windows, IOS and Android. The
   prototypical implementation of the toolkit for Digital Content Creation
   is extendable utilizing an assessment system of how learning communities
   value the tools, promote, like and share knowledge resources during the
   process of collaborative Learning Experience Design.}},

   research, d) enriches school history with ``new histories{''}, such as
   history of inventions, history of feelings, history of democratic
   institutions etc., which are taught alternatively (group method, drama
   etc.) but are simultaneously expressed through new historical manners
   (movie making, digital comic), and d) aims at the development of
   critical thought, the stimulation and promotion of the child's
   sentimental world.
   According to the principles of ``new history{''} and ``media
   education{''} teachers of the Hellenic American Education Foundation
   created an innovative biennial project. This effort aims at an
   interdisciplinary, cross-cultural approach to world history and culture
   and puts the use of media in the center of the procedure. The main area
   of study in Year I (ten year old students) concerns great inventions in
   world history (a diachronic look in the past, present and future). Year
   II (eleven year old students) focuses on a comparison study of the Greek
   and American Revolution and Greek and American Democracy. The project
   that we will present (Year I study) was implemented in two Greek Classes
   and one corresponding English Class (EFL) in 5th Grade Elementary.
   Pupils of all three classes formed groups (of 3-5 individuals), selected
   and studied a technological breakthrough and created a two minute
   historical documentary or digital comic to present the invention and its
   implications on humanity. Final projects were posted on the School's
   Course Management System (CMS). Evaluation of the project was based on
   active participation, imaginative approach and presentation of subject
   matter, electronic commentary from peers and teacher (team discussion),
   and through the completion of an evaluation form for the documentary or
   digital comic script.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years the availability and amount of information has changed
   dramatically. Teachers and students are not prepared for this situation,
   which could lead to massive problems in the near future.
   We can already watch increasing deficits in the ability of reading,
   writing, analyzing text and evaluating information. Even when we admit
   that most of the predictions of Gee and Prensky seem to be fulfilled by
   now, we see a digital gap and a lack of the ability of students and
   young adults to critically consume information, build an own opinion and
   being able to verbalize it.
   Schools try to react to these upcoming problems by introducing new
   methods (e.g. constructivism, constructionism, and similar methods), but
   there are severe organizational problems concerning the usage of social
   platforms, WorldWideWeb and mobile devices in schools. Traditional
   newspapers try to find ways to attract younger readers by providing them
   with distinct papers for children, which seem to work very well but face
   problems in attracting young adults.
   This paper summarizes the findings and proposals from a project to
   provide a platform for students at the age of 10 to 16 to create,
   collaborate, distribute, and view personal relevant content on the Web.
   This platform can be used by educators in teaching situations as well as
   by children and students for their private purposes. Therefore the
   students shall be enabled and motivated to deal actively and critically
   with information, produce articles and take responsibility for the
   content in a rather save setting.
   Based on the results of questionnaires and surveys and the analysis of
   comparable approaches we developed a concept and a working prototype of
   such a platform. Usability tests and post questionnaires show a high
   acceptance for this product. Especially the involved teachers were
   highly interested in such a platform.}},

Abstract = {{The worldwide reforms today in science and technology education reflect
   the view that 21st century teaching and learning should focus on the
   blending of specific skills, content knowledge, expertise and literacy.
   These reforms advocate self-directed learning and communication skills
   that pose a number of new challenges: how to blend the explicit
   instruction of learning skills into science contents instruction; how
   can the education system promote the development of selfdirected
   learners in heterogeneous classes?
   One solution is the development of digital environments for learning
   science content and science skills that will offer alternative paths of
   learning and develop students' self-regulation capabilities. However,
   developing such environments poses many questions for curriculum
   developers including suitability to different types of learners and the
   type of scaffolding needed to support and promote self-regulation and
   meaningful learning. The present study investigates some of these
   questions.
   The study was carried out in the context of 7th grade science curriculum
   that embedded the study of learning skills in science content. A digital
   learning environment and activities for 7th grade science through
   problem solving was designed with the aim of catering to the needs of
   different learners and to foster self-regulation capabilities. The
   activities accompany the study of several science ( chemistry) topics in
   the curriculum and several learning skills. The environment offers
   students a choice of alternative learning paths characterized by
   different degrees of scaffolding: an autonomous path without any
   scaffolding, a path with hints and a guided path that navigates students
   in the solution process. The scaffolding offered is conceptual,
   meta-cognitive, procedural or strategic.
   The goal of our study is to characterize the different self-regulating
   behaviors demonstrated while using different paths, and to identify
   students' considerations in choosing the particular learning paths in
   the digital environment. Additionally, the study appraised the manner in
   which these considerations relate to prior results on assessment tasks
   and students' self-regulation learning behaviors.
   The research population consists of 80 students who were taught the same
   curriculum materials. All students were asked to complete a
   self-regulation questionnaire, assessment tasks and were asked to write
   a reflective report. Following the assessment tasks the students worked
   with the digital environment. Data was obtained through use of tracing
   methods, from results of the digital activities, and from talk aloud
   protocols and interviews with selected students. Results show a variety
   of considerations for choosing learning paths including students' fear
   of failure, their perceived abilities, and their interest in being
   challenged. Further results shed light on the degree of contribution of
   the varied types of scaffolding. These results provide an important
   contribution to the further evolution of digital learning environments
   aimed at the development of self-directed learners.}},

Abstract = {{There are two very important things that can be said of ``Change{''},
   Change is an invariant in life and is one of the two certainties in
   people's life. Change in information technologies is happening at a high
   speed, these changes must reach and help transform education. ``The
   interplay between technologies is creating unprecedented waves of
   disruptive innovation, which is forcing organizations to rethink
   everything and embrace a post-digital world filled with new risks and
   opportunities,{''}Bill Briggs, a world leader in Deloitte Consulting. It
   is time to innovate in education and Pedagogical Robotics is an
   excellent alternative.
   Andreas Schleicher, Education Secretary General of OECD, recommended
   some changes to the Mexican Educational System, which favors that work
   at school, take the student as center of the system, as center of
   activity. Where a student supported by the school environment is the one
   that generate his own knowledge and the school program promotes
   creativity, ingenuity and diversity. Creating evaluations based on
   student leadership and outcomes.
   In this paper after acknowledging that technological advances and
   changes should be used to improve education, as well as, to know and
   consider the OECD's recommendations. We present the characteristics of
   XXI Century students, among the more important ones, is that we are
   talking about the ``Net Generation{''}, which are ``always connected{''}
   and performing multiple tasks. They also Use and work with multimedia,
   text, sound, video, images, video, etc. Next, we present the XXI Century
   Association framework of the new skills, necessary for the new era.
   Which are grouped into three main groups a) Information and
   Communication Skills b) Critical Thinking and Problem Solving Skills and
   c) Personal Productivity and Job Skills. Finally, we present results on
   several studies mainly at high school level, which report on many
   benefits that Robotics competitions have on the development of XXI

Abstract = {{Recent technological advances in the AEC (architecture engineering and
   construction) industry have increased the potential of facade
   performance, as data sets arising from digital models can now be shared
   synchronously between various disciplines as well as iteratively
   throughout the design process. These data exchanges are facilitated by
   the integration of natural programming languages and increasingly
   accessible and powerful visualization and simulation tools into
   traditional modeling environments. Web-and cloud-based collaboration
   tools contribute to facilitating the digital information exchange. The
   increased efficiency and corresponding cost-effectiveness of a
   collaborative, performance-based design process has led to a heightened
   call for this practice by clients and building industry legislators
   alike.
   The pedagogical challenge of a collaborative approach is not only to
   teach the technical skills of computational design, like parametrics and
   energy analysis, but also instil a sensibility of how to implement an
   adaptive, intelligent digital and project management model that will be
   efficient for downstream interoperability. The question involves
   successfully creating an efficient process, beginning from an energy
   analysis workflow moving toward the parametric design, of BIM (Building
   Information Model) components, and looping back to energy analyses for
   validation, and on to direct fabrication; perhaps most importantly,
   teaching work flow processes among student teams.
   A new Center for Performative Design \& Engineering and the FuseLAB
   project, at NYCCT, both created with National Science Foundation
   funding, bring together different disciplines involved in BIM, Building
   Performance, and Fabrication, to teach new research methodologies and
   concepts through design, assembly, and testing. A culminating product of
   these initiatives is a curriculum-wide interdisciplinary student project
   where various courses collaborate on portions of the design process of
   facade panels to fully close the design/analysis/fabrication/validation
   loop. This project illustrates actionable responses to environmental
   inputs that feed into the fabrication of innovative developable and
   deployable surfaces.
   Beginning from an industry-identified design problem, form-finding based
   design runs synchronously with environmental analysis, using
   interoperable computational tools and the assistance of an environmental
   engineer as well as rapid-prototyping tools. Initial design and analysis
   conjectures are continued into a BIM environment, where connectivity to
   a building and overall integration can be evaluated. The student groups
   collaborate on projects together with the assistance of multiple
   web-based interface sites, such as G-Team, Box, Google Plus web
   conferencing, and a Word Press site.
   The refined prototypes are fed back to the computational team, where
   students learn about sheet metal fabrication, while next,
   waterjet-prototyped panels are tested in the field or at an offsite lab.
   The percentage differences in field measurements and computational
   analysis are fed back into the computational model to increase accuracy,
   thereby closing the loop when the digital model becomes accurate
   relative to physical performance.}},

Abstract = {{Although experimental studies have shown a strong impact of text layout
   on the legibility of e-text, many digital texts appearing in eBook or
   the internet use different designs, so that there is no straightforward
   answer in the literature over which one to follow when designing

   particularly the influence of line length on reading performance of
   e-school book. An intensive experiment has been conducted which targeted
   school students between the age of 9 and 13. Performance of students was
   assessed through two dependent variables: (1) time to complete each
   tasks; and (2) accuracy of the answers. Accuracy data was based on the
   number of correct answers the students provided and the total score was
   12 points. Several of findings were reported by this experiment such as;
   the time needed to complete all the question models becomes
   significantly low when students are older, errors for all the question
   models are expected to be significantly lower for older students.
   Comparing reading text on a single column with double columns shows that
   the reading process is affected by the students' age, as older students
   were faster when reading through double columns, while students aged 9
   prefer the single column in both reading processes. The study has
   recommended double line for a faster reading among students with
   satisfactory reading performance, while long line was suggested for
   students who have difficulty with their reading.}},

Abstract = {{This research report reflects on the experiences of the Digital
   Inclusion eCentre Management Training Programme delivered in 2012 -to 62
   participants from 34 eCentres situated in the Western Cape. This
   roll-out was a result of a successful pilot which was delivered in 2011
   -to 18 participants from 10 eCentres in the Western and Northern Cape
   regions. The Centre for Innovative Educational and Communication
   Technologies (CIECT), situated at the University of the Western Cape
   (UWC), South Africa designed, developed, localised and facilitated the
   programme.
   CIECT, as a stakeholder within the Western Cape Knowledge Production and
   Coordination Hub (WCKPCH) focuses on Digital Inclusion and Social
   Innovation within Western Cape and Northern Cape communities (rural,
   deep-rural, urban and peri-urban). The WCKPCH's main objective is; to
   produce knowledge and coordinate innovation, existing and complex
   digital inclusion eSkills initiatives as part of a response to the South
   African National e-Skills Plan of Action; and aligned to the National
   Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF).
   CIECT registered the programme through the South African Quality
   Authority (National Qualifications Framework/NQF Level 6). The Centre
   continuously monitors the Programme through research and internal
   evaluation. This is done in order to report on the impact, lessons
   learnt and to provide recommendations for further local and national
   delivery. The programme targeted eCentre Managers and other key role
   players at the community eCentres such as administrators; and even board
   members. Participants underwent relevant eSkills training to capacitate
   and enhance existing skills and knowledge. One of the main goals of the
   Programme was to capacitate participants to engage in ICT
   train-the-trainer interventions within their communities.
   A case study approach was conducted to report on the 2012 Programme and
   experiences of the selected 62 eCentre Managers across 34 Western Cape
   eCentres (rural, deep-rural, urban and periurban). Since the aim of the
   Programme research was to identify community needs in relation to
   eSkills, the report will discuss findings and provide some
   recommendations. These findings include: a need for reliable
   infrastructure; limited time allocated for usage of eCentre services;
   more efforts needed toward empowering communities; certification of
   training Projects offered by community eCentres. This research report
   informs the impact of delivery to eCentres in the Western and Northern
   Cape; and for national scalability.}},

Abstract = {{This research deals with defining the boundaries of architectural
   representation that can be defined for the university training of new
   architects. This era is characterized by a strong presence of digital
   technology in all areas of the production process of the project and
   this has a strong influence on the expectations that are created around
   the iconic model of an ``architecture product{''}.
   At the same time, the significance of the conceptual elements of the
   context and the process itself are likely to be outclassed by the
   seductive appeal of the evolved forms of computerized representation.
   In this paper I present a path that integrates the conceptual and the
   iconic sides and that takes account of the epochal mutation to the
   representation without sacrificing any attention to the capital
   relevance of the conceptual representation of the meanings of
   historical, cultural and anthropological aspects of an architectural
   space.
   This path has also been used as a frame for a didactical application in
   a class of Representation in the degree course of Environmental
   Architecture at the Politecnico di Milano.}},

Abstract = {{This short paper details a collaborative teaching and learning
   evaluative project between Nursing and Midwifery, Pharmacy and Medicine
   at Keele University, to explore the development of team working skills
   (NOTECH) and debrief within an inter-professional active virtual
   learning environment.
   The virtual ward and NOTECH training provided within the KAVE (Keele
   Active Learning Environment) are thought to be the first of its kind
   within the UK. The project has been presented both at National and
   International conferences and been very positively received. KAVE is a
   physical room where three-dimensional `stereoscopic' visuals display on
   three walls and the floor, to create a computer generated virtual
   environment. A student wears active 3D glasses and a lightweight head
   and hand-tracking device. The computer-generated visuals respond to
   position in the KAVE and allow the student to `pick up' and interact
   with digital objects such as care plans, prescription charts,
   observation charts etc. The virtual ward within the KAVE hosts five
   unique patient cases and is able to simulate observation and diagnostic
   skills training. Vital signs monitors' provide information regarding the
   status of each virtual patient within the ward. The five patient avatars
   are set up to respond `real-time' to student interventions which enables
   the students to rehearse professional behaviours in a realistic
   risk-free environment, whilst providing opportunities for non-technical
   skills practice prior to real-world patient encounters. Early
   evaluations received from students have been very positive.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. In recent years, the use of mobile devices has
   significatively increased among the college population, especially in
   Spain, according to the annual Information Society report. In
   educational settings, tablets and smartphones are the mobile devices
   which offer powerful opportunities to develop new digital resources.
   These tools facilitate the acquisition of complex contents and
   therefore, they could be used to enhance the learning process of
   neuroanatomy. A number of applications have been developed so far, but
   few of them include an evaluation of the educational value assigned by
   the final users: the students.
   Aim. The objectives of this study are the following: first, to present a
   new digital application for the exploration of the human brain based on
   digital and interactive three-dimensional models and second, to evaluate
   the degree of satisfaction for end-users.
   Method. Original cross-sectional images acquired from the Visible Human
   Project of the National Library of the United States of America were
   used to ensure real three-dimensional representations of human
   neuroanatomy. The volumetric generation of the brain structures
   consisted of three main steps: first, the bilateral segmentation in the
   cross-sectional images; second, the creation of a polygonal surface
   mesh; and third, the independent renderization of each brain structure
   and registration with the sectional images. Finally, the application
   itself was developed using the Software Development Kit (SDK), Objective
   C as programming language, and Cocoa associate tools. Then an eight-item
   rating scale was carried out to evaluate undergraduate student's utility
   perception of the application.
   Results. A new application called Brain System 3D was developed and will
   be available through the Apple and iTunes stores. This application
   supports traditional neuroanatomy training at undergraduate level using
   iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad in the classrooms. In particular, it
   allows the individual and simultaneous display of both brain structures
   and cross-sectional images within the brain. This application also
   provides a powerful tool for an interactive and user-friendly
   exploration of highly complex neuroanatomical concepts such as
   three-dimensional details and spatial relationships among brain
   structures. Furthermore, a large percentage of sampled students, over
   90\%, assigned a very high educational value to this tool and considered
   that it facilitates student's independent learning by displaying
   visually attractive and interactive brain anatomy. Conclusion. Brain
   System 3D represents a visual and interactive tool for teaching and
   learning neuroanatomy, and for promoting college students' engagement in
   an independent learning process. Discussion. Implications regarding the
   use of this application and mobile devices in undergraduate educational
   settings are discussed in the field of neuroanatomy.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Neuroanatomy is one of the key fields in neuroscience.
   However, its contents are both complex and difficult to understand for
   most of medical students. Three-dimensional models have proved useful
   resources in training contexts by reducing the cognitive load associated
   to mental reconstruction from plane cross-sectional images. Aim. The
   objective of this study is to develop both realistic and interactive
   digital three-dimensional models of neuroanatomical structures. In
   particular, special attention is drawn to deep brain structures such as
   cranial nerves and neurovascular elements for training purposes at
   undergraduate level.
   Methods. The volumetric reconstructions were developed using Autodesk
   (R) Maya (R) version 13. This is professional software used in 3D
   animation, which delivers a comprehensive set of tools for modeling,
   simulation and rendering that met the demanding requirements for this
   project.
   Results. Digital three-dimensional models of brain structures, in
   particular, vascular system and cranial nerves were developed creating a
   comprehensive and interactive tool for the exploration and study of
   complex neuroanatomical contents in educational settings, providing a
   new tool (to support) independent learning. This tool provides highly
   (complex) and detailed reconstructions of the neurovascular system.
   Discussion. This (advanced) visualization system provides a unique
   computer-based learning environment for exploring and understanding
   brain structures, cranial nerves and the neurovascular system, three of
   the most difficult contents in neuroanatomy given their complex spatial
   relationships. This tool incorporates a comprehensive, visually rich,
   tridimensional representation of the brain, vascular system and cranial
   nerves, also featuring surface views of structures contained within the
   brain, as well as interactive tools for dissecting the brain and viewing
   cross-sections of living subjects imaged by magnetic resonance. These
   features make this tool a single source for teaching and understanding
   complex neuroanatomical contents and an excellent resource for
   neuroscience professors, students and health care professionals. It
   provides a visual introduction to locate major brain structures, cranial
   nerves and vascular systems of the human nervous system and allows
   exploring high-resolution three-dimensional models of the real human
   body, where the human brain can be virtually dissected in
   high-resolution in vivo images, consisting of coronal, axial, and
   sagittal sections, including complete section series in each anatomical
   plane to examine and follow the flow of information in cranial nerves.
   It also includes additional features such as zoom for detailed
   inspection, individual selection of structures and hierarchical
   organization of brain structures.
   Conclusion. This advanced visualization tool offers new learning
   material, which enhances the visualization and exploration of
   morphological and spatial relationships among brain structure 3D models,
   cranial nerves and the vascular system. In summary, it is a complete
   visual and interactive resource for teaching neuroanatomy.}},

Abstract = {{Near the end of a teaching period it is standard university practice to
   gather feedback from students, often using two types of surveys: one for
   the appraisal and development of educators, and the other to evaluate
   units, modules or subjects (herein called courses). Student Evaluation
   of Courses and Teaching (SECT) is a key component of university quality
   assurance, the overall aim of which is institutional improvement. Many
   universities have achieved a functional proficiency with SECT through
   electronic administration (eSECT). Students favour online distribution;
   digital data is less prone to error as compared to scanned forms and
   retyped student comments; the technology affords analysis and alignment
   with other indicators of quality assurance; and digital networks
   decrease turnaround time. While these advantages have been well
   documented in the literature, three themes for further investigation
   have emerged: design features and student response characteristics;
   opportunities for student engagement; and strategies for applying
   student feedback to university improvement. The project described in
   this paper addresses these domains through the collaborative efforts of
   strategically selected Team Members from eight Partner Institutions
   across five Australian states. The project is being undertaken in three
   stages, the first stage of which is described in this paper. Eight case
   studies were developed, compared and contrasted to identify themes and
   takeaways. The key process themes were: the importance of collaboration
   with key stakeholders throughout the change from paper to eSECT, and the
   benefits of integrating survey and report distribution with the learning
   management system. The unexpected finding was that, in many
   institutions, the student response rates were higher for online
   administration as compared to previous paper processes.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a case study of an evolving approach to teaching and
   learning that utilizes technology and advanced `flipped classroom'
   activity-based design to encourage students' lifelong learning skills.
   As O'Neil, Kelly, and Bone, (2012) note {[}1]:
   ``The flipped classroom is an innovative model of teaching which
   utilizes educational technology and directed activities to positively
   impact the learning environment. In a flipped classroom, the instructor
   serves as a facilitator and students are empowered to become active
   participants in their learning experience.{''}
   The case study shows how the principles of a `flipped classroom' as
   defined by Staker \& Horn are put into practice {[}2]. They state that a
   flipped classroom is where within a given course or subject, students
   move on a fixed schedule between face-to-face teacher-guided practice
   (or projects) on campus during timetabled sessions and online delivery
   of content and instruction of the same subject from a remote location
   (often home) in their own time. The primary delivery of learning is
   online. The Flipped-Classroom model accords with the idea that blended
   learning includes elements of student control over the time, place,
   path, and/or pace at which they learn.
   This case study evolved over the period 2008 to 2012 and shows how a
   rich and rewarding experience to learning and teaching developed through
   the application of technology and a learning activity-design approach.
   The innovative changes made to the traditional lecture based type of
   interaction are presented by colleagues instrumental and
   well-experienced in the design, development, delivery and enhancement of
   such a technology enhanced and flipped learning approach.
   The technology enhanced and flipped learning design process is
   described, as are experiences of its delivery. The case study highlights
   key features of this approach, the benefits, and drawbacks and offers
   valuable tips for those migrating to teach this way in the future.
   Using a blend of technology enhanced learning and `flipped' teaching
   techniques value has been added to the learning and teaching experience
   by enabling:
   Connectivity to information and to others.
   24/7 access to learning resources.
   Greater choice over the time, place and pace of study.
   Opportunities for reflection and planning in personal learning spaces.
   Rapid feedback on formative assessments.
   More active learning by means of interactive technologies and multimedia
   resources.
   Participation in communities of knowledge, inquiry and learning.
   Development of skills for living and working in a digital age.
   The case study enables practitioners to experience the enhancements to
   their learning and teaching activities as outlined by Knight {[}3].}},

Abstract = {{The change of communication from oral to chirografique has involved
   considerable and important changes in psychological and sociological
   nature. Writing has turned the thought processes, has expanded
   communication capabilities, has given the start to what the press has
   then amplified: the separation of the word from immediate present and
   the reduction of the sound in space. With the press, after more than six
   hundred years since the birth of Gutenberg, today we are faced with a
   myriad of technological innovations both in the field of electronic
   publishing and in the context of the media. The term ``ebook{''} (text
   in digital format, electronic book) indicate the publication in
   electronic format, the format in which the digital text is converted and
   the reader dispositive of e-text. Thanks to ebooks we have found a
   solution to the problem of preservation and dissemination of content, a
   new opportunity to redefine the relationship between author, reader,
   editor, an opportunity to revive the idea of universal and unconditional
   access to the knowledge, the ability to access through the internet to
   open virtual library where users have an active role and become the
   place to interact, collaborate, build new shared meanings.
   In Italy, starting from the 2009/2010 school year, the Ministry of
   Education, Universities and Research has sponsored Digital School Plan
   in order to modify learning environments thanks to the widespread
   introduction of technologies in support of teaching (in particular
   through the use of interactive whiteboard and the ebook). The research
   presented in this paper starts from this frame of reference. With the
   research we wanted to determine whether the use of ebooks in schools has
   resulted in an improvement in terms of the training organization and
   motivation of the students. The objectives of the research were those to
   provide an answer to the following questions: does the introduction of
   ebooks cause a value-added design of multimedia content? Does the use of
   the ebook promote pupils' motivation for learning?
   In the search 11 teachers (primary school and secondary school grade)
   and 89 students (68 of 11 years attending the first class of the
   secondary school of first instance and 21 of 9 years attending the
   fourth class of primary school) were involved. Two questionnaires were
   administered to educators and to students in order to acquire the
   information consistent with the objectives of the research and the
   results have corroborated the initial hypothesis. The use of the ebook
   has positive influence on the design of teaching activities mainly
   geared to encourage interactivity on the one hand between the individual
   student and the contents of knowledge and, on the other hand, to
   facilitate the interaction between the pupils themselves. We should also
   verify how students' motivation is greatly improved with positive
   repercussions in terms of quality of learning.}},

Abstract = {{There is now a plethora of Massive Open On-line courses (MOOCs) offered
   worldwide. Whilst many MOOCs focus on discipline-specific content,
   little attention has been paid to how MOOCs can explicitly help
   participants develop generic employability skills such as communication,
   digital literacy, global citizenship and the like. Similarly little
   attention been paid to explicitly assuring the quality of MOOCs with
   respect to alignment with regulatory body standards. Deakin University's
   first MOOC, DeakinPrimer, is an introduction to humanitarian responses
   to 21st century disasters. It has been designed to assist participants
   to explicitly evidence generic or employability skills, some of Deakin's
   eight Graduate Learning Outcomes (GLOs) including communication, digital
   literacy, critical thinking and global citizenship. Other key features
   of DeakinPrimer include opportunities for networking with fellow
   participants and experts within the humanitarian field, and the
   opportunity to apply for credit towards the Graduate Certificate in
   International Community Development (level 8 in the Australian
   Qualifications Framework {[}AQF]) and for those with a prior Bachelor
   degree, the Masters in Humanitarian Assistance or the Masters of
   International Community Development (level 9 in the AQF). DeakinPrimer
   is designed as a test bed for a learning innovation, particularly
   micro-credentialing GLOs using digital badges to enable self and peer
   endorsement of evidence of learning. Badging is integrated in two ways.
   Firstly, DeakinPrimer participants build portfolios of learning
   artefacts associated with learning activities, then assess their work
   against a set of holistic, generic learning outcomes standards rubrics.
   If they judge their evidence as meeting the required standard, they can
   claim a badge (self endorsement) associated with particular GLOs.
   Secondly, participants can request and provide peer feedback and
   endorsement (using peer badges). The integration of self and peer review
   in the assessment tasks helps participants develop important
   employability skills, the ability to critically self-reflect on their
   own work and critically analyse the work of others and provide
   evidence-based feedback. DeakinPrimer is scheduled to commence in July
   2013. This paper explains the way in which the course curricula has been
   designed to use technologies to enable participants to curate evidence
   of learning, and self and peer endorse such learning against defined
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{Under the inevitable trend of globalization, intercultural communication
   seems to become a crucial part of education in today's culturally
   diverse societies, confronting educators around the world with both new
   opportunities as well as challenges. Libraries, as an indispensable
   support of higher education experience, nowadays have a role that is far
   more than a passive storage of information. Many libraries are
   proactively seeking to adjust to their new roles and involve
   technologies to improve their services.
   This paper will present the authors educational, internship and personal
   relations with two universities and their libraries, regarding how they
   utilize latest technologies to promote cross-cultural communication to
   enrich users' learning and extracurricular experience, through a
   comparative perspective based on the author's involvement with each
   library respectively. The focus of discussion will be the increasingly
   important role of intercultural communication in education and how
   modern libraries can serve as a well-equipped platform and how they
   motivate and involve users to engage in cross-cultural learning
   experience. The paper also seeks to pave way for further discussion on
   how libraries across borders can join forces in terms of culture,
   resources and ideas on education.
   David B. Weigle Information Commons (WIC), an innovative section of the
   Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center at University of Pennsylvania Libraries
   (UPenn) in the United States, has explored the uses of new media
   technologies to support intercultural communication. WIC uses a variety
   of communication tools (social media, video) to engage students and
   faculty in new ways of capturing learning outcomes. Many activities of
   the Commons are staffed by undergraduate and graduate students. Students
   provide technology, public speaking and program assistance, and present
   a variety of workshops to peers. Each year, the Commons hosts an
   International Experiences Festival. WIC has also collected examples of
   exemplary student work for a multimedia student showcase.
   (http://wic.library.upenn.edu)
   As one of the major ``out-classroom{''} learning centres in the campus,
   Hong Kong City University Library, one of the best-reputed in the
   region, endeavors to take advantage of the existing collections and
   resources, while seeking opportunities for cross-regional cooperation
   for more shared resources to reposition the library as an intellectual
   hub and to raise the functionality of space so that a balance can be
   struck between the ever-expanding collection, evolving technologies and
   growing user needs. Special focus will be given on 1) the Outstanding
   Academic Papers by Students (OPAS) program, which is an online portal
   jointly contributed by several notable universities in China, Hong Kong,
   Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand Japan, and more, aiming at promoting
   academic achievement and collaborative learning through innovation and
   multicultural exchange; 2) the newly announced Digital Collections cum
   Rare Book Exhibition. (http://www.cityu.edu.hk/lib/)
   WIC and HK CityU Library, both as active players among libraries in
   their regions and vivid representatives of western and eastern ideology
   of education respectively, are now seeking opportunities for future
   collaboration. An outline of potential cooperation of will be proposed,
   taking into account the advantages and characteristics of educational
   ideologies as well as their different culture and approaches to support
   higher education.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper consists in analysing the PoliDaido project as a
   case study on the use of e-learning and digital communication at
   extra-European level. This was a project developed in collaboration with
   the Architecture Department of the Daido University (Nagoya, Japan) and
   the School of Architecture and Society of the Politecnico di Milano
   (Milan, Italy). The project involved students of the Politecnico di
   Milano (Italians, Foreigners from several Countries enrolled in the
   Architectural Master Degree Course and also Erasmus Students) and
   students of Daido University in Nagoya attending to two parallel Studio
   Project Courses. PoliDaido collaboration provided blended activities,
   face-to-face and via web, with distance exchanges on the platform,
   mainly in asynchronous mode, and a final workshop (in Japan or in
   Italy), attended by the teaching staff with the local students. Milanese
   and Japanese students worked on the same topic in a virtual workshop,
   called `Cscape', and had the opportunity to interact online among them
   and with teachers thanks to the multimedia platform ``e-project{''}
   released by Centro METID of the Politecnico di Milano. As a virtual
   laboratory PoliDaido focused on two activities: on the one hand the
   sharing of structured resources, with the exchange of academic materials
   (hand-outs, readings) and the publication of the architectural projects
   prepared by working groups, on the other hand distance communication
   among people, using instant chat channels, but also the graphics
   functionalities of the platform to facilitate dialogue and confrontation
   among designers. The technological tool solved the linguistic gap
   between the users (teachers and students), by introducing a kind of
   communication mainly written and asynchronous, using English language.
   PoliDaido was part of a ``e-learning{''} research project with the aim
   of designing tools specialised for online design training and devoted to
   the creation of a virtual environment in which students and teachers
   belonging to different countries and having different cultures could
   interact by sharing information and multimedia files to develop new
   ideas and innovate solutions. The paper presents the results of this
   five-years-long experience, and what we learned from this positive
   experience.}},

Abstract = {{Web based applications are already widely used in health promotion
   campaign, thanks to their potential in spreading information and
   involving the audience. These tools, increasing the level of
   interactivity, facilitate the sharing of experience creating new
   learning contexts. However the effectiveness of digital tools in the
   learning process and their ability of arousing curiosity and
   appreciation of the target group need to be investigated.
   Over the last few years the internet has fostered an important space for
   the creation of narratives. The digital storytelling has now become a
   social phenomenon, generated by the personal need to tell one's one
   story through self-produced digital videos uploaded on video sharing
   channels such as You Tube and Vimeo. Storytelling is nowadays
   successfully used in school setting and workplace as a mean of
   discussion and contextualization of knowledge thanks to the formative
   and educational meaning of narration highlighted by numerous pedagogical
   studies.
   The research project ``Chemical risks in food: comparing web and paper
   communication tools{''}, promoted by Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale delle Venezie, aims to experiment this approach with high
   school students in the specific field of education related to food
   chemical risks.
   The study had a dual purpose: on the one hand to test a participatory
   process for the creation of communication campaigns in which
   storytelling technique could be applied to issues of psychosocial impact
   such as food safety; on the other hand to evaluate the strengths and
   weaknesses of digital media in comparison with more conventional
   communication intervention.
   A communicative message on chemical risks in food was developed with the
   involvement of 50 adolescent aged between 16 and 18. Students actively
   worked on the production of a story, used to develop two different
   communication tools: a video interpreted by the students themselves and
   a comic strip in which characters were drawn from photos of the actors
   in the video.
   Students' participation was pivotal to develop a message and to design
   tools according to the target expectations, preferences and social
   setting. Furthermore, psychological studies suggest that the active role
   of the recipients of the message in realizing educational intervention
   appears to improve the understanding of issues related to health risk
   prevention, increasing the effectiveness in positively modifying
   attitudes and behaviours.
   Both the communication tools were evaluated by a sample of 393 high
   school students from 5 provinces of the North East Italy. The efficacy
   and the level of appreciation were assessed by means of a structured
   face-to-face questionnaire.
   The results show a difference in the level of approval of the two tools.
   The video received lower approval scores compared to the comics. Several
   studies confirmed that digital media and videos can be suitable tools to
   improve learning and scientific communication to adolescent. Therefore
   it is essential to deepen the understanding of the tools specific
   features preferred by the target group before developing an online
   health communication intervention.
   This research provides useful data to enhancing knowledge, methods and
   tools for the implementation of effective communication campaign on food
   risks and the design of innovative strategies for the promotion of
   public health.}},

   and chose which ones to elaborate. In a second step, they wrote together
   the storyboards and created the videos. This process, promoted
   reflective processes and generated a real ``community of practice{''},
   created by collaborating in a productive environment and negotiating
   shared meanings: this contributed to subjects taking on a new
   perspective about their job and helped them reach a higher level of
   awareness about their specific professional competencies and critical
   work issues. Moreover, the use of Digital Storytelling, in this kind of
   context, was a real trigger to developing effective team-building
   processes, fostering high levels of commitment and motivation, and
   ``capturing{''} tacit knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{As a catalyst for educational change we can read how technology produces
   ways of thought and behavior as extension of ourselves and the
   conditions in which we understand subjective realities through digital
   modes of knowledge exchange. Using the case study of the development of
   an educational mobile application the work addresses the way digital
   spaces can become specific and central to meaning and understanding,
   rather than an alternative form of delivery the learning place creates
   new interactions and the learner is able to engage with the research
   across larger knowledge networks, through use of applications and shared
   resources. The digital space in which a learner participates occupies a
   center of meaning constructed by experience. The work identifies the
   significance of place and how this is structured through interaction
   with mobile technology. One of the defining characteristics of new
   technologies is they embody mass socialization of Internet connections
   and activities based around the collective actions of communities of
   users rather than individuals. In this sense, much digital technology
   use can be seen as a `hybrid of tool and community' (Shirky 2008, p.
   136), referring to services and applications that rely on `openly shared
   digital content that is authored, critiqued and reconfigured by a mass
   of users'.
   I intend to present my work through the rationale of the development of
   a social networking mobile phone application to augment the physical
   classroom space and develop a new space for interaction. How do these
   transitory digital spaces become embedded with the experiences symbolic
   of a place of learning? The concept of place develops from
   understandings of large areas of open access digital space that is
   neither innocent nor neutral, but an instrument of the political; with a
   performative aspect for whoever inhabits it (Pouler in Scheer and
   Preiser 1994, p. 175). Marc Auge (2008) argues that the facts of
   post-modernity `point to a need for radical rethinking of the notion of
   place. Place, he argues has traditionally been thought of as a fantasy
   of a society anchored since time immemorial in the permanence of an
   intact soil'. How can we use technology to develop new sites of learning
   and alternative digital spaces?}},

Abstract = {{Modern technology incorporates a wide range of digital technologies,
   including those created specifically for everyday tasks typically
   operated in stand-alone mode. Yet, innovations in mobile technologies
   and the Internet influence design and adoption of these everyday
   technologies by introducing new interaction techniques and by providing
   access to information and people that facilitate effective use. This
   chapter describes best practices and challenges for enabling older
   adults to adopt everyday technologies transformed by technology
   innovations. First, the authors define everyday technologies and known
   factors influencing successful use including environmental support and
   context of use. Then, they discuss issues and challenges of design for
   everyday technologies and summarize the factors that influence everyday
   technology use in a conceptual diagram. The authors also present
   recommendations for specific constituents that may improve technology
   adoption by older adults. Lastly, they discuss future opportunities for
   enhancing everyday technology use with good design, useful support, and
   appropriate innovations.}},

Abstract = {{Business modeling frameworks are important means for developing new
   business ideas. Resulting business models can assist in decision making
   on whether to implement an innovation. We argue that business modeling
   frameworks have to be process-oriented. Process-orientation in business
   modeling has two major advantages: Different stakeholders' perspectives
   may be integrated and business model information may easily be reused in
   the later innovation process. In this article we introduce the
   process-oriented business model framework Octoproz and its application
   in an innovation workshop in a real life scenario of a printing industry
   case company. Our qualitative results suggest that Octoproz assists
   business modelers in detailing and structuring business ideas in a
   meaningful and comprehensive way. However, we identified a pain point in
   financial calculations in process-oriented business modeling. Our
   framework requires improvement to provide for guidance in the
   calculation process. Moreover, we found that Octoproz is limited in its
   applicability for purely digital business models. We finally indicate
   directions for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Novel means for understanding our lives, organizations and societies are
   coming from the digital world and the Internet: a massive amount of
   information is emerging from the digitization of contemporary cities,
   through technologies embedded into streets and buildings or carried by
   people and vehicles. This stratification of experiences demands new
   modes of inquiry and synthesis: a new generation of city maps capable to
   define and visualize both physical and social environments, as well as
   individual and collective narratives.
   Telltale is a research project conducted among three different
   departments of Politecnico di Milano (Design department, DAStU
   department of Architecture and Urban Studies, DEIB department of
   Electronics, Information and Bioengineering) aiming at disclosing and
   exposing emerging issues, discourses, and uses of the cities of Milan
   and New York. This is done by observing and visualizing the digital
   traces coming from the direct experience of people who live in, visit or
   just pass through the city, and the news that narrate its stories and
   rumors, expecting to support and improve policy-making practices and to
   provide all the stakeholders with new insights about their cities While
   traditional methods used for acquiring and processing information about
   the cities and its fruition seem to be inadequate to meet this need, the
   necessary challenge for urban studies lies in the integration of
   available digital knowledge bases together with innovative uses of
   traditional data, aimed at capturing the variety of changes in urban
   practices.
   To us, sustainability can be interpreted also as the possibility to
   listen to people's attitudes and perceptions about their surroundings
   trying to retum multiple and overlapping dynamic images of the city as
   it is used by its citizens (residents and temporary users). This, to
   help stakeholders and decision makers at the urban scale to achieve more
   responsible decisions both at the micro (local) and macro (city) scale.
   The paper presents the on-going research project aims and intermediate
   results enlightening:
   a general framework we built to organize the actual knowledge we can
   extract from user generated content,
   the most meaningful urban questions possibly to be answered through
   those data, - the description of the platform we are building to extract
   urban knowledge,
   actual applications of Telltale methods and platform for supporting
   decision making processes at urban scale.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Performing peripheral nerve block is a key element in the
   curriculum of medical students, in particular, anesthesiologists.
   Regions considered optimal for performing peripheral nerve blocking have
   been well documented. However, students and professors show difficulties
   in both learning and teaching the way to identify and perform regional
   anesthesia in those regions from ultrasound images. Purpose. This study
   aims to develop a virtual environment for the simulation of ultrasound
   exploration of the neck nerves and both the upper and lower limbs for
   regional anesthesia teaching and learning. Method. Cross-sectional
   images were obtained from Magnetic Resonance Imaging for puncture
   regions involved in ultrasound-guided nerve block. Results. A
   three-dimensional digital viewer was developed which allowed the
   identification of key structures involved in peripheral nerve block in
   neck, upper and lower limbs. Additionally, a complete list of
   neuromuscular systems of the arms and legs, involving nerves and
   muscles, are also displayed for their study. Conclusions. Implications
   for learning and teaching the ultrasound exploration for regional
   anesthesia procedures and acquisition of anatomical knowledge are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Educational innovation involves focusing classroom dynamics towards new
   trends. For this purpose it is necessary to make effective changes in
   teaching practices and to adapt them to the specific contexts of their
   creation. The inclusion of Information and Communication Technology
   (ICT) has led to most of the advances in the field of education over the
   last three decades. This is due to the fact that the role of ICT is not
   only reduced to the provision of new teaching tools, but has also led to
   the continuous introduction of new approaches to essential elements of
   education: (1) teaching programs; (2) learning; (3) teaching; and (4)
   work relationships among teachers, students and other actors.
   The works that make up this track deal with certain of these aspects
   through the contribution of results obtained from research proving that
   innovation processes developed from emerging technologies are changing
   school dynamics, which could ultimately involve major changes in
   educational processes, schools, classrooms and teacher training.}},

Abstract = {{The collaboration of diverse educational agents mainly promotes learning
   from such cooperative initiatives, while it aims at making every
   participant learn with and from each other in reflective, critical and
   autonomous ways, conducive to an improvement of the shared construction
   of knowledge. In this context, ICT constitutes a most suitable tool for
   the generation of joint communicative spaces where manifold variables
   may converge and a wide range of methodologies and strategies can be
   activated, thus fostering richer levels of interaction and a swift
   communication between its users.
   Within this framework, this article seeks to describe and analyze
   technologically mediated collaborative work experiences in Level 5
   accredited primary schools of Castile and Leon. Qualitative methods were
   used to that end, which allowed us to identify the teachers' perceptions
   of the use of ICT in the preparation and delivery of their subject
   matters. The results evince that teachers hold a positive view once they
   have used such technology-based approaches, although they demand a
   better provision of infrastructures and more institutional support,
   including specific aids for life-long learning schemes. Conclusions of
   this study have been drawn both to help and to offer some guidance to
   teachers engaged in innovative, collaborative, and
   technologically-assisted curricular processes within 2.0 school
   settings.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was developed under the Innovation Project
   ``Evaluation and monitoring of the use of virtual teaching tools in a
   teaching b-learning stage{''}. Its main purpose was, above all, to
   evaluate the use of Studium by teachers in the Department of Didactics,
   Organization and Research Methods at Salamanca University. Studium is
   the Moodle platform (http://moodle.usal.es), supported by the University
   of Salamanca (USAL). We have pretended to take into account teachers'
   point of view to subsequently propose improvement actions.
   The results showed how the subjects related to Information Technology
   and Communication (ICT) have integrated more digital content as well as
   activities such as surveys and wikis. In the same group,
   self-assessment, evaluation of work and tests punctuate significantly
   higher. However, there is no perceptible difference in the interaction
   among students themselves and in students with teachers groups.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some of the challenges ahead of us even after 75
   years of the discovery of the fission process and large progress made
   since then. The focus is on application orientation, which requires
   improved measurements on fission cross-sections and neutron and
   gamma-ray multiplicities. Experimental possibilities have vastly
   improved the past decade leading to developments of highly sophisticated
   detector systems and the use of digital data acquisition and signal
   processing. The development of innovative fast nuclear reactor
   technology requires improved respective nuclear data. Advancements in
   theoretical modeling also require better experimental data. Theory has
   made progress in calculating fission fragment distributions (GEF code,
   FREYA code) as well as prompt neutron and gamma-ray emission to catch up
   with the improved experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Landforms classification is one of the applications based on digital
   terrain model (DTM). There were evaluated several classification methods
   like Hammond's (1964), Dikau's (1991), Pike's (2006), etc. These methods
   were automated and they are innovating and testing for different types
   of terrain nowadays. Innovations lie mainly in a processing of more
   precise data and an adjusting the methods to get more precise and
   valuable result.
   The paper deals with a comparison testing of methods for landforms
   classification over study DEMs. The area of Moravian part of Beskydy
   Mountains was selected as a study area. There was tested witch
   classification system and its setting are suitable for the study area.
   Hammond's classification with Dikau landform code (1991) and with MORAP
   landform code and Wood classification (1996) were used. There are
   several input options for these classifications. Settings according
   Barka et al. {[}10] and Morgan and Lesh {[}9] were compared. Testing was
   provided by script in GRASS GIS software.}},

Abstract = {{Educ@tion is an application framework available to teachers, students,
   and headmasters, based on the integration of open source modules and
   specific developments of Telecom Italia, which do not require licensing
   costs. It is made up of a range of innovative didactic applications,
   which are integrated with an advanced solution for dashboard data
   management and school administration. The prototype is being tested in
   several Italian primary and secondary schools. During the academic year
   2010/2011, Telecom Italia has run two trials in particular in two
   Italian high schools (one in Naples and the other in Trent). During
   these experiences teachers and students have tested the innovative
   module of editorial mash up, for the collaborative aggregation of
   multimedia didactic materials. Both schools have highlighted a major
   student feeling of involvement, their increased enthusiasm for the
   school and a higher rate of grades in the classes that had been involved
   in the digital activities.}},

Abstract = {{Roman underground cemeteries are an heritage to be safeguarded and
   enhanced. They constitute the memory of customs, traditions and rituals
   of a civilization. In Syracuse there are different catacombs complex
   (San Giovanni, Vigna Cassia and Santa Lucia). They are the most ancient
   document of Christianity in Sicily. Sometimes, plano-altimetric layout
   reuses existing hydraulic structures (aqueducts, private channels,
   cisterns) and earlier burial areas of the city.
   The Aim of the research is the knowledge and the enhancement of the San
   Giovanni's catacomb complex through digital technologies for 3D data
   acquisition and virtual models that characterize and document its shape,
   size, geometry and materials. Moreover, digital enhancement project
   foresees the creation of a multimedia platform for archaeological
   complex guided tours and online ones.
   That methodological approach required an interdisciplinary team composed
   by archaeologists, architects, engineers and experts in cultural
   communication.
   Within digitization project our research team had to tackle wide-ranging
   issues and challenges: the sheer size of the complex, the intricate
   layout of the rooms and galleries, the surface irregularities, the bad
   lighting conditions, the significant amount of data to process and
   manage.
   The scientific survey of the archaeological complex is the
   metric/spatial support that can be used to start innovative methods that
   allow you to create new scenarios for experimentation finalized to
   multi-disciplinary knowledge and enhancement of not easily accessible
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper analyses together information technologies and
   health, to address the question of how social networks may, with
   knowledge sharing to patients, doctors, health care stakeholders,
   provide a new vehicle to build new emerging ``smart organizations{''}.
   The purpose of this paper is to explore with a conceptual approach how
   social media (Facebook) can be used strategically to promote social
   innovation. The evolution of the Information Technologies opens, today,
   new organizational scenarios also in the healthcare systems: the virtual
   revolution announces a new model of society in which healthcare
   organizations must change radically managerial imperatives, the
   structures, the processes and organizational cultures; if they want to
   survive they must be able to penetrate in emotionality of persons
   (Normann, 2006). The health care organizations, complex adaptive
   systems, must become open and collaborative systems, capable of
   developing deep partnerships with patients, their families and the
   community benefits from offered services, improving thus the
   effectiveness and efficiency of medical care. To achieve this, it is
   necessary to create places, especially virtual, where new
   ``distinctive{''} knowledge is created, a knowledge that spreads through
   relational assets that are established between the human components. The
   communication process, therefore, takes a central role, both in the
   operator-user relationships and in the operator- operator relationships.
   Design/methodology/approach - We implement an approach in which patients
   are active participants in their own care and we develop a model more
   collaborative and human that challenges dogmas of communication deeply
   held inside health organizations to create a ``new value{''}. The
   research topic is very complex; therefore, the empirical analysis has
   been a key point to address it. The data were collected through a pilot
   project at the national level, which involved 1500 people, including
   doctors, members of different health care organizations, and patients.
   Originality/value - The pilot project, starting from the existing data
   in the literature on the use of virtual communication and of social
   networks in health care organization, brings to light the fact that
   today health care organizations are using Facebook as a showcase,
   without exploiting its true potential. The paper identify to what extent
   Italian hospitals use social media and if the use of social networks
   such as communication systems in health care organization improves the
   human relationship and communication between the patient and the health
   care system. In fact, replacing medical text cryptic with a natural
   language, enhanced, where possible, by audio or video recordings, it is
   possible to maintain the specific terminology needed to identify
   possible pathologies, reducing the ambiguity. Patients and doctors are
   linked ``anywhere and anytime{''}. Healthcare organizations that
   implement communication systems, using Facebook, may benefit from the
   ability of this to give a voice to patients, to communicate fast, to be
   near to the patients, to develop a ``new image{''} of ``social
   hospitals{''} that is of smart organizations.
   Practical implications - This methodology puts in evidence the need to
   reaffirm and reshape ``the closeness and distance{''} between healthcare
   organizations and individuals. Patients today have a ``digital
   identity{''}, spend their free time online in social networks, they have
   energy, enthusiasm and ability to find on-line solutions to their
   pathologies, they speak the language of the computer, they love the
   virtual interaction. And it's the same for doctors: a new generation,
   ``always on-line{''} (Veen and Vrakking, 2010) who is connected,
   content-centric, computerized, community oriented. In this scenario
   hospitals seem to be becoming aware of the benefits social media could
   offer but they are still rather sceptical about how Facebook can be
   used. The challenge is due and it must be not only organizational but,
   above all, cultural (Normann, 1996).}},
