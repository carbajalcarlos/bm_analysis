Abstract = {{Through analyzing the current situation of digital signal processing
   teaching, the lack of cultivating students' thinking ability and
   innovation is serious in the current teaching model. Then, the
   conceptive is put forward that an interactive teaching model is used in
   digital signal processing teaching; the requirements and specific
   programs are built; the interactive virtual platform and network Lab for
   digital signal processing learning are developed. Practice Teaching
   proves that interactive teaching model will help to stimulate students'
   interest in learning, and develop students' practical ability and

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a project to digitise
   maps at the Royal Tropical Institute, or Koninklijk Instituut voor de
   Tropen (KIT), of The Netherlands. KIT has an extensive collection of
   maps and nautical charts of (sub-) tropical regions, including general
   maps and topographical map series, city maps, thematic maps and national
   atlases. The collection comprises some 27,000 maps and over 1,000
   atlases. Almost 12,000 maps are from the former Dutch colonies,
   Netherlands Indies (Indonesia), Surinam and The Netherlands Antilles.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper explains how users have access
   to the maps via the Library's online catalogue. One of the future goals
   is combining the KIT collections in order to make it possible to search
   a map and to find accompanying documents, museum objects and photographs
   and to add more metadata.
   Findings - The paper finds that the digitised collection of maps has
   been used by various researchers as well as by relief workers in the
   aftermath of the tsunami in Indonesia.
   Originality/value - The innovative part of the project is the ability to
   search by location and to navigate through serial maps. A link with
   Google Earth makes it possible to compare an old map with a new
   satellite image.}},

Title = {{Collaboration nation: the building of the Welsh Repository Network}},
Journal = {{PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{98-108}},
Abstract = {{Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to disseminate information about
   the Welsh Repository Network (WRN), innovative work being undertaken to
   build an integrated network of institutional digital repositories. A
   collaborative approach, in particular through the provision of
   centralised technical and organisational support, has demonstrated
   improvement in the use and curation of digital repository content across
   Wales.
   Design/methodology/approach - The vision of the WRN has been delivered
   using two project phases; the first establishing technical
   infrastructure followed by a phase focussing on user engagement, content
   generation and enhancement of repository interfaces. The methodologies
   used have involved gathering technical requirements and procurement and
   installation of repository solutions, including a cash injection of
   4,000 pound per institution to purchase suitable hardware. The current
   phase explores experimental approaches to stimulate engagement, embed
   solutions and generate content to populate the repositories.
   Collaboration is the overarching theme driving the approach.
   Findings - The WRN is now a physical entity offering complete national
   coverage. Vitally, the WRN is also functioning as a virtual network. The
   variety of technical repository solutions implemented reflect the
   variety of institutions with makeup, current computing infrastructure
   and staffing levels all influencing the chosen infrastructure. Current
   challenges focus on organisational aspects of engagement; culture
   change, strategic buy-in and policy issues have all proved significant.
   Originality/value - The WRN demonstrates that collaboration results in
   success. The model can inform and lead others considering repository
   matters and has provided findings of interest and value to many wider
   communities from repository specific, through information and research
   management to the information profession as whole.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. - To assess the diagnosis and therapeutic management of the benign
   prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by the general practitioners (GPs) in the
   Maine-et-Loire.
   Patient and methods. - A questionnaire evaluating the management of BPH
   was sent to the 686 GPs of the Maine-et-Loire between March and June
   2008.
   Results. - One hundred and seventy-one GPs answered. Among them 24\%
   were women, 35.1\% worked in urban areas, 34.5\% worked in semi-urban
   areas and 30.4\% worked in rural areas. 17.5\% had been working less
   than 10 years, 29.2\% had been working between 10 and 20 years and
   53.2\% had been working more than 20 years. The medical interview, the
   digital rectal examination (DRE) and the assay of the prostatic serum
   antigen (PSA) were performed by more than 90\% of the GPs whereas the
   ultrasound scan and the international prostatic score symptom (IPSS)
   were respectively used by only 15,2 and 69,6\% of them. Phytotherapy,
   alphablockers and inhibitors of 5 alpha reductase were respectively
   prescribed by 85.4, 95.3 and 53.8\% of the GPs. 96.5\% of the GPs
   addressed the patient to a urologist after the failure of the first line
   treatment. There were no differences according to the working
   environment. Women performed less DRE (p<0.0001) and sent more patients
   to urologist than men (p=0.0197). Finally, 88.9\% of the GPs were
   interested in having an update on the last recommendations.
   Conclusion. - The GPs diagnosed BPH and initiated the first line
   treatment. In case of failure, they sent the patients to a urologist.
   Their primary treatment management was not really in adequation with the
   recommendations. The recent therapeutic innovations may explain this
   discordance between the clinical practice and the recommendations. It is
   noteworthy that most of the GPs who answered this survey were keen in
   having an update on the recent advances in the BPH management. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Knowledge economy is resulting into competition which increases the
   demand for innovation. The wave has urged libraries which faced no
   competition before to think of ways to add and show more value to its
   users. The coming of digital libraries and other information providers
   challenges traditional libraries to improve its practices before
   becoming obsolete. This paper is based on the findings from the research
   for the Master thesis focused on establishing the relationship between
   intellectual capital and knowledge sharing. It is an explanatory survey
   addressing the issue of intangible assets as unseen value in public
   libraries. The research intended to use both a questionnaire and
   interview to ensure validity. A questionnaire was designed in such a way
   that key questions were asked alternatively in the same questionnaire to
   compensate the interview which its feasibility was constrained by time
   and distance. The questionnaire was then administered to six different
   universities to ensure reliability of the findings. As a consequence of
   distance and difficulties in selecting respondents, snowball sampling
   was used. Descriptive narrative and mapping were then used to explain
   the findings. Due to time and distance constraints the research focused
   only on the aspect of human capital and structural capital and leaves
   such aspects as customer capital, renewal capital and process capital to
   be covered by other researchers.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of digital media puts a heavy pressure on the classical
   models of learning and teaching. Including argumentation in the array of
   instruments used by e-learning is not only rewarding from a didactic
   point of view, but also technically challenging. This paper an online
   debate platform that combines a ``Peer Instruction{''} like strategy for
   actively engaging students with argument based techniques. Our research
   is focused on developing an algorithm that computes the value of
   ``social validation{''} in a debate and methods for evaluating the
   student involvement. The paper will also present the server side
   components and the general architecture of the platform, conceived as a
   service provider for any e-Learning Management System. Using this
   application, the teacher will be able to generate debates based on
   concepts from his/her pedagogical materials, involving students in
   critical thinking activities. At the same time, teachers will presents
   be able to evaluate each student's level of understanding and learning,
   based on the content and the extent of contribution to the debate.
   Implemented as a web service platform, the tool should be accessed from
   learning management systems such as Moodle, Blackboard etc, from blogs
   and personal websites and could be attached to any digital content. The
   platform is an argument mapping tool optimized for use even in the
   classroom as a background channel of discussions.}},

Abstract = {{The paper explores the curriculum and materials design of a Lingua
   project for Romanian as a foreign language. The A2 (CEFR) blended
   learning course targets adults who need Romanian for study or the
   profession. The methodology of autonomous learning and the motivational
   value of the face to face component are analysed. The paper is rooted in
   research of competence-based concepts for foreign language curriculum
   development derived from language learning and assessment instruments
   such as the Common European Framework of Reference and the European
   Language Portfolio. Our innovative approach applies CEFR principles to
   curriculum design for Romanian as a foreign language at A2 level. This
   entails adapting existing models to the specificity of the Romanian
   language, while also incorporating recent work into European models of
   blended learning materials development and methodology. The role of
   supporting instruments for learners and blended learning tutors is
   highlighted throughout. Innovation comes from the competence-based
   curriculum, the blended learning approach facilitating autonomous
   learning, and the cross curricular dimension engendering learner and
   tutor digital competence. Self/evaluation abilities are fostered.
   Learning path customisation is achieved through learner freedom to
   control own agenda and check progress. Web 2.0 applications help deliver
   the online course. The Romanian A2 blended learning course is the work
   of Romanian materials developers experienced in creating paper-based
   materials for teaching/learning English, with support from such
   international professionals. The Romanian course highlights how blended
   learning benefits foreign language learning, how a competence-based
   curriculum can be developed, and how teaching Romanian as a foreign
   language is consistent with foreign language teaching. The VLE hosting
   the course and BL methodology help professionalise the teaching of
   Romanian as a foreign language. The course can be extensively used with
   Erasmus students and foreign students in their preparatory year who need
   to consolidate their Romanian as a foreign language skills. The facility
   of assisting tutors in how to use the platform creatively and develop
   new exercises and learner-specific tasks is another added value.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation in teaching, learning and research is core to the mission of
   higher education. It is what we try to do, a collaborative environment
   that inspires collective teaching, learning and research. Thus, the
   objective of this research is to identify the requirements of e-learning
   system implementation. This research for Danubius Online Collaboration
   and E-learning Environment (CLE) focuses on proposing a suitable
   framework of e-learning deployment. A selection and comparison with
   several e-learning systems are made and finally decide which is the most
   suitable for our requirements. At the end of this research, the selected
   e-learning software is proposed to Danubius Online developers. It will
   be used as a guideline in developing the Danubius Online CLE. The
   Danubius CLE provides a student-centered platform for learning that can
   transform the educational experience. The platform allows users to
   store, organize and present digital representation of the teaching,
   learning or offers a host of capabilities to support research
   collaboration. The paper aims to highlight the importance of
   implementing Danubius Online CLE, which provides to users flexibility to
   select and combine tools required to support and achieve individual and
   collaborative project objectives. The Danubius Online CLE purpose is to
   communicate the goals and issues of the teaching and learning community
   for a better documentation, support and quality assurance of the higher
   education within the Danubius University. Being part of The Sakai
   Community, the platform provides an opportunity for users to improve the
   quality of the collaborative learning environment, and to share best
   practices in teaching, learning and research.}},

   organized into a searchable digital library collection containing 380
   million five-word sequences drawn from a vocabulary of 145,000 words
   Although the phrases are short, learners can browse more extended

   evaluations were conducted. an expert user tested file system to see if

Abstract = {{The increasing demand of affordable continuous fibre reinforced polymer
   composites for structural applications requires an improved
   understanding on parameters that control the quality of the fibrous
   performs and composites. Getting a better definition of the final
   textile structure is one of the major issues for 3D textiles. 3D textile
   structures consist of the distribution and assembly of fibrous materials
   in several directions by various processes such as of weaving, knitting
   and braiding. Nevertheless, the accurate prediction of the mechanical
   behaviour of such composites and transport properties in dry textiles is
   strongly linked to the ability to predict the spatial arrangement of the
   yams. This may be challenging due to the complex paths of the yarns
   controlled by the textile technology. The use of the digital simulation
   of the textile manufacturing process is a useful help to predict the
   intricate fibrous architecture that depends on the waviness and
   distortion of the yams. Moreover the use of appropriate numerical
   approaches to predict transport properties is necessary to avoid meshing
   issues. In this study, a numerical tool has been developed to simulate
   the manufacturing of 3D textile structures. The kinematic motion of the
   textile process is modelled along with the mechanical interactions of
   the yams with their environment. The approach is based on a physical
   based simulation including contacts between yams, contacts between yam
   and the braiding tool. This simulation methodology accounts also for the
   mechanical deformation of the yam and changes in the orientation to the
   geometrical constraints of the process. The hydraulic permeability of
   the computed yam arrangement is predicted using a mesh free lagrangian
   approach called Finite Point Method (FPM). FPM is an innovative
   mesh-free thermal CFD code for incompressible and compressible flows.
   FPM includes Newtonian or non-Newtonian viscosity laws, natural
   convection, heat conduction, heat exchange at the boundaries.
   Mesh free techniques enables to deal with the complicated topologies
   such as woven fabrics for which a mesh is very difficult to obtain. FPM
   enables to predict the permeability of a complicated woven fabric on an
   elementary cell. The computed permeability can then be used for Resin
   Transfer Molding (RTM) applications. Results with FPM will be shown with
   an overview of the method.}},

Abstract = {{NSF's NSDL is composed of domain-oriented pathways. Ensemble is the
   pathway for computing and supports the full range of computing education
   communities, providing a base for the development of programs that blend
   computing with other STEM areas (e.g., X-informatics and Computing + X),
   and producing digital library innovations that can be propagated to
   other NSDL pathways. Computing is a distributed community, including
   computer science, computer engineering, software engineering,
   information science, information systems, and information technology.
   Ensemble aims to provide much needed support for the many distinct yet
   overlapping educational programs in computing and their associated
   communities. To do this, Ensemble takes the form of a distributed portal
   providing access to the broad range of existing educational resources
   while preserving the collections and their associated curatorial
   processes. Ensemble encourages contribution, use, reuse, review, and
   evaluation of educational materials at multiple levels of granularity.}},

Abstract = {{Machine vision is widely used in an industrial environment today. It can
   perform various tasks, such as inspecting and controlling production
   processes, that may require humanlike intelligence. The importance of
   imaging technology for biological research or medical diagnosis is
   greater than ever. For example, fluorescent reporter imaging enables
   scientists to study the dynamics of gene networks with high spatial and
   temporal resolution. Such high-throughput imaging is increasingly
   demanding the use of machine vision for real-time analysis and control.
   Digital microfluidics is a relatively new technology with expectations
   of becoming a true lab-on-a-chip platform. Utilizing digital
   microfluidics, only small amounts of biological samples are required and
   the experimental procedures can be automatically controlled. There is a
   strong need for the development of a digital microfluidics system
   integrated with machine vision for innovative biological research today.
   In this paper, we show how machine vision can be applied to digital
   microfluidics by demonstrating two applications: machine vision-based
   measurement of the kinetics of biomolecular interactions and machine
   vision-based droplet motion control. It is expected that digital
   microfluidics-based machine vision system will add intelligence and
   automation to high-throughput biological imaging in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The recent seismic events that have affected different areas of the
   planet point out the need to respond quickly to emergencies caused by
   these events; for this reason a semi-automatic method was experimented
   which would provide information concerning the damaged buildings in the
   study area through satellite images.. In September 1997 an earthquake
   hit the study area, causing significant damage to a number of towns and
   villages in the area. This research attempts to: a) improve the digital
   surface model extracted from lkonos satellite images covering an area of
   central Italy (Foligno, Umbria), through the pre-processing of raw
   images and manual editing b) study the best DSM models to improve the
   detection of height differences, mainly in urban areas, and evaluate the
   results of the land cover classification as further data for detecting
   changes in building distribution. DSM obtained by three-dimensional maps
   have been compared with DSM extracted directly from aerial stereo pairs
   using different approaches. The innovative aspect of the experiment is
   that of wanting to evaluate whether the combined use of multispectral
   classification techniques and altimetric aspects taken from
   high-resolution satellite images can make the recognition of changes to
   buildings affected by the earthquake more robust. The same methodology
   can be used also for updating existing medium-scale maps; in this case
   as well, the comparison of data regarding the same area but for
   different periods is important.}},

Title = {{Electric Guitar and Violin}},
Booktitle = {{SCIENCE OF STRING INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Pages = {{393-415}},
Abstract = {{Almost all the instruments described in this book have their origins in
   historical cultures dating back over many centuries. In contrast, the
   electric guitar and violin are clearly twentieth-century innovations.
   They are products of the electronics age following invention of the
   rectifying thermionic valve (tube) by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904, the
   amplifying triode valve (tube) by Lee de Forest in 1907, and the
   vacuum-filled amplifying valve (tube) by Irving Langmuir in 1915. By
   1916, such valves were already being used in radio receivers, and
   important advances were being made in microphone, amplifier, and
   loudspeaker design. This, and the increasingly wide distribution of
   mains electricity in the 1920s, provided the technology and
   infrastructure for the development of the electric guitar and violin and
   their lower-pitched relations the bass guitar, viola, cello, and
   string-bass. Although we focus here on the electric guitar and violin,
   almost everything discussed in this chapter is also relevant to their
   lower-pitched relations.
   In the first section, we briefly describe the emergence of the electric
   violin and guitar within the context of early acoustic recordings, and
   radio and public performances, in which conventional acoustic stringed
   instruments such as the guitar and violin were placed at a huge
   disadvantage compared to the much louder wind and brass sections of big
   band groups and orchestras. We then describe in a little more detail the
   early innovations, which led to today's familiar shapes and sounds of
   today's electric violin and guitar. The third section describes the
   design and influence on the sound of magnetic and piezoelectric pickups,
   with a brief interlude on some of the special effects that characterize
   the sounds of many guitarists and pop music groups of the 1960s and
   onward. We conclude by describing the use of the electric violin in
   advancing our understanding of the acoustics of the traditional violin
   and especially those factors in the perceived sound and quality that can
   be related to the damped, multiresonant, filtering action of the violin
   shell.
   There are a number of publications describing the history and design of
   the electric guitar and violin (Bacon 2006; Evans 1977; Graesser and
   Holliman 1998; Ratcliffe 2005; Smith 1987), and a wealth of information
   available on the web (e.g. www.digitalviolin.com]. Most important
   innovations were made by designers working for commercial companies,
   mostly in America, with freely downloadable patent applications
   (www.google.com/patents) providing details of important developments.
   These will be frequently referenced, for example, in the form {[}Charles
   Chew 1885/7 US 358542] - an early patent for a silent, stick-like,
   practice violin, similar in shape to many modern electric violins, where
   the application and awarding dates are both indicated.}},

Abstract = {{It is necessary for blinding digital image watermark algorithm to
   extract watermark information without any extra information except the
   watermarked image itself. But most of the current blinding watermark
   algorithms have the same disadvantage: besides the watermarked image,
   they also need the size and other information about the original image
   when extracting the watermark. This paper presents an innovative
   blinding color image watermark algorithm based on Lab color space, which
   does not have the disadvantages mentioned above. This algorithm first
   marks the watermark region size and position through embedding some
   regular blocks called anchor points in image spatial domain, and then
   embeds the watermark into the image. In doing so, the watermark
   information can be easily extracted after doing cropping and scale
   change to the image. Experimental results show that the algorithm is
   particularly robust against the color adjusting and geometry
   transformation. This algorithm has already been used in a copyright
   protecting project and works very well.}},

Abstract = {{The progress in solving grand challenges in eHealth is not as dynamic as
   the development of advanced Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICT). Despite many accomplished achievements in research, systems and
   solutions available on the market are not comprehensive. There are two
   main reasons for this: the progress in overcoming existing barriers is
   insufficient and we will face a social revolution corresponding to the
   expected development of Future Internet and the transformation into
   ubiquitous society. The paper presents a possible solution for this
   situation and is relevant for two important topics: telemedicine/eHealth
   services and integration between classical medicine and eHealth. We
   introduce the concept of innovative ICT platform for eHealth services
   which arose within an advanced Polish eInfrastructure. Accordingly, the
   paper is focused on well characterized components of this
   infrastructure, which are already used by different eHealth projects and
   activities. The set of components include PIONIER Optical Network, GRID
   computing infrastructure, virtual laboratories, video content
   distribution system, digital libraries and high definition
   videoconferencing. These components allow to create an integrated
   eHealth living laboratory platform which lets users to participate in a
   new model of interaction where doctors, nurses, patients interact with
   virtual space and at the same time they use real facilities available in
   hospitals, which are to be parts of the lab infrastructure. The pilot
   realization of this concept has begun to enable applications for disease
   research and treatment organization, virtual laboratory for medical
   imaging, clinical decision support system, medical teleeducation and
   teleconsultations. This is the way we propose to break down technical
   and social barriers and possibly accelerate solving grand challenges in
   medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Health Care and the Life Sciences (HCLS) are at the leading edge of
   applying advanced information technologies for the purpose of knowledge
   management and knowledge discovery. To realize the promise of the
   Semantic Web as a framework for large-scale, distributed knowledge
   management for biomedical informatics, substantial investments must be
   made in technological innovation and social agreement. Building an
   effective Biomedical Semantic Web will be a long, hard and tedious
   process. First, domain requirements are still driving new technology
   development, particularly to address issues of scalability in light of
   demands for increased expressive capability in increasingly massive and
   distributed knowledge bases. Second, significant challenges remain in
   the development and adoption of a well founded, intuitive and coherent
   knowledge representation for general use. Support for semantic
   interoperability across a large number of sub-domains (from molecular to
   medical) requires that rich, machine-understandable descriptions are
   consistently represented by well formulated vocabularies drawn from
   formal ontology, and that they can be easily composed and published by
   domain experts. While current focus has been on data, the provisioning
   of Semantic Web services, such that they may be automatically discovered
   to answer a question, will be an essential component of deploying
   Semantic Web technologies as part of academic or commercial
   cyberinfrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Along with the incessant advancement in optics, electronics and computer
   technologies during the last three decades, commercial digital video
   cameras have experienced a remarkable evolution, and can now be employed
   to measure complex motions of objects with sufficient accuracy, which
   render great assistance to structural displacement measurement in civil
   engineering. This paper proposes a computer vision-based approach for
   dynamic measurement of structures. One digital camera is used to capture
   image sequences of planar targets mounted on vibrating structures. The
   mathematical relationship between image plane and real space is
   established based on computer vision theory. Then, the structural
   dynamic displacement at the target locations can be quantified using
   point reconstruction rules. Compared with other tradition displacement
   measurement methods using sensors, such as accelerometers,
   linear-variable-differential-transducers (LVDTs) and global position
   system (GPS), the proposed approach gives the main advantages of great
   flexibility, a non-contact working mode and ease of increasing
   measurement points. To validate, four tests of sinusoidal motion of a
   point, free vibration of a cantilever beam, wind tunnel test of a
   cross-section bridge model, and field test of bridge displacement
   measurement, are performed. Results show that the proposed approach can
   attain excellent accuracy compared with the analytical ones or the
   measurements using conventional transducers, and proves to deliver an
   innovative and low cost solution to structural displacement measurement.}},

Abstract = {{In 2005, Ningbo Design Research Institute of Mapping \& Surveying
   started the development of concepts and an implementation of Virtual
   Reality Ningbo System (VRNS). VRNS is being developed under the digital
   city technological framework and well supported by computing advances,
   space technologies, and commercial innovations. It has become the best
   solution for integrating, managing, presenting, and distributing complex
   city information. VRNS is not only a 3D-GIS launch project but also a
   technology innovation. The traditional domain of surveying and mapping
   has changed greatly in Ningbo. Geo-information systems are developing
   towards a more reality-, three dimension- and Service-Oriented
   Architecture-based system.
   The VRNS uses technology such as 3D modeling, user interface design,
   view scene modeling, real-time rendering and interactive roaming under a
   virtual environment. Two applications of VRNS already being used are for
   city planning and high-rise buildings' security management. The final
   purpose is to develop VRNS into a powerful public information platform,
   and to achieve that heterogeneous city information resources share this

Abstract = {{Achievement of solar system exploration roadmap goals will involve
   robotic or human deployment and long-term operation of surface science
   packages remote from human presence, thus requiring autonomous,
   self-powered operation. The major challenge such packages face will be
   operating during long periods of darkness in extreme cold potentially
   without the Pu238 based power and thermal systems available to Apollo
   era packages (ALSEP). Development of such science payloads will thus
   require considerable optimization of instrument and subsystem design,
   packaging and integration for a variety of planetary surface
   environments in order to support solar system exploration fully. Our
   work supports this process through the incorporation of low temperature
   operational components and design strategies which radically minimize
   power, mass, and cost while maximizing the performance under extreme
   surface conditions that are in many cases more demanding than those
   routinely experienced by spacecraft in deep space. Chief
   instruments/instrument package candidates include those which could
   provide long-term monitoring of the surface and subsurface environments
   for fundamental science and human crew safety. The initial attempt to
   design a 10 instrument environmental monitoring package with a
   solar/battery based power system led to a package with a unacceptably
   large mass (500 kg) of which over half was battery mass. In phase 1, a
   factor of 5 reduction in mass was achieved, first through the
   introduction of high performance electronics capable of operating at far
   lower temperature and then through the use of innovative thermal balance
   strategies involving the use of multi-layer thin materials and
   gravity-assisted heat pipes. In phase 2, reported here, involves
   strategies such as universal incorporation of ULT/ULP digital and analog
   electronics, and distributed or non-conventionally packaged power
   systems. These strategies will be required to meet the far more
   challenging thermal requirements of operating through a normal 28 day
   diurnal cycle. The limited temperature range of efficient battery
   operation remains the largest obstacle.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental are being conducted to determine the fundamental behavior
   of steel columns. Column and beam-column specimens are being tested by
   subjecting them to combined mechanical and thermal loading. The
   experimental approaches involves the use of: (a) innovative radiant
   heating and control equipment to apply thermal loading instead of using
   a conventional furnace and (b) digital image processing technique
   incorporated with close-range photogrammetry to measure the deformation
   and curvature over the heated region. Also, a unique self-reacting test
   frame was designed by the authors to conduct the column experiments. The
   measured axial force-moment-curvature-temperature (P-M-phi-T), axial
   force-displacement-temperature (P-Delta-T), and axial force-end
   rotation-temperature (P-theta-T) responses of steel columns were
   compared with those obtained by 3D finite clement analyses.}},

Abstract = {{We describe our microscopic model of highway traffic and its
   implementation as digital laboratory. We discuss the range of
   experiments that can be conducted using this laboratory. Software
   implementation details are discussed together with the model because the
   implementation affects the model and delimits what can be modeled. This
   is seldom described in the literature, but lack of this knowledge often
   affects the ability of the reader to replicate the research. We model
   the expressway as a number of adjacent lanes, where each lane is divided
   into cells. Each cell is assumed to be 7.5 m. The most innovative aspect
   of our model is that we model multiple lanes as a single 1-D automaton.
   By extending the ``Cellular Automata{''} (CA) paradigm to the ``Global
   Cellular Automata{''} (GCA) paradigm we can represent the multilane
   highway with a single 1-D GCA, which can be implemented to execute
   faster than a traditional 2-D CA implementation and than a multi 1:D CA
   implementation. We present selected simulation results and outline our
   plan for future work.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the views from the project ``Study on the
   developmental strategy of Chinese fishery science and technology in
   medium and long-term{''}. The first priority of fisheries in China is to
   produce sufficient aqua-products to meet the demand, which is estimated
   to be more than 20 million tons over current levels by 2030. The
   difficulties are the restrictions from resources and the environment,
   and poor management in marketing and administration. The strategies for
   fishery science and technology are classified as ``Safeguard strategy,
   Promotion strategy, Developing and Widening strategy and Innovation
   strategy{''}. The key points suggested by the strategy for raising the
   level of fishery science and technology and competitive power of fishery
   products are: formulation of policy should be based on fish consumption
   purposes; integration of technology through ``Digital fisheries{''} and
   ``Engineering fisheries{''}; efficiency improvement of species, feed
   coefficient and processing; strengthening education and training levels
   of fishery labor; organizational reform by promoting four types of
   ``Complement and Combination (C\&C){''} systems; introduction of
   technology from other industries; establishing a practical action plan
   and goals on aquatic product security and quality management; and
   setting up information sharing platforms and data bases, and related

Abstract = {{This approach to sustainable design explores the possibility of creating
   an architectural design process which can iteratively produce optimised
   and sustainable design solutions. Driven by an evolution process based
   on genetic algorithms, the system allows the designer to ``design the
   building design generator{''} rather than to ``designs the building{''}.
   The design concept is abstracted into a digital design schema, which
   allows transfer of the human creative vision into the rational language
   of a computer. The schema is then elaborated into the use of genetic
   algorithms to evolve innovative, per formative and sustainable design
   solutions. The prioritisation of the project's constraints and the
   subsequent design solutions synthesised during design generation are
   expected to resolve most of the major conflicts in the evaluation and
   optimisation phases. Mosques are used as the example building typology
   to ground the research activity. The spatial organisations of various
   mosque typologies are graphically represented by adjacency constraints
   between spaces. Each configuration is represented by a planar graph
   which is then translated into a non-orthogonal dual graph and fed into
   the genetic algorithm system with fixed constraints and expected
   performance criteria set to govern evolution. The resultant Hierarchical
   Evolutionary Algorithmic Design System is developed by linking the
   evaluation process with environmental assessment tools to rank the
   candidate designs. The proposed system generates the concept, the seed,
   and the schema, and has environmental performance as one of the main
   criteria in driving optimisation.}},

Abstract = {{Beginning teachers are entering the profession with increasing
   confidence in their ability to use digital technologies which has the
   potential to change the way teachers of the future make pedagogical
   decisions. This paper explores how pedagogical reasoning and action
   might occur in the digital age, comparing Schulman's 1987 model with the
   reality for a small sample of digitally able beginning teachers as part
   of the emerging generation of teachers. The latter were examined through
   a multiple case study during their first year of teaching as they made
   decisions about using digital technologies within their teaching
   practice which gave an insight into pedagogical reasoning and action
   through the use of open-ended interviews and observation. The conclusion
   drawn is that while the pedagogical reasoning and action model remains
   relevant, it was based on an assumption that teaching involves knowledge
   being passed from a teacher to their students, which was found to
   restrict innovation by digitally able teachers. A broader interpretation
   of knowledge and teaching within this model building on emerging
   learning theory could help reform practice once again, providing a
   framework for teachers in the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that digital fabrication
   has had little impact in the Brazilian architecture so far, as compared
   to other countries, not because of an alleged unavailability of CNC
   technology in this country's construction industry, but for other
   reasons that must be investigated. We show in this paper the results of
   a preliminary survey carried out in the region of Brasilia that reveals
   a significant presence of CNC technology in the local construction
   industry which points to new opportunities for innovation in the
   architectural field. We will also show that some experiments in
   architectural education involving rapid prototyping and digital
   fabrication may provide a lead towards the solution of this problem.}},

Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS \& STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Integrating the customer in the innovation process is believed to be a
   powerful means to reduce failure rates and to increase the revenue from
   new products. Although many companies have launched programmes to enable
   such integration, the understanding of the mechanisms behind successful
   programmes remains limited. Furthermore, the benefit of integrating
   customers in the innovation process has to be weighed against the costs.
   Virtual customer integration has been discussed as a way to limit these
   costs and bring the benefits of potentially unlimited scalability. Using
   a sample of the Euro Stoxx 50 companies, we shed light on the various
   types of virtual customer integration platforms, their limitations,
   their benefits and the mechanisms that have to be put in place to make
   them succeed. Results indicate that only a limited number of platforms
   go beyond the sourcing of ideas. Especially the integration of the
   customer in the execution phase of the innovation process remains
   largely limited to digital goods.}},

Abstract = {{New ITCs have proven to be useful tools for implementing innovating
   didactic and pedagogical formula oriented to enhance students' en
   teachers' creativity. The up-and-coming massive e-learning and blended
   learning projects are clear examples of such a phenomenon. The teaching
   of oral communication offers a perfect scenario to experiment with these
   formulas. Since the traditional face to face approach for teaching
   `Speech techniques' does not keep up with the new digital environment
   that surround students, it is necessary to move towards an `Online
   oratory' model focused on using TEL to improve oral skills.
   Valladolid University offers a subject called `Tecnicas de Expresion
   Oral' (Speech techniques) for an advertising and PR degree. Jon
   Dornaleteche has been the teacher in charged of it in the last four
   years. This paper summarizes all the achievements obtained by means of
   the application of ITCs and proposes a didactic guide to help teachers
   change their methods.}},

Abstract = {{International literature shows that the positive effect on students
   performance from the adoption of innovations in the technology of
   teaching and learning do not affect all teaching methods and learning
   styles equally, as it depends on university strategy and policy towards
   Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) adoption, students
   abilities, technology uses in the educational process by teachers and
   students, or the selection of a methodology that matches with digital
   uses. This paper provides empirical answers to these questions with data
   from online students at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC). An
   empirical model based on structural equations has been defined to
   explain complex relationships between variables. Our results show that
   motivation is the main variable affecting online students' performance.
   It appears as a latent variable influenced by students' perception of
   efficiency, a driver for indirect positive and significant effect on
   students' performance from students' ability in ICT uses.}},

Abstract = {{A process-oriented model is developed to underpin the initiatives in
   technology-enhanced learning currently introduced in the Faculty of
   Education, University of Malta. The need for such initiatives is
   highlighted considering the educational, economical and social needs of
   the country. These needs demand a technology-intensive, flexible,
   learner-oriented approach to education and training. More important they
   need to be based on an innovative methodology that focuses on learning
   processes and interactions rather than subject content only. Based on
   recommendations from different fields of research a process-oriented
   approach is proposed that considers dimensions and levels of
   interactions. Interactions are categorized along the domain, technology
   and community dimensions and across three pedagogical levels novice,
   competent and expert learners each having characteristic learning needs.
   The model is used to develop a programme in TEL integrating
   epistemology, pedagogy, design principles with use of digital tools.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) have contributed
   considerably to our understanding of the structure and function of the
   human brain, and are essential in modern radiological practice. The
   development and applications of MRI systems at fields of 7 Tesla and
   above provide many new opportunities and technical challenges. The
   increased signal strength at higher fields may be used to obtain higher
   resolution images, faster images and/or images with greater contrast to
   noise. These can be used to improve detection of lesions, for more
   accurate assessment of the structural anatomy of the brain (including
   higher resolution tractography of white matter), and improved
   sensitivity in functional MRI. However, high field MR imaging is also
   affected by macroscopic field variations caused by inhomogeneities of
   magnetic susceptibility within the body, and these can degrade spectra
   and introduce image distortions. Moreover, the performance of
   radiofrequency (RF) coils is also affected at higher fields, and it is
   more difficult to create uniform RF fields within large objects. These
   challenges are being met using various technical innovations such as
   dynamic shimming, the use of parallel arrays of coils, novel
   spectral-spatial excitation methods, novel pulse sequences and
   post-acquisition digital processing. In combination these efforts
   promise to allow ultra-high field imaging and spectroscopy to contribute
   significantly to our understanding of brain structure and function in
   various conditions.}},

Abstract = {{VR (Virtual Reality) is a powerful tool for the simulation of virtual
   prototypes, because it allows engineers to enhance the analysis and
   validation of the digital product before manufacturing any physical
   mock-up. Unfortunately, VR software tools are not able to fully simulate
   the behaviour of a virtual product, because they are mainly conceived to
   reproduce the visual appearance of the product: the functional
   simulation is limited to basic behaviours related to the animation of
   the objects in the virtual world (e.g.: part movements). This paper
   describes an innovative approach to create functional behaviour
   simulations in VR using the same models and the same software employed
   by the engineers in the design phase. Our approach is based on the
   run-time connection between the VR software and the simulators used for
   product design and analysis. This means that there is no need to write
   code for describing the product behaviour, and any modification done on
   the behaviour models is immediately testable in VR. It is apparent that
   these advantages allow to reduce the time needed to implement the
   virtual prototyping, thus achieving a more efficient design process.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative learning mechanism for identifying learners' learning
   styles to improve adaptive learning is proposed. Hypermedia-learning
   tools are highly interactive to learners in web-based environments that
   have become increasingly popular in the field of education. However,
   these learning tools are frequently inadequate for individualize
   learning because accessing adaptive learning content is required for
   learners to achieve objectives. For predicating adaptive learning, a
   neuron-fuzzy inference approach is used to model the diagnosis of
   learning styles. Then, according to the diagnosis results, a
   recommendation model is constructed to help learners obtain adaptive
   digital content. The proposed approach has the capability of tracking
   learning activities on-line to correspond with learning styles. The
   results show that the identified model successfully classified 102
   learners into groups based on learning style. The implemented learning
   mechanism produced a clear learning guide for learning activities, which
   can help an advanced learning system retrieve a well-structure learning
   unit.}},

Abstract = {{Transit agencies conduct origin destination on-board surveys
   periodically to gather information regarding travel patterns and
   demographic data of their users and to collect customer satisfaction
   information. These surveys constitute a highly valuable means of
   obtaining important information on an agency's customers to provide a
   basis for effective transit planning and for regional travel demand
   modeling efforts. This paper describes the application of innovative
   technologies in the data collection process to improve data quality,
   data completeness, and data collection management. This includes the
   simultaneous collection of boarding and alighting count data at the stop
   level using Global Positioning System enabled personal digital
   assistants, association of distributed surveys to boarding locations,
   and a web-based sample and productivity management system. These
   technologies allow for automatic collection of boarding location,
   arrival and departure times, and transit trip times. An imputation
   procedure was developed to derive the most likely alighting location of
   each collected sample. Joint application of these technologies reduces
   survey length and thereby minimizes respondent burden.}},

   digital images has become increasingly popular in recent years because
   of the improved efficiency it brings to pavement management. Meanwhile,
   significant leaps have been made in the sciences of computer vision and
   image processing. Although automated pavement distress evaluation using
   digital images has benefitted from the advances in image processing,
   innovative techniques used in computer vision, such as image
   characterization using quantification of optical texture properties of
   images, has not been exploited adequately in pavement evaluation.
   Several widely used optical texture techniques for characterization of
   digital images are introduced in this paper, and their useful
   applications in pavement evaluation are highlighted. Automated and
   accurate detection of correspondences in progressive images of the same
   pavement captured during different times is essential for close
   monitoring of cracks or wear at the project level. Two reliable methods
   for determining correspondences among pavement images irrespective of
   the illumination at capture are (a) texture masking and minimum texture
   distance method, applicable to locations with no significant distress,
   and (b) homogeneous coordinate geometrical matching and the maximum
   texture distance to detect the locations of distress. Scaled scattering
   index, which is a parameter ideal for estimating the size of texture
   primitives required for texture analysis and characterization of the
   pavement surface composition, is also introduced. Finally, texture
   characterization is applied to detection of exact locations of crack
   propagation and excessive pavement wear.}},

Abstract = {{Edgardo Cheb-Terrab is an applied mathematician who specializes in
   developing algebraic algorithms for Maple, a mathematical software
   package for symbolic computation. His algorithms solve classes of
   problems, including differential equations and special functions. In
   1999, Cheb-Terrab used his software to investigate solutions of Abel
   equations-a class of first-order non-linear differential equations that
   was first described by the Norwegian mathematician Niels Abel in the
   1820s. By the end of the 20th century, the mathematics research
   literature contained solutions to nearly 40 types of Abel equations;
   each of these types was thought to require its own method of solution.
   Cheb-Terrab showed that all these types are special cases of an
   8-parameter hyper-class. By devising a computer algorithm for solving
   all equations of this hyper-class, he expanded the range of solvable
   Abel equations far beyond what was thought possible. These results could
   not have been derived without a computer.
   Even though one may expect such innovation to be greeted
   enthusiastically, Cheb-Terrab's work has met with suspicion and even
   dismissal by mainstream algebraists. ``For many of them, it was heresy;
   surely a computer cannot solve problems that were impenetrable to such
   great mathematicians as Abel and Liouville{''} (E.S. Cheb-Terrab,
   personal communication, November 2, 2008). Ironically, Cheb-Terrab's
   censure by the research community came at a time when thousands of
   mathematicians, engineers, and physicists were already using his
   algorithms, and verifying the solutions obtained, in a variety of
   applications. It took four years, and a lengthy review process, to
   publish the findings (Cheb-Terrab \& Roche, 2003).
   Cheb-Terrab has since developed innovative computer-based solutions to
   other long-standing problems in algebra. Yet he regularly confronts
   obstacles to acceptance. As Cheb-Terrab (personal communication,
   December 13, 2008) noted, ``{[}m]athematicians have received with
   discomfort almost every algorithm that I developed which seemed to
   challenge `established truths'; but, in fact, these established truths
   were never anything more than incomplete truths holding back progress in
   their fields.{''}
   The issue of what constitutes acceptable mathematics innovation points
   to a prevalent orthodoxy among mathematicians around the question ``What
   is mathematics?{''} Even though today's digital technologies enable new
   mathematical understandings, many mathematicians are unwilling to accept
   computerized solutions as ``real mathematics.{''} For them, the only
   true mathematics is that which manifests in the time-honored mechanisms
   of formal proof. As Cheb-Terrab's example illustrates, these
   mathematicians, in their strict conformity to traditional modes of
   mathematical knowledge production, may be stunting the evolution of
   mathematics and contributing to stagnation of mathematical research.
   Likewise, we believe that part of the blame for the current stagnation
   of mathematics education and pedagogy can be attributed to a shared
   orthodoxy among educators around the question ``What is mathematics?{''}
   From an evolutionary perspective, we understand the term orthodoxy as
   referring to rigid adherence to a particular worldview, and refusal to
   acknowledge and participate in the evolution of consciousness.
   Mathematics pedagogues often perceive mathematics as a treasured,
   monolithic, even sacred body of knowledge, which must be preserved and
   passed on to future generations. This perception of mathematics often
   leads to a model of instruction that centers on transmission of stable
   knowledge.
   This chapter explores the range of worldviews that respond to the
   question ``What is mathematics?{''} We will use the evolutionary
   frameworks of complexity science and integral philosophy to analyze the
   stages through which conceptions of mathematics have evolved to date,
   and where they are likely to evolve next. We examine barriers to the
   evolution of teachers' views on mathematics, and some approaches from
   the authors' experience to overcome these barriers. We conclude with a
   discussion of the implications that an evolutionary view of mathematics
   holds for pedagogy, and, in particular, the need for educators to
   balance stable and emergent dimensions of mathematics in their
   instruction.}},

Abstract = {{In what ways might informational techniques and information technology
   alter the infrastructure of society? The approach employed in this paper
   involves a number of fundamental, almost historically determined,
   conditions for the emergence of an increasingly societal infrastructure.
   This discussion is then related to analyses of the significance of
   information and communication technologies (ICT) in terms of ubiquities,
   agglomerations and clusters. Are there grounds for assuming that these
   trends are having an impact on the systems of towns and cities of
   differing sizes and at varying distances? In conclusion, the discussion
   turns to the issue of whether developments in informational techniques
   over the past 20 years are leading towards what has been referred to as
   a digital division of labour and, by extension, also towards a `digital
   (societal) infrastructure'.}},

Abstract = {{From colour images acquired with a hand held digital camera, an
   innovative tool for assessing chronic wounds has been developed. It
   combines both types of assessment, colour analysis and dimensional
   measurement of injured tissues in a user-friendly system. Colour and
   texture descriptors have been extracted and selected from a sample
   database of wound tissues, before the learning stage of a support vector
   machine classifier with perceptron kernel on four categories of tissues.
   Relying on a triangulated 3D model captured using uncalibrated vision
   techniques applied on a stereoscopic image pair, a fusion algorithm
   elaborates new tissue labels on each model triangle from each view. The
   results of 2D classification are merged and directly mapped on the mesh
   surface of the 3D wound model. The result is a significative improvement
   in the robustness of the classification. Real tissue areas can be
   computed by retro projection of identified regions on the 3D model.}},

Abstract = {{Effective information communication and public participation in the
   planning process are important elements for facilitating successful
   environmental decision-making. Previous research has demonstrated the
   importance of these factors for delivering benefits to a wide range of
   stakeholders in the planning system by increasing the transparency and
   efficiency of the planning process. Planning information relating to the
   potential visual impacts of proposed developments is particularly
   important in the case of wind farm planning, given the high levels of
   concern amongst members of the public regarding the perceived negative
   visual impacts of wind turbines on the landscape. However, shortcomings
   associated with traditional visualisation techniques used to assess such
   impacts have been highlighted in previous research, along with drawbacks
   related to the dissemination of such information to the public during
   the planning stages of wind farm development. This research is concerned
   with evaluating the potential of innovative digital landscape
   visualisation and Web-based approaches for addressing some of the
   shortcomings in these areas. This paper describes the implementation of
   a Web-based survey study designed to evaluate the potential of online
   GIS-based approaches for improving the effectiveness and dissemination
   of wind farm visualisations and enhancing public participation in wind
   farm planning. Results from the survey study add to the research
   literature by demonstrating how innovative visualisation and Web-based
   approaches have real potential for augmenting existing methods of
   information provision and public participation in the wind farm planning
   process. The findings of this study are also transferrable to other
   landscape planning scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The world of Geographic Information (GI) Science has changed. Today,
   many of the elements of Digital Earth, meaning as a multi-resolution,
   three-dimensional representation of the planet, are not only available
   but also used daily by hundreds of millions of people worldwide thanks
   to innovative ways to organize and present the data and rapid
   technological advancements. 3D Geobrowsers can provide higher usability
   and interactivity that can facilitate exchange and dissemination of
   spatial information among stakeholders and government agencies. However
   providing access to harmonized data is only a first step towards
   providing adequate support to environmental management, which requires
   development of analysis and spatio-temporal data models functionalities.
   Many environmental analyses, e.g. monitoring a sequence of earthquakes
   epicentres, a storm, a forest fire, spread of pollutant etc., cannot be
   performed without considering the evolution, over time, of geographic
   features. Additionally today`s sensing technologies provide frequently
   updated GI, at relatively reduced costs, coming from environmental
   sensors, satellite etc. This forces the GI community to reconsider
   current data models, taking into account time as one of the main
   variables.
   BRISEIDE - BRIdging SErvices, Information and Data for Europe is a Pilot
   B, funded by the ICT Policy Support Programme (or ICT PSP), tries to
   bridge the aforementioned gap, by building on top of existing SDIs in
   order to provide users with more complete and adequate data and
   processing tools capable to handle the time dimension. BRISEIDE develops
   spatial analysis WPSs and integrates them within existing open source
   frameworks. Spatio-temporal processing services are exposed via the web
   and are made available through compatible WebGIS applications.
   Open Geospatial Consortium Web Services, already made available by
   relevant INSPIRE-related EU projects, exposing standard services such as
   WMS, WCS and WFS, can be used to provide access to relevant
   geodatabases, enriched, when needed, with information, extracted from
   heterogeneous, distributed user operational databases. In addition to
   this, in order to achieve optimality geo-processing functionalities
   distribution, standardized services capable to extract data of interest
   can be provided to ensure spatio-temporal information ingestion,
   querying, processing, visualization and value added processing. Spatial
   analysis and Spatio-temporal web processing services (WPS) are exposed
   via the web and are made available integrating them within existing open
   source frameworks through compatible WebGIS applications}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and orthoimages have become
   standard geospatial products. However, photogrammetric systems used for
   generating them still remain desktop or workstation based systems. This
   paper outlines an innovative concept of DTM generation and geospatial
   image orthorectification over the Internet. The article contains
   description of algorithms for automatic DTM and orthoimage construction.
   DTM is an element that is necessary in the process of creating
   orthoimages and has a crucial influence on their cartometric attributes.
   Thus, it is extremely important to determine sources of errors that can
   influence the accuracy of the Digital Terrain Model constructing
   photogrammetric methods. Last part of the article contains presentation
   of Internet application dedicated to DTM and orthoimage construction and
   their quality assessment. Several Java client-server web applications
   were developed. In practice the application of the proposed algorithms
   is based on the system of a central unit (a server of applications and
   Web pages) and customer computers equipped with standard Internet
   browsers. It is possible to access this application from the Internet
   site of Department of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing UWM in Olsztyn
   (http://www.kfit.uwm.edu.pl/zp.html) by selecting the ``Orthophoto
   generation{''} projects. Opportunities of networked DTM generation and
   image ortorectification have had a great impact on the development of
   geo-information processing.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific and technical knowledge of the world grows through individual
   processes of speculation, making and documenting knowledge claims, the
   social processes of circulating and testing them, and the cyclic
   iteration of these processes to incrementally build on what is already
   known. Formal publication of claims in journals has been critical to
   circulating and critiquing new knowledge claims.
   Editorial peer review supposedly justifies the costs of the publishing
   activities surrounding it. Yet publishing costs, largely paid by
   libraries, have become unsustainable. Also, the costs discourage many
   from publishing and limit access of others to what is published.
   Today's editorial peer review results from the exponential growth and
   specialization of the sciences in the second half of the 20th Century,
   but offers little genuine epistemic value. It may actually thwart the
   advancement of innovative and revolutionary research.
   Following Popperian evolutionary epistemology, we consider the social
   and epistemological dynamics of editorial peer review. We also note that
   that the ever increasing sophistication of digital technologies
   extending our cognitive capacities provides a pathway to very
   substantially reduce the cost of publishing whilst at the same time
   increasing the transparency and value of genuine peer review.}},

Abstract = {{In nursing education, to prepare nurses to change environments and
   practice in new environments, a need for innovation always exists.
   Therefore, new strategies must be used in nursing education. Simulation
   and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are some of the new strategies.
   Simulation is a teaching strategy that involves replicating reality.
   Although today in many countries high-fidelity simulation is a growing
   teaching method, there is not a simulation laboratory in Turkish Nursing
   Schools yet. Simulation and PDAs can be infused into the Turkish
   undergraduate education program to help prepare nursing students for
   professional practice. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the usability of mobile information terminals, such
   as personal digital assistants (PDAs) or Tablet personal computers, to
   improve access to information resources for nurses and to explore the
   relationship between PDA or Tablet-supported information resources and
   outcomes.
   Background: The authors evaluated an initiative of the Nursing
   Secretariat, Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, which
   provided nurses with PDAs and Tablet PCs, to enable Internet access to
   information resources. Nurses had access to drug and medical reference
   information, best practice guidelines (BPGs), and to abstracts of recent
   research studies.
   Method: The authors took place over a 12-month period. Diffusion of
   Innovation theory and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in
   Health Services (PARIHS) model guided the selection of variables for
   study. A longitudinal design involving questionnaires was used to
   evaluate the impact of the mobile technologies on barriers to research
   utilization, perceived quality of care, and on nurses' job satisfaction.
   The setting was 29 acute care, long-term care, home care, and
   correctional organizations in Ontario, Canada. The sample consisted of
   488 frontline-nurses.
   Results: Nurses most frequently consulted drug and medical reference
   information, Google, and Nursing PLUS. Overall, nurses were most
   satisfied with the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) BPGs
   and rated the RNAO BPGs as the easiest resource to use. Among the PDA
   and Tablet users, there was a significant improvement in research
   awareness/values, and in communication of research. There was also, for
   the PDA users only, a significant improvement over time in perceived
   quality of care and job satisfaction, but primarily in long-term care
   settings.
   Implications: It is feasible to provide nurses with access to
   evidence-based practice resources via mobile information technologies to
   reduce the barriers to research utilization.}},

Title = {{Comparison Between the plusoptiX and MTI Photoscreeners}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Both the Medical Technology and Innovations (MTI) and
   plusoptiX photoscreeners are used to objectively screen for amblyogenic
   risk factors in children. The MTI has been extensively Studied, but the
   limited availability of film may render it obsolete. We compared the MTI
   with the plusoptiX, a newer digital photoscreener, for the ability to
   detect amblyogenic factors when compared with a comprehensive pediatric
   ophthalmic examination. We believe our results will help to guide
   community-based vision screening programs.
   Methods: One hundred fifty-one children were examined consecutively in
   our office. Each patient was screened with the MTI and plusoptiX devices
   on the same day as part of a comprehensive pediatric ophthalmic
   examination. Results via MTI were evaluated by an expert masked examiner
   (R.W.A.), and the plusoptiX results were interpreted by the incorporated
   software.
   Results: Sixty-five percent of patients were found to have amblyopia or
   amblyogenic risk factors during the pediatric ophthalmic examination
   conducted via the American Association of Pediatric Ophthalmology and
   Strabismus referral criteria. We found the MTI photoscreener to have a
   sensitivity of 83.6\%, specificity of 90.5\%, false-positive rate of
   9.4\%, false-negative rate of 1.6.3\%, and positive predictive value of
   94.2\%. The plusoptiX demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.9\%, specificity
   of 96.1\%, false-positive rate of 3.7\%, false-negative rate of 1.0\%,
   and positive predictive value of 97.9\%.
   Conclusion: The MTI and plusoptiX photoscreeners proved to be effective
   when compared with a comprehensive cycloplegic pediatric ophthalmic
   examination. The plusoptiX, however, was found to have a higher
   sensitivity and specificity than the MTI.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In her article ``Innovation and Multimedia in the Poetry of cummings and
   Mayakovsky{''} Svetlana Nikitina discusses how e.e. cummings and
   Vladimir Mayakovsky foreshadowed the digital revolution of today in
   their multimedia experiments in poetry. Although they spoke different
   languages and lived in different societies, the two modernist poets
   display similarities in their modernist aesthetics. Both are artists as
   well as poets who blur the line between the two forms of art. Their
   synesthesia inoculates them against postmodern disintegration of meaning
   or form. Although cummings is a staunch individualist, and Mayakovsky
   the tribune of the collective, they both rebel against traditional
   poetic forms and invent a new language of multisensory and multimedia
   processing. Both make orthography and page design sculpt the spontaneous
   experience they want to convey. By showing Mayakovsky and cummings as
   consummate makers of words, images, experiences, and new social orders
   who treated their verbal material as a physical medium, Nikitina
   supports the claim that the poets' visual sensibility and multimedia
   orientation prevented them from sliding into postmodern deconstruction
   and created the center that could hold.}},

Title = {{Navigational metalanguages for new territory in English: The potential
   of grammatics}},
Journal = {{ENGLISH TEACHING-PRACTICE AND CRITIQUE}},

Abstract = {{This paper takes up the sea-faring metaphor at the centre of this
   special edition and asks what kinds of navigational tools
   (metalanguages) are necessary to steer English through the digital seas
   of contemporary communication. Much of this territory is yet to be
   mapped and the disciplinary ``boat{''} is buffeted by contrary winds
   such as pressures for improved outcomes on the basics and development of
   21(st)-century digital skills. The role of grammar as a navigational aid
   is complicated by these competing pressures. Alongside developing
   metalanguages to explore digital literacy practices in Web2, in
   multimodal texts like picture books, websites and social networking
   sites, teachers are being asked simultaneously to prepare students for
   national testing regimes which assess children's abilities to identify
   the correct verb, to underline the pronouns and to punctuate sentences
   in language convention tests. What kinds of grammar will enable us to
   manage such seemingly incongruous purposes? How do we make use of tools
   to improve students' writing without succumbing to reductionist models
   of language? What kinds of ``stretch{''} do available grammars need if
   they are to prove useful as tools in this environment?
   In this paper, I draw on a range of students' verbal, visual and
   multimodal texts to investigate the issues facing adaptations of
   grammatically informed metalanguages in English. I attempt to show how
   such metalanguages will need to accommodate and account for verbal texts
   produced by students for assessment and multimodal texts produced by
   young learners in less formal, even play, situations. Basing my account
   on Halliday's notion of ``grammatics{''}, I argue that any navigational
   toolkit needs to make space for both convention and innovation, but that
   this process requires careful thinking, dialogue across different
   grammars and substantive research into semiosis in school English.}},

   oscillator's output phase to avoid the signal distortion that had
   severely limited the performance of earlier VCO-based ADCs, which had

Abstract = {{High-speed imaging records valuable information of events that occur in
   microscopic timescales and provides an insight into fast changing
   phenomena that eludes visual understanding. Over the past hundred and
   fifty years cameras have evolved from very basic devices to present day
   complex electro optical imaging systems that require computers
   programmed with innovative software to manage the multitude of
   operational parameters. This evolutionary process has passed through
   numerous stages advancing alongside other technologies as they have
   become available. However, two overriding factors have been influential
   in camera development; the first being the need to generate sufficiently
   bright images that can be recorded in microscopic timescales, and the
   need to synchronize the framing window to allow the critical dissection
   of the area of interest. Unless these fundamental requirements are
   satisfied other parameters such as resolution and image numbers become
   less relevant. The extraction of temporally related data was difficult
   and time consuming particularly if multiple cameras were used which
   introduced parallax errors. However, the continued development of solid
   state imaging sensors has provided flexibility for integration into
   imaging systems that record image sequences which can be critically
   interrogated providing a detailed account of events that occur in
   microscopic timescales.}},

Abstract = {{This article is devoted to an analysis of cyber security, a concept that
   arrived on the post-Cold War agenda in response to a mixture of
   technological innovations and changing geopolitical conditions. Adopting
   the framework of securitization theory, the article theorizes cyber
   security as a distinct sector with a particular constellation of threats
   and referent objects. It is held that ``network security{''} and
   ``individual security{''} are significant referent objects, but that
   their political importance arises from connections to the collective
   referent objects of ``the state,{''} ``society,{''} ``the nation,'' and
   ``the economy.{''} These referent objects are articulated as threatened
   through three distinct forms of securitizations: hypersecuritization,
   everyday security practices, and technifications. The applicability of
   the theoretical framework is then shown through a case-study of what has
   been labeled the first war in cyber space against Estonian public and
   commercial institutions in 2007.}},

Abstract = {{New sensor technologies open possibilities for measuring traditional
   biosignals in new innovative ways. This, together with the development
   of signal processing systems and their increasing computing power, can
   sometimes give new life to old measurement techniques.
   Ballistocardiogram (BCG) is one such technique, originally promising but
   later replaced by the now very popular electrocardiogram. It's usability
   was previously limited by the large size of the devices required to
   record it, and the complex nature of the recorded signal, which gave
   little information in visual inspection. In this paper, we present how a
   lightweight and flexible electromechanical film (EMFi) sensor can be
   used to record BCG. A ballistocardiographic chair, designed to look like
   a normal office chair, was built and fitted with two sensitive EMFi
   sensors. Two different measurement setups to record the signal from the
   EMFi sensors were developed. The first, so-called wired setup, uses a
   commercial bio-amplifier, and a special pre-amplifier to interface to
   it. The latter, so-called wireless setup, uses our own hardware to
   transmit the recorded digitized signals wirelessly to a nearby PC. Both
   of these systems are presented and their performance evaluated. Also,
   the suitability, limitations and advantages of the EMFi sensor over
   existing sensors and methods are discussed. The validity of the EMFi
   sensor and amplifier output is tested using a mechanical vibrator.
   Lastly, a summary of signal analysis methods developed for our system is
   given. The developed systems have be used for medical BCG measurements,
   and the recordings indicate that the both the systems are functional and
   capture useful BCG signal components.}},

   Program's innovative approach to distributed digital preservation to
   accomplish a variety Of business, social, and technical pursuits. LOCKSS
   technology enables nontechnical administrators to create and manage
   their own preservation network via a ``Private LOCKSS Network{''} (PLN).
   A PLN is a scaled down version of the Public LOCKSS network, which
   comprises two hundred library members and preserves over a thousand
   titles from more than three hundred Publishers. PLNs enable like-minded
   institutions to shoulder the responsibility of preserving in perpetuity
   scholarly e-content of importance to the group. More and more research

Abstract = {{Aims: The paper reviews the development of information and communication
   technology in briefing and proposes a collaborative briefing framework
   to extend key stakeholder engagement, aiming to improve the efficiency
   and reliability of project briefing for megaprojects. Scope: Authors
   introduce an innovative collaborative approach to promote stakeholder
   involvement by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of managing a
   large group of stakeholders, harnessing collaboration technology.
   Drawing parallels with biological neural networks in humans, a
   conceptual collaborative briefing framework is proposed to demonstrate
   how briefing team members can work collaboratively as a virtual
   organisation through a shared digital workspace. This framework has five
   core elements: integrated briefing team, collaborative briefing job
   plan, computer supported cooperative work platform, requirements
   processing models and facilitation models. Conclusion: The proposed
   framework supplements face-to-face discussion with Computer mediated
   discussion, depending on the type, flexibility and interaction needed
   for different aspects in briefing. This ``hybrid briefing method{''}
   would maximise the benefits to costs ratio of expanded stakeholder
   engagement in project briefing. The framework is expected to promote the
   accuracy and transparency of `requirements identification' processing,
   the effective engagement and appropriate integration of more stakeholder
   inputs and finally, to improve the efficiency and reliability of
   briefing outputs. Lastly, some framework limitations are discussed,
   aimed at further development and a computer prototype. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Medical communication in the pharmaceutical industry has evolved over
   the past quarter century along with advances in information technology.
   The medical information function within the pharmaceutical industry
   became a distinct entity in the early 1980s as the demand for systematic
   and organized information increased and the complexity of questions
   required more in-depth responses. Early on, literature searching was a
   manual process, but microfiche storage and retrieval systems improved
   capabilities. The use of the computer in the 1990s played a major role
   in transforming medical information departments, allowing for shared
   information, documentation, and electronic system development.
   Traditional paper-based methods of retrieving information from physical
   libraries has given way to digitized medical information from virtual
   platforms accessed via the World Wide Web and proprietary web portals.
   Likewise, communication of information to the end user has been
   transformed and is much less reliant on traditional delivery methods.
   New venues for real-time information sharing between the industry and
   the customer are on the horizon. The continued relevance of the medical
   information function in the pharmaceutical industry will rely on
   adaptation to new and changing technology and the ability to provide
   added value to both internal and external customers. While it is
   impossible to discuss all of the technologies used in medical
   communications, this article attempts to describe a variety of
   innovations utilized throughout the years.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technologies paved the path to some new possibilities in
   generating and exchanging information in various forms and through
   various media. This development has gone so far that the more
   traditional questions of media freedom and its economical and
   socio-political determinism does not suffice any longer. In exploring
   the social role of the news it is necessary to investigate the ways the
   technological innovations in question are utilised, such as the media
   companies' thrive in producing more content for less money and in less
   time. Multimedial availability and exchange of video, in particular,
   once reserved exclusively for television, destabilises the traditional
   divide between the press, radio and television media, and opens a debate
   about the new forms of journalistic expression. ``Digital news{''} which
   has grown out of the maximised exchange of information through
   multiplicated channels and converged media, has set up some new rules on
   its own. To mention but a few, what was the most important news item is
   now the latest one, the institutionalised sources are accompanied by the
   users, while television delivers information with the help of the press,
   and vice versa. In order to cut through the technological-Institutional
   foundations of the so-called ``new trends{''}, we foreground the issues
   around the media contents, the increased fluctuation of which is
   fostered by the development of media, which disperses the contents into
   an array of directions and through various media technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Vitiligo is an acquired loss of pigmentation and its treatment remains
   very difficult up to date. Narrow band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) and
   topical immunomodulators are included among the most innovative
   approaches to vitiligo. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of
   NB-UVB, topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of
   vitiligo. Adult patients with chronic and stable vitiligo refractory to
   conventional therapies were enrolled in an open parallel groups study.
   The patients were scheduled on the basis of a computer-generated
   randomization into three groups: 13 patients received NB-UVB
   phototherapy 3 times a week, 15 patients were treated with pimecrolimus
   1\% cream b.i.d. and 16 patients applied tacrolimus 0.1\% ointment
   b.i.d. All three treatment regimens were performed for 24 weeks. At
   baseline and every three weeks for the whole period of therapy the
   patients were examined through digital photographs and, at the end of
   the study, based on the percentage of repigmentation, treatment outcome
   was classified as ``absent{''} (0), ``slight{''} (< 25\%), mild
   (25-49\%), ``moderate{''} (50-74\%), and ``excellent{''} (> 75\%).
   During the whole period of the study, possible side effects were
   recorded. The response to treatments varied according to the anatomical
   location of the lesions. No statistically significant differences in
   repigmentation for any anatomical site were recorded with the three
   treatments. The best results were obtained for lesions of the face with
   pimecrolimus cream and tacrolimus ointment and of the neck with NB-UVB.
   Statistically significant differences in repigmentation between
   photo-exposed and covered skin areas were recorded although the patients
   were asked to avoid direct UV exposition and to apply a very high
   protection sun screen on vitiligo lesions. All three treatments should
   be considered as a good option in the treatment of vitiligo. NB-UVB
   irradiation may represent the optimal choice in generalized vitiligo
   with topical immunomodulators in localized vitiligo.}},

Abstract = {{After some initial reluctance, nowadays transition from conventional
   analogue-to-digital radiographic technique is realized in the vast
   majority of institutions. The eventual triumph of digital over
   conventional technique is related to its undoubted advantages with
   respect to image quality and improved image handling in the context of a
   picture archiving and communication system.
   CR represents the older system, which matured over decades and
   experienced some important recent improvements with respect to dose
   efficiency and work-flow efficiency that strengthened its position. It
   represents a very versatile, economically attractive system that is
   equally suited for integrated systems as well as for cassette-based
   imaging at the bedside.
   DR systems offer superb image quality and realistic options for dose
   reduction based on their high dose efficiency. While for a long time
   only integrated systems were on the market suited for a large patient
   throughput, also mobile DR systems became recently available.
   While for the next years, it is likely that DR and CR systems will
   coexist, the long term perspective of CR will depend on further
   innovations with respect to dose efficiency and signal-to-noise
   characteristics while for DR economical aspects and broader availability
   of mobile systems will play a role. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In December of 2008, the Recording Industry Association of America
   (RIAA) stopped its strategy of suing individuals for copyright
   infringement over peer-to-peer networks, but now seeks the cooperation
   of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to deter online copyright
   infringement. These novel proposed collaborations, which have recently
   appeared and become prevalent worldwide in various forms, could lead to
   termination and suspension of internet connections based upon mere
   suspicions. In the United States, these proposals fail when analyzed
   under the FCC's Internet Policy Statement because they are likely to
   deprive individuals of lawful content and applications of their choice.
   I propose a standard under which to evaluate these new ISP-RIAA
   collaborations: Professor David Nimmer's interpretation of the Digital
   Millennium Copyright Act's (DMCA) repeat infringer standard. Any
   collaboration where suspected infringers lose internet access at the
   direction of the RIAA must affect only those who have been previously
   held liable for copyright infringement or of whom the ISP has actual
   knowledge of infringement. This solution harmonizes the interests of the
   ISPs, the RIAA, and the FCC, and is logical when one considers the
   purpose, policy, and interpretation of both the Internet Policy
   Statement and the DMCA's repeat infringer standard.}},

Abstract = {{A high-fidelity aircraft simulation model, reconstructed using the
   digital flight data recorder of the 1992 Amsterdam Bijlmermeer aircraft
   accident (flight 1862), has been used to evaluate a new fault-tolerant
   flight control algorithm in an online piloted evaluation. This paper
   focuses on the piloted simulator evaluation results. Reconfiguring
   control is implemented by making use of adaptive nonlinear dynamic
   inversion for manual fly-by-wire control. After discussing the modular
   adaptive controller setup, the experiment is described for a piloted
   simulator evaluation of this innovative reconfigurable control algorithm
   applied to a damaged civil transport aircraft. The evaluation scenario,
   measurements, and experimental design, as well as the real-time
   implementation are described. Finally, reconfiguration test results are
   shown for damaged aircraft models including component as well as
   structural failures. The evaluation shows that the fault-tolerant flight
   control algorithm is able to restore conventional control strategies
   after the aircraft configuration has changed dramatically due to these
   severe failures. The algorithm supports the pilot after a failure by
   lowering workload and allowing a safe return to the airport. For most
   failures, the handling qualities are shown to degrade less with a
   failure than the baseline classical control system does.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the development of the whole skeleton of the
   soft-shelled turtle Pelodiscus sinensis, with particular emphasis on the
   pattern and sequence of ossification. Ossification starts at late
   Tokita-Kuratani stage (TK) 18 with the maxilla, followed by the dentary
   and prefrontal. The quadrate is the first endoskeletal ossification and
   appears at TK stage 22. All adult skull elements have started
   ossification by TK stage 25. Plastral bones are the first postcranial
   bones to ossify, whereas the nuchal is the first carapacial bone to
   ossify, appearing as two unstained anlagen. Extensive examination of
   ossification sequences among autopodial elements reveals much
   intraspecific variation. Patterns of ossification of cranial dermal
   elements are more variable than those of endochondral elements, and
   dermal elements ossify before endochondral ones. Differences in
   ossification sequences with Apalone spinifera include: in Pelodiscus
   sinensis the jugal develops relatively early and before the frontal,
   whereas it appears later in A. spinifera; the frontal appears shortly
   before the parietal in A. spinifera whereas in R sinensis the parietal
   appears several stages before the frontal. Chelydrids exhibit an early
   development of the postorbital bone and the palatal elements as compared
   to trionychids. Integration of the onset of ossification data into an
   analysis of the sequence of skeletal ossification in cryptodirans using
   the event-pairing and Parsimov methods reveals heterochronies, some of
   which reflect the hypothesized phylogeny considered taxa. A functional
   interpretation of heterochronies is speculative. In the chondrocranium
   there is no contact between the nasal capsules and planum supraseptale
   via the sphenethmoid commissurae. The pattern of chondrification of
   forelimb and hind limb elements is consistent with a primary axis and
   digital arch. There is no evidence of anterior condensations distal to
   the radius and tibia. A pattern of quasi- simultaneity is seen in the
   chondrogenesis of the forelimb and the hind limb. J. Morphol.

Abstract = {{Background and Objective: The treatment of skin with fractional devices
   creates columns of micro-ablation or micro-denaturation depending on the
   device. Since the geometric profiles of thermal damage depend on the
   treatment parameters or physical properties of the treated tissue, the
   size of these columns may vary from a few microns to a few millimeters.
   For objective evaluation of the damage profiles generated by fractional
   devices, this report describes an innovative and efficient method of
   processing and evaluating horizontal sections of skin using a novel
   software program.
   Materials and Methods: Ex vivo porcine skin was treated with the
   Lux1540/10, Lux1540 Zoom and Lux2940 with 500 optics. Horizontal
   (radial) sections of biopsies were obtained and processed with H\&E and
   NBTC staining. Digital images of the histologic sections were taken in
   either transmission or reflection illumination and were processed using
   the SAFHIR program.
   Results: NBTC- and H\&E-stained horizontal sections of ex vivo skin
   treated with ablative and non-ablative fractional devices were obtained.
   Geometric parameters, such as depth, diameter, and width of the
   coagulated layer (if applicable), and micro-columns of thermal damage,
   were evaluated using the SAFHIR software. The feasibility of objective
   comparison of the performance of two different fractional devices was
   demonstrated.
   Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides a comprehensive,
   objective, and efficient approach for the comparison of various
   fractional devices. Correlation of device settings with the objective
   dimensions of post-treatment damage profiles serve as a powerful tool
   for the prediction and modulation of clinical response. Lasers Surg.

Abstract = {{Power transformers' reliability can be seriously affected by partial
   discharges. For this reason, it is necessary to implement technical
   methods to identify endangered equipment before catastrophic failures
   occur. A well-known method that can be applied either in the laboratory
   or in the field is the detection and localization of partial discharges,
   by means of the analysis of the acoustic signals they produced. An
   innovative partial discharge detector was developed based on the
   analysis of an acoustic or electrical PD signal envelope. This paper
   describes the architecture of the developed acoustic detector, which is
   composed of a set of ultrasonic sensors, signal conditioning and control
   modules, a graphical interface and the required software for the
   location of the affected area within the transformer. The conditioning
   and control modules perform analog to digital conversion, arrival time
   measurement, communication and control operations. Finally, some power
   transformer diagnostic testing is presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative telemedicine-enabled rapid breast care service is
   described that bundles telemammography, telepathology, and teleoncology
   services into a single day process. The service is called the
   UltraClinics (R) Process. Since the core services are at four different
   physical locations a challenge has been to obtain STAT second opinion
   readouts on newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. In order to provide
   same clay QA re-review of breast surgical pathology cases, a DMetrix
   DX-40 ultrarapid virtual slide scanner (DMetrix, Inc., Tucson, AZ) was
   installed at the participating laboratory. Glass slides of breast cancer
   and breast hyperplasia cases were scanned the same day the slides were
   produced by the University Physicians Healthcare Hospital histology
   laboratory. Virtual slide telepathology was used for STAT quality
   assurance readouts at University Medical Center, 6 miles away. There was
   complete concurrence with the primary diagnosis in 139 (90.3\%) of
   cases. There were 4 (2.3\%) major discrepancies, which would have
   resulted in a different therapy and 3 (1.9\%) minor discrepancies. Three
   cases (1.9\%) were deferred for immunohistochemistry. In 2 cases
   (1.3\%), the case was deferred for examination of the glass slides by
   the reviewing pathologists at University Medical Center. We conclude
   that the virtual slide telepathology QA program found a small number of
   significant diagnostic discrepancies. The virtual slide telepathology
   program service increased the job satisfaction of subspecialty
   pathologists without special training in breast pathology, assigned to
   cover the general surgical pathology service at a small satellite
   university hospital. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite services benefit civil society by helping tackle challenges
   such as climate change, the digital divide, etc. They have the potential
   to deliver concrete benefits to European society through innovative
   services supporting economic, societal and environmental policies. Such
   benefits can trigger increased public support for space in Europe.
   However, this potential has yet to be achieved. This paper argues that
   technological bias, the diversity of interests and initiatives among
   stakeholders and their individual actions do not always serve their
   collective objective to ensure wide diffusion of satellite services. It
   draws on theories of diffusion of innovation and on its authors'
   participatory work with the space and the user communities and at their
   interface in an effort to help diffuse satellite services within civil
   society. One of the major causes of insufficient service diffusion is
   the weakness of the interface between the space and user communities;
   some of factors that currently contribute to this state of affairs are
   the space community's over-reliance on publicly financed, technical
   demonstration projects as solutions to service diffusion; insufficient
   coordination by public authorities of innovation policies and programmes
   with other public policies and objectives; and an insufficient
   integration of satellite services within users' culture, traditional
   tools and services. The discussion allows for conclusions to be drawn on
   how the system of stakeholders could function better in order for
   satellite services to be successfully diffused in Europe. Crown

Title = {{Differences in Male and Female Spino-Pelvic Alignment in Asymptomatic
   Young Adults A Three-Dimensional Analysis Using Upright Low-Dose Digital
   Biplanar X-rays}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. A three-dimensional analysis of spino-pelvic alignment in
   60 asymptomatic young adult males and females.
   Objectives. To analyze the differences in sagittal spino-pelvic
   alignment in a group of asymptomatic young adult males and females and
   describe gender specific reference values.
   Summary of Background Data. Several spinal disorders like idiopathic
   scoliosis and Scheuermann's disease have a well-known sex-related
   prevalence ratio. As spino-pelvic alignment plays an important role in
   spinal biomechanics, it is imperative to analyze possible differences
   between the male and female spino-pelvic alignment. Furthermore, in
   spinal fusion surgery, normal sagittal balance should be recreated as
   closely as possible.
   Methods. An innovative biplanar ultra low-dose radiographic technique
   was used to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of the spine
   (T1-L5), sacrum, and pelvis in a freestanding position of 30
   asymptomatic young male and 30 young female adults. Values were
   calculated for thoracic kyphosis (T4-T12), lumbar lordosis (L1-S1),
   total and regional lumbopelvic lordosis (PRT12, PRL2, PRL4, and PRL5),
   sagittal plumb line of T1, T4, and T9 (HAT1, HAT4, and HAT9), T1-L5
   sagittal spinal inclination, T9 sagittal offset, and pelvic parameters
   (pelvic tilt, sacral slope, and pelvic incidence). In addition,
   vertebral inclination in the sagittal plane of each vertebra was
   measured. Differences in spinopelvic alignment between the sexes were
   analyzed.
   Results. The female spine was more dorsally inclined (11 vs. 8; P =
   0.003). High thoracic and thoracolumbar vertebrae were more dorsally
   inclined in women than in men. Thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis,
   regional lumbopelvic lordosis, sagittal plumb lines, T9 sagittal offset,
   and pelvic parameters were not statistically different between the
   sexes.
   Conclusion. These results indicate that the female spine is definitely
   different from the male spine. The spine as whole and individual
   vertebrae in certain regions of the normal spine is more backwardly
   inclined in females than in males. Based on our previous research this
   signifies that these spinal regions are subjected to different
   biomechanical loading conditions. These vertebral segments are possibly
   less rotationally stable in females than in males.}},

Abstract = {{We present imaging of the recently discovered Hercules Milky Way
   satellite and its surrounding regions to study its structure, star
   formation history and to thoroughly search for signs of disruption. We
   robustly determine the distance, luminosity, size, and morphology of
   Hercules utilizing a bootstrap approach to characterize our
   uncertainties. We derive a distance to Hercules via a comparison to
   empirical and theoretical isochrones, finding a best match with the
   isochrone of M92, which yields a distance of 133 +/- 6 kpc. As previous
   studies have found, Hercules is very elongated, with epsilon = 0.67 +/-
   0.03 and a half-light radius of r(h) similar or equal to 230 pc. Using
   the color-magnitude-fitting package StarFISH, we determine that Hercules
   is old (> 12 Gyr) and metal-poor ({[}Fe/H] similar to -2.0), with a
   spread in metallicity, in agreement with previous spectroscopic work.
   This result is robust with respect to slight variations in the distance
   to Hercules and mismatches between the observed Hercules color-magnitude
   diagram and theoretical isochrones. We infer a total absolute magnitude
   of M(V) = -6.2 +/- 0.4. Our innovative search for external Hercules
   structure both in the plane of the sky and along the line of sight
   yields some evidence that Hercules is embedded in a larger stream of
   stars. A clear stellar extension is seen to the northwest with several
   additional candidate stellar overdensities along the position angle of
   Hercules out to similar to 35' (similar to 1.3 kpc). While the
   association of any of the individual stellar overdensities with Hercules
   is difficult to determine, we do show that the summed color-magnitude
   diagram of all three is consistent with Hercules' stellar population.
   Finally, we estimate that any change in the distance to Hercules across
   its face is at most similar to 6 kpc, and the data are consistent with
   Hercules being at the same distance throughout.}},

Abstract = {{A new platform for HDTV transmissions, in the form of a new-generation
   terrestrial digital video broadcasting standard (DVB-T2), has been
   developed by the DVB Project and will be published by the European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute. A number of technical
   innovations have been included in DVB-T2 to boost throughput and
   ruggedness, enhance single-frequency network coverage, and ease both
   transmitter and receiver implementation. This article starts from the
   motivations that led the DVB project to create the new standard and then
   surveys the key technologies behind DVB-T2, including the LDPC/BCH
   forward error correction scheme, transmission scheduling, orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing with huge block size, multiple-antenna
   transmissions, and synchronization techniques. A comparison with the
   current DVB-T standard is also provided, showing that DVB-T2 is able to
   increase the payload throughput and allows HDTV transmission with
   current network planning.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems with multiple receive channels
   allow for high-resolution wide-swath imaging thus overcoming a
   fundamental limitation of conventional single-aperture SAR. By using
   multiple apertures in azimuth, additional samples are received for each
   transmitted pulse. This allows for a reduced pulse repetition frequency
   (PRF) thereby enabling a wider swath. However, a nonoptimum PRF is
   associated with a nonuniform sample spacing in azimuth and needs to be
   compensated by a multichannel reconstruction algorithm. For strong
   deviations from the optimum PRF, the inverse character of such an
   algorithm might result in a degraded performance. This can be overcome
   by an innovative advanced transmit antenna architecture which allows for
   a pulse-to-pulse shift of the phase center. Such an antenna enables the
   adaptive adjustment of the system's phase center positions to the
   respective PRF, thereby ensuring constant performance over a clearly
   extended PRF range. In particular, in combination with conventional
   multichannel processing strategies, this technique represents the next
   step toward a fully active multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SAR and
   has a great potential for future systems.}},

Abstract = {{The ADC shown in this paper uses an innovative Sigma-Delta (Sigma Delta)
   architecture that replaces the flash quantizer and mismatch corrected
   DAC of a multibit continuous time (CT) modulator by a time domain
   encoder similar to a PWM modulator to reduce the effective ADC area. The
   modulator achieves the resolution of a multibit design using single bit
   circuitry by concentrating most of the quantization error energy around
   a single frequency, which is afterwards removed, seizing the zeros of a
   sinc decimation filter. The non flat error spectrum is accomplished by
   use of two filter loops, one of which is made to operate in a
   self-oscillating mode. An experimental CT-Sigma Delta ADC prototype has
   been fabricated in 0.13 mu m CMOS which implements a third order
   modulator with two operating modes. Measurements show an effective
   number of bits (ENOB) of 10 bits and 12 bits in a signal bandwidth of 17
   MHz and 6.4 MHz, respectively, and a power-efficient figure of merit
   (FoM = P wr/2 . BW . 2(ENOB)) of 0.48 pJ/conversion at 1.5 V supply. The
   active area of the ADC is 0.105 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{This research aimed to study the relationships between livestock
   systems, landscape maintenance and farming styles in the Belluno
   Province, a mountainous area of the Eastern Italian Alps. A total of 65
   farms were sampled on the basis of livestock category farmed and herd
   size. Farms were visited to collect information on technical and
   productive aspects, on landscape features of land managed, which was
   identified by aerial photographs and digitised in a GIS environment, and
   on the farmers' background, attitudes and approach to farming. Six
   different livestock systems were identified: intensive beef cattle (2
   farms); extensive beef cattle (12 farms); large sheep/goat farms (9
   farms); small sheep/goat farms (6 farms); intensive dairy cattle (14
   farms) and extensive dairy cattle (22 farms). The intensive systems had
   larger herds, modern structures and equipment, and were strongly
   production oriented, whereas the extensive systems had smaller herds and
   productivity, with often traditional or obsolete structures and
   equipment, but showed a tendency to diversify production by means of
   on-farm cheese making and/or mixed farming of different livestock
   categories. The ability to maintain meadows and pastures was greater for
   the extensive systems, especially in steep areas, while the annual
   nitrogen output, estimated as kg N/ha, was lower. Data on the farmers'
   background and attitudes were analysed with a non-hierarchical cluster
   procedure that clustered the farmers into 4 farming styles widely
   different in motivations to farming, innovative capability, and ability
   to diversify income sources and ensure farm economic viability. The
   farming styles were distributed across all livestock systems, indicating
   the lack of a linkage between the assignment of a farm to a livestock
   system and the way the farm is managed. This study demonstrates that in
   mountain areas variability of livestock systems may be high, and that
   they differ not only in production practices but also in the ability to
   maintain landscape, which is generally higher in the extensive or even
   marginal systems. Within a given livestock system, farms may be managed
   with different styles, which implies that informative knowledge to
   address policy decisions needs to integrate the definition of livestock
   systems with the assessment of farming styles.}},

Abstract = {{South Korea continues to lead the way in digital opportunity with its
   recent, innovative and ubiquitous city projects. The u-city initiative
   in South Korea is a national urban development project that focuses on
   strengthening the role of information and communication technologies in
   civic planning and management. This study tracks the changing dynamics
   driving the information society initiative of South Korea to evaluate
   the process of design and development of u-city. This study reviews
   qualitative data related to the u-city projects, describes the
   transformations and translation of this data in the public, political,
   and social discourse, and discusses the prospectus of a ubiquitous
   information society environment. The findings raise fundamental,
   practical questions about the role of ubiquitous computing in shaping
   our future cities. The findings show that there are more challenges
   ahead than prospects, despite the fact that the u-city has all the
   advanced technological components for a positive development. The South
   Korean u-city is typically more prone to problems related to the lack of
   social infrastructure, market restrictions, political quagmires and
   vested financial interests. The paper discusses the deficiencies of the
   South Korean approach, namely a lack of holistic approach by integrating
   technological possibilities with social application needs.}},

Abstract = {{The trend towards point-of-care and the advance in mobile technologies
   bring the potential to employ Mobile Nursing Information Systems (MNIS)
   in nursing care routines. However, adopting the MNIS is not simply a
   case of purchasing the required hardware and software, but rather a
   social interaction process between users, organizations, and the
   environment. Therefore, this study developed a framework of twelve
   factors affecting the decision to adopt/not to adopt the MNIS in the
   nursing department, and tested it from the perspective of the nursing
   administrators. A mail survey was conducted to collect the opinions of
   84 nursing administrators, and a discriminant analysis was used to
   identify the critical factors for the adoption/non-adoption of the MNIS.
   Business competition, external suppliers' support, and internal needs
   were identified as being significantly associated with the adoption of
   MNIS. Potential adopters can apply the results of this study as a
   reference when making the adoption decision regarding MNIS, while
   non-adopters and vendors can examine the resistance to MNIS.}},

Abstract = {{For any innovated plant design, the designed paper plant can be
   converted into a computer as a digital plant with advanced simulation
   techniques before being constructed into a real plant. A digital plant,
   namely engineering simulator, can be applied for: (1) verification of
   system design and system integration, (2) power test simulation, (3)
   plant transient and accident analyses, (4) plant abnormal and emergency
   procedure development and verification, (5) design change verification
   and analysis, etc. An advanced engineering simulator was successfully
   developed for the LungMen advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) plant to
   support various applications before and after commercial operation. This
   plant specific engineering simulator was developed based on two separate
   RELAP5-3D modules synchronized on a commercial simulation platform,
   namely 3-Key Master. On this advanced LungMen plant simulation (ALPS)
   platform, major plant dynamics were simulated by two separate RELAP5-3D
   modules, one for reactor system modeling and the other for balance of
   plant (BOP) system modeling. Moreover, major control systems as well as
   emergency core cooling system (ECCS) were all simulated in great detail
   with built-in tasks of this commercial simulation platform. Different
   from real time calculation on training simulator, precision of
   engineering calculation is intentionally kept by synchronizing modules
   based on the most time-consuming one. During synchronization, each
   module will check its' own converge criteria in each small time
   advancement. This plant specific advanced ABWR engineering simulator has
   been successfully applied on: (1) licensing blowdown analysis of feed
   water line break (FWLB) for containment design; (2) phenomena
   investigation of low-pressure ECC injection bypass during FWLB; (3)
   analysis of FW pump performance during power ascending: (4) verification
   of plant vendor's pre-test calculations of each start-up test. Crown

Abstract = {{The history of digital soil mapping and modeling (DSMM) is marked by
   adoption of new mapping tools and techniques, data management systems,
   innovative delivery of soil data, and methods to analyze, integrate, and
   visualize soil and environmental datasets. DSMM studies are diverse with
   specialized, mathematical prototype models tested on limited geographic
   regions and/or datasets and simpler, operational DSMM used for routine
   mapping over large soil regions. Research-focused DSMM contrasts with
   need-driven DSMM and agency-operated soil surveys. Since there is no
   universal equation or digital soil prediction model that fits all
   regions and purposes the proposed strategy is to characterize recent
   DSMM approaches to provide recommendations for future needs at local,
   national and global scales. Such needs are not solely soil-entered, but
   consider broader issues such as land and water quality, carbon cycling
   and global climate change, sustainable land management, and more. A
   literature review was conducted to review 90 DSMM publications from two
   high-impact international soil science journals - Geoderma and Soil
   Science Society of America Journal. A selective approach was used to
   identify published studies that cover the multi-factorial DSMM space.
   The following criteria were used (i) soil properties, (ii) sampling
   setup, (iii) soil geographic region, (iv) spatial scale, (v)
   distribution of soil observations, (vi) incorporation of legacy/historic
   data, (vii) methods/model type, (viii) environmental covariates, (ix)
   quantitative and pedological knowledge, and (x) assessment method.
   Strengths and weaknesses of current DSMM, their potential to be
   operationalized in soil mapping/ modeling programs, research gaps, and
   future trends are discussed. Modeling of soils in 3D space and through
   time will require synergistic strategies to converge environmental
   landscape data and denser soil datasets. There are needs for more
   sophisticated technologies to measure soil properties and processes at
   fine resolution and with accuracy. Although there are numerous
   quantitative models rooted in factorial models that predict soil
   properties with accuracy in select geographic regions they lack
   consistency in terms of environmental input data, soil properties,
   quantitative methods, and evaluation strategies. DSMM requires merging
   of quantitative, geographic and pedological expertise and all should be
   ideally in balance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an innovative optimization method, real structured
   genetic algorithm (RSGA), which combines the advantages of traditional
   real genetic algorithm (RGA) with structured genetic algorithm (SGA),
   and applies it for digital filter and control design optimization
   problems. For infinite impulse response (IIR) filter designs, the
   proposed approach fulfills all types of filters by minimizing the order
   of the filter and the absolute error of both passband and stopband. Both
   system structure and parametric variables are simultaneously optimized
   via the proposed chromosome scheme. The approach has also been extended
   to deal with robust control design problems. The approach offers an
   effective method for designing an optimal controller with robust
   stability. Simulation and experimental results conveys the excellence of
   the proposed algorithm over traditional approaches in convergence speed,
   performance, cost effectiveness, and attains simpler structure. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{This article focuses on Eurimages, the Council of Europe fund for the
   co-production, distribution and exhibition of European films. The core
   investigation of this paper relates to the benefits this public fund has
   had for the European film sector. Reflecting on the fund's twenty-year
   existence, what output has been realized, both in economic and cultural
   terms? Turning to the future, what are the fund's prospects now that the
   sector is facing the technological challenge of digitization? In order
   to evaluate the performance of the fund, the author takes a closer look
   at the economic, cultural and technologically innovative results
   achieved by Eurimages and relates these to the objectives that were set
   at its establishment. This evaluation is carried out by using
   statistical data as well as insights gained from policy documents,
   literature and expert interviews.}},

   innovations in Second Life}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends von Hippel's (Manag. Sci. 32(7):791-805, 1986)
   concept of lead users to a virtual reality environment. Three lead user
   groups, site developers, business firms and avatars, have a synergistic
   role to play in extending virtual reality from a social networking
   platform to a commercial one. The paper proposes a framework for
   assessing the extent to which innovative practices have been
   demonstrated by lead user business firms in a virtual setting. It
   applies the framework to twenty pioneering firms that operated within
   Second Life in 2007, from an avatar's perspective. The study's findings
   indicate that business firms made little use of digital agents, and
   provided few examples of bricolage. However, they exhibited higher
   levels of innovation in their use of telepresence and interactivity,
   which contributed to the achievement of flow. As a single-avatar study,
   the paper has limited generalizability, however studies with a wider
   scope will enable further development of this framework.}},

Abstract = {{The application of recent technical developments, such as digital PCR or
   shot-gun sequencing, for the analysis of cell-free fetal DNA, have
   indicated that the long-sought goal of the noninvasive detection of Down
   syndrome may finally be attained. Although these methods are still
   cumbersome and not high throughput, they provide a paradigm shift in
   prenatal diagnosis, as they could effectively pronounce the end of
   invasive procedures, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villous sampling
   for the detection of such fetal anomalies. However, it remains to be
   determined how suitable these approaches are for the detection of more
   subtle fetal genetic alterations, such as those involved in hereditary
   Mendelian disorders (e.g., thalassemia and cystic fibrosis). New
   technical developments, such as microfluidics and reliable automated
   scanning microscopes, have indicated that it may be possible to
   efficiently retrieve and examine circulating fetal cells. As these
   contain the entire genomic complement of the fetus, future developments
   may include the noninvasive determination of the fetal karyotype.}},

Abstract = {{Whether and how organizations adapt to changes in their environments has
   been a prominent theme in organization and strategy research. Within
   this research, there is controversy about whether organizational
   routines hamper or facilitate adaptation. Organizational routines give
   rise to inertia but are also the vehicles for change in recent work on
   dynamic capabilities. This rising interest in routines in research
   coincides with an increase in management practices focused on
   organizational routines and processes. This study explores how the
   increasing use of process management practices affected organizational
   response to a major technological change through new product
   developments. The empirical setting is the photography industry over a
   decade, during the shift from silver-halide chemistry to digital
   technology. The advent and rise of practices associated with the new ISO
   9000 certification program in the 1990s coincided with increasing
   technological substitution in photography, allowing for assessing how
   increasing attention to routines through ISO 9000 practices over time
   affected ongoing responsiveness to the technological change. The study
   further compares the effects for the incumbent firms in the existing
   technology with nonincumbent firms entering from elsewhere. Relying on
   longitudinal panel data models as well as hazard models, findings show
   that greater process management practices dampened response to new
   generations of digital technology, but this effect differed for
   incumbents and nonincumbents. Increasing use of process management
   practices over time had a greater negative effect on incumbents'
   response to the rapid technological change. The study contributes to
   research in technological change by highlighting specific management
   practices that may create disconnects between firms' capabilities and
   changing environments and disadvantage incumbents in the face of radical
   technological change. This research also contributes to literature on
   organizational routines and capabilities. Studying the effects of
   increasing ISO 9000 practices undertaken in firms provides an
   opportunity to gauge the effects of systematic routinization of
   organizational activities and their effects on adaptation. This research
   also contributes to management practice. The promise of process
   management is to help firms adapt to changing environments, and, as
   such, managers facing technological change may adopt process management
   practices as a response to uncertainty and change. But managers must
   more fully understand the potential benefits and risks of process
   management to ensure these practices are used in the appropriate
   contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The biological, chemical, behavioral and physical sciences
   provide the fuel for innovation, discovery and technology that
   continuously improves the quality of the human condition. Computer power
   derived from the dramatic breakthroughs of the digital revolution has
   made extraordinary computational capacity available for diagnostic
   imaging, bioinformatics (the science of information) and numerous
   aspects of how we practice dentistry in the 21st century.
   Overview. The biological revolution was initiated by the identification
   of the structure for DNA in 1953, a discovery that continues to catalyze
   improvements in patient care through new and better diagnostics,
   treatments and biomaterials. Humanity's most basic and recognizable
   characteristics-including the face-are now better understood through the
   elucidation of our genome and proteome, the genes and proteins they
   encode. Health care providers are beginning to use personalized medicine
   that is based on a person's genetic makeup and predispositions to
   disease development.
   Conclusions. Advances in the fields of genetics, developmental and stem
   cell biology, and many other disciplines continue to fuel innovative
   research findings that form the basis for new diagnostic tests,
   therapeutic interventions and procedures that improve the quality of
   life for patients. Scientists are on the threshold of applying knowledge
   in stem cell biology to regenerative medicine and dentistry, heralding
   an era when clinicians can consider using biological engineering to
   replace tissues and organs lost to disease or trauma.}},

   environment of change, we have done little to update the institution of
   education. The field of design has a great deal to offer children at
   this time. The thinking processes and multimodal approaches can, in
   part, provide the foundation for the skills that children will need for
   the necessary innovations of the future. The following article makes
   further recommendations for creativity as the next essential literacy

Abstract = {{There is increasing empirical evidence from academic research and strong
   recognition among policymakers that wide diffusion and innovative uses
   of digital wireless phones are important sources of a country's economic
   growth and social development. Adopters do not necessarily adopt digital
   wireless phones at the same time though. Although the diffusion of
   innovation theory suggests five adopter categories according to their
   degree of innovativeness, this approach lacks theoretical justification
   and, more importantly, it makes a critical assumption of a normal
   distribution of adopters that needs empirical validation. This study
   investigates the basis for defining different adopter categories and
   factors that affect adoption decisions of digital wireless phones using
   the aggregate data on 46 developed and developing countries from 1992 to
   2002. This paper utilizes a two-step analysis approach. The first step
   evaluates the distribution of adopters over time using various diffusion
   models. The second step uses iterative survival analysis to examine the
   patterns of influential factors on adoption behavior by evaluating the
   survival models using a 1\% increment of cumulative penetration as the
   targeted events. The results of the best-fitting diffusion models
   indicate that digital wireless phone adoption patterns did not follow a
   normal distribution and did not map exactly into Rogers' five adopter
   categories. The results from the iterative survival analysis suggest
   four adopter categories (innovators, early adopters, breakthrough
   adopters, and mainstream adopters) among the first 30\% of adopters.
   Different factors are observed to influence various adopter categories'
   adoption decisions. The results offer insights to support
   telecommunication operators to develop strategies to attract these
   adopters. It also supports policymakers' efforts to design effective
   regulatory frameworks. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several modifications in surgical techniques and various pharmacological
   and non pharmacological modalities have been introduced to prevent
   adhesions formation in surgery on flexor tendons of the hand. However,
   most studies have been carried out in animals with very few human
   trials. Only early postoperative rehabilitation is supported by clinical
   evidence, while the optimal rehabilitation protocol remains
   controversial. Innovations in surgical techniques and other modalities
   need to be tested with adequately powered human trials, before their
   potential benefit in clinical practice is accepted.}},

Abstract = {{Tangible interaction is an emering field of human-computer interaction
   that links the digital and the physical worlds by,9 embedding
   Computation in physical artifacts and environments. This paper shares
   our experience teaching tangible interaction over the past 4 years in an
   interdisciplinary, project-based laboratory course at Tufts University.
   Although the course is offered through the Computer Science Department,
   it reflects the multidisciplinary nature of the field, merging product
   engineering practices with a design studio approach. With a diverse mix
   of students, this approach has fostered creativity and hands-on
   learning. Throughout the course students have created innovative
   interfaces that not only capture fundamental concepts of tangible
   interaction but also contribute novel techniques for Supporting
   collaborative design. We discuss examples of student-created interfaces
   and illustrate the relationship between the methods employed in the
   course and the artifacts created. We also share our recommendations for
   implementing such a course in institutions with constraints similar to
   ours including a limited budget and minimal laboratory space.}},

Abstract = {{When James Watson suggested that Africans are less intelligent than
   Whites in October 2007, he was quickly called ``stupid{''} and
   ``irrational{''} by the international media. In this article, I argue
   that this characterization misses the structural elements at play and
   the larger social transformations where shifting discursive formations
   of race are converging in old and new ways with developments and
   innovations in digital culture and information technologies. This
   article identifies three discursive frames that characterize race talk
   in contemporary society, drawing on the work of Bonilla-Silva, Bell,
   Gilroy, Hall, and Spivak, and explores how they operate in a specific
   institutional context. Medical biotechnology, like many other
   enterprises, has been undergoing enormous changes enabled by
   developments and innovations in computing technologies such as databases
   and the Internet. As a result, scientific understandings of genetics and
   race are being recoded in the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we propose that the grammar of schooling {[}Tyack, D.,
   \& Tobin, W. (1994). The ``grammar{''} of schooling: Why has it been so
   hard to change? American Educational Research Journal, 31(3), 453-479.]
   is responsible not only for the well-known and world-wide difficulties
   in integrating ICT into formal educational settings, but also for the
   replication of traditional models when this integration occurs. In clear
   contrast with this domain, in out-of-school projects ICT is integrated
   in innovative and truly ``disruptive{''} {[}Blin, F., \& Munro, M.
   (2008). Why hasnt technology disrupted academic teaching practices.

   Computers and Education, 50(2), 475-490.] ways. To exemplify this
   integration, we have selected and described two successful, although
   different in nature, out-of-school projects. The first one, Pincel y
   Raton, seeks to develop creativity in children and to educate them to
   use ICT in a reflexive and useful manner. The second project, Menosca,
   pursues children's understanding of their historical and social
   environment through the use of GPSs, digital photography and web-page
   design. Both experiences underscore the multiple and varied
   possibilities that ICT affords for meaningful learning when the
   constraints inherent to the school setting do not seem to apply. By
   contrasting the formal and the out-of-school experiences, it is possible
   to unveil and bring to consciousness the principles and rules of the
   ``grammar of schooling{''}. We propose that becoming aware of the
   features of this grammar, i.e., philosophy, course design, time and
   place, tasks, resources, outcomes and products and assessment, is the
   first step toward change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The early days of radio astronomy showed incredibly diverse
   experimentation in ways to sample the electromagnetic spectrum at radio
   wavelengths. In addition to obtaining adequate sensitivity by building
   large collection areas, a primary goal also was to achieve sufficient
   angular resolution to localize radio sources for multi-wavelength
   identification. This led to many creative designs and the invention of
   aperture synthesis and VLBI. Some of the basic telescope types remain to
   the present day, now implemented across the entire radio spectrum from
   wavelengths of tens of meters to submillimeter wavelengths. In recent
   years, as always, there is still the drive for greater sensitivity but a
   primary goal is now to achieve very large fields of view to complement
   high resolution and frequency coverage, leading to a new phase of
   experimentation. This is the ``back to the future{''} aspect of current
   research and development for next-generation radio telescopes. In this
   paper I summarize the scientific motivations for development of new
   technology and telescopes since about 1990 and going forward for the
   next decade and longer. Relevant elements include highly optimized
   telescope optics and feed antenna designs, innovative fabrication
   methods for large reflectors and dipole arrays, digital implementations,
   and hardware vs. software processing. The emphasis will be on meter and
   centimeter wavelength telescopes but I include a brief discussion of
   millimeter wavelengths to put the longer wavelength enterprises into
   perspective. I do not discuss submillimeter wavelengths because they are
   covered in other papers.}},

   spans his later work, from the mainly Modernist poems of the early 90's
   to the experiment of metrical sonnets and to his recent, digitally
   influenced work. In the world of globalization and information, the
   value of poetry has been challenged. All poets have to consider where
   poetry happens. Lehto shows his attempt in art and poetry in the ways of
   plurality of cultures, the experiment of the language, and the exploring
   of forms of expression. The inventiveness and imagination give us a

Abstract = {{Telepathology, the practice of pathology at a long distance, has
   advanced continuously since 1986. Today, fourth-generation telepathology
   systems, so-called virtual slide telepathology systems, are being used
   for education applications. Both conventional and innovative surgical
   pathology diagnostic services are being designed and implemented as
   well. The technology has been commercialized by more than 30 companies
   in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Early adopters of telepathology
   have been laboratories with special challenges in providing anatomic
   pathology services, ranging from the need to provide anatomic pathology
   services at great distances to the use of the technology to increase
   efficiency of services between hospitals less than a mile apart. As to
   what often happens in medicine, early adopters of new technologies are
   professionals who create model programs that are successful and then
   stimulate the creation of infrastructure (ie, reimbursement,
   telecommunications, information technologies, and so on) that forms the
   platforms for entry of later, mainstream, adopters. The trend at medical
   schools, in the United States, is to go entirely digital for their
   pathology courses, discarding their student light microscopes, and
   building virtual slide laboratories. This may create a generation of
   pathology trainees who prefer digital pathology imaging over the
   traditional hands-on light microscopy. The creation of standards for
   virtual slide telepathology is early in its development but
   accelerating. The field of telepathology has now reached a tipping point
   at which major corporations now investing in the technology will insist
   that standards be created for pathology digital imaging as a value added
   business proposition. A key to success in teleradiology, already a
   growth industry, has been the implementation of standards for digital
   radiology imaging. Telepathology is already the enabling technology for
   new, innovative laboratory services. Examples include STAT QA surgical
   pathology second opinions at a distance and a telehealth-enabled rapid
   breast care service. The innovative bundling of telemammography,
   telepathology, and teleoncology services may represent a new paradigm in
   breast care that helps address the serious issue of fragmentation of
   breast cancer care in the United States and elsewhere. Legal and
   regulatory issues in telepathology are being addressed and are regarded
   as a potential catalyst for the next wave of telepathology advances,
   applications, and implementations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{An innovative telemedicine-enabled rapid breast care service is
   described that bundles telemammography, telepathology, and teleoncology
   services into a single day process. The service is called the
   UltraClinics (R) Process. Because the core services are at 4 different
   physical locations, a challenge has been to obtain stat second opinion
   readouts on newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. To provide same day
   quality assurance rereview of breast surgical pathology cases, a DMetrix
   DX-40 ultrarapid virtual slide scanner (DMetrix Inc, Tucson, AZ) was
   installed at the participating laboratory. Glass slides of breast cancer
   and breast hyperplasia cases were scanned the same day the slides were
   produced by the University Physicians Healthcare Hospital histology
   laboratory. Virtual slide telepathology was used for stat quality
   assurance readouts at University Medical Center, 6 miles away. There was
   complete concurrence with the primary diagnosis in 139 (90.3\%) of
   cases. There were 4 (2.3\%) major discrepancies, which would have
   resulted in a different therapy and 3 (1.9\%) minor discrepancies. Three
   cases (1.9\%) were deferred for immunohistochemistry. In 2 cases
   (1.3\%), the case was deferred for examination of the glass slides by
   the reviewing pathologists at University Medical Center. We conclude
   that the virtual slide telepathology quality assurance program found a
   small number of significant diagnostic discrepancies. The virtual slide
   telepathology program service increased the job satisfaction of
   subspecialty pathologists without special training in breast pathology,
   assigned to cover the general surgical pathology service at a small
   satellite university hospital. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method to build equivalent models of radiating printed
   circuit boards based on complex E-field measurements taken in the close
   vicinity of the device under test is explored. It is shown that the
   inverse problem to be solved to retrieve the currents from the field
   data is ill-posed. An innovative regularization approach implementing a
   penalty on abrupt spatial variations of the currents is proposed to
   alleviate this difficulty. Various schemes to mesh the equivalent
   current distribution are also explored. Combining these with
   measurements, it is shown that accurate estimation of equivalent current
   models can be achieved, thereby allowing the identification of the
   emission sources. The method is tested for different circuit
   configurations with both synthetic and real data. Obtained results
   demonstrate the efficiency of the method.}},

Abstract = {{The extension of the innovation cluster approach to creative industries
   is relatively recent. In this article we discuss the application of a
   formal cluster benchmarking model to a creative industry, the Ontario
   screen-based media industry (here defined as the film, television, and
   interactive digital media {[}IDM] sectors), the results of which shed
   insight into the ways that creative and technology-based clusters differ
   from one another. We discuss five challenges of approaching a creative
   industry in terms of an innovation cluster: 1) accurately understanding
   the nature and significance of innovation processes in cultural
   industries; 2) facilitating the linkages, spillovers, and externalities
   that are believed to be of strategic significance; 3) factoring in the
   clusters numerous trans-local external linkages; 4) innovation policy
   measures for labor, entrepreneurs, and small firms in media industries;
   5) identifying cluster-specific implications of actual or potential
   policy measures for innovation in an industry in which policy influences
   are widespread.}},

Abstract = {{Recent technological innovation has now made it possible to turn the
   computer into a microscope. This has entailed a shift from light
   microscopy to virtual microscopy. This development then foregrounds the
   issue of the pedagogy involved in this move from the analogue technology
   of the light microscope to the digital, computerized instance of virtual
   microscopy. In order to address this issue, undergraduate students
   enrolled in the Bachelor of Dental Science program at the University of
   Queensland School of Dentistry were surveyed to ascertain their
   preference for light or virtual microscopy. The value of this study is
   that it was conducted on the same cohort of students in two separate
   courses in 2006 and 2008, giving it longitudinal validity. The responses
   were overwhelmingly in favor of virtual microscopy. When it came to
   completely replacing the light microscope with virtual microscopy,
   however, students were much more ambivalent about such a wholesale
   change although this was less of an issue in the senior year. This shift
   from light to virtual microscopy signals larger changes in the tertiary
   sector from print-literate to electronic forms of knowledge and from
   teacher-centered to student-focused frames of learning. In short, we are
   in the midst of the e-evolution of microscopy in dental education.}},

Abstract = {{`Collaborative culture', `mass creativity' and `co-creation' appear to
   be contagious buzzwords that are rapidly infecting economic and cultural
   discourse on Web 2.0. Allegedly, peer production models will replace
   opaque, top-down business models, yielding to transparent, democratic
   structures where power is in the shared hands of responsible companies
   and skilled, qualified users. Manifestos such as Wikinomics (Tapscott
   and Williams, 2006) and `We-Think' (Leadbeater, 2007) argue collective
   culture to be the basis for digital commerce. This article analyzes the
   assumptions behind this Web 2.0 newspeak and unravels how business gurus
   try to argue the universal benefits of a democratized and collectivist
   digital space. They implicitly endorse a notion of public collectivism
   that functions entirely inside commodity culture. The logic of
   Wikinomics and `We- Think' urgently begs for deconstruction, especially
   since it is increasingly steering mainstream cultural theory on digital

Title = {{Determination of long-term erosion rates in vineyards of Navarre (Spain)
   using botanical benchmarks}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{Grape production is an ancient and important activity, particularly in
   Spain. Within this country, Navarre is one of the best vine-producing
   regions. Despite the importance of the vine crop, any quantification of
   soil erosion rates on a pluri-decennial scale under this world-wide land
   use is scant. Considering that in Navarre grafting in vines was made
   until the 1990s directly in the field, and almost at soil surface level,
   the quantification of erosion/sedimentation rates around a single plant
   can be performed by using the large, identifiable callus forming around
   the graft as a palaeo-surface marker. Moreover, by sampling a number of
   vines evenly spread over the field, an erosion/sedimentation pattern
   within the study vineyards can also be defined by data interpolation.
   Our purpose in this paper is thus (i) to assess the erosion rates of
   vineyards of different ages in a Mediterranean area using the
   aforementioned botanical signal i.e., grafting callus. and (ii) to
   determine the topographic changes caused by the erosion processes in
   these fields. Some vineyards affected by soil erosion were selected to
   carry out our experiments.
   In the region of Navarre, 7 rain-fed vineyards of different ages
   (between 22 and 61 years old) were selected as experimental plots. To
   find out how far from the ground surface the graft was originally made.
   we sought vineyards close and (almost) contemporary to the studied ones,
   whose soil surface level has remained roughly invariant during the time.
   Also, 2 types of Digital Elevation Models (DEM) were created: (i) A DEM
   depicting the present land surface by using the actual elevation values
   of the soil surface, and (ii) another DEM aiming to recreate the former
   topography of the vineyard (i.e. that present near planting time). By
   performing in each vineyard a subtraction of the DEM representing the
   land surface at the moment of planting from the DEM of the present land
   surface, a new DEM quantifying the local soil loss/gain rates over the
   entire crop span is obtained. The present work reveals important overall
   erosion rates in vineyards of Navarre (ca. 3 kg m(-2) year(-1) or 2 mm
   year(-1)) which, on average, greatly exceed even the most conservative
   soil loss tolerance thresholds. Moreover, the results suggest that
   tillage erosion is the leading soil loss process in the study vineyards
   rather than water erosion.
   Our innovative way of determining overall rates of soil surface changes
   in grafted vineyards appears to be a promising method to estimate
   long-term erosion/sedimentation rates not only in vines but also in
   other crops, providing a reliable botanical benchmark of the former soil
   surface. Furthermore, a spatial pattern of soil loss and gain can also
   be defined in the terrain. Furthermore, this soil loss assessment could
   be a valuable way, to some extent, to compensate for the lack of
   information on long-term erosion rates in cultivated areas of Navarre
   and Spain, as well as to validate long-term erosion models such as USLE
   or the like. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating digital, analog, I/O and memories onto a single chip is a
   great challenge to the design and process engineers. From the process
   engineers' point of view, integrating these modules with conflicting
   requirements needs a lot of innovation in the process technology. One
   such requirement is the need of having multiple gate oxide thickness on
   the same chip. Fluorine implantation of variable doses is explored to
   achieve this goal. It has been found that by varying the implanted dose
   of the fluorine in silicon, the oxidation rate and thereby the oxide
   thickness can be varied. The electrical characterization of the
   fluorine-implanted silicon based MOS structures using C-V and J-E
   measurements is reported here. It has been found that one can control
   the oxide thickness, interface properties and threshold voltage that
   could be vital in the SOC level integration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The AMUC (Associated Motion capture User Categories) project consisted
   of building a prototype sketch retrieval client for exploring motion
   capture archives. High-dimensional datasets reflect the dynamic process
   of motion capture and comprise high-rate sampled data of a performer's
   joint angles; in response to multiple query criteria, these data can
   potentially yield different kinds of information. The AMUC prototype
   harnesses graphic input via an electronic tablet as a query mechanism,
   time and position signals obtained from the sketch being mapped to the
   properties of data streams stored in the motion capture repository. As
   well as proposing a pragmatic solution for exploring motion capture
   datasets, the project demonstrates the conceptual value of iterative
   prototyping in innovative interdisciplinary design. The AMUC team was
   composed of live performance practitioners and theorists conversant with
   a variety of movement techniques, bioengineers who recorded and
   processed motion data for integration into the retrieval tool, and
   computer scientists who designed and implemented the retrieval system
   and server architecture, scoped for Grid-based applications. Creative
   input on information system design and navigation, and digital image
   processing, underpinned implementation of the prototype, which has
   undergone preliminary trials with diverse users, allowing identification
   of rich potential development areas.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to identify changes that have taken place in the Asian
   technological creativity after the post-communication revolution of
   digital technologies. After examining the utility patent applications
   forwarded to the US Patent Office by 24 Asian countries between 1965 to
   2007, the study partially supports the claim that the ``digital
   communication revolution have influenced the competitive creativity
   development in Asia.{''}
   However, the development growth model is shaped like a snail shell, and
   digital technologies have not been the silver bullet that promoted the
   leapfrogging of creativity in stagnating countries. Information and
   communication technologies (ICT) should be considered as a means of
   technological learning rather than the end of creativity development.
   The challenge of strengthening stagnating Asian countries to become
   competitive and innovative nations will continue until the next decade.
   Unless necessary steps are taken to improve technological learning and
   local innovations in stagnating countries, their technological
   dependency will increase and thus deepen the marginalization in the
   coming eras.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative design is presented which implements an area and power
   efficient near-lossless image compressor in an ASIC for
   power-constrained image sensor nodes in medical field such as the
   wireless endoscope capsule. The compressor is composed of a JPEG-LS
   encoder with a novel hardware-oriented image filter which improves the
   average compression by 17.3\%. Architecture design techniques such as
   parallel pipelines and in-stage resource sharing are extremely employed
   to save the die area. Low power design techniques such as hierarchy
   memory access, clock gating and voltage scaling are used to reduce power
   consumption. The compressor occupies a die area of 0.85mm(2) in 0.18 mu
   m 1P6M CMOS technology. The implemented JPEG-LS encoder costs the lowest
   gate counts and memory requirement in the reported literature. For VGA
   images at 15 frames per second, the real-time compression can be
   achieved at 20MHz clock frequency with power dissipation of 800uW at
   1.1V supply voltage.}},

Abstract = {{This Virtual Issue highlights 10 recent innovative, unconventional, or
   otherwise significant contributions to Earth Surface Processes and
   Landforms that help advance the state-of-the-art in research on linkages
   between landslides, hillslope erosion, and landscape evolution. The
   selected studies address this feedback within a temporal spectrum that
   ranges from the event to the millennial scale, thus underscoring the
   importance of detailed field observations, high-resolution digital
   topographic data, and geochronological methods for increasing our
   capability of quantifying landslide processes and hillslope erosion.

Abstract = {{This article presents estimates of the impact of regional variety and
   trade linkages on regional economic growth by means of export and import
   data by Italian province (NUTS 3) and sector (three-digit) for the
   period 1995-2003. Our results show strong evidence that related variety
   contributes to regional economic growth. Thus, Italian regions that are
   well endowed with sectors that are complementary in terms of competences
   (i.e., that show related variety) perform better. The article also
   assesses the effects of the breadth and relatedness of international
   trade linkages on regional growth, since they may bring new and related
   variety to a region. Our analysis demonstrates that regional growth is
   not affected by simply being well connected to the outside world or
   having a high variety of knowledge flowing into the region. Rather, we
   found evidence of related extraregional knowledge sparking intersectoral
   learning across regions. When the cognitive proximity between the
   extraregional knowledge and the knowledge base of a region is neither
   too small nor too large, real learning opportunities are present, and
   the external knowledge contributes to growth in regional employment.}},

Abstract = {{An intensive investigation of China's high-tech sector led by a noted
   Hong Kong-based geographer examines the patterns of cooperation between
   firms and local governments (so-called ``state-firm strategic
   resonance{''}) as an alternative to knowledge spillover in an effort to
   explain why certain firms are more likely to innovate than others within
   an economic cluster. As a case study, they select the integrated circuit
   design industry (a key in the development of more efficient computing
   and thus a critical element of the digital revolution) in Shanghai, one
   of the most advanced metropolitan regions in China. A systematic
   analysis of firm-level data obtained inter alia from the authors' 2008
   survey and interviews revealed a significant pattern of variation in
   innovation that could not be explained by inter-firm interactions in the
   process of industrial clustering. The authors argue that the uneven
   pattern of technological innovation is contingent on a state-built
   institutional and market environment designed to stimulate firms'
   innovative activities, and demonstrate how firms respond to that
   environment in a Chinese metropolis. Journal of Economic Literature,

Abstract = {{In today's marketplace, many of the newer-generation convergence
   products (e.g., camera phones, all-in-one personal digital assistants)
   offer consumers product performance that rivals dedicated versions. With
   the increased availability of options, consumers now face another
   dilemma in their purchase consideration: Which product form should they
   choose-converged, dedicated, or both? This study investigates the choice
   patterns for product forms along the technology trajectories. In a
   series of four studies, the authors find that at low levels of
   technological performance, consumers overwhelmingly select convergence
   products over the dedicated options, whereas the choice pattern is
   reversed at high levels of technological performance. Furthermore, the
   authors demonstrate that a preannouncement of future technology can
   affect consumer preferences for product forms. Finally, they address the
   managerial implications and suggest directions for further research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel pixel-based scrambling scheme to protect, in
   an efficient and secure way, the distribution of digital medical images.
   To provide an efficient encryption of a large volume of digital medical
   images, the proposed system uses simple pixel level XOR operation for
   image scrambling in an innovative way such that structural parameters of
   the encryption scheme have become a part of the cryptographic key. The
   cryptographic key of this operation is a true random number sequence
   generated from multi-scroll chaotic attractors.
   Cryptanalysis is provided. Simulation experiment has also validated the

   Technology Depth and Service Breadth in the BRIC Countries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Can mobile communication technologies bridge the digital divide between
   developing and developed countries? This paper shows that the divide
   looks differently from what was previously thought for the
   fastest-growing developing countries-Brazil, Russia, India, and China
   (BRIC) based on 2006 data. While mobile technology depth (number
   subscriptions as percentage of population) is lower in BRIC, it has been
   rapidly growing, equaling, or surpassing some developed countries for
   BRIC such as Russia and Brazil. BRIC such as India and Russia also equal
   or surpass several developed countries in 2006 in terms of mobile
   technology breadth (service variety) on 34 individual and five
   categories of mobile services available worldwide. While some BRIC may
   be behind developed countries on one of these dimensions in 2006, they
   are ahead on the other dimension. Thus, the digital divide between BRIC
   and developed countries can be narrower, absent, or even reversed,
   depending on the metric used. This paper argues that BRIC can serve as
   frontrunners whose lessons on technology diffusion can be applied in
   other developing countries. The paper presents implications for new
   product and innovation management and digital divide research and for
   policy making and business processes for high-tech companies in BRIC and
   other developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{A multidisciplinary approach was developed to analyse the impact of the
   various tectonic joints on water and gas transfers in the carbonate
   aquifer of Quezac (southern Massif Central, France). Microtectonic
   measurements confirmed the local tectonic history and the structural map
   was completed by a morphostructural approach, using detailed
   photointerpretation of both aerial photographs and a digital elevation
   model. The past fluid transfers were discussed on the basis of field
   observations and the possible geodynamic context. The present fluid
   transfers observed in the field were related to four main groups of
   tectonic joints, based on a tectonic and morphostructural approach. The
   history of tectonic constraints, geodynamic context and fluid transfers
   was then reconstructed. It highlighted the major role of the north-south
   tectonic joints for water flows, followed by east-west joints, because
   of their longest karstification history. Joints with NW-SE and NE-SW
   orientations, which were more recently karstified. appeared to have less
   influence on water transfers. The weak gas production at the surface of
   north-south faults was explained by its dispersion owing to their
   intense karstification. On the basis of the innovative multidisciplinary
   approach, we propose a model for the water and gas preferential flow
   paths, taking the local tectonic and geodynamic context into account.}},

Abstract = {{The Mark Twain Project Online (MTPO) was launched in October 2007 and,
   in this first phase, digitally published several thousand of Twain's
   letters, almost 100 facsimiles of original documents, and over 28,000
   records of other correspondence. The partners involved in the building
   of MTPO - the Mark Twain Papers, the California Digital Library, and
   University of California Press - created the site on the premise that
   Web-accessible versions of this content, enhanced by innovative design
   and site architecture and a suite of research tools, would greatly
   improve scholars' ability to discover and work with this unique
   material. Anecdotal feedback supports this premise. Early data analysis
   confirms the usefulness of facsimiles and browsing functionality. Users
   tend to prefer simple keyword over complex searches; however, those
   conducting advanced searches are using the tool flexibly, as we had
   hoped. Further analysis is expected to improve our understanding of how
   researchers use these tools in combination.}},

Abstract = {{Heike WEBER. Can Consumers act as Innovators? The role of users in the
   shaping of German GSM telephony In 1992, the digital cellular standard
   GSM was introduced into several European countries. Based on this
   development, in conj. unction with the deregulation of the
   telecommunications market, the substantial miniaturization of terminals,
   and the creation Of new mass marketing strategies and user practices,
   the mobile telephone was transformed from an elite tool for businessmen
   into an everyday communication tool. Taking the case of (West) Germany,
   this article emphasizes the power of mobile telephone users in this
   transformative process. To evaluate the impact of mobile telephones, it
   proposes an heuristic which distinguishes between ``prospective
   users{''} as they are constructed by planners, producers or marketing
   institutions, and,real users who actually use the technology in their
   daily lives. While the idea of businessmen in need of a mobile office
   dominated GSM's planning and early implementation phase, later
   developments took both system-builders and system-users by surprise.
   Through largely unforeseen practices, mass consumers shaped mobile
   telephony into an everyday technology used to master micro-mobility and
   social networking. The flexibility of the GSM standard enabled both
   creative re-interpretation of the technology and regular upgrades. Some
   of these upgrades, however, reflected marketing hopes rather than the
   actual practices of real users.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years, we have witnessed the boom of the digital market
   due to the proliferation of emergent audiovisual services and the
   increasing number of broadband networks. In this scenario, users
   insistently demand innovative services for exchanging and sharing their
   own audiovisual contents. In order to meet these needs, in this paper,
   we propose a system that broadcasts user-generated audiovisual contents
   for handheld devices in a mobile network based on the DVB-H broadcasting
   standard. Besides, our system offers diverse value-added services to
   these new active users, such as: (1) annotation, sharing and
   personalized distribution of audiovisual contents, (2) multi modal
   access, via Web or by client applications running locally in the
   handheld device, and (3) exploitation of return channels to transmit
   interactive contents that enhance the user's experience. To achieve
   these goals, our system adopts well-known technologies for broadcasting
   and semantic annotation of audiovisual contents, as well as emergent
   technology from Web 2.0 and Semantic Web. We have carried out tests
   involving a group of students from the University of Vigo, who were
   satisfied with the personalization capabilities offered by our TV system
   for mobile settings.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive clinical imaging data and additional relevant information
   are crucial for the planning and delivery of radiation therapy in
   patients with cancer. Multiple stand-alone systems that make use of
   technologic advances in imaging, treatment planning, and treatment
   delivery acquire or generate key data during the course of radiation
   therapy. However, the data are scattered in various systems throughout
   the radiation therapy department, thereby compromising efficient
   clinical work flow. In 1997 and 1999, the Digital Imaging and
   Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard was extended from radiology
   to radiation therapy with the ratification of seven DICOM-RT objects.
   These objects helped set the standard for (a) data integration and
   interoperability between radiation therapy equipment and information
   systems from different manufacturers, and (b) the use of DICOM
   diagnostic images in radiation therapy. More recently, key radiation
   therapy imaging and informatics data have been integrated to form an
   open-architecture comprehensive radiation therapy electronic patient
   record (ePR) system. The benefits of such a DICOM-RT-based ePR system
   are threefold: it can be used as a foundation for performing effective
   and efficient clinical services, as a common platform for radiation
   therapy data exchange and expert consultation, and for medical imaging
   informatics research in developing innovative decision support tools and
   a knowledge base for improved treatment with radiation therapy. (C)

Abstract = {{The application of digital design technology has provided the chance for
   innovating the structure design of traditional jacquard fabric. In this
   paper, a study on innovative design was carried out aimed at creating
   double-face fabric with novel full-color effects on both face and back
   sides. The basic design theory was that with the application of
   full-color compound fabric structure and regular stitch weaves, under
   layered-combination design mode, the figured double-face jacquard fabric
   could be designed through the combination of face and backing fabric
   structures that were designed respectively in advance. By such way, the
   resultant fabric structure was capable of expressing independent
   full-color figuring effects on both sides of fabric, in which the
   backing structure was covered by face structure. Such fabric fully meets
   the requirement of balanced interlacement and poses no problems in
   industrial production due to the application of the regular face,
   backing and stitch weaves.}},

Abstract = {{The blade is one of the vital components and the most difficulty in
   manufacturing of large hydro turbines. In order to cost-effectively and
   productively manufacture these kinds of blades, a series of innovative
   digital techniques have been developed. It includes the digital design
   of hydro turbine blades based on manufacturers' requirements,
   computer-aided location and the machined error evaluation with three
   dimensional digitized measure, tool path generation strategy for
   enhancing machining efficiency and controlling deviation in NC
   machining, tool path generation and NC machining simulation by means of
   a virtual NC machining environment for blades, and feasible strategy and
   the systematic scheme for manufacturing of large blades with 5-axis
   simultaneous CNC machining technology. The developed innovative digital
   manufacture techniques have been successfully applied in the
   manufacturing of both the large grade Kaplan and Francis hydraulic
   turbine blades. It has been shown that the higher efficiency and the
   better surfaces finish accuracy can be achieved in practical
   engineering. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The use of digital outcrop models in combination with traditional
   sedimentological field data improves the accuracy and efficiency of
   qualitative and quantitative characterization of outcrop analogs for
   reservoir modeling purposes. In this article, we apply an innovative
   methodology of outcrop characterization to an Upper Triassic
   fluvial-dominated system, exposed in extensive outcrops with limited
   three-dimensional (3-D) exposure.
   Qualitative analysis of the study outcrop allows the subdivision of the
   formation into three architectural intervals. Each interval can be
   further subdivided into subintervals on the basis of architectural
   style. This subdivision provides information on reservoir
   compartmentalization, which is used for zonation of the geocellular
   model. Qualitative analysis also provides valuable information on
   reservoir facies distribution.
   A new technique termed ``perpendicular projection plane{''} is presented
   as a tool for quantitative analysis of outcrops with reduced 3-D
   exposure. This technique improves the accuracy of apparent width
   measurements of geobodies exposed in outcrops, which are subparallel to
   paleoflow. The quantitative analysis provides a detailed data set of
   geobody dimensions to use as conditioning data for analog reservoir
   models. Statistical analysis of the dimensions provides empirical
   relationships to apply in subsurface analog systems to reduce
   uncertainty related to stochastic modeling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, more attention has been paid on artificial life
   researches. Artificial life(AL) is a research on regulating gene
   parameters of digital organisms under complicated problematic
   environments through natural selections and evolutions to achieve the
   final emergence of intelligence. Most recent studies focused on solving
   certain real problems by artificial life methods, yet without much
   address on the AL life basic mechanism. The real problems are often very
   complicated, and the proposed methods sometimes seem too simple to
   handle those problems. This study proposed a new approach in AL
   research, named ``generalized artificial life structure(GALS){''}, in
   which the traditional ``gene bits{''} in genetic algorithms is first
   replaced by ``gene parameters{''}, which could appear anywhere in GALS.
   A modeling procedure is taken to normalize the input data, and AL
   ``tissue{''} is innovated to make AL more complex. GALS is anticipated
   to contribute significantly to the fitness of AL evolution. The
   formation of ``tissue{''} begins with some different AL basic cells, and
   then tissue is produced by the casual selections of one or several of
   these cells. As a result, the gene parameters, represented by
   ``tissues{''}, could become highly diversified. This diversification
   should have obvious effects on improving gene fittness. This study took
   the innovative method of GALS in a stock forecasting problem under a
   carefully designed manipulating platform. And the researching results
   verify that the GALS is successful in improving the gene evolution
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have revolutionized
   programmable/reconfigurable digital logic technology. However, one
   limitation of current FPGAs is that the user is limited to strictly
   electronic designs. Thus, they are not suitable for applications that
   are not purely electronic, such as optical communications, photonic
   information processing systems and other multi-technology applications.
   While;at wide variety of multi-technology devices ranging from
   microelectromagnetic systems (MEMS) devices, analog devices, photonic
   information processing devices, telecommunication and digital data
   processing systems to biological and chemical sensors have been
   implemented, research in this area has for the most part been limited to
   systems built with application-specific devices. While these designs are
   well optimized for a specific application, they do not provide the
   flexibility associated with reconfigurable/programmable hardware. As
   with any application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), this approach
   is very costly, and the turnaround time between design iterations may be
   several months. The difficulty of using custom designed multi-technology
   VLSI components is overcome in the present research with the
   introduction of a multi-technology FPGA (MT-FPGA) with innovative system
   architecture. The proposed new class of field programmable device will
   extend the flexibility, rapid prototyping and reusability benefits
   associated with conventional FPGA technology into photonic and other
   multi-technology domain and give rise to the development of a wider
   class of programmable and embedded integrated systems.}},

Abstract = {{Digital radiography has been studied extensively for thickness
   measurement in recent years. This has resulted in enhanced image quality
   and improved overall evaluation. In this research, an innovative
   numerical method was used,for image enhancement and radiographic
   interpretation through the use of MATLAB software. Film digitising was
   carried out by a scanner. Thickness profiles of specimens were extracted
   front the optical density of radiographs by a numerical method.
   Therefore, digital imaging and optical density measurements were
   combined to evaluate the thickness profile of samples. Results were used
   to create a three-dimensional mapping of the non-complex specimens for
   further investigation. Then the volumetric information could be used for
   the evaluation of various defects, such as corrosion, erosion and
   pitting. The most important challenge in the calculations was measuring
   the exact effective atomic attenuation coefficient for the samples. For
   this purpose, some reference blocks were designed, fabricated and used.
   In addition to practical experiments, Monte Carlo simulation was carried
   out for accurate assessment of the developed method. Although results
   show a high correlation between real and calculated values for plates,
   insulated and non-insulated pipes, this method cannot be used for the
   volumetric rendering of samples with a complex geometry Ordinary
   computerised tomography has to be used for complex specimens.}},

Abstract = {{In current cars, loops are commonly used to redirect the webbing which
   reels out from the retractor to the passenger's shoulder. Some types of
   pillar loops, also called D-rings, lead to a non-systematic instability.
   The webbing, which should scroll without hindrance through the D-ring,
   laterally shifts, bunches and produces the overturning of the ring.
   In this paper, this so-called seat belt bunching phenomenon is parsed
   during a first step with sled test campaigns data. The results of
   designs of experiments are analysed and discussed.
   To expertize this instability issue, an innovative fixture is exploited
   during a second step to reproduce the phenomenon in a fully controlled
   manner for dynamic and quasi-static loadings. To assess these subsystem
   tests, a Digital Images Correlation system is employed to evaluate the
   strain distribution of seat belt webbing during the bunching phase.
   Based on these local measurements, a correlation of a Finite Element
   model of seat belt bunching is achieved using a new shell element for
   webbing fabric, before proposing an explanation of the phenomenon. (C)

Abstract = {{Understanding the complex relationships between microstructural
   organization and macromechanical function is fundamental to our
   knowledge of the differences between normal, diseased/injured, and
   healing connective tissues. The long-term success of functional
   tissue-engineered constructs or scaffolds may largely depend on our
   understanding of the structural organization of the original tissue.
   Although innovative techniques have been used to characterize and
   measure the microstructural properties of collagen fibers, a large gap
   remains in our knowledge of the behavior of intermediate scale (i.e.,
   ``mesostructural{''}) groups of fiber bundles in larger tissue samples.
   The objective of this study was to develop a system capable of directly
   measuring deformations of these smaller mesostructures during
   application of controlled loads. A novel mesostructural testing system
   (MSTS) has been developed to apply controlled multiaxial loads to medium
   (meso-) scale tissue specimens, while directly measuring local
   nonuniform deformations using synchronized digital video capture and
   ``markerless{''} image correlation. A novel component of the MSTS is the
   use of elliptically polarized light to enhance collagen fiber contrast,
   providing the necessary texture for accurate markerless feature tracking
   of local fiber deformations. In this report we describe the components
   of the system, its calibration and validation, and the results from two
   different tissues: the porcine aortic valve cusp and the bovine
   pericardium. Validation tests on prepared samples showed maximum error
   of direct strain measurement to be 0.3\%. Aortic valve specimens were
   found to have larger inhomogeneous strains during tensile testing than
   bovine pericardium. Clamping effects were more pronounced for the valve
   specimens. A new system for direct internal strain measurement in
   connective tissues during application of controlled loads has been
   developed and validated. The results from the two different tissues show
   that significant inhomogeneous deformations can occur even in simple
   tensile testing experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The Silent Cerebral Infarct Multicenter Transfusion (SIT) Trial is a
   multi-institutional intervention trial in which children with silent
   cerebral infarcts are randomized to receive either blood transfusion
   therapy or observation (standard care) for 36 months. The SIT Trial is
   scheduled to enroll approximately 1,880 children with sickle cell
   disease from 29 clinical sites in the United States, Canada, UK, and
   France. Each child undergoes a screening magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) of the brain to detect the presence of silent cerebral
   infarct-like lesions, a pre-randomization (baseline) MRI and exit MRI to
   determine if there are new or enlarged cerebral infarcts, using a
   designated, prospective imaging protocol. The objective of this
   manuscript is to describe the innovative method used to process and
   adjudicate imaging studies for an international trial with a primary
   endpoint that includes neuroimaging. Institution investigators at each
   site were provided with computer hardware and software for transmission
   of MRI images that allow them to strip the scans of all personal
   information and add unique study identifiers. Three neuroradiologists at
   separate academic centers review MRI studies and determine the presence
   or absence of silent cerebral infarct-like lesions. Their findings are
   subsequently placed on web-based case report forms and sent to the
   Statistical Coordinating Center. The average time from imaging center
   receipt of the MRI study to the radiology committee report back to the
   local site is less than two working days. This novel strategy was
   designed to maximize efficiency and minimize cost of a complex large
   multicenter trial that depends heavily on neuroimaging for entry
   criteria and assessment for the primary outcome measures. The
   technology, process, and expertise used in the SIT Trial can be adapted
   to virtually any clinical research trial with digital imaging
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Radiological imaging of the vascular system is an essential component in
   the clinical evaluation of vascular emergencies. Duplex ultrasound is
   still in use as a basic diagnostic means and enables initial diagnostic
   information. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA), the longtime gold
   standard, is now more often used with therapeutic interventions rather
   than purely diagnostic studies. However, over the past 10 years, there
   has been a rapid development of new technology that has deeply changed
   vascular imaging and allows a non-invasive depiction with a robust
   technique, greater speed and higher resolution. Advanced cross-sectional
   imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography nowadays enable a
   dedicated diagnostic evaluation of acute aortic and peripheral arterial
   pathologies. Due to its enormous innovation and broad and quick
   availability angiographic multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) could
   replace catheter-based angiography in the diagnostic assessment.
   This article summarizes the performance of MDCT angiographic imaging and
   its diagnostic and therapeutic significance for the diagnostic
   assessment of non-traumatic aortic and peripheral arterial diseases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends the existing research on the interplay of positive
   and negative feedback dynamics in the competition for business system
   dominance. By building on an analysis of the digital television launch
   in the United Kingdom, we find that the expectation of network
   externalities intensifies competition causing strong negative feedback
   effects to emerge. Actions aimed at improving one's position are
   systematically imitated and pre-emptied. Pressure builds up in the
   business system, and only when the weakest firms exit, the positive
   feedback effects are unleashed in their full magnitude. Our findings
   contribute to an improved understanding of institutional dynamics in new
   technology introduction. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to explore the opportunities virtual
   worlds offer for real-world innovations. By integrating users of virtual
   worlds into in interactive new product development process, companies
   can tap customers innovative potential using the latest technology.
   Connecting the emerging technology of virtual Worlds With a
   customer-centric perspective of open innovation allows unique and
   inventive opportunities to capitalize oil users' innovative potential
   and knowledge. The concept of avatar-based innovation serves as a point
   of origin to reveal these possibilities and represents the first attempt
   to systematically take advantage of virtual worlds for innovation
   management. In doing so, this paper argues that latest advances of
   information and communication technologies enrich the interaction
   process and can improve new product development process. Further,
   characteristics are presented that suggest that the digital environment
   is especially conducive to innovation and creative tasks. Based oil
   theoretical insights, the analysis of eight cases (Coca-Cola, Steelcase,
   Osram, Alcatel-Lucent, Toyota Scion, Endemol, Aloft, and Mazda),
   participant observation directly within the virtual world and 23
   interviews with both managers and customers, this paper demonstrates how
   virtual worlds allow producers and consumers to swarm together with
   like-minded individuals to create new products and permits companies to
   find an audience to test, use, and provide feedback on the content and
   products they create. We highlight the active roles avatars can play
   throughout the whole innovation process, and demonstrate the
   opportunities of how manufactures and Customers could collaborate to
   innovate from idea to launch. A few pathfinding companies experiment
   with avatars as a source of innovation. Specifically, the initiatives of
   Osram, Steelcase, Mazda, and Toyota truly link the concepts of open
   innovation and virtual worlds to employ the interactive technology for
   new product development. These efforts are critically analyzed to
   examine the hypothesized potential of avatar-based innovation. The cases
   pinpoint practical implications and reveal both preconditions and
   challenges of this new approach to interactive new product development.
   The results suggest that in order to fully realize the potential of
   avatar-based innovation, companies need to create a compelling open
   innovation experience and consider the peculiarities of Virtual worlds.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the interactive nature of relationships between
   Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) in terms of their
   technological innovations and diffusion. For the purpose, the United
   States Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO) database was used and
   Lotka-Volterra equations were applied to the patent data, resulting in a
   Patent Interaction Network (PIN). This matrix was employed to
   investigate the interaction patterns among ICT-related industries,
   allowing co-evolution process across ICTs to be analyzed. This paper
   also examined patenting activities in the Korean ICT sector, which has
   announced the IT839 strategy to address ICT-related services,
   infrastructures and growth drivers. It is judged that the evolving
   pattern of Koran ICT has been compatible with the PIN, facilitating the
   development of each other. It is also expected that promoting broadband
   and home-network technologies, together with technologies on digital
   contents and software solutions, can lead to the growth of the whole ICT
   industry. Such research findings will provide numerous implications for
   policy-making and strategic planning for ICT development. (C) 2009

   evaluate the resulting structure, process, and outcome changes.
   Method
   Cross-sectional survey of program directors at 10 academic institutions
   augmented by review of reports and secondary analyses of existing
   databases to identify structural and process measures of curriculum
   implementation, participation rates, and students' responses to
   Association of American Medical Colleges Medical School Graduation
   Questionnaires about geriatrics training.
   Results
   All 10 institutions reported structural changes, including newly
   developed or revised geriatric rotations or courses for their trainees.
   Most used online Internet educational materials, sent students to new
   training venues, incorporated geriatric case discussions, implemented
   standardized patients, and used digital media. On average, each
   institution trained more than 1,000 medical students, 500 residents, 100
   faculty, and 700 nonfaculty community physicians during the award
   period. Reynolds institutions also provided geriatrics training across
   22 non-primary-care disciplines. Eight schools implemented formal
   faculty development programs.
   By 2005, students at Reynolds-supported schools reported higher. levels
   of geriatrics/gerontology education and more exposure to expert
   geriatric care by the attending faculty compared with students at
   non-Reynolds schools. innovations and products were disseminated via
   journal publications, conference presentations, and the Portal of
   Geriatric Online Education.
   Conclusions
   The investment of extramural and institutional funds in geriatrics
   education has substantially influenced undergraduate, graduate, and
   practicing physician education at Reynolds-supported schools. The full
   impact of these programs on care of older persons will not be known
   until these trainees enter practice and educational careers.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas the computing power of DSP or general-purpose processors was
   sufficient for 3G baseband telecommunication algorithms, stringent
   timing constraints of 4G wireless telecommunication systems require
   computing-intensive data-driven architectures. Managing the complexity
   of these systems within the energy constraints of a mobile terminal is
   becoming a major challenge for designers. System-level low-power
   policies have been widely explored for generic software-based systems,
   but data-flow architectures used for high data-rate telecommunication
   systems feature heterogeneous components that require specific
   configurations for power management. In this study, we propose an
   innovative power optimization scheme tailored to self-synchronized
   data-flow systems. Our technique, based on the synchronous data-flow
   modeling approach, takes advantage of the latest low-power techniques
   available for digital architectures. We illustrate our optimization
   method on a complete 4G telecommunication baseband modem and show the
   energy savings expected by this technique considering present and future
   silicon technologies.}},

   system for the recording of extracellular neuronal activity, with the
   possibility of selecting one of four channels. The system comprises four
   radio frequency (RF) transceivers, three microcontrollers, and a digital
   amplifier and filter. This constitutes an innovative distributed
   processing approach. Gain, cutoff frequencies, and channel selection are
   remotely adjusted. Digital data transmission is used for both the
   bioelectrical signals and the control commands. This feature offers
   superior immunity to external RF interference. Real-time viewing of the
   acquired data allows the researcher to select only relevant data for
   storage. Simultaneous recordings of neuronal activity from the striatum
   of a freely moving rat, both with the wireless device and with a wired

Abstract = {{The UK Government strategy for aging in the 21st Century challenges
   conceptions of older people as passive recipients of care and promotes
   their engagement as active citizens. The strategy includes a commitment
   to test services which embody these principles with a range of
   innovative pilot projects. This paper summarises research on older
   people's information needs and use which informed the design for one of
   these projects, Leeds Link-Age Plus. The research explored the complex
   circumstances around which older people access and use social and
   community information - a topic that has received limited attention in
   the literature. The paper is novel in considering how the use of
   informal networks for securing information, advice and advocacy can be
   supported by technology literate mediators, who may be older people,
   located within local community or voluntary organisations. Emphasising
   the mediator in design facilitates social contacts, directly addresses
   issues of trust and can reduce the chance of causing distress dealing
   with complex information. A model is suggested for using emerging
   technology to introduce new ways in which information for older adults
   can be improved by digital `circles of support' - a form of social
   network where mediators collaborate to create and share self-authored
   content. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize the shape, the quality, and the roughness of
   microshells, typically used technologies are scanning electron
   microscopy, scanning interferometric microscopy, or atomic force
   microscopy. One of the drawbacks of these techniques is that they are
   generally slow because of their scanning process. Digital holographic
   microscopy technology is an innovation that can offer ability adapted to
   these studies. It captures holograms instead of intensity images, as
   done by conventional microscopes. The holograms are then digitally
   interpreted (10 per second) to reconstruct a double image, one for the
   intensity and another one for the phase. Using a rotation axis, the bump
   counting for the complete microshell surface is possible with a very
   highspeed. Using an image stitching software, mapping can be done in a
   few minutes. Wavelets such as ``Mexican hat{''} are used to model the
   bumps. Each bump can then be characterized on the map by its position,
   diameter, and height.}},

Abstract = {{The coexistence issue between ultra-wideband (UWB) radio communication
   systems and narrow-band wireless LAN systems is investigated by
   experiments and simulations. The work is divided in two parts. In this
   Part H, either impulse radio or multiband orthogonal frequency-division
   multiplex systems are assumed to be the disturbance source, while
   narrow-band wireless systems based on IEEE 802.11a/b are assumed to be
   the victims. The electromagnetic interference produced by a UWB
   disturbance source to the WiFi victim systems is experimentally
   evaluated by radiated measurements in a semianechoic chamber. Then, an
   innovative conducted coupling test is proposed to simplify the
   measurements while maintaining satisfactory accuracy. A simulation
   method is also proposed to help designers of wireless communication
   systems. The bit error ratio and packet error ratio are measured to
   evaluate the level of interference between different radio systems. Some
   tests are carried out for typical operational conditions of radio
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{To compare posterior capsular opacification (PCO) in a

   (IOL) and a hydrophobic acrylic IOL.
   Seventy-eight patients with simple cataract were randomized to receive
   either the BioVue 3 HSM hydrophilic acrylic IOL (Ophthalmic Innovations
   International, Ontario, CA, USA) (n = 38) or the Sensar AR40e
   hydrophobic acrylic IOL (AMO, Santa Ana, CA, USA) (n = 40). Another 99
   patients with complicated cataract received either the BioVue 3 (n = 49)
   or the Sensar AR40e IOL (n = 50). Twelve months after surgery, POCOman
   software was used to analyze digital retroillumination photographs of
   the PCO.
   In the simple cataract group, the respective PCO areas, expressed as a
   percentage and PCO severity scores at 12 months were 6.12\% and 0.081 in
   the BioVue 3 group and 5.91\% and 0.075 in the Sensar AR40e group. There
   was no statistically significant difference in the PCO area or the PCO
   severity score between the two IOLs (P = 0.631, P = 0.495,
   respectively). In the complicated cataract group, the respective PCO
   areas and PCO severity scores were 35.80\% and 0.181 in the BioVue 3
   group and 27.17\% and 0.110 in the Sensar AR40e group. There was no
   statistically significant difference between the two IOLs (P = 0.147, P
   = 0.162).
   There was no difference in the degree or severity of PCO between the HSM
   hydrophilic acrylic IOL and the hydrophobic acrylic IOL groups.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding consumers' upgrading behavior is essential to product
   planning. Product managers would like to know what fraction of customers
   would upgrade to new and improved versions, and how fast. This paper
   presents a method to forecast the sales path of an improved version of a
   high-technology product defined in terms of its price path and
   multiattribute product specification. The approach is potentially useful
   to managers to answer what-if questions on the effects of alternative
   price paths and product specifications of the upgrade on when and what
   fraction of customers will upgrade. By doing such analysis for several
   product options under consideration, managers can choose the best
   feature specification and price path for the upgrade. The proposed
   approach integrates an individual-level conjoint utility model with a
   hazard function specification. The first stage of estimation (i.e.,
   conjoint analysis) measures individual-level multiattribute utility
   functions, and the second stage ( i.e., duration analysis) calibrates
   the coefficients of predictor variables of the time to upgrade via
   maximum likelihood. An illustrative application in the personal digital
   assistant (PDA) category confirms the predictive validity and potential
   usefulness of the proposed approach. Among the empirical findings are
   that higher upgrade costs and expectation of faster product improvement
   tend to delay buyers' upgrading decisions. The roles of other predictor
   variables such as product category characteristics, consumer
   characteristics, and peer pressure were also confirmed.}},

Title = {{Incorporating Network Externalities into the Technology Acceptance Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{291-307}},

Abstract = {{Research on network externalities has identified a number of product
   categories in which the market performance of an innovation (e.g., unit
   sales and revenues) is an increasing function of that innovation's
   installed base and the availability of complementary products.
   Innovation scholars have attributed these findings to the positive
   impact of network externality variables on consumer perceptions of
   innovation attributes. This paper provides the first empirical
   examination of these perceptual linkages by extending the Technology
   Acceptance Model to include consumer perceptions of network externality
   variables. The authors hypothesize that, when direct and indirect
   network externalities exist, consumer purchase intentions and consumer
   perceptions of an innovation's usefulness and ease of use will
   positively reflect perceptions of installed base size and the
   availability of complementary products. To test this reasoning, the
   authors developed new measures of consumer perceptions of network
   externality variables. These measures were incorporated into a survey
   that explored the attitudes in Japan of potential adopters toward
   digital music (DM) players at an early stage in the product life cycle.
   Findings reveal a direct positive relationship between ease of use and
   the perceived availability of digital music. The authors also find
   positive and significant relationships between both purchase intention
   and perceived usefulness and (1) the perceived size of the DM player
   installed base and (2) the perceived availability of digital music. An
   application of the Baron-Kenny test for mediating variables reveals that
   (1) ease of use partially mediates the relationship between the
   perceived availability of digital music and perceived usefulness and (2)
   perceived usefulness partially mediates the relationship between the
   perceived availability of digital music and purchase intention. The
   research has important implications for future research on new product
   adoption and for the management of innovations that involve network
   externalities. The conceptual model provides a framework for testing
   alternative explanations of observed variations in the impact of network
   externalities within and across product categories. The empirical
   analysis provides guidance for managers who wish to manage the impact of
   network externalities on adoption. In addition to stimulating the size
   of the installed base and the variety of complementary products,
   executives must also manage consumer awareness of network externality
   variables and consumer understanding of the relationship between those
   variables and innovation attributes. Finally, traditional adoption
   models link consumer adoption decisions to perceptions of innovation
   attributes. The findings provided here imply that predictive accuracy of
   these models can be improved by including consumer perceptions of
   network externality variables.}},

Abstract = {{The paper analyses the impact of geographic innovation on total factor
   productivity (TFP) in Taiwan in 2001 using 242 four-digit standard
   industrial classification (SIC) industries. We compute TFP by estimating
   Translog production functions with K, L, E and M inputs, and measure the
   geographic innovative activity using both Krugman's Gini coefficients
   and the location Herfindahl index. We also consider the geographic
   innovation variable as an endogenous variable and use two stage least
   squares (2SLS) to obtain a consistent, albeit inefficient, estimator.
   The empirical results show a significantly positive effect of geographic
   innovation, as well as R\&D expenditure, on TFP. These results are
   robust for the Gini coefficients and location Herfindahl index, when
   industrial characteristics and heteroskedasticity are controlled.
   Moreover the Hausman test shows that the geographic innovation variable
   should be treated as endogenous which Supports the modern theory of
   industrial clustering regarding innovation spillovers; within Clusters.

Abstract = {{Digital jacquard fabric has its design concept and method directly
   borrowed from computer images and color modes. This has enabled the
   creation of innovative jacquard fabric design that is far beyond what
   freehand patterns can express. In this paper, the principles of digital
   jacquard designing have been classified into two parts: colorless mode
   and colorful mode, and an innovative layered-combination design mode has
   been suggested that contains this new design concept, by which digital
   jacquard fabric can be designed from colorless single-layer structures
   to colorful compound structures. As a result, designed jacquard fabrics
   are capable of expressing picturesque and photo-realistic effects with a
   mega-level color number on the face of the fabric. It is envisaged that
   the results of the study are of tremendous benefit to the creation of
   new jacquard fabrics with inimitable digital effects that can be
   manufactured.}},

Abstract = {{Fish have appeared since Precambrian more than 500 million years ago.
   Yet, there are still much untamed areas for fish propulsion research.
   The swordfish has evolved a light thin/high crescent tail fin for
   pushing a large amount of water backward with a small velocity
   difference. Together with a streamlined forward-enlarged thin/high body
   and forward-biased dorsal fin enclosing sizable muscles as the power
   source, the swordfish can thus achieve unimaginably high propulsion
   efficiency and an awesome maximum speed of 130 km/h as the speed
   champion at sea. This paper presents the innovative concepts of
   ``kidnapped airfoils{''} and ``circulating horsepower{''} using a vivid
   neat-digit model to illustrate the swordfish's superior swimming
   strategy. The body and tail work like two nimble deformable airfoils
   tightly linked to use their lift forces in a mutually beneficial manner.
   Moreover, they use sensitive rostrum/lateral-line sensors to detect
   upcoming/ambient water pressure and attain the best attack angle to
   capture the body lift power aided by the forward-biased dorsal fin to
   compensate for most of the water resistance power. This strategy can
   thus enhance the propulsion efficiency greatly to easily exceed an
   astonishing 500\%. Meanwhile, this amazing synergy of force/beauty also
   solves the perplexity of dolphin's Gray paradox lasting for more than 70
   years and gives revelations for panoramic fascinating future studies.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the results of an international study of creative
   industry policies and strategies, based on a survey of public-sector
   creative city initiatives and plans and their underlying rationales. As
   well as this survey and an accompanying literature review, interviews
   were carried out with senior policy-makers and intermediaries from
   Europe, North America, Africa and south-east Asia. The paper considers
   the scope and scale of so-called new-industrial clusters in local
   cultural and creative quarters and sub-regional creative hubs, which are
   the subject of policy interventions and public-private investment. The
   semantic and symbolic expansion of the cultural industries and their
   concentration in once-declining urban and former industrial districts,
   to the creative industries, and now to the knowledge and experience
   economy, is revealed in economic, sectoral and spatial terms. Whilst
   policy convergence and emulation are evident, manifested by the
   promotion of creative spaces and industry clusters and versions of the
   digital media and science city, this is driven by a meta-analysis of
   growth in the new economy, but one that is being achieved by old
   industrial economic interventions and policy rationales. These are being
   used to justify the redevelopment of former and residual industrial
   zones, with cities utilising the creative quarter/knowledge hub as a
   panacea to implement broader city expansion and regeneration plans.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past years, more and more attention has been paid to artificial
   life research. The main object of artificial life research is to explore
   how to control the environments in which the digital organisms imitating
   natural life, under complicated competition and evolutionary conditions,
   develop their own wisdom, which can then be used to solve the problems
   in the real world. While most of the current researches applied one or
   another artificial life method to solve real problems, the fundamental
   mechanism of the emerging process of artificial life is seldom
   addressed. The research works on genetic algorithms, although bearing
   fruitful results, could only be deemed as constituting a basic stage in
   the process of artificial life development. This study proposes a new
   method of employing artificial life, to complement the contents of the
   research of mindless intelligence, which is regarded as a bridge linking
   genetic algorithms to general artificial life. And two important
   concepts, key manipulating parameters and contribution function in its
   context, are proposed to expand the mindless intelligence applications,
   in order to pave the way for the optimal design of an artificial life
   method, in an attempt to fill the conceptual gap between genetic
   algorithms and artificial life., and consequently clarifying the
   artificial life mechanism. As a case study we applied these innovative
   methods to solve an open problem: the Tower of Hanoi, to attest to the
   feasibility of our approach, and we have achieved satisfactory results.}},

Abstract = {{Digital learner portfolios are of growing importance in higher education
   as the sector seeks new teaching-learning-assessment methods which
   promote students' autonomy as managers of their own virtual learning
   environment. The purpose of this study was to analyse descriptively the
   undergraduate students' perceptions, attitudes and behaviour when using
   an eportfolio to support their learning and assessment in practice based
   courses at two traditional Spanish universities. The participants were
   88 students, who were studying through a blended learning mode. Data
   were collected through questionnaires: a computer experience survey,
   another which examined the psychological, pedagogical and technological
   dimensions of eportfolios use. Further, an individual overall reflection
   was obtained from each student to help gain an understanding of their
   experiences of using the eportfolio. A mixed-method analysis was applied
   in order to study the impact of this technological innovation on
   students and their satisfaction. The results showed that the students
   had positive opinions and self-efficiency through the eportfolio as a
   tool to manage their learning and assessment during a semester.
   especially from the second month of use. However, the expected impact on
   their learning was not so significant. Nevertheless, the students
   emphasised that the eportfolio was valuable as a personal developmental
   learning tool. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent legislation in New Zealand has placed statutory obligations on
   its government organizations to introduce sound records management
   practices and to ensure long-term access to their digital records. To
   obtain a base level of knowledge on current digital preservation
   practices and on awareness of digital preservation issues, an online
   survey was conducted of the nation's government organizations in March
   2006. The survey. which achieved a response rate of 42.4\%, found that
   most organizations were knowledgeable about basic aspects of their
   digital resources but their awareness of digital preservation was
   generally low, and digital preservation activity was modest overall. To
   identify possible reasons for this situation, Rogers' (Diffusion of
   innovations. 5th ed. New York: Free Press. 2003) Diffusion of
   Innovations model is used to discuss digital preservation as an
   innovation and the level of readiness for digital preservation as the
   innovation's rate of adoption. The paper concludes by using Rogers'
   model as the basis for making recommendations aimed at helping the
   government's lead agencies to increase New Zealand's public sector
   readiness for digital preservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a well-proven imaging technique for
   remote sensing of the Earth. However, conventional SAR systems are not
   capable of fulfilling the increasing demands for improved spatial
   resolution and wider swath coverage. To overcome these inherent
   limitations, several innovative techniques have been suggested which
   employ multiple receive-apertures to gather additional information along
   the synthetic aperture. These digital beamforming (DBF) on receive
   techniques are reviewed with particular emphasis on the multi-aperture
   signal processing in azimuth and a multi-aperture reconstruction
   algorithm is presented that allows for the unambiguous recovery of the
   Doppler spectrum. The impact of Doppler aliasing is investigated and an
   analytic expression for the residual azimuth ambiguities is derived.
   Further, the influence of the processing on the signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) is analyzed, resulting in a pulse repetition frequency (PRF)
   dependent factor describing the SNR scaling of the multi-aperture
   beamforming network. The focus is then turned to a complete
   high-resolution Wide-swath SAR system design example which demonstrates
   the intricate connection between multi-aperture azimuth processing and
   the system architecture. In this regard, alternative processing
   approaches are compared with the multi-aperture reconstruction
   algorithm. In a next step, optimization strategies are discussed as
   pattern tapering, prebeamshaping-on-receive, and modified processing
   algorithms. In this context, the analytic expressions for both the
   residual ambiguities and the SNR scaling factor are generalized to
   cascaded beamforming networks. The suggested techniques can moreover be
   extended in many ways. Examples discussed are a combination with ScanSAR
   burst mode operation and the transfer to multistatic sparse array
   configurations.}},

   upgraded remarkably. In addition, some relevant experiments are
   conducted on this micro rapid prototyping system. In the experiment,
   light beam is projected onto a digital mirror device (DMD) chip
   {[}Hornbeck LJ. Digital light processing: A new MEMS-based display, 4th

   micro mirror. Meanwhile, by making use of zoom lens and pins array mask
   (PAM), the continuing pixels can be scattered. Moreover, in order to
   project scattered pixels onto the resin surface, the optical system is
   exploited. Additionally, by using a micro-stage, it is able to control
   the micro X-Y movement between the scattered pixels. Furthermore, this
   paper makes use of the spray coating technology to improve the build up
   capability of the overhand structures of the traditional deep dip
   liquid-type RP system. Finally, combining the fore-mentioned
   technologies, one can produce 3-D prototypes with overhand structures in
   higher resolution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a feasibility study for the implementation of a

   levels of 24 and 17 dBm in the lower and in the higher bands to maintain
   ACPR and EVM requirements below 33 dBc and 5\%, respectively. The
   conclusions drawn in the paper justify the design effort of this

Abstract = {{The article argues that, beyond the boundaries of activists and
   concerned citizens, the massive appropriation of the Internet techniques
   of self-publication and the social modes of interactions on the web,
   lead to the extension of the public sphere to the rank-and-file. It
   takes the position that civic culture is not homogeneous and that it is
   shaped by different social practices that we examine through three sets
   of digital public spheres. First, the rise of ``free speech{''} in
   professional journalistic practices on media websites expands to
   readers' voices (in forums, online surveys, readers' comments), while
   citizens' engagement in amateur grassroots journalism challenges both
   the professional practices and the ethics of journalism. Second, the
   lively political blogosphere demonstrates how personal opinions on
   public matters find their legitimacy in the interactive dialogue in and
   across networks and lead to the emergence of rank-and-file opinion
   leaders, while also presenting various pitfalls, such as the redundancy
   of a limited number of viewpoints. Third, the social and leisurely
   Internet usage of ordinary citizens leads them to confront political and
   public issues in a casual and random manner, which in turn leads them to
   discuss these matters occasionally in online or face-to-face settings.
   This trend is reinforced by the innovative creation of user-generated
   content, mixing text, sound, and video formats that are widely
   circulated on the web. The rise of new forms of political and social
   critique on the Internet and the sharing of common experiences in the
   electronic space results in novel mean of public engagement and
   contributes to the shaping of a new civic and social form.}},

Abstract = {{Digital end organs composed of hard, modified epidermis, generally
   referred to as claws, are present in mammals and reptiles as well as in
   several non-amniote taxa such as clawed salamanders and frogs, including
   Xenopus laevis. So far, only the claws and nails of mammals have been
   characterized extensively and the question of whether claws were present
   in the common ancestor of all extant tetrapods is as yet unresolved. To
   provide a basis for comparisons between amniote and non-amniote claws,
   we investigated the development, growth and ultrastructure of the
   epidermal component of the claws of X. laevis. Histological examination
   of developing claws of X. laevis shows that claw formation is initiated
   at the tip of the toe by the appearance of superficial cornified cells
   that are dark brown. Subsequent accumulation of new, proximally extended
   claw sheath corneocyte layers increases the length of the claw.
   Histological studies of adult claws show that proliferation of
   cornifying claw sheath cells occurs along the entire length of the
   claw-forming epidermis. Living epidermal cells that are converting into
   the cornified claw sheath corneocytes undergo a form of programmed cell
   death that is accompanied by degradation of nuclear DNA. Subsequently,
   the cytoplasm and the nuclear remnants acquire a brown colour by an
   as-yet unknown mechanism that is likely homologous to the colouration
   mechanism that occurs in other hard, cornified structures of amphibians
   such as nuptial pads and tadpole beaks. Transmission electron microscopy
   revealed that the cornified claw sheath consists of parallel layers of
   corneocytes with interdigitations being confined to intra-layer contacts
   and a cementing substance filling the intercorneocyte spaces. Together
   with recent reports that showed the main molecular components of amniote
   claws are absent in Xenopus, our data support the hypothesis that claws
   of amphibians likely represent clade-specific innovations,
   non-homologous to amniote claws.}},

Abstract = {{Initiated by the availability of digital signal processors and emergence
   of new applications, market demands for permanent magnet synchronous
   motors have been surging. As its back-emf is sinusoidal, the drive
   current should also be sinusoidal for reducing the torque ripple.
   However, in applications like hard disk drives, brushless direct current
   (BLDC) drive is adopted instead of sinusoidal drive for simplification.
   The adoption, however, comes at the expense of increased harmonics,
   losses, torque pulsations, and acoustics. In this paper, we propose a
   sensorless optimal sinusoidal BLDC drive. First and foremost, the
   derivation for an optimal sinusoidal drive is presented, and a power
   angle control scheme is proposed to achieve an optimal sinusoidal BLDC.
   The scheme maintains linear relationship between the motor speed and
   drive voltage. In an attempt to execute the sensorless drive, an
   innovative power angle measurement scheme is devised, which takes
   advantage of the freewheeling diodes and measures the power angle
   through the detection of diode voltage drops. The objectives as laid out
   will be presented and discussed in this paper, supported by derivations,
   simulations, and experimental results. The proposed scheme is
   straightforward, brings about the benefits of sensorless sinusoidal
   drive, negates the need for current sensors by utilizing the
   freewheeling diodes, and does not incur additional cost. (C) 2009

Title = {{Enrichment of land-cover polygons with eco-climatic information derived
   from MODIS NDVI imagery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},

Abstract = {{The FAO land-cover classification system (LCCS) represents an innovative
   approach to standardizing and harmonizing land-cover classifications
   based on remote sensing data. The thematic information considered by the
   LCCS, however, is intrinsically related to vegetation physiognomy and
   does not report important eco-climatic features. Our aim is to develop a
   methodology to enrich LCCS maps with information on vegetation
   productivity and phenology derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
   data.
   The LCCS has recently been applied in East Africa by the Africover
   project. The proposed methodology is developed and tested in Tanzania
   using MODIS NDVI data for a 5-year period (2001-05).
   Annual NDVI profiles of Africover polygons were extracted from MODIS
   imagery. These profiles, composed of 23 NDVI values per year, were
   averaged over the study period, purified for possible land-cover errors
   and converted into a more manageable format composed of 24 half-month
   values. The resulting NDVI profiles were first analysed visually and
   then evaluated statistically against rainfall measurements taken at 12
   Tanzanian stations. The steps involved were as follows: NDVI values were
   aggregated on a monthly basis and represented with a one-digit integer
   to obtain an extended code; a subset of parameters describing vegetation
   development and phenology was identified, thus obtaining a restricted
   codification; and finally, the information loss resulting from both the
   extended and restricted codification was evaluated with respect to the
   original NDVI profiles.
   NDVI profiles of different Africover classes can differ in mean values
   but tend to have a similar shape, linked to the seasonality of local
   vegetation. Both NDVI annual averages and seasonal variations are
   strictly dependent on rainfall patterns, particularly in arid zones. The
   tested codifications effectively summarize the eco-climatic information
   contained in the polygon NDVI profiles, with the extended and restricted
   codifications retaining > 90\% and 80\% of such information,
   respectively.
   The proposed methodology is capable of enriching LCCS polygons with
   eco-climatic information derived from MODIS NDVI data. Such information
   is related to vegetation development and seasonality, and can be
   efficiently condensed at various levels of detail.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, cultural heritage is under threat and danger (pollution,
   natural disasters, wars, etc.). In this domain, cultural heritage
   management (CHM) as the art, vocation and practice of managing cultural
   heritage resources and as a multi-discipline research area has a vital
   role. In recent years, the innovations, improvements and rapid advances
   in traditional and geographic (GIS) databases, design computing, digital
   architecture and archaeology, imaging sensors and scanners, computer
   modeling software, haptic equipments and e-learning technology, as well
   as the affordability and availability of many powerful graphics
   workstations make metadata and 3D modeling techniques for CHM with
   e-learning and haptic rendering (virtual reality) functionality
   feasible. This paper addresses the application research issue of
   incorporating metadata and modeling in a CHM case study and discusses
   the related e-learning functionality. So, in this article, a practical
   project is used to demonstrate the functionality and the performance of
   the proposed 3D modeling metadata based CHM methodology. In particular,
   the processing steps from image acquisition to the 3D geometric and
   semantic description of the Galerius Palace ``Octagonon{''}
   (Thessaloniki, Greece) in a 3D digital environment are presented. Also,
   emphasis is put on documenting the new term 3D modeling metadata for CHM
   and on discussing as an open issue the concept personalized eleanzing
   CHM scenarios. The proposed methodology has 10(-2) modeling accuracy
   (i.e. 1\% relative inaccuracy) and it is of interest for archaeology,
   architecture, virtual reality, e-learning, e-culture and virtual
   tourism. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the impact of investments in modernization and
   innovation on productivity in a sample of firms in the global pulp and
   paper industry. This industry has traditionally accounted for
   significant amounts of employment and capital investment in North
   America and Europe. In contrast to much of the existing literature which
   focuses on the impact of R\&D and patents on firms' performance and
   productivity, we examine data on actual investment transactions in four
   main areas: (i) mechanical, (ii) chemicals, (iii) monitoring devices and
   (iv) information technology. We find that firms that implemented a
   greater number of investment transactions in modernization achieved
   higher productivity, and these estimated quantitative effects are
   greater than the impact of standard innovation variables such as patents
   and R\&D. Investment transactions in the information technology and
   digital monitoring devices imparted a particularly noticeable boost to
   productivity. These results are obtained after controlling for other
   firm-specific variables such as capital intensity or mergers and
   acquisitions. Thus, firms' decisions to undertake investments in
   modernization and incremental innovations appear to be critical for
   achieving gains in productivity, compounding to form meaningful
   differences in performance, productivity and competitive position across
   firms in the longer run. For some of the traditional industries like
   pulp and paper, R\&D and patents seem to be particularly poor indicators
   of innovation and, more generally, how firms go about achieving gains in
   productivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Can animation bring life to the computer? Can the computer take
   animation to a new horizon extending from cinema and visual art? This
   article starts with a scrutiny of the conventional definition of
   animation and its connection to the continuum of liveliness, followed by
   an examination of the two furthest points on that scale: lively
   movement, which is spiritual; and inorganic movement, which is
   functional. The author shows that, in the digital age, movement of
   various degrees of liveliness can be significant and meaningful through
   a wide array of motor-sensory functions. This brings about a new notion
   of materiality, which constructs an innovative meaning of animation. The
   author then argues that, when combined with the unique functions of the
   computer, animation can find a shortcut between the two extremes of
   liveliness: spirituality and functionality. Therefore, the field of
   animation could benefit from an expansion of its digital attributes.
   Finally, the author discusses a corpus of artefacts created in different
   historical periods and different media that exemplify the
   spiritual-functional loop.}},

Abstract = {{In order to ensure good video quality and location-independent access to
   multimedia content, digital video broadcasting-satellite service to
   handhelds (DVB-SH) takes advantage of several innovative techniques. The
   major one is the forward error correction (FEC) scheme implemented at
   the link layer called multiprotocol encapsulation-inter-burst FEC
   (MPE-IFEC). MPE-IFEC supports reception in situations of long duration
   erasure spanning several consecutive time slice bursts (lasting several
   seconds) due to characteristics of the land mobile satellite channel
   which are easily hampered by obstacles such as trees, buildings, or
   overpasses. However, when deep signal fades last for larger durations,
   the MPE-IFEC correction capacity is insufficient and MPE-IFEC fails,
   causing a service interruption. In this paper, we propose a repair
   mechanism and a suitable architecture for real-time streaming service
   error handling with reduced degrading effects such as picture freeze,
   video frame degradation, and video lag. Based on an analytical model of
   the performance of the MPE-IFEC, an iterative algorithm is proposed
   where the probability of recovery of lost bursts is computed and
   updated. The proposed algorithm controls the retransmission request on
   the cellular network. Simulation results show that by recovering only
   some specific lost bursts ilia the cellular path, the quality of
   experience here expressed in terms of burst error rate is improved. (C)

Abstract = {{Much has been written about the need to address the requirements of the
   user when designing information appliances (mobile phones, MP3 players,
   personal digital assistants (PDAs) and so on), but less is written about
   the challenges designers face in bringing this about. Using case
   studies, this paper will examine six of the problems facing design teams
   in consultancies, Small- to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and
   multinationals tasked with the design of complex computer embedded
   products. A case study of the successful implementation of a
   technology-based product is presented. The factors that make it an
   example of good practice and the ways in which the designers have
   overcome the six challenges are examined. In conclusion, the challenges
   for the successful design and development of information appliances are
   summarized and ways in which they might be addressed discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Plant phenology relates strongly to primary productivity and the energy
   that enters into ecological food webs, and thus is vital in
   understanding ecosystem function and the effects of climate and climate
   change. The manual collection of phenological data is labor-intensive
   and not easily scalable, thus the ability to quantify leaf flush and
   other parameters at many locations requires innovative new methodologies
   such as the use of visible light digital cameras. improved imaging
   performance was obtained by using a cabled, mobile camera system that
   allowed a repeated image census of branches of Rhododendron occidentale
   in the understory along a 30 m transect during leaf flush. Automatic
   division of acquired images into areas of interest (leaves) and
   background for calculating leaf area was accomplished by thresholding
   images in different color spaces. Transformation of the color space into
   the hue, saturation, and luminance (HSL) color space before thresholding
   resulted in a mean RMS error of 21.2 cm(2) compared to hand-counts of
   leaf area. Thresholding in the native red, green, and blue (RGB) color
   space to isolate leaves resulted in a larger error, as did using
   algebraic combinations of the color components or color ratios. Relating
   physiological function to images, as for sap flow for branches of R.
   occidentale, indicates that the greening and calculated leaf area of a
   species as detected by imagers requires additional meteorological sensor
   data for interpretation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A process-independent adaptive bandwidth spread-spectrum clock generator
   (SSCG) with digitally controlled self-calibration techniques is
   proposed, By adaptively calibrating the VCO gain (K(nu)) and charge-pump
   (CP) current over C (I(CP)/C), the SSCG can realize not only adaptive
   bandwidth but also process independence at each operating frequency. The
   innovative point is the adaptive bandwidth control using K, and I(CP)/C
   calibration. This control enabled a test chip to keep a sharp triangular
   SSC profile while operating over a wide frequency range (125 to 1250
   MHz). The variations of VCO gain and CP current are reduced to one third
   those of the conventional architecture. At 1250 Mbps (625 MHz) the
   reduction of spectrum peak amplitude is 18.6 dB which is 2.3 dB better
   than the reduction obtained without calibration.}},

Abstract = {{Three innovative solutions for contactless angle detection are described
   and compared. They use a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor bridge
   which detects the direction of the magnetic field of a rotatable magnet
   placed near the sensor. The three solutions differ in the CMOS
   Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) employed as sensor signal
   conditioning interface, leading to different cost-performance tradeoffs.
   The first ASIC is all-analog, being the simplest and cheapest one. The
   second ASIC is a mixed-mode solution providing a pulse width modulated
   (PWM) output, and its main innovation is the use of a compact
   piecewise-linear ADC to compensate for the sensor nonlinearity. This
   way, linearization and A/D conversion are performed simultaneously,
   saving power and silicon area. The third ASIC is mostly digital and
   fully programmable, being the most flexible and accurate (albeit costly)
   solution. It incorporates as main novelties a new offset compensation
   technique that shares most of required circuits with the
   successive-approximation ADC, and a new combinational circuit for
   linearization. Measurement results for the three implementations are
   provided, and their performance tradeoffs discussed.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS}},

Abstract = {{Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) can be summarized as
   follows: it inherits from proportional-integral-derivative (PID) the
   quality that makes it such a success: the error driven, rather than
   model-based, control law; it takes from modern control theory its best
   offering: the state observer; it embraces the power of nonlinear
   feedback and puts it to full use; it is a useful digital control
   technology developed out of an experimental platform rooted in computer
   simulations. ADRC is made possible only when control is taken as an
   experimental science, instead of a mathematical one. It is motivated by
   the ever increasing demands from industry that requires the control
   technology to move beyond PID, which has dominated the practice for over
   80 years. Specifically, there are four areas of weakness in PID that we
   strive to address: 1) the error computation; 2) noise degradation in the
   derivative control; 3) oversimplification and the loss of performance in
   the control law in the form of a linear weighted sum; and 4)
   complications brought by the integral control. Correspondingly, we
   propose four distinct measures: 1) a simple differential equation as a
   transient trajectory generator; 2) a noise-tolerant tracking
   differentiator; 3) the nonlinear control laws; and 4) the concept and
   method of total disturbance estimation and rejection. Together, they
   form a new set of tools and a new way of control design. Times and again
   in experiments and on factory floors, ADRC proves to be a capable
   replacement of PID with unmistakable advantage in performance and
   practicality, providing solutions to pressing engineering problems of
   today. With the new outlook and possibilities that ADRC represents, we
   further believe that control engineering may very well break the hold of
   classical PID and enter a new era, an era that brings back the spirit of
   innovations.}},

Abstract = {{Many firms are transforming themselves from vertically integrated
   organizations into digitally enabled organizations. As firms become more
   innovative in their technical infrastructures and more competitive in
   their respective industries/verticals, their extended enterprise models
   include using their previous enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   investments as foundations for prioritizing additions and for
   longer-term strategies. The key issue for many firms is how to leverage
   their ERP implementation to become better partners and collaborators by
   enabling digital options to exploit business opportunities. This paper
   ascertains the contextual conditions under which ERP system
   implementations have the greatest impact on intention to adopt digital
   options. Using empirical data, it finds that the impact of ERP
   implementation on digital-options adoption intention is moderated by a
   firm's digital-resource readiness. For information systems (IS)
   practice, the study suggests that firms should view ERP divisibility as
   an option value generator for supporting new customers and revenue
   opportunities. For IS research, it relates digital-options theory to
   specific measurable constructs and to the firm's digital-resource
   readiness. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}},

   784-795, 2009. First published January 8, 2009;
   doi:10.1152/japplphysiol. 90376.2008.-A novel, standardized geometry of
   the human nasal cavity was created by aligning and processing 30 sets of
   computed tomography (CT) scans of nasal airways of healthy subjects.
   Digital three-dimensional (3-D) geometries of the 60 single human nasal
   cavities (30 right and 30 mirrored left cavities) were generated from
   the CT scans and measurements of physical parameters of each single
   nasal cavity were performed. A methodology was developed to scale,
   orient, and align the nasal geometries, after which 2-D digital coronal
   cross-sectional slices were generated. With the use of an innovative
   image processing algorithm, median cross-sectional geometries were
   created to match median physical parameters while retaining the unique
   geometric features of the human nasal cavity. From these idealized 2-D
   images, an original 3-D standardized median human nasal cavity was
   created. This new standardized geometry was compared against the
   original geometries of all subjects as well as limited existing data
   from the literature. The new model has potential for use as a geometric
   standard in future experimental and numerical studies of deposition of
   inhaled aerosols, as well as for use as a reference during diagnosis of
   unhealthy patients. The specific procedure developed could also be
   applied to build standard nasal geometries for different identifiable
   groups within the larger population.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to analyze how a firm responds to a
   challenge from a transformational technology that poses a threat to its
   historical business model. We extend Christensen's theory of disruptive
   technologies to undertake this analysis. The paper makes two
   contributions: the first is to extend theory and the second is to learn
   from the example of Kodak's response to digital photography. Our
   extensions to existing theory include considerations of organizational
   change, and the culture of the organization. Information technology has
   the potential to transform industries through the creation of new
   digital products and services. Kodak's middle managers, culture and
   rigid, bureaucratic structure hindered a fast response to new technology
   which dramatically changed the process of capturing and sharing images.
   Film is a physical, chemical product, and despite a succession of new
   CEOs. Kodak's middle managers were unable to make a transition to think
   digitally. Kodak has experienced a nearly 80\% decline in its workforce,
   loss of market share, a tumbling stock price, and significant internal
   turmoil as a result of its failure to take advantage of this new
   technology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Digital elevation models (DEM) are becoming increasingly important as
   tools in hydrological research and water resources management. Since
   error and uncertainty are inherently associated with spatial data, a
   complete evaluation of a DEM is of utmost importance before it is put
   into subsequent analysis. The present paper offers an innovative
   approach for quality assessment of contour interpolated DEMs of
   different resolutions. Five most frequently cited interpolation methods
   viz., TIN with linear interpolation, Inverse Distance Weighing, Thin
   Plate Spline, Ordinary Kriging and TOPOGRID were selected for gridding
   of contours at five different resolutions i.e., 30m, 45m, 60m, 75m and
   90m. In order to compare the quality of interpolated DEMs, a qualitative
   and quantitative evaluation of inter-polated DEMs for their vertical,
   horizontal and shape accuracy were carried out. It was found that
   different interpolation methods produced DEMs with different levels of
   artifacts. The analyses of vertical accuracy suggested that the
   variations were not pronounced in nature. However, the quantitative
   comparisons for horizontal and shape accuracy showed that there was a
   high level of disparity with significant differences among the
   interpolated DEMs.}},

Abstract = {{A large amount of literature provides empirical evidence in support of
   Marshall or Jacobs theories regarding the specialization or diversity
   effects on the economic performance of regions. This paper surveys these
   scholarly contributions and summarizes their results according to their
   similarities and differences. The reviewed empirical work presents a
   diverse picture of possible conditions and circumstances under which
   each kind of externalities could be at work. The wide breadth of
   findings is generally not explained by differences in the strength of
   agglomeration forces across industries, countries or time periods, but
   by measurement and methodological issues. The levels of industrial and
   geographical aggregation together with the choice of performance
   measures, specialization and diversity indicators are the main causes
   for the lack of resolution in the debate. The 3-digit industrial
   classification seems to be the level at which MAR and Jacobs effects are
   undistinguishable from one another, and this is often exacerbated by a
   high level of geographical aggregation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This work develops a new current-mode mixed signal Complementary
   Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) imager, which can capture images and
   simultaneously produce vehicle lane maps. The adopted lane detection
   algorithm, which was modified to be compatible with hardware
   requirements, can achieve a high recognition rate of up to approximately
   96\% under various weather conditions. Instead of a Personal Computer
   (PC) based system or embedded platform system equipped with expensive
   high performance chip of Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) or
   Digital Signal Processor (DSP), the proposed imager, without extra
   Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) circuits to transform signals, is a
   compact, lower cost key-component chip. It is also an innovative
   component device that can be integrated into intelligent automotive lane
   departure systems. The chip size is 2,191.4 x 2,389.8 mu m, and the
   package uses 40 pin Dual-In-Package (DIP). The pixel cell size is 18.45
   x 21.8 mu m and the core size of photodiode is 12.45 x 9.6 mu m; the

Abstract = {{The history of television production and technology has been a
   continuing process of change and improvement. Changes in technology and
   the production processes span the time from the early days when
   programming was either live or film-based, continuing through the
   changes to videotape, color from monochrome, from analog to digital
   through to today's solid state storage and high-definition production
   processes. Throughout most of this change and innovation, the production
   process was primarily a linear, serial process and the consumer
   experience largely consisted of a push-based process, involving
   ``appointment{''} viewing on a single type of viewing device. The
   current transition to networked, file-based workflows promises to
   achieve greater flexibility and efficiency to address changes in
   business and consumer expectations in the media space.}},

Abstract = {{OBJCETIVES To present, in an experimental study, an assessment of
   innovative digital fluoroscopy systems with three-dimensional (3D)
   reconstruction for use in endourologic applications.
   METHODS The experiment was performed in a pig model. We used 5 pigs. An
   obstructive uropathy model was created in the right kidney to dilate the
   urinary tract for group 1. Group 2 consisted of the nondilated left
   kidney. After selecting the tract on the 3D image, the lower caliceal
   group was punctured in the 2 kidneys under fluoroscopic control, to
   assess the efficiency of the 3D reconstruction when selecting the renal
   calix to be punctured.
   RESULTS The 3D reconstruction system allowed us to obtain reconstruct
   the pelvis in three dimensions, isolated as the pelvis and renal
   parenchyma, as well as the adjacent bony relationships. In this study,
   the Success rate was 100\% for locating the selected renal calix.
   CONCLUSIONS With this 3D reconstruction system, we were able to obtain a
   series of images that allowed for the study of the Volume of the kidney,
   perfectly determining its renal calix distribution in the operating
   room. This enabled LIS to determine the precise delineation of the
   target calix. We, therefore, consider this new urologic application of
   fluoroscopy very useful in surgical planning for antegrade access of the
   upper urinary tract. UROLOGY 73: 649-652, 2009. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an innovative, non-intrusive method for mapping
   waterway characteristics in riverine areas. The technique uses
   photogrammetry to provide quantitative information about the dry area in
   the vicinity of the waterways (banks and floodplain) and image
   processing algorithms to characterize the flow. Riverside images of a
   riverine area are decomposed into quasi-planar areas and ortho-rectified
   and re-assembled to obtain a panoramic ortho-view of the area of
   interest. Morphological features of interest (such as river bank
   positions, flood plain edges, mud deposits, vegetation and erosion
   patterns) are then identified on the ortho-view and mapped digitally.
   Image sequences of the river flow are recorded, allowing a surface
   velocity analysis to be obtained through Large Scale Particle Image
   Velocimetry (LSPIV). Finally, the mapped elements and the surface
   velocities are displayed together in a GIS-like visualization. Through
   the presentation of a case study of a flood event at a culvert site,
   this paper demonstrates the capability of the technique to monitor
   characteristics of waterways over time. The method is inexpensive (a
   conventional video or digital camera can be used), fast and requires
   minimum preparation. It can be applied in such important river-related
   research areas as morphodynamic and sediment transport studies. It also
   fosters an improved understanding of the coupling between the river and
   its banks, which is essential for river restoration and eco-habitat
   studies. The present methodology is readily available for implementation
   in routine bridge inspections, fitted with an easy-to-use graphical
   interface. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative approach is introduced to form virtual transmitting and

   coding waveforms from the antenna elements and digitally processing of
   their echoes at the receiver. Multiple virtual transmitting-receiving
   beams can be formed simultaneously by employing an equal number of
   beamforming filters without increasing transmitting power or antenna
   gain or resolution loss. The virtually formed antenna beams can provide
   equivalent antenna gains and spatial resolutions as the conventional
   phased arrays of the same size. Because the actual antenna radiation
   pattern can be made almost isotropic, the new system has low probability
   of intercept (LPI) property. With both transmitting and receiving beams
   virtually implemented through digital filtering, costly radiation phase
   shift used in phased arrays is not needed for beam scanning in the
   proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative laboratory methodology for an introductory digital design
   course is presented. Instead of having traditional lab experiences,
   where students have to come to school classrooms, a ``lab at home{''}
   concept is proposed. Students perform real experiments in their own
   homes, using hardware kits specially developed for this purpose. They
   analyze given problems, design the appropriate solutions, and test the
   actual circuit in a distance learning context. Four course offerings
   were successfully accomplished with this methodology, and more than 65
   kits with a programmable logic board were given to groups of students
   for the whole semester in each of these. An opinion survey showed that
   the experience was very successful among students. Laboratory learning
   objectives are analyzed to validate this experience. This paper also
   discusses scalability and different students' work evaluation
   approaches, in order to facilitate the application of this methodology
   to other contexts. Moreover, the ``lab at home{''} is shown to be very
   suitable for high enrollment courses and easy to scale, providing actual
   hardware platforms for students at an affordable cost for the
   institution.}},

Title = {{Exact Feature Extraction Using Finite Rate of Innovation Principles With
   an Application to Image Super-Resolution}},

Abstract = {{The accurate registration of multiview images is of central importance
   in many advanced image processing applications. Image super-resolution,
   for example, is a typical application where the quality of the
   super-resolved image is degrading as registration errors increase.
   Popular registration methods are often based on features extracted from
   the acquired images. The accuracy of the registration is in this case
   directly related to the number of extracted features and to the
   precision at which the features are located: images are best registered
   when many features are found with a good precision. However, in
   low-resolution images, only a few features can be extracted and often
   with a poor precision. By taking a sampling perspective, we propose in
   this paper new methods for extracting features in low-resolution images
   in order to develop efficient registration techniques. We consider, in
   particular, the sampling theory of signals with finite rate of
   innovation {[}10] and show that some features of interest for
   registration can be retrieved perfectly in this framework, thus allowing
   an exact registration. We also demonstrate through simulations that the
   sampling model which enables the use of finite rate of innovation
   principles is well suited for modeling the acquisition of images by a
   camera. Simulations of image registration and image super-resolution of
   artificially sampled images are first presented, analyzed and compared
   to traditional techniques. We finally present favorable experimental
   results of super-resolution of real images acquired by a digital camera
   available on the market.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to predict and map the regional distribution
   of the trabecular architecture and the material properties of the
   glenoid and to estimate the predominant loading condition on the glenoid
   through the mapping. The morphological and material characteristics of
   the glenoid were investigated by analyzing digitized trabecular bone
   images obtained from twelve cadaver scapula specimens. The morphological
   and material characteristics computed from the cadaver specimens show
   that the predominant loading on the glenoid generally occurs during
   Shoulder movement, which produces forces directed toward the posterior
   aspect of the bare region. This study is innovative in its detailed
   mapping of the morphological and material characteristics of the glenoid
   and its pioneering approach used to estimate the loading pattern acting
   on the glenoid through the mapping.}},

Abstract = {{For decades, nonprofit organizations have played a vital role in
   educational technology innovation. Sesame Street, online high schools,
   probeware for science and mathematics teaching and learning, and many
   other innovations now widely used both in and outside schools were
   developed by nonprofits, including not only universities but also
   independent R\&D organizations, such as the Concord Consortium. Within
   the federal budget, there has been a decade-long trend to reduce both
   the size and number of awards made specifically for innovation in
   educational technology. Small grants, including those for basic
   research, are less likely to lead to transformative innovations in
   teaching and learning than larger, targeted awards for innovation. At a
   time when digital tools continue to grow more useful and powerful, and
   when larger numbers of schools are using them effectively, it is time
   for federal agencies to focus additional resources on educational
   technology innovation.}},

Abstract = {{A recent trend in technological innovation is towards the development of
   increasingly multifunctional and complex products to be used with in
   rich socio-cultural contexts such as the high-end office, the digital
   home, and professional or personal healthcare. One important consequence
   of the development of strongly innovative products is a growing market
   uncertainty regarding `if', `how', and `when' users can and will adopt
   such products. Often, it is not even clear to what extent these products
   are understood and interacted with in the intended manner. The mentioned
   problems have already become an evident concerti in the field, where
   there is a significant rise in the numbers of seemingly sound products
   being complained about, signaling a lack of soft reliability. lit this
   paper, we position soft reliability as a growing and critical industrial
   problem, whose solution requires new academic expertise from various
   disciplines. We illustrate potential root causes for soft reliability
   problems, such as discrepancy between the perceptions of users and
   designers. We discuss the necessary approach to effectively capture
   subjective feedback data from actual users, e.g. when they contact call
   centers. Furthermore, we present a novel observation and analysis
   approach that enables insight into actual product usage, and outline
   opportunities for combining such objective data with the subjective
   feedback provided by users. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Social influence determines to a large extent what we adopt and when we
   adopt it. This is just as true in the digital domain as it is in real
   life, and has become of increasing importance due to the deluge of
   user-created content on the Internet. In this paper, we present an
   empirical study of user-to-user content transfer occurring in the
   context of a time-evolving social network in Second Life, a massively
   multiplayer virtual world.
   We identify and model social influence based on the change in adoption
   rate following the actions of one's friends and find that the social
   network plays a significant role in the adoption of content. Adoption
   rates quicken as the number of friends adopting increases and this
   effect varies with the connectivity of a particular user. We further
   find that sharing among friends occurs more rapidly than sharing among
   strangers, but that content that diffuses primarily through social
   influence tends to have a more limited audience. Finally, we examine the
   role of individuals, finding that some play a more active role in
   distributing content than others, but that these influencers are
   distinct from the early adopters.}},

Abstract = {{CZT pixel detectors show interesting capabilities for SPECT imaging.
   They combine a high energy resolution, good detection efficiency and a
   very good intrinsic spatial resolution. As these performances are
   superior to those obtained with scintillation detectors, a resulting
   improvement of image quality is expected. However, SPECT imaging
   performances are mostly limited by the collimation geometry and CZT
   based imagers cannot bring a significant gain without a global system
   redesign. Recently, several innovating ideas have been introduced and
   new systems have been developed in order to overcome these limitations.
   We previously proposed an architecture named ``HiSens{''} with the
   objective to use more completely the information given by the detector
   to improve image quality. We presented some encouraging simulation
   results showing that a good knowledge of the interaction location inside
   of the detector could help to improve image. We present here an
   experimental study using a dedicated test bench called ``Minigami{''}.
   It includes a monolithic pixel detector associated with integrated
   charge preamplifiers; and 16 fully digital processing channels. Wide
   images are obtained by scanning the object with a translation table.
   Signal processing circuits extract relevant parameters relative to each
   photon. These data are saved to a list mode file. Afterwards acquisition
   files are post-processed in order to build spectra and images. In this
   paper, we describe steps involved in the image construction and
   solutions used to compensate for various detector non-idealities.
   Finally, we will discuss image characterization and present some
   results. Results show that CZT intrinsic spatial resolution enables to
   retrieve additional information and allows to shift the traditional
   trade-off between efficiency and spatial resolution.}},

Abstract = {{In order to achieve a dynamic spectrum management as in cognitive radio,
   the first task is to sense the spectrum holes. This paper is trying to
   make a contribution in the challenge of spectrum sensing for cognitive
   radios. We consider a case in which the local sensors involved in the
   spectrum sensing are aware of the primary signal's digital modulation.
   As a case of study the primary user's signal is assumed to have a binary
   phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, we therefore concentrate only on
   the presence detection of a BPSK signal. This work presents an
   innovative solution for presence detection of BPSK signals, in additive
   white Gaussian noise. We state the problem as a binary hypothesis test
   considering the noise variance, complex signal amplitude, and the symbol
   code sequence unknown. A new and simple search method for solving the
   maximization problem involved in deriving the Generalized Likelihood
   Ratio (GLR) test is proposed. We evaluate the performance of the
   detector based on our simple search scheme and compare it with that of
   the exact GLR obtained via complete search and also with the previous
   works. The simulation results show that our proposed detector performs
   just as good as the exact GLR detector, with much less computational
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{One of the promises of Digital Television is the possibility of creating
   interactive and innovative television services, like catch-up TV
   However, these services need external resources, coming from the
   channels themselves or from manual annotation. In this paper, a system
   for automatically building a Catch-up TV service from the available EPG
   and the broadcasted TV stream, is presented. The system combines several
   content-based techniques for extracting exact program boundaries from
   the TV stream. Traditional commercial detection and recognition methods
   are used, as well as novel techniques to detect and classify
   repetitions. Identification of the TV program is then performed by
   matching the detected boundaries with the EPG. Extensive experiments on
   three weeks of TV assess the effectiveness of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the 3D restitution of large and incomplete
   thousand-year-old sculptures belonging to the Spanish Museum of Roman
   Art (MNAR, Museo Nacional de Arte Romano). Roman sculptures are
   difficult to synthesize because of the complex geometry of the clothes
   that the characters usually wear and the glows that the marble causes.
   Therefore, the main purpose of this work is to develop efficient 3D
   digitalization techniques which provide high-quality synthesized models.
   For this, several researching aspects are undertaken: digitalization of
   occluded parts, viewpoints selection, surface matching, color
   processing, holes detection and filling, etc. Another important aspect
   which has been dealt with in the paper concerns the promotion of
   multi-discipline research that encourages the social benefits and the
   application of its results in the cultural heritage field. This paper
   shows the current problems, innovations and results as well as states
   future works and developments over the following years.}},

Abstract = {{From innovation triggered by user virtual communities to remote surgery
   and new financial instruments, the creative power of individuals is
   being fostered at proportions previously unseen. The main driver
   enabling such a pace of innovation, scientific progress, and user
   adoption is the Digital Revolution. One consequence is that
   interrelationships between science, technology and society are
   increasing in complexity and harder to understand.
   COST Foresight 2030 is an initiative encompassing a set of events
   designed to explore a multi-disciplinary vision for a future permeated
   and shaped by the digital revolution. The first of such events is a
   brain-storming workshop on Computer and Communication Sciences and
   Technologies, whose objective is to identify key technologies available
   by year 2030 and the corresponding benefits for Individuals, Society,
   and the World, in terms of Devices, Systems, and Services. The outcomes
   of this workshop will serve as the basis for experts in other scientific
   areas to envision how challenges in their respective disciplines will be
   tackled when such technologies are available. Such outcomes will be
   presented at the IEEE VITAE conference.}},

Abstract = {{There are rapid technological changes occurring globally with
   differential effects on gender. This paper explores emerging gender
   issues in this environment. The genders have different intentions and
   experiences of computer usage in training and learning. Accessibilities
   of computers itself is a big dream still in many places. Women
   empowerment can be achieved through gaining knowledge, ideas, culture,
   and passions.
   The computer skills will allow them to productively transform knowledge
   and information into innovative products and services This will help
   gender to lead both themselves and their nation in competitiveness, and
   increased wealth and prosperity. Knowledge and information are the most
   essential concepts which will lead to empowerment of women The advances
   of science and technology requires a whole new set of skills.
   This paper describes how information and knowledge-driven society would
   help in bringing empowerment of women. Once Women Are empowered, then
   they can compete in a global knowledge based economy.}},

Abstract = {{Explosive growth in photovoltaic markets has fueled new creative
   approaches that promise to cut costs and improve reliability of system
   components. However, market demands require rapid development of these
   new and innovative technologies in order to compete with more
   established products and capture market share. Oftentimes diagnostics
   that assist in R\&D do not exist or have not been applied due to the
   innovative nature of the proposed products. Some diagnostics such as IR
   imaging, electroluminescence, light IV, dark IV, x-rays, and ultrasound
   have been employed in the past and continue to serve in development of
   new products, however, innovative products with new materials, unique
   geometries, and previously unused manufacturing processes require
   additional or improved test capabilities. This fast-track product
   development cycle requires diagnostic capabilities to provide the
   information that confirms the integrity of manufacturing techniques and
   provides the feedback that can spawn confidence in process control,
   reliability and performance. This paper explores the use of digital
   radiography and computed tomography (CT) with other diagnostics to
   support photovoltaic R\&D and manufacturing applications.}},

Abstract = {{As the population continues to grow and in addition the percentage of
   elderly within the population increases, there is a need for supporting
   seniorities and people with disabilities with intelligent tools. All
   these provoke a high demand of set-up of new ICT technology and services
   in the daily living environment of elderly users for supporting their
   personal autonomy. T-Seniority is a new innovative service that expands
   the benefits of information society to older people through digital TV
   channels, and will run in even pilot sites in Europe. These trials can
   succeed through utilisation of the Living Labs concept, a complete
   innovation approach in which all stakeholders in a product, service or
   application participate in the development process. The concept is based
   on the Living Lab methodology which provides very high performance for
   product/service ideation and conception stages. In the current paper,
   the most important aspects of the T-Seniority project trials for
   expanding the benefits of information society to older people through
   digital TV channels are presented, in combination with the five-stage
   Living Labs trial configuration work-flow.}},

Abstract = {{3D Virtual Worlds are potent Digital Ecosystems because the 3D interface
   simulates real-world environments and the community of users creates a
   dynamic, real-to-life economy and in-world culture. Some Virtual Worlds
   such as Second Life empower users to generate in-world content through
   object building tools and programming languages; indeed the content in
   Second Life is entirely user-generated. This promotes a rich culture of
   innovation surrounding this emerging technology that continually
   develops the capabilities of the 3D Digital Ecosystem. The collaborative
   culture spans both the 3D in-world environment and 2D ecosystems; for
   example, Web 2.0 applications such as wikis and blogs facilitate
   support, discussion, and documentation for user-generated innovations.
   Innovation in 3D Digital Ecosystems such as Second Life are applied to
   all domains of human endeavour that exist in the real-world, including
   recreation, socialisation, commerce, and education. This paper shares
   the authors' professional experience using Second Life in tertiary
   Information Systems/Science education. Case studies describe the
   specific applications. They are followed by discussion of the benefits
   of 3D Digital Ecosystems for education and suggestions for future

Abstract = {{The increasing rate of technological development is changing how we
   interact socially, commercially, and politically, making this an
   exciting yet challenging time in which to live. As the pace of
   development is destabilising the status quo, it is increasingly
   important for individuals and organisations alike to adapt. Research,
   development, and commercialisation are important tools in facilitating
   innovation for organisations engaging in the modern knowledge/networked
   economy. As an emergent player in the networked economy, Digital
   Ecosystems have great potential for innovation. In particular 3D Virtual
   Worlds offer exciting opportunities for Information Systems research,
   development, and commercialisation. By their very structure, 3D Virtual
   Worlds such as Second Life provide a powerful context for innovation and
   collaboration: Second Life users are immersed in a 3D environment and
   empowered by a menu-based object-builder and a programming language;
   in-built text, voice, and body-language communication tools enrich
   communication, collaboration, and help provide a rich contextual
   presence. The community of users apply themselves to all realms of human
   endeavour, from recreational socialisation to systems development and
   entrepreneurial ventures. The current paper describes a university
   research commercialisation systems development project (of an Automated
   Essay Grading system called MarkIT), that utilises a 3D Digital
   Ecosystem for both promotion and implementation. Subsequently, this
   paper discusses the benefits, limitations, and suggestions for future
   innovation in research, development, and commercialisation of
   Information Systems incorporating 3D Virtual Worlds.}},

Abstract = {{Large and complex socio-technical systems like the agricultural
   extension services of (the multi-lingual, multi-cultural and
   heterogeneous societies) India, pose many challenges for creating an
   innovation system. The challenges stem from the multiplicity of social
   learning systems needed as well as due to the deep rooted heritage of
   age old ``successful{''} technical systems that now need to embrace new
   practices arising from new research and due to emergence of new seeds,
   new pests and diseases, new scarcities and new competition. Social
   science and particularly the sociological understanding of social change
   can and must integrate with information system theories to address the
   complex challenge of innovation in Indian agricultural system. This
   paper analyses the challenges and presents a compilation of action
   reports from the implementation of the Digital Ecosystem for Agriculture
   and Rural Livelihood (DEAL) project that was initiated in northern
   India. In this process this paper explores how the emerging digital
   technologies can support collaborative knowledge creation and sharing
   and discuss the social landscape of socio-technical innovation and

Abstract = {{Most governments, industries and institutions face an adaptive challenge
   to a changed context for strategy. The new operating environment is
   characterized by complexity, interactivity, and rapid evolution. It
   produces more challenges than any one person, business, or government
   can respond to effectively. This has two implications. The first is the
   importance of building collaboration that spans industry environments,
   spawns novel partnerships, and involves multiple stakeholders. The
   second is the importance of shaping developments proactively around a
   new theory for growth.
   The idea for ecosystems as a business metaphor was introduced in the
   mid-1990s, drawing on biology as a new language and logic for strategy.
   At the time, it was considered a fundamental shift that reframed the
   cutting edge for thinking about leadership and competition across a
   broad arc of potential settings, from airlines to restaurants. While the
   information technology industry is adopting a vision of digital
   ecosystems as a guide for technological evolution, a wider embrace of
   business ecosystems as opportunity space for new markets and competitive
   advantage has stalled.
   This paper provides context to close an implementation gap between
   technology innovation and ecosystem-centered business strategy, and
   introduces an ecosystem approach to create a self-generating market in
   the pharmaceutical industry. It also suggests a convulsing international
   system reveals the deeper structural transformation reshaping the human
   condition, creating new commercial pressure that will force leaders in
   industry and government to reorient their thinking in order to escape
   the Darwinian reaper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the electronic design of a plasma impedance probe
   under development for microsatellite applications. The designs primary
   innovation is the integration of matched analog-to-digital converters on
   a single chip for sampling the probe's current and voltage signals. A
   fast fourier transform (FFT) is performed by an off-chip FPGA to compute
   the probe's impedance. This provides a robust solution for determining
   the plasma impedance accurately. The use of matched ADCs decreases the
   instrument's sensitivity to imprecision and variation in the probe
   stimulus waveform and the FFT reduces sensitivity to transient spikes
   that proved disruptive in previous instruments. The major analog errors
   and parametric variations affecting the PIP instrument and its effect on
   the accuracy and precision of the impedance measurement are also
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a research work in the context of a national
   project, DIGITAL OCEAN for the creation and distribution of multimedia
   content, where we present tailorable groupware architecture, Oce@nyd, to
   allow a collaborative collection of multimedia information over the
   internet. The Oce@nyd architecture is based on Web services and software
   agents' integration. This research is, until now, never been exploited
   in the context of groupware tailorability, hence bringing innovation in
   the CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) domain. We apply our
   research work on DIGITAL OCEAN in order to give users means to
   collaborate more efficiently, for the purpose of enriching underwater
   maps with up-to-date multimedia files, as well as means to tailor the
   services proposed in the system in order to adapt the system to their
   preferences, and hence enhance collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{It has been established that Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICTs) are key drivers for rural development. However, while many
   countries such as India and South Africa have made significant
   investments in rural ICT infrastructure and its developmental spin-offs,
   rural women are still neglected when it comes to access to ICTs. This
   neglect is evident in the ICT policy initiatives in South Africa as an
   example, where the relevant policies lack any significant or direct
   attention to rural women's development. If ICT policies do not address
   the gendered digital divide in rural areas gender inequality will be
   encouraged. This paper gives insights on how information exchange by
   means of ICTs such as Internet, mobile phones and radio could foster
   economic growth and empowerment of rural women in South Africa. In
   addition, the paper discusses the role of relevant stakeholders in ICT
   policy formulation for more effective and appropriate communication, and
   innovative ways of using ICTs for women empowerment in rural areas. The
   authors make recommendations for ICT policy development that would
   better serve the needs of rural women leading to their empowerment.}},

Abstract = {{For implantable neural interface applications, it is important to
   compress data and analyze spike patterns across multiple channels in
   real time. Such a computational task for online neural data processing
   requires an innovative circuit-architecture level design approach for
   low-power, robust and area-efficient hardware implementation.
   Conventional microprocessor or Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chips
   would dissipate too much power and are too large in size for an
   implantable system. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware design
   approach, referred to as ``Preferential Design{''} that exploits the
   nature of the neural signal processing algorithm to achieve a
   low-voltage, robust and area-efficient implementation using nanoscale
   process technology. The basic idea is to isolate the critical components
   with respect to system performance and design them more conservatively
   compared to the noncritical ones. This allows aggressive voltage scaling
   for low power operation while ensuring robustness and area efficiency.
   We have applied the proposed approach to a neural signal processing
   algorithm using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and observed
   significant improvement in power and robustness over conventional
   design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates and proposes the use of the Rough Set Theory as
   an innovative approach to digitally control static dc-dc converters.
   Rough set theory is a powerful mathematical tool which is able to
   produce a set of rules that represents the behavior of a certain system.
   PID and Fuzzy controllers applied to the buck and boost converters,
   respectively, are used as model controllers. Each controller is
   implemented and tested and some of its signals are sampled to produce a
   database. A set of rules is derived from the application of rough set
   theory to this database. These rules are used to generate a digital
   controller - the RS digital controller which has a behavior similar to
   the model controller. The RS digital controller is then applied to the
   buck and boost converters. Theoretical aspects of rough set theory and
   the RS digital controller design are presented. Additionally, simulation
   results are provided and analyzed. They show the functionality of the RS
   digital controllers and validate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile phone technology has advanced in recent year. Many innovative
   applications with mobile phones were implemented apart from the
   conventional voice data transfer. Short Message Service (SMS) originally
   developed for sending status information by the service providers have
   found numerous applications recently including business transactions. In
   this project, a prototype of a wireless health monitoring system capable
   of sending SMS related to the health status of the patient is developed.
   The project can be divided in to three stages of data acquisition, data
   processing and communication stages. A data acquisition stage consists
   of sensors to monitor the temperature and pulse rate. The sensor outputs
   are converted to digital form and read by a Basic Stamp microcontroller
   which does some processing and is sent through the serial port to the
   Visual Basic (TM) data processing software. Various GUI forms like
   patient information are developed in Visual Basic to assist in data
   processing. Critical values of the measured data can be set; exceeding
   which the Visual Basic will initiate the communication unit to send SMS
   to the predefined mobile numbers. When anomalies are detected or a
   threshold is reached, the monitoring system automatically transmits the
   information to the doctor's hand phone on the mobile network as a SMS
   message via a GSM device / SMS gateway and at the same time the system
   will update the hospital database periodically. For each stages of the
   project various design options were considered and the best one is
   chosen. The project was successful as a prototype to send SMS regarding
   the patient info to the doctors. Since only a prototype was intended in
   this project, sensors accuracy and other data acquisition features were
   compromised by choosing or simulating the available sensor rather than
   using biomedical sensors due to cost and availability factors.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most pressing problems in present digital devices are those
   on-chip and between chips interconnections. Associated with these are
   the difficulties of placing logic elements as well as routing of their
   interconnections. As traditional metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect
   transistor (MOSFET) design and composition are continuously tweaked and
   scaled to smaller dimensions, interconnect innovation has struggled to
   keep pace. This has lead to an increasing performance disparity between
   transistor switching latency and wire transmission time. The mismatch
   has implications for integrated circuit (IC) design resulting it?
   slower, more power hungry and space-inefficient circuits.
   3D silicon integration is a proposed solution that promises to
   simultaneously increase chip-level performance and decrease overall
   power consumption, while boosting transistor density and computational
   power per unit volume. The implications of this novel approach to
   integration are assessed through an initial 3D processor test vehicle
   implementation.}},

   display the final achievement by the concrete and visual way, but also
   cannot leave the analysis and compares the graphical representation in

   much painstaking care. It needs the designer to consider carefully how
   to express the unique idea objectively The spark of inspiration of an
   innovative design comes from the repeated collisions between the
   negation and affirmation. Hand painting may catch this kind of the spark
   of inspiration rapidly However, today, as the computer technology is
   popular and increasingly refined, rapidly penetrated into all fields of
   science, it has became a new trend to using the DIGITIZER and the
   computer into the hand-painted design and expression. Moreover the
   computer hand painting is helpful to call for new design ideas, reduces
   the design cycle, and the design is easy to control, revise and
   regenerate, then the actual efficiency is greatly raised}},

Abstract = {{A full database supported strategy is presented for the software
   development of integration design and analysis of engineering
   productions. The strategy resolves the elements of engineering design
   and analysis as a solver and five supporters. The solver embraces all
   the used scientific methods, approaches, and measurements logically,
   digitally, and numerically. The supporters are databases for supporting
   the solver. They are Prototype-F for reserving functional, constructive
   and geometric parameterization prototypes; Material-S for material and
   structure metallurgical, physical, static mechanical, fatigued, and
   fractured parameters; Loads for service conditions including loads and
   environments obtained from expected design, on-line inspection, and
   numerical simulations; Criteria for code based criteria and the
   customer's requirements; and History for historic successful and failure
   events. Any of information in the databases is step-by-step called by
   the solver to match the process of production design and analysis by an
   independent and flexible interface. The software is then developed by
   combining software engineering, data engineering, and knowledge
   engineering to form an innovation software environment of Re-usability,
   High efficiency, Flexibility, and adaptability. The software information
   can be multiplied and strengthened days and months. And the functions
   can be perfected itself as the time increase. Feasibility has been

Abstract = {{This study intends to redesign the user interface of mobile devices to
   ease the heavy workload on the thumb as well as to better fit our hand
   with the devices when grasping. Based on the motion characteristics of
   thumb and index finger and the one-handed operated interface
   requirements, a new design idea was emerged. The design principles were
   taken into consideration for the new interface design in order to
   increasing comfort and reducing muscle workload of the thumb. The method
   of this study is divided into two stages: new device innovation and
   evaluation. After experimental analysis, this study suggests: 1.
   Designing the contoured grasping region based on user anthropometric
   data for the mobile devices will provide a more comfortable grasp. 2. It
   is recommended that the center of keypad be located at near the thumb
   tip for both minimizing the joint angle changes of operating digits and
   enhancing the accessibility of the thumb. 3. The effort of adding index
   finger keys for reducing thumb fatigue level is not seem to be obvious.
   The results can contribute to design of one-handed mobile device.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of the Internet, Web2.0 as the next
   generation of networking services emphasizes social interaction and
   share of user-generated content in a collaborative environment. It has
   evolved and transferred the Internet into a platform by supporting rich
   digital media technology for the development of innovative business and
   educational applications. In conjunction with Web 3D technology, social
   networking has already begun to foster an intuitive and immersive system
   that allows effective visual communication and delivers real time
   natural interactive experience for enhancing user motivation and
   engagement compared with the traditional static and text-oriented Web.
   This paper presents an augmented social interactive learning approach to
   incorporating social networking services on Web2.0 into traditional
   distance learning and on-site teaching for blended learning. This paper
   also discusses the key issues including user interaction and
   communication forms and examines different educational activities
   involving user content generation, e-tutoring, and role-playing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a large-scale heterogeneous Multi-Core Digital
   Signal Processors (MC-DSP) prototype constructed with super-nodes,
   PolyDSP, and proposes a data speculation technique based on customized
   Data Streams Transmission Control Engine (DSTCE). This technique
   improves the efficiency of data streams transmissions within single
   super-node and among super-nodes. The innovation of this technique is
   that it combines a data speculation solution with the programming model
   of MC-DSPs, avoids complex cache coherence problems, and increases the
   parallelism between data processing and memory accessing for MC-DSPs
   significantly. Our simulation results show that, the performance of
   single super-node of PolyDSP is improved by 22\% on average, and the
   performance of PolyDSP with two super-nodes based on DSTCE is 14\%
   higher than that of based on CC-NUMA structure(1).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a methodology for designing a fully-digital
   reconfigurable receiver for QAM signals. Band-Pass Sampling (BPS) is
   used as a first stage with a unique Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
   positioned immediately after the receiver antenna. The band-pass
   sampling is analyzed with reference to noise aliasing deriving from
   band-pass filter and the results in the numerical frequency domain are
   presented. The inescapable frequency, symbol and phase synchronization
   problem in our model of receiver is approached and solved blindly with
   an information-theoretic criterion: joint entropy maximization is
   utilized for frequency and symbol synchronization while mutual
   information minimization is utilized for phase recovery. The innovative
   contribution of this paper consists in matching band-pass sampling and
   blind synchronization with a design of a synchronized reconfigurable
   receiver for QAM signals.}},

Abstract = {{Many embedded security chips require a high-quality digital True Random
   Number Generator (TRNG). Recently, some new TRNGs have been proposed in
   the literature, innovating by their new architectures. Moreover, some of
   them don't need to use the post-processing unit usually required in TRNG
   constructions. As a result, the TRNG data rate is enhanced and the
   produced random bits only depend on the noise source and its sampling.
   However, selecting a TRNG ran be a delicate problem. In a hardware
   context (e.g. Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or
   Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation), the
   design area and power consumption are important criterions. To the best
   of our knowledge, no effective comparison of several TRNGs appears in
   the literature. This paper evaluates the randomness behavior, the area
   and the power consumption of the latest TRNGs. These investigations are
   realized into real conditions, by implementing the TRNGs into FPGA
   circuits.}},

Abstract = {{The technology that dominated the second half of the 20th century was no
   doubt the digital electronic computer and its derivatives. The Computer
   Society of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
   was born the same year as the world's first digital computer - the ENIAC
   (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer). As the computer became
   ever more important to every aspect of life in the civilized world, the
   Computer Society matched its phenomenal growth to become the largest
   technical society within IEEE and the largest computing professional
   society in the world. This paper traces the development of the IEEE
   Computer Society from its humble beginnings to its many activities
   today. This historical review shows that throughout its history, the
   Computer Society has been and continues to be responsive to the
   technology it represents. The Society expands its service as the
   discipline becomes more encompassing and multifaceted. Moreover, by
   effectively using the very technology it represents, the leadership of
   the Society not only provides its members with cost-effective services,
   but also leads the way in designing innovative products that become
   beneficial to the world at large.}},

Abstract = {{Indian agriculture is today at a cross road. Many new diseases, pests
   and weeds affect the crops. Some old techniques, such as the copious use
   of irrigation, have resulted in top soil impoverishment. There is a need
   for innovative practices to be introduced at every stage of the Indian
   agriculture value chain. The current practices within the Indian
   Agricultural Extension Service (IAES) focus on a top down approach to
   services. It largely depends on a traditional F2F service model. This
   model focuses on instructional model of imparting knowledge to the
   farmers at the village level. Our past studies across several districts
   of Uttar Pradesh in India show lack of innovation across the entire IAES
   system and ill effect of group think. Innovation at the grass root level
   does not spread across the value chain due to unidirectional approach of
   the current IAES. In this context ICT provides an opportunity to enhance
   the service dominant co-creation and delivery in the extension system by
   providing a set of tools and techniques that are interoperable and easy
   to use. This paper explores how digital technology deployment projects
   need to distinguish between organizing explicit knowledge from
   agricultural experts and researchers (Gran Dhara) in knowledge
   repositories as opposed to acquisition of field knowledge from farmers,
   traders and other practitioners (Gana Gyan) through participative and
   circularity of communication.}},

Abstract = {{In the past ten years, the Taipei City Government has made efforts to
   transform itself into an e-government and to create a digital
   environment for businesses and citizens. Furthermore, Taipei attempts to
   become an intelligent and ubiquitous city via delivering public services
   and application services to the citizens, such as Intelligent
   Transportation System (ITS), Wireless Campus, M-medicine, Culture
   Express, and so on. Under the context, the development of ICTs
   (information and communication technologies) brings some changes in
   shaping service economy to a city, such as the innovation delivered from
   public and private sectors to the society with different collaborative
   networks. Thus, the new services development and commercialization
   becomes a key issue in the next-generation applications of the ICTs to
   people's daily life.
   This study attempts to conduct an empirical case study for the
   exploitation of business model and market trends of tourist system which
   building up upon convenient stores in Taipei. Since Intelligent Living
   Technology and Service (ILTS) industry are formed within the government
   to call for collaboration among the various departments and agencies as
   an industrial alliance, the construction, renovation, management or
   maintenance are handled in a public-private partnership (PPP) framework.
   In addition, the ``Service, Science, Management and Engineering
   (SSME){''} approach is used as an interdisciplinary experimental design
   method t demonstrate the study, de sign, and implementation of new
   service system. Finally, the discussion with multi-stakeholders and
   users `patterns that provides different experience to those adopted
   private cooperation in city development to achieve the goal of
   intelligent life.}},

Abstract = {{With aggressive MOSFET scaling, short channel effects (DIBL and V(TH)
   roll-off), off-state and gate leakage, parasitic capacitance and
   resistance severely limit the device performance. These, in addition to
   V(DD) scaling limitation and high sub-threshold swing (>60mv/dec) give
   rise to high I(OFF) and make power dissipation, both dynamic and static,
   an enormous challenge, especially for low power/low current
   applications. New device innovations are essential to achieve low I(OFF)
   by having steep sub-threshold behavior for low power applications.
   Towards this end, a novel asymmetric Tunneling Source MOSFET is proposed
   in this paper. The main feature of this device is the concept of gate
   controlled carrier injection through band-to-band tunneling at the
   source junction. This novel device has the potential for steep
   sub-threshold behavior (<<60mv/dec), improved I(ON)/I(OFF) and high ROUT
   and gain (g. x ROUT) at low bias currents. It also possesses excellent
   immunity against short channel effects which improves scalability into
   sub-50nm regime and makes it an attractive candidate for low power
   digital and analog operations.}},

   state machine design, etc. These projects are carried out in groups,
   thereby developing the students' abilities to work in teams. We present

   such a memory. The DPM is a data storage based on the commonly used RFID
   (Radio Frequency Identification) technology and can contain all kinds of
   product information, e.g. a complete product history or handling
   information. Thereby each product can be handled individually, even in
   automated logistic processes. Additionally, the whole life cycle of a
   product can be stored for quality assurance or backtracking. In
   automated processes, e.g. production, logistics and retail, robots are
   used to handle, to detect and to manipulate such objects with DPMs. The
   DFKI(1) Robotics Innovation Center develops industrial robots which
   communicates via RFID with the DPM and deriving handling and
   manipulation information from it. In this work we present two autonomous
   robot systems in detail which are used for direct DPM interaction.
   Furthermore, we state our experiences in several demonstration scenarios
   and discuss our next steps regarding future robotic scenarios for DPM
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel broadcast network architecture, where macro and
   micro Base Stations (BS) transmit partially the same signal in a SFN
   manner. Leveraging this architecture we propose to operate the medium as
   a pure IP multicast bearer coupled with a feedback channel for
   scheduling and optimizing the bandwidth usage. The extra bandwidth can
   be managed locally with a fine grain thanks to the dense BS deployment.
   Such a system drastically improves the covet-age area, including indoor,
   while reducing power consumption, using low power transmitters and well
   targeted transmissions. It also copes with the ramping up of ``green{''}
   requirements. The single frequency operation also leads to a highly
   bandwidth efficient system, suitable for exploitation Of the digital
   dividend in the UHF band for instance. Finally, this system can
   introduce some innovative services, potentially managed by new players
   so that the overall revenues pay back the dense radio architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Current methods of educating students are becoming increasingly
   obsolete. The cognitive processes, systems, and mechanisms by and
   through which students learn have changed dramatically, yet few
   professors have changed their pedagogical style. Accordingly, many
   students find themselves initially faced with classes that are
   unnecessarily difficult, frequently boring, of unexplained relevance,
   taught in increasingly obsolete ways by professors who are not only
   clueless about the way today's students - many of them digital natives
   who are intimately familiar with synthetic realities, social networking
   sites, and mashups that their elders may not even know exist - think,
   interact, and learn, but who are actively hostile to their student's
   cognitive patterns. The increasingly rapid evolution of information and
   communication technology - ICT - offers new and exciting options for
   education, but it is doubtful that the incremental and cautious pace of
   educational innovation seen today is adequate to introduce them.}},

Abstract = {{PARISROC is a complete read out chip, in ANIS SiGe 0.35 mu m technology,
   for photomultipliers array. It allows triggerless acquisition for next
   generation neutrino experiments and it belongs to an R\&D program funded
   by the French national agency for research (ANR) called PMm(2):
   ``Innovative electronics for photodetectors array used in High Energy
   Physics and Astroparticles{''} (ref.ANR-06-BLAN-0186).
   The ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) integrates 16
   independent and auto triggered channels with variable gain and provides
   charge and time measurement by a Wilkinson ADC (Analog to Digital
   Converter) and a 24-bit Counter. The charge measurement should be
   performed from 1 up to 300 photoelectrons (p.e.) with a good linearity.
   The time measurement allowed to a coarse time with a 24-bit counter at
   10 MHz and a line time on a 100ns ramp to achieve a resolution of 1 ns.
   The ASIC sends out only the relevant data through network cables to the
   central data storage. This paper describes the front-end electronics

Abstract = {{This work deals with the use of gamma spectrometry for fourth generation
   Sodium Fast Reactor (SFR) power monitoring and clad failure detection.
   Usually, gamma spectrometers could not manage on-line applications in
   high count rate and fast activity variations but recent improvements in
   this research field may improve it. The ADONIS analyser for gamma
   spectrometry could met two needs of fourth generation SFR {[}1].
   The ex-core neutron power measurement gives instant neutron power
   estimation but has some shift problems, mainly due to the burn-up
   phenomenon. High security margins are then set and so, the reactor can
   not work at its best thermodynamic efficiency. Previous works on
   Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) show that gamma emitters concentration
   in primary coolant is also directly linked with reactor power (N-16
   power measurement) {[}7]. On SFR, the use of short decay period gamma
   emitters as the F-20 radionuclide will allow a fast power measurement
   with a direct correlation with the instant fission rate and without
   burn-up dependency.
   The second need is the clad failure detection improvement. The SFR clad
   failure detection is done by radiochemical and gamma measurements on
   argon cover gas and primary sodium samples. Gaseous fission products and
   delayed neutron fission products (only the I-137 and the Br-87) are
   measured but lots of fission products (gamma emitters) are not measured
   nowadays on-line due to high sodium activity and its fast changes.
   This paper presents the experiment done at the French Phenix SFR of the
   CEA Marcoule and its analysis. Measuring activation and fission products
   contained in primary sodium coolant, the adaptive ADONIS gamma
   spectrometry system set on primary sodium coolant sample could be a new
   innovating power monitoring and clad failure detection system for future
   SFR.}},

Abstract = {{Tandem-L is a proposal for an innovative interferometric and
   polarimetric radar mission that enables the systematic monitoring of
   dynamic processes on the Earth surface. Important mission objectives are
   global forest height and biomass inventories, large scale measurements
   of millimetric displacements due to tectonic shifts, and systematic
   observations of glacier movements. The innovative mission concept and
   the high data acquisition capacity of Tandem-L provide a unique data
   source to observe, analyze and quantify the dynamics of a wide range of
   mutually interacting processes in the bio-, litho-, hydro- and
   cryosphere. By this, Tandem-L will be an essential step to advance our
   understanding of the Earth system and its intricate dynamics.
   This paper provides an overview of the Tandem-L mission concept and its
   main application areas. Performance predictions show the great potential
   of Tandem-L to acquire a wide range of bio- and geophysical parameters
   with high accuracy on a global scale. Innovative aspects like the
   employment of advanced digital beamforming techniques to improve
   performance and coverage are discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the IQ imbalance sensibility of the code
   multiplexing front-end architecture. This innovative architecture has
   been recently proposed in order to reduce the analog complexity of an
   antenna diversity receiver front-end. An interesting characteristic of
   this structure is that the resulting IQ imbalance is equal for each
   received baseband signal. Associated with Single Matrix Inversion
   algorithm, this property ensures a high IQ imbalance robustness. A
   global antenna diversity system including analog front-end and digital
   processing has been implemented in order to perform simulation
   validation. Results show that the bit error rate does not increase
   significantly with the multiplexing and this increase is compensated for
   a high IQ imbalance.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the usage of IT
   based systems in vehicles, with predictions that in the near future,
   more than 90\% of innovations in the automotive sector will be centered
   on IT software and hardware. However, innovation also means that
   intellectual property (IP) is created, which is valuable to third
   (potentially) untrusted and malicious parties. In particular,
   automobiles are already suffering from security issues, such as illegal
   copying of software IP, counterfeiting of electronic components, illegal
   tampering with digital data inside the electronic control units (ECUs),
   etc. Recently, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) attracted
   significant interest for numerous applications such as protection of
   software and hardware IP, secure key storage and component
   identification, to name a few. In this paper, we describe how PUFs can
   be used for secure key storage, component identification, IP protection
   in vehicle applications, and their suitability for vehicle insurance
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{eCall is a project of the European Commission for the improvement of
   transportation safety by providing rapid assistance to motorists
   involved in a collision anywhere in the European Union. In the event of
   a collision, the intended solution employs an in-band modem that
   transmits vehicle location, airbag deployment, and other relevant
   information timely and reliably from the in-vehicle system (IVS) over
   the cellular network voice channel to the public safety answering point
   (PSAP). This paper describes the requirements, system design and
   performance of the eCall in-band modem solution that was selected by
   3GPP. Due to the employment of this solution in life-critical
   situations, transmission reliability and speed are of utmost importance.
   The effective transmission channel is characterized by the highly
   nonlinear speech codec, as well as radio channel impairments,
   constituting a challenge for the in-band transmission of digital data.
   Several innovative transmission concepts were developed for our eCall
   in-band modem solution to address this challenge.}},

Abstract = {{The issue of digital identity is at the heart of many contemporary
   strategic innovations, covering crime, internal and external security,
   business models etc. The area of MANets (Mobile Ad-hoc Networks) is
   still in its infancy in the research community, but it plays a vital
   role surrounded by the growing trend of mobile technology for business,
   private and governmental uses. The emergent notion of ubiquitous
   computing makes it possible for mobile devices to communicate and
   provide services via networks connected in an ad-hoc manner. In this
   paper we present the current research issues within the field of MANets
   and highlight some challenges for future studies. The main focus is on
   the area of identity management (IM), context-awareness and
   user-centricity for MANets together with its security issues and
   implications. We conclude with the need of a research into the area of
   IMMANets.}},

   social networking technologies with a system called ARCO to allow
   communities to build digital heritage exhibitions online. With our
   system, digital heritage objects are reanimated in digital space through
   images, video clips, sounds, texts and other media (including 3D) within
   a virtual exhibition space, and thereby given new life. The focus of
   this paper is to primarily show how we can effectively integrate user
   generated heritage content with museum collections online; reconnecting
   objects in collections to disparate communities.}},

Abstract = {{Collaborative writing, one of the methodological innovations for
   language teaching, is ``the social act of creating a single, coordinate
   document with two or more participants{''}. Revision is the last process
   for writing. Corrective feedback and error correction, critical tasks
   for revision, are important for English as a Second Language/English as
   a Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) writing instruction. Research findings
   showed that students' major difficulty in error correction ties in their
   failure to detect errors. Also, researchers proposed that error analysis
   can be reinvented in the form of computer-aided error analysis, a new
   type of computer corpus annotation. Annotations on digital documents can
   be easily shared among groups of people, making them valuable for a wide
   variety of tasks, including providing feedback. Collaborative corrective
   feedback and error correction with asynchronous annotation systems have
   been developed by researchers. It is suggested that collaborative teams
   can be enhanced by applying collaboration in a synchronous environment.
   However, few synchronous annotation systems are developed for corrective
   feedback and error correction. This study developed a web-based online
   synchronous collaborative writing revision instrument for collaborative
   writing revision. With this system, users can collaboratively make
   corrective feedback and error corrections on digitized documents in a
   synchronous environment. It is implemented on the general web browser
   such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, with online annotations in the same
   way as the traditional paper-based correction approach. Another
   innovative functionality developed in this system is that the user can
   freely switch between the annotation mode and the review mode to neatly
   review the ``right{''} article after correction without showing the
   correction marks to reduce the problem of cognitive overload.}},

   community simulates the real states of online purchasing process and
   living of householders which are constructed by 3D network game engine.
   Customers who have registered in the community can play their roles and
   choose any entertainment or any interesting person they like to talk
   with. Meanwhile, advanced online house purchasing substitutes for the
   present tedious purchasing process which costs lots of human and
   material resources and then brings the real estate developer huge
   benefit. This is a totally innovative and meaningful mode of house
   selling. Following the user experience design method and user-centered
   interaction principle, this paper explains the whole process of system
   development and the application prospect of this interactive community.}},

Abstract = {{For decades semiconductor developments have been driven by Moore's Law
   productivity gains. This led to extremely fast digital processors,
   increase in bandwidth and huge memories that boost productivity of PCs,
   mobile phones, and other applications demanding heavy data traffic and
   storage. The economics of the IC industry as well as developments in
   society, however, will cause the trend to turn, leading to a paradigm
   shift in the semiconductors world.
   Our industry is confronted with sky-rocketing cost levels for
   System-On-Chip development in advanced CMOS technology. Secondly,
   ongoing shrinking the physical dimensions will eventually cause Moore's
   Law to come to an end.
   At the same time, consumer demand shifts from ever more productive
   consumer electronics to a variety of new smart products adding value to
   daily life. A globally graying population demands for innovations in
   medical devices and food safety. Raising environmental awareness demands
   for smart ``green{''} solutions. In transportation IC innovations help
   to bring safety, to overcome traffic congestion, and to deliver all
   thinkable information to consumers on the move.
   These and many more applications are typically realized by integration
   of existing CMOS technologies with ``More-than-Moore{''} technologies,
   like Analog/Mixed-Signal, High-Voltage, and MEMS.
   In his keynote presentation we will elaborate on the paradigm shift in
   the semiconductor industry, and present a number of
   ``More-than-Moore{''} applications and underlying enabling technologies.}},

Abstract = {{National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, India (NPLI) has started a new
   time service by transmitting digital time data via telephone network in
   name of Teleclock service which is quite different from the usual
   dial-up time service. Data for the time of the day are sent five times
   for the sake of redundancy. The phase information related to the second
   pulse is also disseminated, thus providing the provision of delay
   compensation.
   NPLI has also developed a Teleclock receiver to access this time
   service. Receivers have been designed to access this service either via
   landline network or mobile network. Real Time Clock of the receiver is
   set / synchronized with the received time data. The confidence in
   accessing correct data has been worked out. The accuracy of time signal
   has been studied for both landline and mobile network. The accuracy of
   The order of sub millisecond has been observed. Online delay
   compensation has been planned.
   Transmission system for commissioning such time service is inexpensive
   and simple. Further, the cost of the receiver is affordable and mainly
   depends on the size of the display. So this system opens up an
   opportunity of staring a national time service and thus is gaining
   popularity in many developing countries.
   This paper describes the system configuration, emphasizes the important
   features of this system and elaborates the uniqueness of this time
   service.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to the optimization and innovation of the method
   investigating vestibular system from the technical point of view. The
   specific method how to evaluate gait function with respect to
   equilibrium function is cranio-corpo-graphy - CCG. The main aim of this
   paper is to describe design and development of the system for
   contactless measurement of immediate body posture based on the
   evaluation mutual position of join going across shoulders and join of
   the forehead and occiput CCG. Previous solution was based on utilization
   of Polaroid and spherical mirror, it means on the analogue technology.
   System of craniocorpography has been recently computerized. The new
   system is based on the videotechnology, it means on the TV system with
   sidelong scanning by TV fisheye camera for increasing of the field of
   view and the wireless transmission of analogue videosignal. The
   videosequences are processed by specialized software and data is saved
   into database. Drawback of the new system is time-consuming
   videosequence processing only. Advantages of the new system are the
   following: more evaluated parameters, reduction of trajectory distortion
   by spherical mirror, exact evaluation of parameters, possibility to
   evaluate stand test and further parameters, detailed analysis of
   movement trajectory and imposition of investigation results and off-line
   analysis. The new system has a lot of advantages and one drawback. Based
   on the comparison and experiments it seems that the new system is more
   appropriate than the old one for clinical neurological practice.}},

Abstract = {{The Digital Array Gas Radiometer (DAGR) concept is based on traditional
   and reliable Gas Filter Correlation Radiometry (GFCR) for remote trace
   gas detection and monitoring. GFCR sensors have been successful in many
   infrared remote sensing applications. Historically however, solar
   backscatter measurements have not been as successful because instrument
   designs have been susceptible to natural variations in surface albedo,
   which induce clutter and degrade the sensitivity. DAGR overcomes this
   limitation with several key innovations. First, a pupil imaging system
   scrambles the received light, removing nearly all spatial clutter and
   permitting a small calibration source to be easily inserted. Then, by
   using focal plane arrays rather than single detectors to collect the
   light, dramatic advances in dynamic range can be achieved. Finally, when
   used with the calibration source, data processing approaches can further
   mitigate detector non-uniformity effects. DAGR sensors can be made as
   small as digital cameras and are well suited for downlooking detection
   of gases in the boundary layer, where solar backscatter measurements are
   needed to overcome the lack of thermal contrast in the IR. Easily
   integrated into a satellite platform, a space-based DAGR would provide
   near-global sensing of climatically important species such as such as
   CO, CH(4), and N(2)O. Aircraft and UAV measurements with a DAGR could be
   used to monitor agricultural and industrial emissions. Ground-based or
   portable DAGRs could augment early warning systems for chemical weapons
   or toxic materials. Finally, planetary science applications include
   detection and mapping of biomarkers such as CH(4) in the Martian
   atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{In Nigeria, the weakening of the state parallels the rise of the
   insecurities of everyday life. Traditional means of social promotion
   Such as education or employment in public Offices have ceased to exist.
   Movie making has proven to be a profitable activity and become a means
   of social promotion for unemployed but creative youth. Nigerian Video
   Film Cultures started as free enterprise and Nigerian video films have
   become prime media for the articulation Of public discourse. The
   production and distribution are based oil all alternative network for
   the distribution of video content. The language combines (language
   combines motifs) motifs from Western and Indian cinema. Nigerian Video
   Cultures challenge the global systems of video production and
   distribution. Call they also challenge the dominance of the Western
   system of visual representation? This is the main question addressed by
   this paper. The author combines the results of the research by
   colleagues from anthropology and media and film Studies, with the
   fieldwork conducted in December of 2006 in Nigeria and online since
   then. She proposes that Nigerian Video Film Cultures subvert the
   dominant systems of video production and distribution, but they also
   provide space for the articulation of public discourse by innovating the
   film language itself.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematics is the universal language of human abstract thought and it
   subtly pervades all forms of Art. Art and Mathematics have evolved in
   parallel, alongwith changes in our ways of conceiving, perceiving,
   experimenting and representing ``reality{''}. One can divide this
   evolution into four steps. The first refers to Classical Art; a second
   to the development of Perspective; a third one to non-Euclidean
   Geometry; a fourth to ``Synthetic Geometry{''} and the deconstruction of
   rigid forms, with the development of fractals and topology alongwith
   modern and avant-garde forms of Art. In the era of Digital Art a
   skillful use of Web and Computer Technologies, alongwith Multimediality,
   offers new challenging ways to introduce Mathematics starting from a
   careful reading of artworks. We have therefore elaborated, proposed and
   begun experimenting an innovative ``teaching and visualization
   project{''} mainly based on advanced techniques at the intersection of
   Mathematics, Computer Science and Digital Art. The project called
   ``SCIENAR{''} - is based the innovative possibilities that new media
   offer for a better Communication, Visualization, Divulgation and
   Didactics of Mathematics. It aims to creating three scientific scenarios
   concerning the theory of Relativity, the notion of Symmetries and the
   foundations of Geometry; starting from these it will be possible to
   produce artistic objects by means of a collaborative work between
   researchers, scientists and artists. ``SCIENAR{''} will generate a fully
   innovative portal, whereby artists will find ready-to-use mathematical
   forms, including the more traditional Web Portal ``MArs{''}. Next steps
   will be aimed at fostering, stimulating and supporting the physical and
   the virtual mobility of artists and cultural players interested to use
   mathematical models for the production of artistic objects, improving
   links among single artists, cultural operators, scientists and experts
   in digital technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines a hedonic regression model of digital camera prices
   using data collected from an internet price comparison service. We find
   that a small number of product characteristics explains most of the
   variation in camera prices. In addition, the model demonstrates
   substantial downward pressure on camera prices during the time period
   considered. We also examine technological innovation shocks to determine
   their impact on product prices. We find that the corresponding price
   reaction exhibits gradual adjustment over time, providing evidence of
   some degree of anticipation of the innovation, as well as a
   post-innovation price shock. This study also demonstrates the power of
   web-based shopping services as a new and novel source of data for
   econometric analysis.}},

Abstract = {{GIS (Geographical Information System) is one of the most striking
   innovation for mapping applications Supplied by the developing computer
   and software technology to users. GIS is a very effective tool which can
   show Visually combination of the geographical and non-geographical data
   by recording these to allow interpretations and analysis. DEM (Digital
   Elevation Model) is an inalienable component of the GIS. The existing TM
   (Topographic Map) can be used as the main data Source for generating DEM
   by amanual digitizing or vectorization process for the contours
   polylines. The aim of this study is to examine the DEM accuracies, which
   were obtained by TMs, as depending on the number of sampling points and
   grid size. For these purposes, the contours of the several 1/1000 scaled
   scanned topographical maps were vectorized. The different DEMs of
   relevant area have been created by using several datasets with different
   numbers of sampling points. We focused on the DEM creation from Contour
   lines using gridding with RBF (Radial Basis Function) interpolation
   techniques, namely TPS as the surface fitting model. The solution
   algorithm and a short review of the mathematical model of TPS (Thin
   Plate Spline) interpolation techniques are given. In the test Study,
   results of the application and the obtained accuracies are drawn and
   discussed. The initial object of this research is to discuss the
   requirement of DEM in GIS, urban planning, surveying engineering and the
   other applications with high accuracy (a few decimeters).}},

Abstract = {{Along post second semester of course 2007-08, at first time a new
   optional subject, Visual Ergonomics, was taught by b-learning
   methodology in Graduate of Optics and Optometry at the University of
   Alicante. In this word the some issues most outstanding both positive
   and negative, are described in this first implementation with a reduced
   group of students. The theoretical section was mainly developed by
   b-learning methodology interchanging on-class training, the most of them
   as feed-back, with virtual sessions supported by some web 2.0 digital
   tools as a blog, multimedia and interactive sessions, and team work
   (where teacher participates as one additional member, inside a strategy
   pre-conceived of situational leadership applied to classroom). The
   informal opinion polls, collected in course final, show that, in spite
   of the fact the students were conscious they had clearly approved this
   subject, the vast of them did not friendly accept so educational
   innovations in this short period. Then, as epilogue to this experience
   in education, this subject could not teach in course 2008-09 because any
   student is enrolled. Although this discipline is highly recommended from
   national guidelines for future Graduate in Optics and Optometry, it is
   not sure it continues at the University of Alicante. However, I hope the
   positive issues of this experience in education can be extrapolated with
   success in other pre and university degrees.}},

   freedom alignment.
   Findings - Automation using five degrees of motion freedom can more
   accurately assemble digital camera systems than previous 1 degree of
   freedom approaches. The approach is also more cost effective.
   Practical implications - Electronic camera systems can be assembled more
   quickly and accurately than with previous methods and with overall cost
   savings. Companies may also find that other high-accuracy devices can be
   assembled more precisely and cheaper using quick UV cure adhesives and
   vision systems for accurate placement.
   Originality/value - Digital camera/image systems will be more accurate
   and less costly, increasing the number of applications to which they can
   be applied.}},

Booktitle = {{AUTONOMIC COMMUNICATION}},

Pages = {{3-30}},
Abstract = {{Today, people are making use of several devices for communications, for
   accessing multi-media content services, for data/information retrieving,
   for processing. computing, etc.: examples are laptops, PDAs, mobile
   phones, digital cameras, mp3 players, smart cards and smart appliances.
   One of the most attracting service scenarios for future
   Telecommunications and Internet is the one where people will be able to
   browse any object in the environment they live: communications, sensing
   and processing of data and services will be highly pervasive. In this
   vision, people, machines, artifacts and the surrounding space will
   create a kind of computational environment and, at the same time, the
   interfaces to the network resources. A challenging technological issue
   will be interconnection and management of heterogeneous systems and a
   huge amount of small devices tied together in networks of networks.
   Moreover, future network and service infrastructures should be able to
   provide Users and Application Developers (at different levels, e.g.,
   residential Users but also SMEs. LEs, ASPs/Web2.0 Service Providers,
   ISPs, Content Providers, etc.) with the most appropriate
   ``environment{''} according to their context and specific needs.
   Operators must be ready to manage such level of complication enabling
   their platforms with technological advanced allowing network and
   services self-supervision and self-adaptation capabilities. Autonomic
   software solutions, enhanced with innovative bio-inspired mechanisms and
   algorithms, are promising areas of long term research to face such
   challenges. This chapter proposes a bio-inspired autonomic middleware
   capable of leveraging the assets of the underlying network
   infrastructure whilst, at the same time, supporting the development of
   future Telecommunications and Internet Ecosystems.}},

   generating modulated signals using a reconfigurable platform based on
   FPAA (Field Programmable Analogue Array). In the experiments it was used
   Anadigmvortex - AN221E04 circuit included in a development board
   connected to PC through a serial interface. For simulations of the
   implemented circuits it was used the software tools named
   AnadigmDesigner2 which benefits of an reach library of devices and

Abstract = {{Collective intelligence derives from the connection and the interaction
   of multiple, distributed, independent intelligent units via a network,
   such as, typically, a digital data network. As collective intelligences
   are effectively making their way into reality in consequence of
   ubiquitous digital communication, the opportunity and the challenge
   arise of extending their basic architecture in order to support higher
   thought-processes analogous to those characterizing human intelligences.
   We address here specifically the process of conceptual abstraction,
   namely the discovery of new concepts and ideas, and, to this purpose, we
   introduce the general functional notion of cognitive prosthesis
   supporting the implementation of a given thought-process in a collective
   intelligence. Since there exists a direct relationship between concept
   discovery and innovation in human intelligences, we point out how
   analogous innovation capabilities can now be supported for collective
   intelligences, with direct applications to Web-based innovation of
   products and services.}},

Abstract = {{This article will seek to introduce readers to an aspect of Canadian
   cultural life that is perhaps little known - printmaking - and, in
   particular, to three major figures It will explore how their work is
   representative of new, less traditional approaches to printmaking Most
   people think of printmaking as `traditional' art and it is true that
   traditional forms still have an important place However, printmakers
   have always been happy to adopt the latest commercial innovations, and
   adapt their traditional skills and concepts to take account of
   technological advances Much contemporary printmaking makes use of new
   technologies, especially digital print techniques This article will
   discuss contemporary printmakers Richard Lacroix, Barbara Zeigler and
   Wayne Eastcott, all of whom have introduced new technologies into their
   work and who, in certain cases, may be said to be at the cutting edge
   The article will also demonstrate how the work of these artists,
   although individualistic, reflects both their belief in collaboration
   and the accelerating internationalisation of art}},

Abstract = {{We extend the transformational model of social activity proposed in
   recent realist social theory by importing into it a theory of
   technological objects and technological change. The paper begins with an
   account of the transformational model, focusing particularly on the
   relationship between routines and social rules. We then outline a theory
   of what we call the `technical identity' of technological objects,
   drawing on the notion of collective assignments of agentive functions
   proposed by the philosopher John Searle. Finally, we link this theory to
   the transformational model and derive three broad categories of
   technological change. The framework as a whole is illustrated with
   empirical material drawn from a recent study of the shift from analogue
   photography to digital imaging in consumer photography.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that media and communications theory, as with cultural
   and creative industries analysis, can benefit from a deeper
   understanding of economic growth theory. Economic growth theory is
   elucidated in the context of both cultural and media studies and with
   respect to modern Chinese economic development. Economic growth is a
   complex evolutionary process that is tightly integrated with
   socio-cultural and political processes. This paper seeks to explore this
   mechanism and to advance cultural theory from an erstwhile
   political-economy perspective to one centred about the co-evolutionary
   dynamics of economic and socio-political systems. A generic model is
   presented in which economic and social systems co-evolve through the
   origination, adoption and retention of new ideas, and in which the
   creative industries are a key part of this process. The paper concludes
   that digital media capabilities are a primary source of economic
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The most of all Spanish (Valencia) online youths ages 12-17 are using
   online social networking sites (by interne and mobile technology),
   according to a new local survey of teenagers conducted by Valencia
   University, Fepad \& Polytechnic University of Valencia.
   The survey also finds that that older teens, particularly girls, are
   more likely to use these sites. For girls, social networking sites are
   places to reinforce pre-existing friendships, while for the boys who use
   the sites, the networks provide opportunities for flirting and making
   new friends.
   In both cases, the business relations in the future will be influenced
   by this new relation method, new business relationship assumed as
   ``digital natives{''} against the current ``digital immigrants{''} who
   have not so assumed like the first this network technology.
   The objective of his study is to present our research on the
   relationship between the new technology of Web 2.0 and the behaviour,
   personality of the teenagers who form the object of the study as well as
   the potential dependencies and the personal, academic and family
   disorders as a result of the abuse of these technologies, specifically
   via the mobile phone. The main objective is to explore how web-based
   technologies lessen or generate several types of disorder in today's
   society, particularly among teenagers.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, it is highly important for us to well organize, access, and
   store digital data in a way which is efficient and secure. Since there
   are many incidents which may cause the loss of important data, backing
   up and safe-keeping important data into some reliable and flexibly
   accessible media is an extremely important practice. In this paper we
   propose a Backward Web-feed Based Framework (BWBF) for supporting the
   automatic backup and restoration of important files by using an emerging
   web technology - the podcast technology. A sample BWBF based backup
   service designed and implemented to automatically and asynchronously
   backup files to (and restore files from) BWBF-based remote back-tip
   servers was described in this article.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescein angiography (FA) was discovered by Nowotny and Alvis in the
   1960s of the 20th century and has evolved to become the `Gold standard'
   for macular diagnostics. Scanning laser imaging technology achieved
   enhancement of contrast and resolution. The combined Heidelberg retina
   angiograph (HRA2) adds novel innovative features to established fundus
   cameras. The principle of confocal scanning laser imaging provides a
   high resolution of retinal and choroidal vasculature with low light
   exposure providing comfort and safety for the patient. Enhanced
   contrast, details and image sharpness image are generated using
   confocality. For the visualization of the choroid an indocyanine green
   angiography (ICGA) is the most suitable application. The main
   indications for ICGA are age-related macular degeneration, choroidal
   polypoidal vasculopathy and choroidal haemangiomas. Simultaneous digital
   FA and ICGA images with three-dimensional resolution offer improved
   diagnosis of retinal and choroidal pathologies. High-speed ICGA dynamic
   imaging can identify feeder vessels and retinal choroidal anastomoses,
   ensuring safer treatment of choroidal neovascularization.
   Autofluorescence imaging and fundus reflectance imaging with blue and
   infrared light offer new follow-up parameters for retinal diseases.
   Finally, the real-time optical coherence tomography provides a new level
   of accuracy for assessment of the angiographic and morphological
   correlation. The combination of various macular diagnostic tools, such
   as infrared, blue reflectance, fundus autofluorescence, FA, ICGA and
   also spectral domain optical coherence tomography, lead to a better
   understanding and improved knowledge of macular diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Newspapers are operating in increasingly competitive and fragmented
   markets for audiences and advertising revenues, government media policy
   and changing audience requirements for news and the ways in which it is
   presented and delivered. A growing army of bloggers and amateur citizen
   journalists now delivers - but rarely edits - content for all media
   platforms, while new media technologies, combined with the changing
   structure of global news industries, are radically changing the ways in
   which newspapers and media business functions and struggles for
   profitability. Our research sought to answer the question of how the
   internet is impacting on producer/consumer value activities in the news
   media supply chain. To answer this question initial descriptive
   statistical analysis was performed on 51 newspapers. This was followed
   by a focus group undertaken with London-based news media organizations
   and bloggers. The findings showed that in spite of initial fear and
   rejection, the internet is now firmly embedded in news media supply
   chain operations. Firms are now using the internet as an operant
   resource and working proactively with consumers to develop various forms
   of relationship value. We highlight the role of consumers in the
   creation of news (editorial) content and consumer-driven moves toward a
   merged media platform of distribution (including television, online,
   mobile and printed forms). Regional news media organizations will
   probably continue to survive if they are able to supply a highly
   specialized and `hyper local' community service. This will be in the
   form of `hybrid' content: analysis, interpretation and investigative
   reporting in a print product that appears less than daily combined with
   constant updating and reader interaction on the web.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method of
   ontology-based digital product data exchange. The digital product data
   are enriched with virtual prototype (VP) model information and the
   designed exchange process is discussed. Additionally, an algorithm
   enabling the ontology-based data exchange method among missile guide
   systems is proposed and analyzed.
   Design/methodology/approach - Semantic sevice-oriented architecture
   (SSOA) is an innovative integration architecture for digital product
   information integration and process integration. In digital product
   ontology layer of SSOA, a new method of ontology-based product data
   exchange is proposed. Compared with traditional information exchange,
   the method adds the VP's information to general digital products'
   information. The VP's information is described by building VP static
   structure ontology and dynamic behavior ontology. The exchange process
   of the novel method is discussed in detail. Finally, an example
   illustrating the data exchange among missile guide systems is given and
   the merits of the proposed method is analyzed.
   Findings - Simulation information, especially VP information, is not
   always well defined and taken into account by product data exchange
   systems such as product data management or product lifecycle management.
   A formal description of VP information is often required in efficient
   and effective product data exchange. The goal is to define VP structure
   and behavior ontologies to enable ontology-based digital product data
   exchange.
   Originality/value - Using VP information including structure information
   and behavior information, the paper provides a new method of digital
   product data exchange.}},

Abstract = {{The needs of digital divide for rural communities and the economics of
   currently available broadband access technologies, motivate for innovate
   and deploy new system designs and applications. The widely available and
   flexible WiFi technique meets the cost and suitability targets for rural
   broadband applications. To cope with the special requirements of rural
   communication, amendments of 802.11 standards at the MAC protocol level
   has been introduced. These amendments were important due to the
   shortcomings of WiFi over long distances under the power constraints.
   This paper proposes a new 802.11 point-to-multipoint (PMP) technique
   based on TDD/TDMA technique, this by using one of the access points in
   the system as centralized/gateway point to the others APs. The
   discussion includes the TDMA design, architecture on top of the
   conventional 802.11 MAC. The protocol convergence at the gateway between
   the access network and the backhaul is also presented. The simulation
   results present the performance analysis and validate the efficiency of
   the proposed scheme.}},

   client care experiences that focus on common alterations in health
   status. However, due to the unpredictability of client census within any

   But With the use of patient simulators in a dedicated Clinical
   Simulation Laboratory setting, students can be universally,

   connect theory with the clinical environment. Outcomes from using
   patient simulators include improved nursing knowledge base, enhanced

   information technology for using a Personal Digital Assistant and
   documenting care by means of an electronic Patient Record System. An

Abstract = {{IPTV services have been widely deployed by network operators around the
   world over the last years. Real-time streaming of Linear TV and
   Video-on-Demand (VoD) offerings, especially in the now more and more
   popular High Definition quality, however puts a high burden on the
   network and content servers concerning bandwidth, Quality-of-Service,
   processing performance and scalability if 100.000s of user have to be
   supported simultaneously. While multicast delivery can cope with some of
   these problems for Linear TV services, the unicast VoD services cannot
   take advantage of that and especially the request for on-demand content
   is expected to substantially grow in the future. With the introduction
   of Content Download Services (CDSs), operators now have the option to
   provide IPTV services in innovative ways: They can provide high-quality
   video services to users with limited access bandwidth, off-load the
   streaming request for blockbuster movies at peak times from the VoD
   servers or provided personalized advertisements for insertion into a
   live program event in advance to the users set-top box. The Digital
   Video Broadcast (DVB) Project has recently finalized its CDS
   specification. DVB CDS supports push and pull delivery models with
   unicast, multicast and peer-to-peer distribution to enable various
   business models and use cases. In this work we introduce the
   standardized technology, its architecture and map it to the use cases
   and business models.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the current study is to measure the level of ICT adoption
   among SMEs' in Malaysia and the factors that influence SMEs' favorable
   attitude and barriers that hinder them from adopting ICT in their
   business. SME is the heart of any national development both from an
   economy point of view as well as employment. ICT enterprises need
   creativity and innovations of a fast nature which is possible with the
   small sector. ICT also enables one to become a global player even in
   their greenfield project. The questions that arise are: Given this
   situation, ``Why are SMEs slow in adopting this vital tool for
   progress?{''} ``Why is the encouragement mediocre with no special focus
   into training and development and incentives created for them?{''} ``Why
   have there not been any TNA studies of this emerging area till date,
   while many other countries have reviewed and updated this area of study
   and are poised to make major breakthroughs?{''} ``Why are later entrants
   in this progressing much faster then Malaysia, who is actually targeting
   to become the knowledge leaders of the Asian region?{''} Though many of
   the areas would remain unaddressed in our study a fairly good glimpse is
   expected to be available to the researchers in this regard.
   Nevertheless, a study of the status is felt interesting and useful for
   academicians, policy makers and the industries attempting this
   development.
   Questionnaire responses were collected from 50 SME units' ICT status
   enabled consideration of the diverse uses of digital technology that
   already existed to support individuals, businesses and organizations use
   of information and knowledge management approaches. Research found that,
   most of the managers and supervisors of SMEs are aware of the benefits
   of ICT but yet a large portion of SMEs did not adopt ICT till date. This
   research also figured out the factors of ICT adoption, ICT planning of
   adoption, benefits of ICT adoption and barriers of ICT adoption among
   SMEs. Suggestions on the steps towards ICT adoption among SME has been
   discussed in this research. Therefore the change to ICT usage by SME
   sector is expected to open up a wide zone of operations favorable to the
   SME sector and other stakeholders, with a better business chance to all
   especially the SMEs adopting this initiative. It is left to the
   authorities to create a more favorable environment than presently

Abstract = {{Geographical information systems (GIS). recognised as instrumental in
   the documentation, mapping and analysis of spatial crime data. can
   provide a framework for the integration and analysis of spatial data
   whether remotely generated on a regional scale, around surveyed or
   sampled on a local scale at a crime scene. In this paper a missing
   person homicide case study is discussed to illustrate the role of
   spatial thinking in search methodologies and the application of GIS and
   spatial analysis techniques. Differential global positioning systems
   were used to collect data from an area of mixed moorland, bog and
   agricultural ground in the west of Ireland where police intelligence
   suggested human remains may have been hidden by a murderer. These data
   allowed the creation of a digital terrain model (DTM) at a resolution
   not achieved by conventional terrain mapping. The resultant topographic
   maps and 3D visualisations allowed a sector, or topographic domain.
   approach to be used at a scale finer than usual in geornorphology. This
   in turn allowed small water catchments to be defined. These data
   informed the sampling of shallow groundwater for carbon content and
   isotope analysis. Two anomalies were indicated, in places consistent
   with known criminal behaviour. The locations were surveyed by a ground
   penetrating radar system, and by a cadaver dog. Ground penetrating radar
   (GPR) failed to indicate any subsurface disturbance or grave, yet the
   cadaver dog indicated a point of interest close to the location of one
   anomaly identified from groundwater sampling. Further searching near
   this location failed to discover human remains. yet the isotope,
   topography and dog indications showed that some anomaly existed. This
   finding may be a false-positive, the result of previous excavation
   activity or that the remains had `returned to earth', in the light of
   the missing person never having been found. Regardless, the spatial
   search methodology described is an innovative combination of new
   technology, traditional landscape interpretation and hydrological
   chemical analysis. Adaptation, testing and use of this protocol for
   similar searches are recommended. The approach also has broader
   application to environmental, humanitarian and military investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Today's highly integrated System-on-Chips (SoC) demand innovative
   architectural modeling means to cope with their energy constraints. In
   this context, SystemC has become a well-established simulation tool for
   Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) in the integrated electronics industry
   but it lacks the support for power modeling. This paper introduces
   ActivaSC, a flexible, fast, transparent and non-intrusive extension to
   the SystemC class library which allows capturing the activity
   information of a digital system being modeled. This information can then
   be post-processed to estimate power consumption. ActivaSC avoids time
   consuming design iterations as designers can assess architectural design
   trade-offs based on system activity early in the design flow. ActivaSC
   does not require any code alterations nor a specific API, so that it can
   be used with any modeling style. Finally, several benchmark tests
   illustrate the superior efficiency of ActivaSC. A speed-up of up to 75\%
   in terms of elaboration overhead and 20\% in terms of simulation
   overhead is realized with respect to prior art.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging context of e-Science imposes new scenarios and requirements
   for digital preservation. In particular, the data must be reliably
   stored, for which redundancy is a key strategy. But managing redundancy
   must take into account the potential failure of component. Considering
   that correlated failures can affect multiple components and potentially
   cause a complete loss of data, we propose an innovative solution to
   manage redundancy strategies in heterogeneous environments such as data
   grids. This solution comprises a simulator that can be used to evaluate
   redundancy strategies according to preservation requirements and
   supports the process to design the best architecture to be deployed,
   which can latter be used as an observer of the deployed system,
   supporting its monitoring and management.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive scaling to nanometer CMOS technologies causes both analog and
   digital circuit parameters to degrade over time due to die-level stress
   effects (i.e. NBTI, HCI, TDDB, etc). In addition, failure-time
   dispersion increases due to increasing process variability. In this
   paper an innovative methodology to simulate analog circuit reliability
   is presented. Advantages over current state of the art reliability
   simulators include, among others, the possibility to estimate the impact
   of variability and the ability to account for the effects of complex
   time-varying stress signals. Results show that taking time-varying
   stress signals into account provides circuit reliability information not
   visible with classic DC-only reliability simulators. Also,
   variability-aware reliability simulation results indicate a significant
   percentage of early circuit failures compared to failure-time results
   based on nominal design only.}},

   collars, engineers, office workers). It is a corporate laboratory in a
   large industry, where natural activity of real users is observed in a
   continuous manner in various spaces (project space, meeting room,
   lounge, etc.) The RAO room, an augmented meeting room, is used daily for
   ``normal{''} meetings; it is also the ``mother room{''} of all augmented
   meeting rooms in the company, where new systems, services, and devices
   are tested. The LDC has gathered a unique set of data on the use of AE,
   and developed various observation and design techniques, described in
   this chapter. LDC uses novel techniques of digital ethnography, some of
   which were invented there (SubCam, offsat) and some of which were
   developed elsewhere and adapted (360 degrees video, WebDiver, etc.). At
   LDC, some new theories have also been developed to explain behavior and
   guide innovation: cognitive attractors, experimental reality, and the

Abstract = {{Wise management of natural resources has become a fundamental challenge
   nowadays. Cooperative approaches are needed in order to provide a
   sustainable framework for stimulating the individual awareness and
   participation towards common environmental objectives. In order to reach
   mutually beneficial outcomes, public administrations, companies,
   individuals and communities will need to organize for managing their
   aggregated consumption, reducing unnecessary use of scarce resources.
   This is especially true in the field of energy management where the
   bounded nature of the resources and the behavioural impact of the
   stakeholders on the overall system both play a fundamental role. The
   proposed research aims at contributing to what remains a challenging
   issue across disciplines: explaining the evolution of cooperation among
   unrelated individuals in human societies. We utilize an evolutionary
   game theoretic modelling framework to identify conditions under which
   collaboration among energy end-users mediated by information and
   communication technologies (ICT) will support its sustainable
   exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports industry concentration measures for the South African
   manufacturing sector over the 1972-1996 period for the three digit
   industry classification. Noted are high level of industry concentration
   in South African manufacturing, and a rising trend in concentration
   across a wide range of industries as measured by the Gini coefficient,
   though some countervailing evidence emerges on the Rosenbluth index,
   Analytically the paper examines the impact of concentration on
   employment and investment rates. Results show that increased
   concentration unambiguously lowers employment. For investment rates,
   increased inequality of market share serves to raise investment rates,
   while falling firm numbers for any given inequality of market share
   lowers investment rates. The difference is consistent with a
   disciplining effect of a competitive fringe of firms on the behaviour of
   large firms in a market. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the results of analysis for the applications of the
   European Union financial instruments in the execution of actions
   performed within sectoral operational programmes aimed at the
   development of the information society, with the specific inclusion of
   rural areas. The effectiveness of activities in the area of development
   of the information society is determined by the IT level indicators such
   as: computer hardware availability, Internet access, IT skills of
   citizens, access to public services provided electronically, etc.
   Following Poland's accession to the European Union there has already
   been some progress in the development of the information society which
   is seen in: the growth in the number of rural households having computer
   equipment (up by 21\%) and the increase in the households with Internet
   access (by 14\%). Structural funds like the ERDF, the ESF, and the EAGGF
   have significantly contributed; however, the level of their absorption
   is unsatisfactory. The majority of projects approved for the years
   2004-2007 were low-budget ones, poorly innovative and having a local
   appeal. Beneficiaries of such projects were focused on satisfying their
   primary needs relating to the purchase of hardware and software. For
   elimination the `digital divide' between urban and rural areas more

Abstract = {{Dealing effectively with information and communication technology in the
   information society is a complex task and the human dimension is often
   under-estimated. This paper tries to give a voice to some managers about
   their experiences with information, communication and technology in
   their working environment, which involves participating in a learning
   organisation, knowledge management and communities of practice,
   competency management, ICT-Security awareness management as well as and
   innovation and change management. Managers of a large governmental
   organisation in the Netherlands were polled in a questionnaire
   requesting their responses in using ICT as well as involvement in the
   above categories. The responses of 246 of them were analysed. It was
   found that they knew full well that their strongest need was for a
   conceptual understanding of the implications of ICT in their changed
   work environment. This need overarched the elementary end-user training
   needs of what buttons to press to achieve what end. The research
   findings emphasize that as education is increasingly need-driven instead
   of content-driven it is necessary to reconsider the curricula of higher
   educational institutes especially with regards to management training.
   Furthermore, this research highlights a need for on the job training and
   performance support for middle managers.}},

Title = {{A dynamic RSS information push service mechanism based on ontology of
   user information needs}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{222-236}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This aim of this article is to propose a technical solution
   for digital libraries to establish the information needs ontology based
   on a comprehensive understanding of personalized user information needs
   and offer an information push service by really simple syndication (RSS)
   in a ubiquitous computing environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, the authors formalize an ontology
   model applicable to the ubiquitous computing environment to describe
   user information needs comprehensively. The information needs related to
   the user's research activities are regarded as the ontology, which is
   described with web ontology language (OWL), and thus an ontology
   knowledgebase is established. Second, in light of the user's explicit
   information needs, the digital library finds the hidden information
   needs from the ontology knowledgebase, and also extracts the information
   resources required by the user from the corresponding database and then
   pushes them to the user by means of RSS. Finally, users can browse
   through a man-machine interface to access the information.
   Findings - After these steps, an RSS information push service
   architecture is established based on the user information needs
   ontology, providing the users with dynamic, personalized and proactive
   information services.
   Originality/value - The innovation of this research lies in the fact
   that the architecture that is put forward is helpful to improve the
   accuracy and integrity of information push service of digital library,
   and is also beneficial for the research on u-library.}},

Title = {{From information commons to knowledge commons Building a collaborative
   knowledge sharing environment for innovative communities}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{247-257}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Based on the information commons service model, the aim of
   this article is to propose a new model for knowledge commons. It seeks
   to define the conceptual model and constructing framework of knowledge
   commons, which aim for a collaborative knowledge-sharing environment to
   support innovative community activities of university library.
   Design/methodology/approach - By analyzing the innovation activities of
   communities, infusing theories of knowledge management, collaboration
   and Library 2.0, the knowledge commons conceptual model is brought
   forward to improve communication, collaboration, sharing and
   conversation.
   Findings - Since the innovative community is interdisciplinary and
   cross-campus, the scattered research team and study group requires a
   library to extend the services to a logical system, while the virtual
   layer is to make this spatial decentralized and logically centralized
   system a reality. The core elements, namely information technology,
   organization and management, culture and spirit, make up the supporting
   layer, of which, trust and collaboration culture for innovation is
   important.
   Practical implications - Research work and practice of information
   commons and library 2.0 have aroused a new round of the library service
   movement, while the knowledge commons conceptual model would provide
   steering for a knowledge sharing environment.
   Originality/value - In this paper, the new model is based on information
   commons and assimilating the theories of knowledge management,
   collaboration and Library 2.0, intended to integrate digital library,
   physical resource, virtual resource and human resource into a whole. It
   is of great importance for the library to serve education and scientific
   research well.}},

   libraries}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{258-270}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to put forward a completely new
   academic library service mode called ``Innovation community{''} in light
   of current information environment, social background and user demands.
   ``Innovation community{''} is a mode especially suitable for academic
   libraries, aimed at supporting the cultivation of innovation ability,
   encouraging user participation, joint construction, interaction and
   communication, designing different theme communities and organizing
   supporting services and activities so that both libraries and users can
   become entities of independent innovation. At the same time, this paper
   seeks to elaborate on the development of ideas on constructing this new
   mode of ``Innovation community{''} by taking the IC(2) mode and its
   auxiliary innovation support plan put forward by Shanghai Jiaotong
   University Library as a practice case.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts the research methodology
   that combines situation analysis and theoretical explanation, model
   exhibition and case study.
   Findings - It is found that ``Innovation community{''} is a kind of
   library service mode especially suitable for learning and research
   groups with a demand for innovation. Under an e-science and e-education
   environment, libraries construct an environment and platform for
   promoting communication and cooperation and supporting interdisciplinary
   study and research innovation, and more effectively promoting knowledge
   discovery, research innovation and exploitation of tacit knowledge
   through individualized design and service of theme communities.
   Research limitations/implications - IC(2)@SJTUL, the practice case of
   ``Innovation community{''}, has only constructed an environment at
   present, and the first term of this plan has not been completed.
   Therefore, evaluation of the actual operation effect cannot be made
   until later, and its actual effect has to be tested after a period of
   operation.
   Originality/value - From a new perspective, this paper elaborates on the
   intention, elements and primary characteristics of ``Innovation
   community{''} and studies a typical practice case.}},

Pages = {{298-307}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss how to make libraries
   adjust their roles in the digital age through exploring changing user
   needs and expectations, and utilizing libraries' distinctive advantages,
   so that library resources can be much better used and library users can
   be best served.
   Design/methodology/approach - Library user surveys were conducted by
   Peking University Library from 2006-2007. The surveys are partially
   analyzed to reveal user needs and the relevant responses.
   Findings - Based on the surveys and related studies, the changing user
   needs and expectations can be seen: a single point of discovery for all
   resources from anywhere at anytime; a simple, intuitive user interface
   and good results; seamless services to ensure resources immediately
   available; open platform and easy user communication; convenient
   self-services and personalized services; and embedding library services
   into users' workflows. From these needs and expectations, libraries,
   particularly those serving academic communities, need to reassess their
   roles to offer services in innovative ways.
   Originality/value - The paper highlights the needs and expectations of
   library users using a holistic approach while providing services.

Title = {{Smart Client approaches to digital archiving of e-journals}},

Pages = {{837-845}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a
   research project under-taken by Prosentient Systems and partially funded
   by the ALIA 2007 research study grant. The focus of the project was a
   proof-of-concept implementation of a Smart Client application for
   digital archiving of e-journal subscriptions held by special libraries.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research comprised a survey of
   libraries in the area of electronic journal archiving and software
   development research. The quantitative survey was distributed to 254
   member libraries of the GratisNet and GLASS special library networks in
   Australia. Seven questions explored current practice in e-journal
   archiving. In total, 164 responses were received, of which only seven
   indicated current progress toward e-journal archiving. Based on the
   survey results, the second phase of the project comprised software
   development research.
   Findings - The research outcomes indicate that a cross-platform ``Smart
   Client{''} approach to e-journal archiving is achievable and the
   presentation will review architectural design techniques that support
   cross-platform deployment and simple installation using open source
   smart client tools.
   Practical implications - The transition to e-journal subscriptions has
   not been matched with attention to methods for local archiving of
   e-journal subscriptions. This research demonstrates the feasibility of
   simple solutions suitable for special libraries to implement local
   e-journal archives.
   Originality/value - This research presents an innovative approach to
   e-journal archiving for special libraries. The approach differs from
   current, peer-to-peer approach by implementing a central metadata server
   and a simple easy to deploy desktop archiving agent. Furthermore,
   limitations imposed by copyright restrictions are the principal
   impediment that libraries face in implementing e-journal archives, and
   the centralised metadata approach can help libraries distinguish
   journals for which local archiving is allowed.}},

Abstract = {{Cataract surgery with IOL implantation is performed on millions of
   patients every year. Despite 25 years of technological innovation,
   post-surgical refractive errors have remained a problem. Now these
   errors can be corrected using Calhoun Vision, Inc's light adjustable
   lens (LAL). The correction is accomplished by implanting a
   light-sensitive lens, then illuminating it with a spatially varying
   irradiance profile during a postoperative treatment. This irradiance
   profile is provided by a Light Delivery Device (LDD), which projects an
   image of a Texas Instruments DMD onto the implanted lens. Commercial
   sales of this system began in the summer of 2008 in Europe; US clinical
   trials began in January 2009.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic invoicing (e-invoicing) refers to the sending and receiving
   of invoices by electronic means. Small and media sized enterprises
   (SMEs) have not accepted e-invoicing to the same extent as large
   companies and the public sector in Sweden. The purpose of present study
   was to gain a better understanding of the acceptance of e-invoicing in
   SMEs, particularly small business, by describing the factors that affect
   e-invoicing in SMEs in rural at-ea. The study is a part of a going oil
   project ``The Digital Age in Rural and Remote Areas{''} DARRA. We
   proposed a research model that found significant ill prior research and
   grouped them into four different factors; organisational readiness,
   external pressure, owner/manager characteristics, and perceived benefit
   ill the perception of e-invoicing in SMEs. To validate the model we
   collected data from owners/managers of SMEs by using a Survey. The main
   results from Present Study indicate that SMEs are ready for acceptance
   of e-invoicing. Pressure from customers is considered to be an important
   factor for e- invoicing acceptance in SMEs. Furthermore, the SMEs
   perceive that acceptance of e-invoicing can be beneficial, and lead to
   increased internal efficiency as well as impact on business processes
   and relationships. The innovativeness of the owner/manager was also
   found to influence acceptance of e-invoicingul}},

   (DD) and we pay a special attention to its relation with disabled
   people. We emphasise on the importance of the fight against the DD and
   we report a number of projects that aim to reduce it in Catalonia
   (Spain). The main contribution of this work is the study of the DD from
   the point of view of the relation between Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICTs) and disabled people. We analyse the problems that
   disabled people have to face in order to use ICTs. Therefore, we have
   defined a number of measures to determine the degree of accessibility
   that a given user has and we have carried out some experiments to
   evaluate the proposed measures. Our work is deeply related with the
   Omnia Project and the telecentres network impelled by the Catalan
   Government. Thus, we must understand Our work in the context of these
   innovative initiatives. In this chapter we concentrate oil the
   Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) issues related to the DD in order to
   explain our experience in this field. At the time of writing this text,
   the experimental part is still in progress, however some previous
   results are given. Moreover the current work and experiences are also

Abstract = {{Modern companies are nowadays confronted with an increasing demand of
   multiple products, where they need to perform more flexible every day.
   Cost-intensive decisions are to be confirmed in short times, in order to
   minimize risks and secure efficient production programs as well as
   material flows. Tools for this digital planning via simulation methods
   are one well established possibility to receive decision support.
   Nevertheless, the creation of the necessary simulation models is a
   complicated and error-prone process, where complexity of modeling,
   validation and verification depends on the used tool and its
   functionalities. This paper presents implemented concepts for an
   innovative user support in his tasks of verification and validation of
   simulation models during the execution of a simulation run.
   Time-intensive procedures like stopping simulation, parameterization and
   restarting within the problem analysis are simplified. So the user is
   able to focus on the real problem solving task.}},

Abstract = {{Managing the development and delivery Of Multilingual electronic library
   services is one of the major current challenges for making digital
   content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable. Digital
   libraries and OPAC-based traditional libraries are the most important
   source of reliable information used daily by scholars, researchers,
   knowledge workers and citizens to carry on their working (and leisure)
   activities. Facilitating access to Multilingual document collections
   therefore is an important way of supporting the dissemination of
   knowledge and Cultural content. CACAO offers an innovative approach for
   accessing, understanding and navigating multilingual textual content in
   digital libraries and OPACs, enabling European users to better exploit
   the available European electronic content. This paper describes the

Abstract = {{The main objective of e-NVISION consortium is the development and
   validation of an innovative c-Business platform enabling Construction
   SMEs to model and adapt particular business scenarios; to integrate all
   their enterprise applications and to incorporate legal, economical,
   social and cultural services, with the final goal of facilitating their
   participation in the Future European e-Business Scenario.
   The e-NVISION consortium has decided for a bottom-up approach from the
   construction SMEs standpoint of view. Therefore the definition of future
   scenarios has been based on the know-how (knowledge and experience) of
   the SMEs involved in the project and how they would like to work in the
   future.
   On the other hand the ``State of the Art{''} research has been done to
   guarantee that the work developed is in the line proposed by other
   experts. e-NVISION has looked into the following sources:
   the European Construction Technology Platform (ECTP) 2030 vision, - the
   e-Business w@tch reports in the construction sector,
   the Current state in c-Procurement and c-Quality regarding
   standardization and policies,
   other European projects (mainly from Digital Ecosystem (DE) cluster).
   e-NVISION Partners have selected four scenarios, where e stands both for
   envisioning and electronic:
   1. e-Tendering scenario focused oil two of the main concerns of the
   government bodies which are to encourage more SMEs to respond to tender
   notices as well as to ensure transparency in public processes.
   2. e-Site scenario dealing with delays in the construction works and
   aimed to solve this problem by improving the companies' coordination in
   the construction time.
   3. e-Procurement scenario providing an effective and rational supplier
   selection model to discover, evaluate and select potential vendors.
   4. e-Quality scenario aimed to provide an e-Quality model based on three
   other scenarios. Resulting from those scenarios Quality Assurance
   Program will describe quality requirements and how to fulfill them.
   The selection has been made basing on twelve project management
   construction processes and has taken into account both the Strategic
   Research Agenda (SRA) proposed by the ECTP and recommendations from
   e-Business W@tch. The four selected scenarios aim to provide envisioning
   business services enhancing and stimulating SME involvement in
   construction projects. These scenarios for the future include not only
   the supply-chain actors, but also other external actors, as regulation
   providers, quality certification bodies, and so on ({''}external
   services{''}). Also the integration with the internal applications is
   considered in order to have a holistic view of the business processes.
   e-NVISION scenarios path the way to envision the capability of business
   development in the construction relying on the use or the integration of
   ICTs. Finally, the e-NVISION technical approach for the development of
   the scenarios defined can be summarized as follows:
   B2B approach call help SMEs to solve their daily problems instead of a
   centralized approach. Our aim is to isolate SMEs (suppliers and
   Subcontractors) from the complexity of the centralized systems
   available, which are focused mainly on the necessities of big companies.
   Ontology is the keystone of the dependence between documents and their
   collection and structuring (collected by the system and based on a
   model), actions (followed-up by the schedule), and company profile
   (defining business capabilities of the company and requirements or
   target for future market or project).
   The future business platform should describe the services using a
   semantic Web approach, taking into consideration the technical and
   business view points. This will allow in the future to discover the
   services needed in real time, making the business platform adaptable and
   completely independent of the technical details of the service
   providers.}},

Abstract = {{The convergence of services and technologies has been driven by service
   and network providers with the aim to develop a unified infrastructure.
   From the services side, we have multimedia through unicast, multicast
   and broadcast services. From the technologies side, we have wired and
   wireless technologies, including unidirectional technologies such as
   Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB). These trends allied to the increasing
   mobility and QoS demands, introduce strong requirements to future
   telecommunication networks.
   This paper presents an innovative approach to handle multicast services
   in a heterogeneous networks environment, including broadcast
   technologies. The presented architecture aims at guaranteeing end-to-end
   QoS in mobile scenarios, efficiently handling the underlying network
   resources and integrating the emerging broadcast technologies. This
   architecture was developed in a real environment with mobility of
   multicast sessions through heterogeneous technologies, Wi-Fi and DVB,
   using also Wi-Fi as a return channel. The results show that the
   architecture is able to support the seamless mobility of users receiving
   multicast sessions, with low degradation on the running communications.}},

Abstract = {{LiTPiCs were proposed as a marriage of two innovative technologies -
   light-trails and photonic integrated circuits - as a solution to extend
   metro networks in regional domains and provide dynamism in bandwidth
   allocation for emerging services. Light-trails which are a generalized
   lightpath, essentially formed by an optical bus provide sub-wavelength
   optical grooming and facilitate dynamic bandwidth allocation amongst
   constituent nodes. Communication within a light-trail is all-optical
   thereby limiting their reach to a few node-spans. In parallel, photonic
   integrated circuits were developed that proposed the system on a chip
   concept enabling 3R regeneration of optical signal using embedded lasers
   and receivers on a single Indium Phosphide substrate. PIC technology has
   given rise to the concept of digital optical networks - which have the
   capability to increase reach and commoditize metro networks. By
   conjoining the light-trail and PIC technologies we proposed LiTPiC which
   is essentially preserves light-trail properties while enhancing their
   reach. In this paper we study algorithms for scheduling traffic in a
   LiTPiC. We consider both the static case and the dynamic case - when
   traffic is known and not known apriori. Further we will establish a
   lower and upper bound that would facilitate an evaluation procedure of
   our algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Digital information management is the key enabler for unprecedented rise
   in productivity and efficiency gains experienced by the, world economies
   during the 21st century. Information processing systems have thus become
   essential to the functioning of business, service, academic, and
   governmental institutions. As institutions increase their offerings of
   digital information services, the demand for computation and storage
   capability also increases. Examples include online banking, e-filing of
   taxes, music and video downloads, online shipment tracking, real-time
   inventory/supply-chain management, electronic medical recording,
   insurance database management, surveillance and disaster recovery. It is
   estimated that, in some industries, the number of records that must be
   retained is growing at a CAGR of 50 percent or greater. This exponential
   increase in the digital intensity of human existence is driven by many
   factors, including ease of use and availability of a rich set of
   information technology (IT) devices and services. Indeed, it would be
   difficult to imagine how significant societal transformations that
   better our world could occur without the productivity and innovation
   enabled by the IT. Unfortunately, the energy cost and carbon footprint
   of the IT devices and services has become exorbitant. Moreover, current
   technological and digital service utilization trends result in a
   doubling of the energy cost of the IT infrastructure and its carbon
   footprint in less than five years. In an energy-constrained world, this
   consumption trend is unsustainable and comes at increasingly
   unacceptable societal and environmental costs. This presentation will
   first explain what is meant by green computing and how ``greenness{''}
   of information processing may be quantified. Next, energy-efficient
   computing paradigms which utilize chip multi-processing,
   multiple-voltage domains, dynamic voltage/frequency scaling, and
   power/clock gating techniques will be reviewed. Finally, techniques for
   improving performance per Watt of large-scale information processing and
   storage systems (e.g., a data center), including hierarchical dynamic
   power management, task placement and scheduling, energy balancing,
   resource virtualization, and application optimizations that dynamically
   configure hardware for higher efficiency will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Global ICT programs are defined as new and universal modes of organizing
   mediated by technology and enacted through a novel mix of policy
   instruments, international institutions, business interests, and
   techno/managerial concepts. Largely unexplored in the various fields
   studying innovation and digital technologies, such programs are of
   interest, not least because of their projected ability to promote
   innovation and help achieve new mechanisms of governance at local,
   national, and global scale. Based on relevant information systems
   research, this paper argues that we need a new theoretical understanding
   for the study of such programs and in order to explore their potential
   as a means of technology transfer and innovation in the developed and
   developing world. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Digital Homecare}},
Booktitle = {{HANDBOOK OF DIGITAL HOMECARE}},
Series = {{Series in Biomedical Engineering}},
Year = {{2009}},
Pages = {{151-178}},
Abstract = {{Collaborative Work plays an important role in today's organizations,
   especially in areas where decisions must be made. However, any decision
   that involves a collective or group of decision makers is, by itself
   complex, but is becoming recurrent in recent years. In this work we
   present the VirtualECare project, an intelligent multi-agent system able
   to monitor, interact and serve its customers, which are, normally, in
   need of care services. In last year's there has been a substantially
   increase on the number of people needed of intensive care, especially
   among the elderly, a phenomenon that is related to population ageing.
   However, this is becoming not exclusive of the elderly, as diseases like
   obesity, diabetes and blood pressure have been increasing among young
   adults. This is a new reality that needs to be dealt by the health
   sector, particularly by the public one. Given this scenarios, the
   importance of finding new and cost effective ways for health care
   delivery are of particular importance, especially when we believe they
   should not to be removed from their natural ``habitat{''}. Following
   this line of thinking, the VirtualECare project will be presented, like
   similar ones that preceded it. Recently we have also assisted to a
   growing interest in combining the advances in information society -
   computing, telecommunications and presentation - in order to create
   Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS). Indeed, the new economy, along
   with increased competition in today's complex business environments,
   takes the companies to seek complementarities in order to increase
   competitiveness and reduce risks. Under these scenarios, planning takes
   a major role in a company life. However, effective planning depends on
   the generation and analysis of ideas (innovative or not) and, as a
   result, the idea generation and management processes are crucial. Our
   objective is to apply the above presented GDSS to a new area. We believe
   that the use of GDSS in the healthcare arena will allow professionals to
   achieve better results in the analysis of one's Electronically Clinical
   Profile (ECP). This achievement is vital, regarding the explosion of
   knowledge and skills, together with the need to use limited resources
   and get better results.}},

Journal = {{HERMES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Number = {{53}},
Pages = {{41+}},
Abstract = {{Virtual worlds, whether multiplayer online games or three-dimensional
   virtual worlds like Second Life, crystallize a multitude of hopes, fears
   and fantasies that are linked with technological innovation, with
   contemporary forms of identity and their management, and with
   developments in communication media. Today's unregulated uses of the
   avatar concept and associated projections reveal the paradoxes that
   arise when we attempt to understand new practices and technologies.
   However, the avatar only partially represents the way people function in
   a digital world, and any systemic study therefore needs to specify the
   extent of the subject's presence in a virtual world, in order to give a
   clearer idea of what is personal data in this specific context. How are
   these virtual identities and items of information managed, treated and
   individually and collectively apprehended, by Web surfers themselves and
   by the technical and industrial spheres concerned?}},

Abstract = {{Though increasingly adopted in different countries our current knowledge
   concerning the global adoption of electronic Human Resource Management
   (e-HRM) is limited at present. In particular, it is unclear whether
   e-HRM is a universal management practice or whether there are regional
   differences in the organizational adoption of e-HRM. The present paper
   therefore aims at an initial examination of this question, by a)
   elaborating the general foundations of global e-HRM and b) developing
   some basic propositions on global e-HRM. Discussing the foundations
   uncovers an ambitious and voluminous research task. Based on an analysis
   of basic institutional and cultural influences major results are the
   digital divide, contextual openness, and functional congruence of e-HRM.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the dynamic performance of digital-to-analog converters (DAC)
   is challenging due to the limited resolution of flash analog-to-digital
   converters (ADC) that are used for the scope. Current solutions are
   either difficult to be implemented in practice or suffer from serious
   limitations due to the uncertainty of the hardware utilized. The paper
   present an innovative method for testing the dynamic performance of a
   DAC that uses a low resolution ADC just as the other solutions, but
   exploits it to digitize an amplified version of the error signal,
   instead of the DAC output signal. The limitations due to the hardware
   are thus overcome. The results of a number of simulations confirm the
   feasibility of the proposed method.}},

   graduate education. Meanwhile digital libraries can provide instructors
   and students with a repository of digital resources that have been peer
   reviewed and checked for accuracy and authenticity. We take the
   knowledge maps as a tool to combine the digital resources and the
   e-Learning environment. Knowledge maps can integrate the related digital
   resources, which will make the way of looking for the resources and the
   relationship of knowledge turn to the form of map so that the learners
   can better understand it. In this process we use the RDF, ontology
   language, XML etc. standards and technology and digital library can
   provide API to the knowledge maps. The application of knowledge maps can
   construct the macrostructure of knowledge and help the graduates form
   their knowledge system and obtain knowledge. With the help of the
   knowledge maps, the graduates' innovation ability will be trained well.}},

Abstract = {{In the networked economy firms are recognizing the power of the Internet
   as a platform for creating different forms of relationships and
   collaborations aimed to enhance value and achieve a sustainable
   competitive advantage. Digital Marketplaces represent one of the most
   powerful solutions adopted by firms to support the networking practices
   among firms, especially among SMEs. However in developing countries the
   potentialities of digital marketplaces remains largely unexploited.
   Different human, organizational and technological factors, issues and
   problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and
   appropriate approaches. This article argues that in order for firms in
   developing countries to benefit from digital marketplace platforms it is
   necessary to root them in an assessment study which permits to
   understand the firms preparedness to use the digital marketplace in
   terms of technological infrastructure, human resources' capabilities and
   skills, integration and innovation level among firms. Based on the
   outcomes of this assessment it is then possible to find out a viable
   digital marketplace model that fits with actual readiness status of
   firms and helps them to develop progressively the necessary resources
   and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness in the current digital
   economic landscape.}},

Abstract = {{In order to develop the core chip supporting binocular stereo displays
   for head-mounted display (HMD) and glasses-TV, a VLSI design scheme is
   proposed by using pipeline architecture for 3D display processing chip
   (HMD100B). Some key techniques including stereo display processing and
   high precision video scaling based on bicubic interpolation, and their
   hardware implementations are presented. A new method of field rate
   up-conversion for analog stereo video signal (CVBS) is proposed, and it
   can eliminate the large area of flicker. The proposed HMD100B chip is
   verified by FPGA, and the stereo display image is clear. As one of
   innovative and high integration SoC chip, HMD100B is designed by digital
   and analog mixed circuit. It can support binocular stereo display, has
   better scaling effect and integration. Hence it is applicable in virtual
   reality (VR), 3D games and other microdisplay domains.}},

Abstract = {{With the rise of global competition, innovation through new ventures and
   products are seen as a vital part of industrialized nations' quest to
   sustain economic growth. An integral part of fostering continued
   innovation are improvements in the new product development and project
   management process - as research has shown that for new ventures these
   two areas are key factors for success. This rise of social networking,
   digital design tools, and virtual teams are setting the stage for a
   transformation in how products are developed. New product development
   has historically been a `push system,' with individuals and teams
   transmitting information and waiting for feedback. We propose methods
   and tools that will leverage social networking and shift the paradigm of
   product development from a `push' to a `pull' system where communities
   can actively drive input to the project, rather than respond to active
   requests. This article proposes a collaborative Web 2.0 environment that
   will foster improved communication, design solutions, and innovation
   speed.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual Prototyping is an important tool to verify and optimize product
   properties in the early design phases. By using digital product models
   many simulations of the system behavior can be carried out (instead of
   physical testing) and therefore development cost and time can be
   reduced. For the development of innovative complex technical systems the
   applied models should comprehend the most important product properties.
   Today there are still deficits in modeling and evaluating the acoustical
   behavior of technical products which is particular important for
   consumer goods and automobile industries.
   A flexible audio-visual projection system was configured which combines
   stereoscopic visualization in a CAVE with a new spatial acoustic
   reproduction method: wave-field-synthesis (WFS). This technology enables
   a realistic sound impression which is independent of the position of the
   listener. For this, a scene representation is needed that provides the
   sound reproduction synchronously with the visualization of machinery,
   cars and other technical systems.
   This paper describes the goals of the new audio-visual Virtual Reality
   (VR)-system and its use as an innovative tool for a realistic
   representation and presentation of audio-visual product properties, even
   in early design phases. The paper is mainly focused on methods to
   describe acoustical product properties of technical systems for an
   interactive presentation in real-time Virtual Reality during design
   process.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient and safe performance of nuclear power plants of the future
   requires remote monitoring, control, and condition-based maintenance in
   order to maximize their capacity factor. Small and medium reactors, in
   the 50-500 MWe power range, may become commonplace for certain
   applications, with a design features for remote deployment. Such a
   reactor may be part of a smaller electrical grid, and deployed in areas
   with limited infrastructure. Typical applications include power
   generation, process heat for water desalination, and co-generation.
   There are other considerations in the deployment of these reactors:
   development of effective I\&C to support nuclear fuel security
   monitoring, longer than normal fuel cycle length, and increased autonomy
   in plant operation and maintenance.
   A Model Predictive Controller (M PC) for the IRIS (International Reactor
   Innovative and Secure) system has been developed as a multivariate
   control strategy for reactor power regulation and the control of the
   helical coil steam generator (HCSG) used in IRIS. A MATLAB-SIMULINK
   model of the integral reactor was developed and used to demonstrate the
   design of the MPC. The two major control actions are the control rod
   reactivity perturbation and the steam control valve setting. The latter
   is used to regulate the set point value of the superheated steam. The
   MPC technique minimizes the necessity of on-line controller tuning, and
   is highly effective for remote and autonomous control actions.
   As an important part of the instrumentation \& control (I\&C) strategy,
   sensor placement in next generation reactors needs to be addressed for
   both control design and fault diagnosis. This approach is being applied
   to the IRIS system to enhance the efficiency of reactor monitoring that
   would assist in a quick and accurate identification of faults. This is
   achieved by solving the problem from the fault diagnosis perspective,
   rather than treating the sensor placement as a pure optimization
   problem. The solution to the problem of sensor placement may be broadly
   divided into two tasks: (1) fault modeling or prediction of cause-effect
   behavior of the system, generating a set of variables that are affected
   whenever a fault occurs, and (2) use of the generated sets to identify
   sensor locations based on various design criteria, such as
   observability, resolution, reliability, etc. The proposed algorithm is
   applied to the design of a sensor network for the IRIS system using
   multiple design criteria. This enables the designer to obtain a good
   preliminary design without extensive quantitative information about the
   process.
   The control technique will be demonstrated by application to a real
   process with actuators and associated device time delays. A multivariate
   flow control loop has been developed with the objective of demonstrating
   digital control implementation using proportional-integral controllers
   for water level regulation in coupled tanks. The controller
   implementation includes self-tuning, control mode selection under device
   or instrument fault, automated learning, on-line fault monitoring and
   failure anticipation, and supervisory control.
   The paper describes the integration of control strategies,
   fault-tolerant control, and sensor placement for the IRIS system, and
   demonstration of the technology using an experimental control loop.}},

Abstract = {{Screen-based human-machine interfaces, having been standard for many
   years in most process industries, are now also well acknowledged in the
   main control room of nuclear power plants. Being a standard feature of
   digital I\&C systems, they offer significant benefits and interesting
   options for control room design, but also constitute challenges for the
   designer.
   Attractive opportunities for the designer and operator are for example
   the minimization of equipment, compared to design of hardwired panels,
   the reduction of cabling and cable separation issues, the flexibility
   and increased possibility for customization to specific utilities and
   operator needs
   However, this flexibility brings also new challenges to the design, for
   new builds as well as for plant modernization projects, such as ensuring
   overall situation awareness of the operator, in spite the intrinsically
   serial character of information presentation, and the need to integrate
   different, even diverse digital human-machine interfaces of the safety
   and non-safety I\&C systems.
   The reference concept of AREVA NP for all projects involving control
   room design relies on an overall I\&C architecture, based on the
   TELEPERM XS for safety I\&C systems, and Siemens SPPA T2000. SPPA
   12000's OM690 screen-based monitoring and control system is used as the
   integrated main operator interface, supporting plant operation in all
   plant states. Additionally control boards are used to implement a
   separate safety panel satisfying nuclear safety qualification
   requirements.
   These components are used to tailor the design of main control room,
   remote shut-down stations and local control stations, in accordance with
   licensing requirements, utility expectations and operating staff needs.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to give an insight about the methodology
   of developing the algorithm for a DSP controlled motor drive in order to
   reduce complexity and development time by using re-useable software
   modules from TI(R) library, and by constructing the flow block diagram
   within the Incremental System Build (ISB) levels logic frame. The
   proposed methodology is applied for the implementation of the algorithm
   of an innovative hybrid efficiency control scheme which is incorporated
   to a standard speed Field Oriented Control (FOC) drive, in order to
   improve online the efficiency for various types of motor drives (i.e
   ASI, PMSM drives) for both steady state and transient operation under
   load and speed variations. The hybrid efficiency control system combines
   a fuzzy logic controller and an LMC (Loss Model Controller). In order to
   validate the efficiency improvement and to test the good dynamic
   performance of this innovated efficiency control system, the software
   code is build up by many smaller re-useable software modules and is
   simulated in Simulink environment. For the hardware emulation the Code
   Composer Studio is used. The DSP code is emulated using the XDS510PP
   JTAG Emulator. The innovated fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) prototypes
   are created and tested separately, using the Simulink(R) graphical
   programming. The present improved control scheme is validated by
   hardware emulation in Code Composer Studio TI(R) environment by using
   the Digital Spectrum (R) eZdspF2812 as computing engine and the Digital
   Spectrum (R) DMCI500 as inverter.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new decaying de component estimation algorithm for digital
   relaying. Fault currents tend to include a dc decaying component. This
   component decreases the accuracy and speed of the protection relay
   operation. The proposed algorithm can estimate and eliminate the dc
   decaying component from fault current signals after one cycle from the
   fault instant. Also, it can be applied to a conventional discrete
   Fourier transform to calculate phasor quantities of fault currents in a
   digital protection relay. In the proposed algorithm, the dc decaying
   magnitude and time constant are estimated exactly by integrating fault
   currents during one cycle. The de decaying component is eliminated by
   subtracting the dc value at each sampling instant. To verify the
   performance of the proposed algorithm, we performed a dc component
   estimation test and distance protection test using PSCAD/EMTDC. The
   results of the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation showed that the proposed algorithm
   can estimate de components exactly from fault currents and can be
   applied to digital protection relays for phasor extraction.}},

   allowing reduction of the de input current ripples in classical

Abstract = {{Recently, several sampling methods suitable for signals that are sums of

   Dirac positions. We then demonstrate the efficacy of simple algorithms
   due to Prony and Cornell for low-order powersums and low oversampling
   relative to the rate of innovation. The simulated performance
   illustrates the possibility of superresolution reconstruction and
   robustness to correlation in the powersum sample noise.}},

Abstract = {{A shunt active filter is a power electronic device used in a power
   system to decrease ``harmonic current pollution{''} caused by nonlinear
   loads. The Echo State Network (ESN) has been widely used as an effective
   system identifier with much faster training speed than the other
   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). However, only a few attempts have been
   made to use an ESN as a system controller. As the first attempt to use
   an ESN in indirect neurocontrol, this paper proposes an indirect
   adaptive neurocontrol scheme using two ESNs to control a shunt active
   filter in a multiple-reference frame. As the first step in the proposed
   neurocontrol scheme, an online system identifier using an ESN is
   implemented in the Innovative Integration M67 card consisting of the
   TMS320C6701 processor to identify the load harmonics in a typical
   electric ship power system. The shunt active filter and the ship power
   system are simulated using a Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) system.
   The required computational effort and the system identification accuracy
   of an ESN with different dynamic reservoir size are discussed, which can
   provide useful information for similar applications in the future. The
   testing results in the real-time implementation show that the ESN is
   capable of providing fast and accurate system identification for the
   indirect neurocontrol of a shunt active filter.}},

Abstract = {{Combining productivity and safety is one of the great challenge of
   industrial ergonomics. The field is growing rapidly, with interesting
   scientific and occupational perspectives in all industrialized
   countries. The automotive field well represents the great challenge
   faced today by job organization to meet productivity and legal
   requirements. The continuous request to produce different and innovative
   models obliges the automotive manufacturers to develop more flexible
   assembly lines and enhanced tools for job planning on the same line. In
   the meantime, safety norms and product quality standards demand for
   improved working conditions.
   At present, the situation regarding manual operations within industrial
   production lines is still unsatisfactory from the ergonomics
   perspective. Furthermore, the use of flexible manufacturing cells to
   reduce the product time-to-market often results in increased levels of
   physical stress and cognitive engagement on the staff due to the need to
   frequently change tasks and to learn the greater variety of processes
   involved.
   For these reasons, new procedures and design methodologies are required
   for an early stage hazard and ergonomics assessment of the workplace.
   The traditional analysis of the production process is often not
   sufficient to satisfy the ergonomics optimization, that is to safeguard
   productivity while solving the ergonomics and safety problems on the
   existing workplace.
   Having outlined the scenario, the chapter illustrates a method for
   process design aimed at optimizing work-cells using digital human
   models, virtual reality tools and ergonomics methods. The method allows
   to simulate manual assembly tasks checking human movements and postures
   in order to evaluate general feasibility of the task and risks of
   musculoskeletal pathologies from incongruous postures. Benefits of
   virtual tools are very significant as they allow preliminary analysis of
   the workplace at the early stage of the product/process development
   using only virtual models of the future assembly line. Application to a
   case study is also briefly described.}},

Abstract = {{The information society and of knowledge is characterised by an
   explosive increase of the available ``digital{''} information through
   the products of the technology of information and telecommunication. The
   online marketing means the process of creation and maintenance of the
   relation with the client through online activities of facilitation of
   the exchange of ideas, products and services with a view to satisfy the
   needs of both parties. In the online environment, the marketing
   specialist is permanently in interactive contact with the consumer,
   manufacturer or distributor, he knows, in real time, the dynamic of the
   external environment and of the competition relations, he may act
   proactively before the opportunities and threatens which occur on the
   market whereas the quality and manner of use of the information depend
   on the quality of the marketing act. In the Information Society, the
   online marketing researches represent a market niche which shall insure
   the globalization of the activities through the interactivity offered by
   the online environment, through the low costs and the rapidity of
   obtaining the information, as well as due to the multiple advantages of
   processing, interpretation and data handling, offering competitiveness,
   innovation and creativity in relation with the marketing researches
   carried out traditionally. In this paper we tried to offer an overview
   of current marketing research practices and identify the strong and week
   points of modern, online marketing research, as well as their common
   tools and approaches, in order to give, from both theoretical and
   professional perspectives, an accurate guideline of this new and soon to
   be ubiquitous marketing tool.}},

   and networks, the key focus in ICT is shifting from the individual
   enterprise to the supply chains of which they are a part, and to the
   wider `business ecosystem'. Just as we can only get a proper
   understanding of nature by considering each of the species as part of an
   ecosystem, so we can only get a proper view of local economies by
   considering them as communities of interacting and evolving
   organizations. This insight calls for a new approach to ICT
   infrastructure: one that enables businesses of all sizes, and especially
   SMEs, to develop, adapt and use innovative applications and services
   quickly and easily so as to compete in the fast-moving global economy.}},

Abstract = {{E-detailing means using digital technology: internet, video conferencing
   and interactive voice response. There are two types of e-detailing:
   interactive (virtual) and video. Currently, little is known about what
   factors influence physicians' adoption of e-detailing. The objectives of
   this study were to test a model of physicians' adoption of e-detailing
   and to describe physicians using e-detailing. A mail survey was sent to
   a random sample of 2000 physicians practicing in Iowa. Binomial logistic
   regression was used to test the model of influences on physician
   adoption of e-detailing. On the basis of Rogers' model of adoption, the
   independent variables included relative advantage, compatibility,
   complexity, peer influence, attitudes, years in practice, presence of
   restrictive access to traditional detailing, type of specialty, academic
   affiliation, type of practice setting and control variables. A total of
   671 responses were received giving a response rate of 34.7\%. A total of
   141 physicians (21.0\%) reported using of e-detailing. The overall
   adoption model for using either type of e-detailing was found to be
   significant. Relative advantage, peer influence, attitudes, type of
   specialty, presence of restrictive access and years of practice had
   significant influences on physician adoption of e-detailing. The model
   of adoption of innovation is useful to explain physicians' adoption of
   e-detailing.}},

Abstract = {{The paper critically revisits the theory of entrepreneurship giving
   particular weight to the economic, business and sociological meaning of
   the term. It supports the position that the creator should be thought of
   as an entrepreneur, i.e. somebody who not only creates but who is also,
   or even primarily, aiming to exploit his/her creation to appropriate
   rent. The paper tries to build a theoretical framework to facilitate
   research in the cultural industries using the concepts of
   disequilibrium, entrepreneurial opportunity and rent, and intellectual
   property rights. We assess the disruptive role of new technologies in
   the music industry and examine the role of copyright as an institution
   that can both hinder or facilitate entrepreneurship and innovation in
   the digital domain.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, I examine free and open source software as a unique
   terrain of struggle over the politics of globalization, focusing on the
   Brazilian government's software strategy under the Lula administration.
   First, I locate this strategy in the historical context of the Brazilian
   government struggles for technological development and autonomy. I
   highlight how the Brazilian government used its power as a hierarchical
   organization to take advantage of the distinctive, networked political
   economy of free and open source software. I employ a post-structural
   political economy perspective to analyze the key role of discourse
   within the Brazilian software strategy. Second, I explore two ways that
   the Lula administration pursued its strategy of digital inclusion
   through an innovative approach to the politics of consumption. It used
   the power of government purchases to shift to free and open source
   systems, as well as pursuing a more ambitious project to democratize
   consumption of computers, free software and the Internet among Brazil's
   poor. I conclude by examining the implications of this software strategy
   for understanding and developing a political economy of digital
   inclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Academic research on service innovation has highlighted the distinct
   characteristics of services innovation, the knowledge complexes
   involved, and how services can be autonomous sites of innovation. It
   also highlights that successful services innovations are often not
   technology based but can depend on new organizational or managerial
   practices or marketing and distribution strategies. This paper makes an
   empirical and a conceptual contribution to this literature by focusing
   on one sub-sector of the services sector: digital media applications and
   services. Conceptually, this paper is interdisciplinary and draws upon a
   range of work on innovation and production in media and communication
   studies, innovation studies, evolutionary economics, and sociology.
   Empirically, this paper draws on ten years of qualitative case study
   research focused on innovation in the digital media sector in Ireland
   and, to a lesser extent, Europe. More specifically, we draw upon
   research on the internet, mobile, and games sectors. A key finding
   emerging from this research is that, despite the widespread popular and
   academic focus on technology and codified knowledge, a much broader
   knowledge base (particularly tacit, creative and non-technological
   knowledge) underpins successful innovative practices in digital media
   firms. This paper examines the combination of creative ideas and skills,
   social learning processes of content creators, management, market and
   business knowledge that underpin the development new digital media
   applications and services. It argues that a better understanding of the
   character of knowledge inputs and the innovative practices in digital
   media companies may contribute to a better understanding of innovation
   in the knowledge economy.}},

Abstract = {{This article argues that as our homes, offices, cities, and spaces get
   layered with digital information networks, it is vital that we develop
   new conceptual categories that integrate digital and physical spaces.
   With that objective in mind, it examines how WiFi networks interact with
   socioeconomic factors to reconfigure people, places, and information in
   physical spaces. Drawing on empirical research from ethnographic
   observations, a survey, and in-depth interviews, it shows how the
   availability of WiFi public hotspots has opened up new ways for
   freelancers to do their work, often using different locales for
   different phases of their work. Also, for freelancers in search of
   opportunities for co-working, WiFi hotspots are sites of informal
   interaction, social support, collaboration, and innovation. The article
   also illustrates how a WiFi network does not map onto existing physical
   or architectural boundaries. Instead, it reconfigures them in a number
   of ways by permeating walls, bleeding into public spaces, and breaking
   down some traditional notions of privacy and property while reinforcing
   others. Such reconfigurations of people, places and information require
   a new conceptual framing-codescapes-built on earlier notions of digital
   information and physical space.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic Web technology is able to provide the required computational
   semantics for interoperability of learning resources across different
   Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Learning Object Repositories
   (LOR). The EU research project LUISA (Learning Content Management System
   Using Innovative Semantic Web Services Architecture) addresses the
   development of a reference semantic architecture for the major
   challenges in the search, interchange, and delivery of learning objects
   in a service-oriented context. One of the key issues, highlighted in
   this paper, is Digital Rights Management (DRM) interoperability. A
   Semantic Web approach to copyright management has been followed, which
   places a Copyright Ontology as the key component for interoperability
   among existing DRM systems and other licensing schemes like Creative
   Commons. Moreover, Semantic Web tools like reasoners, rule engines and
   semantic queries facilitate the implementation of an interoperable
   copyright management component in the LUISA architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Many companies that have made considerable investments in IT
   applications to support their product development activities have
   realized limited value from such efforts. In this chapter, we argue that
   a deep understanding of the complementarities that exist in the product
   development context is critical to ensure that business value is derived
   from the IT applications. We propose a multi-level
   complementarities-based model of IT innovation and business value to
   explain the factors that shape the success of IT-enabled product
   development. Our model posits that firms will obtain more value from
   innovative IT investment initiatives when the resulting IT applications
   are fitted into a system of initiative or product development
   context-specific complementary organizational elements (strategies,
   structures, processes, etc.). Further, firms will get more value from IT
   initiatives when investment is combined with certain firm-level elements
   such as a business strategy that is especially amenable to IT support,
   strong IT capabilities, and a modern organizational architecture that
   incorporates a cluster of practices associated with ``digital{''}
   organizations. The model can guide researchers and managers in
   identifying the firm-level pre-conditions for realizing value from
   investments in IT to support product development and specifying
   necessary complementary investments in organizational change associated
   with product development.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter examines the value of ``virtual embeddedness{''} in the
   context of firms that develop complex product systems (CoPS). The
   development of CoPS usually involves many firms working together. Firms
   may choose to maintain arms-length relationships with their partners.
   But often they must coordinate new product development (NPD) through
   more embedded interactions because of the intricate nature of systems
   development in CoPS. Although embeddedness can be socially constructed,
   the rise of Internet and digital technologies have given way to the
   emergence of a new form of embeddedness - virtual embeddedness, which
   provides CoPS firms with unprecedented opportunities for learning and
   scope economics ill the process of NPD. Based on a new typology of
   virtual embeddedness in organizational space, I posit that virtual
   embeddedness is a good complementary vehicle to modularity in the
   management of NPD between CoPS firms. Accordingly, I draw some
   implications for future research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes research investigating the significance of physical
   experience and materiality in creative digital Visual art and design
   practice. Findings are presented from a recent phenomenological study,
   which indicates the ways in which memory of lived experience informs
   creative cognition and feeds the imagination.
   The importance of physical engagement with the world, through the
   senses, enables emotional expression to be made in artworks that can be
   perceived by both artist and audience. Digital creativity support tools
   have been found, in this research, to lack interfaces that facilitate
   the translation of these visual aesthetic qualities in the virtual
   representation.
   Hand use and the sense of touch stimulate novel ideas and enable
   practitioners to break from fixated thinking when working with digital
   design tools. Examples of artworks are presented that illustrate ways
   working with digital technology, make use of physical experience to
   inform visual ideas in which artists. and innovate design solutions.
   Case study research is described that illuminates the ways in which
   memory of physical bodily experience and the time related factors
   involved in making by hand are crucial within the creative process.
   Findings from this research are presented that reveal the importance of
   physical interaction with the world when working creatively with digital
   design tools. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   continue to support RDS to HE libraries. A Steering Group has been
   established to agree and then recommend these changes to the sector.
   Problems caused by encryption continue to dog RDS processes and
   innovation, and can be felt in other areas such as digitisation.
   Switching software appears to offer a short-term solution for RDS, while
   a longer-term resolution will depend on publishers following the lead of
   the music industry. For digitisation, Google appears set on exerting
   tighter control over an ever-increasing amount of content.
   Originality/value - The paper provides a summary of views regarding
   document supply.}},

Abstract = {{The global market for information security services nearly tripled in
   2007, up from about \$6.7 billion in 2000, according to International
   Data Corporation.
   This trend that focuses on information security stresses the translation
   of strategic business objectives and models into an information systems
   architecture that combines data process, workflow, financial and
   simulation models. E-commerce security is a process, not an end result.
   Managers need to understand how advanced technology creates more robust,
   scalable and adaptable information systems for organizations dedicated
   to continuous improvement and innovation.
   The paper presents the key questions used for assessing the existing
   status and the operation mode, and proposes some alternative solutions
   and recommendations for organizations operating in the digital economy.}},

   Government Spectrum}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{1052-1084}},
Abstract = {{While many policy analysts have focused on the fate of the 700 MHz
   auctions, the digital TV transition, and the promise of white space
   devices, a more vast and underutilized resource has gone largely
   unnoticed: government spectrum. The best available data suggests that
   the majority of federal spectrum capacity is left unused. Strategic
   reuse of this spectrum could help obviate the need for significant
   additional reallocation while enabling a wide range of creative new uses
   and social benefits. Based on what little information is publicly
   available, it is reasonable to assume that the repurposing of government
   spectrum would go far in addressing a number of access-related
   communication problems. Repurposing currently unused U.S.
   government-controlled spectrum for opportunistic unlicensed use would
   benefit society by dramatically expanding access to high-speed broadband
   and increasing the pace of wireless technology innovation. This approach
   to spectrum policy presents a ``third option{''} for reform, drawing
   from both the commons and property rights models of spectrum management.}},

   made to the theoretical model and technical framework of the Digital
   Earth, and its related key technologies on spatial information
   processing, spatial data warehouse technology, virtual reality
   technology, high-performance and parallel computing. The DEPS consists
   of seven sub-systems including the spatial data, metadata, model
   database, Grid geoscience computing, spatial information database, maps
   service and virtual reality. Meanwhile, we developed a series of
   application systems such as the environment monitoring for the Olympic
   Games 2008 in Beijing, natural disasters evaluation, digital city,
   digital archeology, Asia regional aerosol and climate change. The
   DEPS/CAS displayed the application ability and potential of the Digital
   Earth in three levels: the global, national and regional.}},

Abstract = {{Ideally, scientists should be able to format, explore, analyse, and
   visualise data in a simple, powerful and fast application that would
   seamlessly integrate georeferenced data from a variety of data sources
   into an intuitive visualisation. The focus of an Environmental
   Information System is providing environmental information to decision
   makers, policy planners, scientists and engineers, research workers,
   etc. which ensures integration of data collection, collation, storage,
   retrieval and dissemination to all concerned. All such queries should be
   responded to supplying substantive information in the form of reports.
   The paper presents an innovative way to utilise the geographic
   information associated with the environmental data. The stand-alone
   application is the integration of using ArcObjects Environmental System
   Research Institute ArcGIS Engine 9.1 and VB.Net. The geographic
   information system (GIS)-based application, a framework of digital earth
   in terms of environmental information system provides a user-friendly
   query interface, which gives information about various environmental
   parameters in tabular as well as on map display. It also provides the
   visual interpretation to make further analysis and future decisions at
   multiple scales, locations and extents. The facility for modifying the
   map attributes and corresponding databases is integrated to update the
   information system. Output spatial data are produced in the form of
   reports using selected fields with display on map.}},

   information for developing more attractive services with greater reach
   and impact on population health.
   Methods: A state-level telephone survey using random digit dialling
   sampling methods assessed preferences for available professional, mutual
   help, and lay resources, as well as innovative computerized and
   self-help resources that enhance anonymity (N=439 households in
   Alabama).
   Results: Respondents preferred help that involved personal contact
   compared to computerized help or self-help, but were indifferent whether
   personalized help was dispensed by professional or lay providers.
   Attractive service features included lower cost, insurance coverage,
   confidentiality, rapid and convenient appointments, and addressing
   functional problems and risks of substance misuse. Respondents in
   households with a member who misused substances rated services more
   negatively, especially if services had been used.
   Conclusion: The findings highlight the utility of viewing substance
   misusers and their social networks as consumers, and the implications
   for improving the system of care and for designing and marketing
   services that are responsive to user preferences are discussed. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{The rationale and design of this cohort laboratory training, which
   blends both real NBTLC and virtual NBTLC, are considered for their
   effect oil student learning. After implementation of the program into a
   graduate engineering laboratory course, an evaluation study was
   conducted to investigate the effectiveness of this blended laboratory
   training program. According to results, most students showed positive
   attitudes toward this practice. In addition, students perceived positive
   impacts of this effort on their laboratory learning experience.
   Furthermore, this paper discusses the important issues observed in the
   study, such as interdisciplinary learning and leaching. It is expected
   that this study will contribute to the practice of innovative adoption
   of technology in engineering laboratory education and research on cyber

Abstract = {{Indentation tests are frequently employed at present for the
   identification of material parameters at different scales. An innovative
   inverse analysis technique, recently proposed by the Authors, combines
   the traditional indentation test with the mapping of the residual
   deformations (imprint), thus providing experimental data apt to be used
   to identify material parameters in film-substrate systems. In this
   paper, such methodology is enhanced to permit the identification of the
   fracture properties of the interface between a coating and its substrate
   once the bulk material parameters are known. In order to make the
   inverse problem well posed, a further set of experimental data, namely
   the horizontal displacement field measured on the film external surface,
   is considered as available experimental information. The sought material
   parameters are recovered through recursive calculations of the
   mechanical response of the film-substrate system, performed by a finite
   strain numerical simulation. The coating and a significant portion of
   the underlying bulk material are incorporated in the finite element
   models built up to this purpose, while delamination is accounted for
   through cohesive elements. The inverse analysis procedure rests on a
   batch, deterministic approach and conventional optimization algorithms
   are employed for the minimization of a suitably defined discrepancy
   norm. Extensive numerical computations have been performed in order to
   test the performance of the proposed methodology in terms of result
   accuracy and computational effort.}},

Abstract = {{Managing coalition networks of organisations is gradually becoming more
   complex and challenging as the current trends of the market conditions
   are becoming more dynamic. The dynamism nature is experienced in many
   aspects including: advances in technologies, rising demand of resources
   for each opportunity, growing volatility of opportunities, and so forth.
   Owing to advances in digital technology, emerging breakthrough solutions
   responding to market needs are becoming increasingly innovative and
   complex. A large amount of resources, competencies, skills, etc. are
   required to accomplish such solutions, usually beyond capabilities and
   capacities of a single organisation. The emergence of coalition networks
   of organisations as breeding environments for creation of temporary
   consortiums has enhanced the possibility of success for organisations by
   facilitating their collaborations. One obstacle to configuration of such
   consortiums as well as collaboration has been the difficulty in
   assessing the trust level of potential partners. So far, the assessment
   of trust level has been performed manually by organisations and in an ad
   hoc manner, which is both time consuming and hardly produces accurate
   results. Consequently, the formation of collaborative initiatives in the
   form of temporary consortiums has become more challenging and
   organisations are reluctant to work with each other. This paper
   addresses the supervised automation of the assessment of trust level of
   organisations in coalition networks to smoothen the formation of
   temporary consortiums. It first presents the concepts of a system
   developed to support the management of long-term coalition networks of
   organisations. It then addresses the design and development of Trust
   Management system by focusing its analysed specifications, designed
   architectures and applied implementation aspects.}},

Abstract = {{Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has introduced many
   changes over the last decades causing a socio-economic evolution based
   on information acquisition and knowledge dissemination. It helped create
   an emering global information-based society with innovative means of
   communication that can help in increasing competitiveness for
   individuals, organisations and societies. ICT has helped generate new
   forms and structures ob business, social and economic entities that are
   no longer bound by geographic or time constraints, but instead depend
   mainly on being connected all the time. This article addresses the
   efforts taking place in Africa to minimise the digital gap and actively
   join the global information society. Many African nations have invested
   heavily in building their ICT infrastructure to help improve the
   readiness of their communities and this article provides an overview of
   some of the projects implemented to build the African information
   society while demonstrating some the lessons learned and experiences
   acquired.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of the World Wide Web and its influence on the fields of
   industry, commerce, healthcare and so on, has led to an innovative,
   dynamic, open, collaborative and interactive environment - the digital
   ecosystem. Whereas service plays an important role in digital
   ecosystems, there is no technology available to retrieve heterogeneous
   and geographically dispersed services. Additionally, no methodology has
   been proposed in the literature that can distinguish or rank the
   services based on the Quality of Services (QoS). In order to address
   these issues, we propose a semantic service retrieval engine which
   incorporates a novel semantic QoS evaluation methodology. The salient
   feature of this methodology that sets it apart from any other QoS
   evaluation methodologies is that the evaluation of the service and the
   subsequent quantification of QoS is a combination of subjective and
   objective QoS measures. Another salient feature of our proposed
   methodology is that it enables the domain-specific ranking of services.
   Finally, ail online prototype is implemented to evaluate our
   methodology, the results of which are discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the main security requirements for Web services
   and it describes how such security requirements are addressed by
   standards for Web services security recently developed or under
   development by various standardizations bodies. Standards are reviewed
   according to a conceptual framework that groups them by the main
   functionalities they provide. Covered standards include most of the
   standards encompassed by the original Web Service Security roadmap
   proposed by Microsoft and IBM in 2002 (Microsoft and IBM 2002). They
   range from the ones geared toward message and conversation security and
   reliability to those developed for providing interoperable Single Sign
   On and Identity Management functions in federated organizations. The
   latter include Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), WS-Policy,
   XACML, that is related to access control and has been recently extended
   with a profile for Web services access control; XKMS and WS-Trust;
   WS-Federation, LibertyAlliance and Shibboleth, that address the
   important problem of identity management in federated organizations. The
   article also discusses the issues related to the use of the standards
   and open research issues in the area of access control for Web services
   and innovative digital identity management techniques are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{SystemC is becoming a popular framework for System on Chip (SoC) design
   and verification. Innovation in SoC design does not come easily. Smaller
   features, faster speeds, and intricate digital logic require more
   simulation resources. SystemC is designed to run the entire simulation
   solely on one processor. Though designers can model concurrent threads,
   those threads are executed sequentially as one process. In this paper,
   we analyze the efficiency of the main approaches to distribute the
   simulation of SystemC models and we present our own approach which is
   based on the analyzed ones. We compare the effectiveness of our approach
   with previous ones using a model with n RISC processors and a single
   n-port RAM.}},

Abstract = {{A very poor neighborhood in Argentina that has many features of lower
   middle class is called ``barrio carenciado{''}. Many heads of the
   families are unemployed and although children have access to schools it
   is common that they do not finish their basic instruction. In many cases
   NGOs play a fundamental role in changing this reality. In this
   presentation we detail the implementation of a test bed where 14
   families and a school were provided with computers, Internet access and
   were educated out of digital illiteracy. Connectivity was provided by
   Wireless Mesh Networking (WMN). The research project, was carried out by
   a group of researchers from the Universidad de La Plata with different
   backgrounds in collaboration with the NGO Barrios del Plata (a chapter
   of Muhammad Yunus's Grameen Bank). The study monitored the changes in
   families' life (in particularly children education and parents
   opportunities related to obtaining work). The deployment of WMN in a
   such a broad area, aimed to define the possible lowest cost
   implementation, and conforms an important part of the research
   activities. The school \#502, originally a node of the WMN, has become a
   ``Laboratory for the use of innovative methodologies in ICT training of
   primary school teachers{''}. The project was financed through an award
   given in a public competition by Microsoft research and CentralTech, a
   leading Argentinean educational center.}},

Title = {{Factors affecting purchase intention on mobile shopping web sites}},
Journal = {{INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{442-458}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore a conceptual model for
   analyzing customers' perceptions of using mobile commerce services for
   online shopping. This paper provides insights into consumer behavior,
   and the results have important implications for designers, managers,
   marketers, and system providers of mobile shopping (m-shopping) web
   sites.
   Design/methodology/approach - An empirical investigation was carried out
   to test the hypotheses. The samples include 369 professional
   participants. For testing the relationships of the model, structural
   equation modeling (SEM) is used.
   Findings - The results demonstrate that anxiety, which is an affective
   barrier against using innovative systems, is a key negative predictor of
   a customer's intentions to use mobile phones. Also, the consumer's
   self-perception of mobile skillfulness significantly affects anxiety,
   enjoyment, and usefulness. Furthermore, enjoyment, usefulness, and
   compatibility have an impact on a customer's behavioral intentions.
   Practical implications - The findings of this study help to understand
   what hinders or encourages the m-shopping intention of online customers.
   Originality/value - The results not only help develop a sophisticated
   understanding of mobile commerce theories for researchers, but they also
   offer useful knowledge to those involved in promoting m-shopping to
   potential purchasers. The value of the paper is that the results could
   be applied to other portable information technology service adoptions,
   such as personal digital assistants (PDA), smart phones, advanced mobile
   phones, and portable global positioning systems (GPS).}},

   proposals based in theoretical interdisciplinary apparatuses.
   Coincidences and disagreements of these authors on Such a complex matter
   lead LIS to formulate a conceptual answer from the library science
   perspective, which differs from the pedagogical discourse and points
   towards the education of the citizen of the information society and that
   of the publishing industry, both involved in digital technology, In
   today's context, library science must renew its social function and one
   of the fundamental aspects of this Lire the problematics of reading.
   Thus, reading methods and theories in which the discourse and practice
   of library science have been based tip to now, must be opened and

   bring along higher defect rates and lower yield. Memory chips, which are
   among the densest circuits used in digital systems, are greatly impacted

   costs rise sharply. In this paper, a new approach for designing memory
   chips to be manufactured using future technologies is proposed, aiming
   to increase the overall yield. The proposed approach trades a small area
   overhead for dramatic production cost reduction, by allowing to use more
   defective memory chips as lower capacity ones, instead of discarding
   them.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative methodology to perform avalanche hazard mapping that
   combines open source GIS tools, expert rules, computational routines,
   and statistical analysis is herewith briefly presented. The method
   provides a ``semi-automatic{''} definition of areas potentially affected
   by avalanche release, motion, and run-out and is based on a combination
   of an ad-hoc developed ``flow-routing algorithm{''} and a
   statistically-based estimation of the run-out distance of avalanches.
   The proposed methodology allows obtaining a preliminary, cost-efficient
   assessment of the avalanche hazard zones, especially for those areas
   where historical information is lacunose or even missing. Furthermore it
   allows including confidence bonds into the analysis, providing different
   avalanche outline as a function of the safety requirements.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper; we present a technique to enable accurate built-in
   measurement of EVM for OFDM transceivers. This measurement technique
   only relies on the decoded bit pattern, and does not require any
   additional test equipment. In order to accurately predict EVM without
   using analog signal analysis, we intentionally code more symbols into
   the bit pattern in test mode, which enables the decoding of IQ signals
   in finer granularity. We present an innovative DFT technique to measure
   EVM on-chip with very little overhead. We also provide an analytical
   framework to determine how the DFT technique needs to be implemented.
   Experimental results using MATLAB simulations and hardware measurements
   confirm the accuracy of the proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{Current maritime systems are to a large extent based on legacy analog
   VHF radios for ship-to-shore communications near port waters, and
   relatively low bandwidth digital satellite communications (SatCom) for
   long-range ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications. The cost of
   bandwidth for SatCom networks is expected to remain high due to the cost
   of launching satellites into orbit and also due to the stabilizers
   required for presently available on-board antennas. On the other hand,
   the legacy VHF system comprises low bandwidth radios incapable of
   supporting applications requiring high data rates. Unlike the
   terrestrial net-works, advancement in maritime networks is severely
   lagging behind its land counterpart.
   MARINTEK is the principle investigator of the MarCom project, a joint
   initiative between several national and international R\&D institutions,
   Universities and Colleges, Public Authorities and Industry, funded by
   the industry itself and The Norwegian Research Council's MAROFF program,
   and aiming at developing a novel digital communication system platform
   to ensure the proliferation of innovative mobile network applications
   presently being widely implemented on land-based wireless systems}},

Abstract = {{Using the manufacturing sector data at the three-digit level, the paper
   examines whether the degree of competition improves productivity in
   developing countries. The degree of competition is measured through
   markups while productivity is measured through total factor productivity
   (TFP) and labor productivity. All are computed by industries. Taking
   account of endogeneity issues and of the role of relevant control
   variables, the results show that in Jordan and Morocco, markup has a
   significant and negative impact on productivity growth. In Egypt, while
   markup does not seem to affect productivity growth, a decrease in the
   share of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in a given industry has a
   significant and positive impact on productivity growth. In general, the
   existence of State-Owned Enterprises is an obstacle to competition. We
   conclude that the greater the degree of competition, the higher the
   productivity in the three countries.}},

Title = {{An empirical assessment of knowledge management criticality for
   sustainable development}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically assess the
   importance of knowledge management (KM) for sustainable development. Two
   main hypotheses about the critical success factors of knowledge and
   technology contribution to sustainable development are tested.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research is carried out using surveys
   and interviews among a KM/integrated information and communication
   technologies (IICTs) sustainable development community
   Findings - Results show that KM is critical for innovation,
   prioritization and efficient use of resources. A significant linear
   association between IICTs and KM across time and geography is detected.
   IICTs improve the quality of shared decision making in inter- and
   intra-organizational settings. Paradoxically, IICTs lead to information
   overload, and digitization leads to knowledge dilution
   ``de-contextualization{''}. Nevertheless, these drawbacks are outweighed
   by the multitude of the converged technologies benefits.
   Research limitations/implications - There is a limited amount of data
   subjected to the statistical analysis. This may skew some of the
   results, and inflate the experimental error. However, the limited data
   are due to the restricted targeted population itself.
   Originality/value - The results in this paper led to the proposal of the
   knowledge iterative supply network (KISN) framework, which describes
   knowledge lifecycle that lessens technology negative impacts. This would
   be a valuable roadmap for KM practitioners who are planning to deploy KM
   technology for supporting sustainable development.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the design goals of Global Environment for Network
   Innovation (GENI), we consider how to support the slicing of link
   bandwidth resources as well as the virtualization of optical access
   networks and optical backbone mesh networks. Specifically, in this
   paper, we study a novel programmable mechanism called optical orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)/orthogonal frequency division
   multiple access (OFDMA) for link virtualization. Unlike conventional
   time division multiplexing TDM/time division multiple access (TDMA) and
   wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)/wavelength division multiple
   access (WDMA) methods, optical OFDM/OFDMA utilizes advanced digital
   signal processing (DSP), parallel signal detection (PSD) and flexible
   resource management schemes for subwavelength level multiplexing and
   grooming. Simulations as well as experiments are conducted to
   demonstrate performance improvements and system benefits including
   cost-reduction and service transparency.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to describe the prevalence and patterns of use of personal
   digital assistants (PDAs) among active nurse practitioners (NPs).
   A descriptive correlational survey was conducted among NPs in the United
   States (N = 126). Participants were randomly selected from members of
   the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners who had listed a practice
   site on their application.
   Sixty-four percent of participants used PDAs. A drug reference was
   reported to be the most useful and frequently installed application. A
   large majority of PDA users believed that PDA use supported clinical
   decision making (91\%), promoted patient safety (89\%), and increased
   productivity (75\%). Sixty-two percent predicted that PDA use would
   change their practice within the next 5 years.
   As innovative PDA applications with potential to improve patient
   outcomes become increasingly available, handheld computer skills will be
   a fundamental practice competency. To prevent errors in clinical
   decision making with quick access to PDA reference materials, NPs must
   critically evaluate the legitimacy and worth of PDA software programs.
   There is a critical need to evaluate the effectiveness of PDA use in
   clinical settings and develop an evidence base to guide use of the PDA
   in solving clinical problems.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness and Safety of Using Podikon Digital Silicone Padding in
   the Primary Prevention of Neuropathic Lesions in the Forefoot of

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{Background: In diabetic patients with complications from peripheral
   neuropathy, the hyperpressure areas can rapidly lead to ulcerative
   lesions in the absence of protective sensation. Partial digital silicone
   orthoses could provide an innovative and functional therapeutic solution
   in the management of preulcerative areas of the forefoot in neuropathic
   diabetic patients. We clinically tested this hypothesis.
   Methods: Digital off-loading silicone padding was prepared for 89
   neuropathic patients with deformities and localized hyperkeratosis in
   the forefoot. After 3 months and in basal conditions, the number of
   areas of hyperkeratosis was evaluated together with the hardness of the
   skin, the number of active lesions, and any adverse events associated
   with use of the orthosis. The patients were compared to a control group
   of 78 randomized patients undergoing standard therapy. In a subgroup of
   10 patients, a static and dynamic biomechanical evaluation was also
   conducted with a computerized podobarometric platform.
   Results: Both the number of lesions and the prevalence of hyperkeratosis
   and skin hardness were significantly lower (P<.01) in the group treated
   with the silicone orthoses than in the control group. No adverse events
   were reported during the 3 months of observation. The podobarometric
   analysis highlighted a significant (P<.001) reduction of peak pressure
   in the areas undergoing orthotic correction.
   Conclusions: Silicone padding is effective and safe in the prevention of
   lesions in neuropathic patients at high risk of ulceration and
   significantly reduces the incidence of new lesions in the 3-month
   follow-up period compared to standard treatment. (J Am Podiatr Med Assoc

Abstract = {{Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) permit the innovation
   of teaching and learning processes. ICT allow teachers to create or
   select and adjust contents that take advantage of the digital
   environment and interaction between peers. Teaching methodologies and
   strategies should be adjusted to the learning styles of students,
   offering them, in turn, the possibility to reflect about the way in
   which they might learn better. This article introduces a work of
   creation and validation of a web-based application, which aims to
   enhance the Management of Learning Styles (MLS) on the part of students
   and teachers, based on Felder-Soloman's Index of Learning Styles
   Questionnaire (ILS) and Honey-Mumford's Learning Styles Questionnaire
   (LSQ). The prototype has been validated and the results suggest its
   applicability and the relevance of the information this tool is capable
   of obtaining - reports on the learning styles profiles by student,
   teacher and class - with the objective of supporting them in the
   selection of strategies to improve teaching and learning, developing at
   the same time skills which will allow them to learn throughout their
   lives.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we focus on digital content markets (DCMs), which have
   typically been seen as an offspring of technological and business
   innovations. However, recent trends indicate that these two perspectives
   are not enough when attempting to understand how DCMs actually work.
   Technology is obviously a prerequisite for business innovations, which
   in turn provide new possibilities for consumers. Nevertheless, consumer
   behaviour is not only a result of technological and business
   innovations, but by itself a crucial factor of DCMs, and therefore also
   an important focus of study. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the
   general view of DCMs by carrying out a literature study that is based on
   the above mentioned three perspectives: technology, business and
   consumer behaviour. As a result of our study, we present some critical
   issues that need to be taken into account when developing ways of
   trading and distributing digital content.}},

   relevant competences. These include ``creative{''}, technical as well as
   other competences. In an ongoing R\&D project, We Study the
   interrelation of competence development and innovation in this field. In
   this context. a Study of different interfaces for self-profiling has
   been conducted with students from two related but different Study
   programs as Subjects. The aim was to find dependencies between personal
   characteristics (especially creativity), self-profiling behavior and the
   perception of matched job offers with respect to innovativeness,
   attractiveness and overstrain. Although the different student groups
   (interactive media and computer science) do not show differences on the
   personal creativity scale they differ considerably in their competence
   preferences. More flexible options in the profiling interfaces are not
   used for a stronger differentiation between competences.}},

Abstract = {{Digital video is a growing and important presence in student learning.
   This paper reports the results of a survey of American educators in
   Michigan (n = 426) conducted in spring 2008. The survey included
   questions about educators' attitudes toward the streaming and
   downloadable video services available to them in their schools. The
   survey results showed that educators mainly used digital video to
   introduce and to conclude learning experiences. These educators, who
   predominantly used the Web-based unitedstreaming (TM) digital video
   service, relished the service's content breadth, short clips and
   potential to foster instructional innovation. However, many survey
   respondents reported concerns about internet connection bandwidth,
   projection capabilities and lack of end-user control over on-demand
   download and manipulation. Educators viewed school-level Information and
   Communications Technology policies, bandwidth capacity and lack of
   support personnel as the causes of these difficulties. Because little
   research has been done on the implementation of digital video services
   in US schools, the conclusions of this study may provide direction for
   educators, researchers and policy-makers who use a variety of digital
   video platforms and services.}},

Abstract = {{Recently there has been an explosion of new technologies and tools such
   as wikis, blogs, tags, Facebook, among many others, that are commonly
   identified under Web 2.0 and which promise a new digital business
   ecosystem fed by formal/informal and internal/external relationships and
   interactions. Although Web 2.0 is very promising to enable such
   collective knowledge creation, technology by itself is not the only
   ingredient. It is also required to define the right strategy,
   governance, culture, processes, training, incentives among others,
   before implementing such innovative open spaces for collaboration and
   knowledge sharing. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present
   a Knowledge Management (KM) Framework and a Maturity Model developed by
   a CEMEX and EPFL collaborative research project to discover the AS-IS
   collaboration practices in CEMEX before the implementation of the
   SMARTBRICKS Web 2.0 prototype for Business Process Management (BPM),

   from print to digital formats, we recognized a need to alter

   replacing obsolete and redundant order codes, and adding new codes for
   electronic resources. As a result, we vastly improved accounting for

   Findings - The environments provide scientists with collaborative and
   customised environments supporting results production and exchange
   around the globe in a cost-efficient manner. The experiences made with
   these innovative research environments within the D4Science project is

   Based on interviews with policy makers and developers of digital
   libraries, this qualitative study examines the influence of culture and
   local practices during the first wave of development, between 1998 and
   2002. The cultural dimension of digital library development is related
   to organizational structure, technology, and national context for each
   of the national digital library programs. The analysis identifies
   distinct models of development, institutionalization time lines, and a
   repertoire of constructivist approaches to digital library innovation in
   each of the national libraries. Part I presented institutional
   histories, methodology, and the theoretical framework guiding analysis

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{While many different endeavors to support name authority control in
   Extensible Markup Langnage (XML) metadata have been explored, none have
   been accepted as a best practice. For this reason, libraries continue to
   experiment with the schema, tool, or process that best suits their local
   authority control needs in XML. This paper discusses current endeavors
   to support name authority control in XML for digitized collections and
   demonstrates an innovative manual solution developed and implemented by
   the University of Tennessee Libraries to achieve this goal. Even though
   this method for authority control in XML metadata still relies on manual
   efforts, it effectively reduces time and research work by efficiently
   setting priorities, identifying critical descriptive areas in the
   digital transcriptions, and identifying the most appropriate
   biographical resources to consult. The effectiveness of this approach in
   improving the rest of the inetadata. production workflow is evaluated
   and presented.}},

Abstract = {{A new design for the Ge bolometers of the EDELWEISS project is described
   here, based on innovative interleaved charge collection electrodes with
   high background discrimination capabilities. The measured surface event
   rejection is compatible with WIMP sensitivity levels down to 10(-) 9
   picobarn (pb). Use of interleaved electrodes on the overall surface of
   the Ge crystal, including its lateral surface, results to a high
   fiducial volume of the order of 80\%. Electronic setup is fairly simple
   with a total of five JFET based read-out amplifiers, one for the NTD-Ge
   heat channel and four for the ionization signal. Fabrication process is
   quite simple and the design is easily scalable to higher mass bolometers
   (1 kg Ge crystal), making it very appealing for the future 1 ton scale
   EUREKA Dark Matter experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
   transferability of the open source principles of product development
   from the realm of software to the realm of physical products
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on the inherent differences between
   software and physical products, a theoretical discussion of the
   challenges that face the implementation of open source principles in the
   physical world are provided. A multiple case study methodology is
   adopted to provide insights into the applicability of the open source
   concept in product development outside software.
   Findings - Many of the challenges identified theoretically are actually
   encountered in practice. To cope with these challenges effectively,
   hardware design activities can be translated into software development
   tasks, using programmable hardware. When dealing with open source
   projects in the physical realm, it is useful to distinguish between
   projects driven by commercial firms and those driven by individuals, as
   each project type can impose different conditions on successful
   implementation.
   Originality/value - Although much scholarly attention has been devoted
   to open source software, the issue of transferability of the identified
   principles to other industries hits undergone little in-depth research.
   This paper provides a solid foundation for further investigation of this
   topic based on theory and empirical case examples. It derives
   recommendations for industrial experts wishing to benefit from the open
   source model in new product development.}},

Title = {{Service innovation and electronic word-of-mouth: is it worth listening

Journal = {{MANAGING SERVICE QUALITY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{249-265}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate what discussants
   in internet based discussion forums talk about. Investigates electronic
   word of mouth (e-WOM) as a potential source of information for service
   innovation. The aim is to derive four core categories of unique
   dialogues that provide valuable information to service innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Apart from Harrison-Walker's effort to
   develop a scale of measuring WOM, disclosing the inside of electronic
   word-of-mouth has never been done before. For this reason a qualitative
   approach using Netnography was adopted. The paper analyzes the content
   of all postings taking place during 100 days in five defined discussion
   forums on the internet.
   Findings - The results indicate that conversations taking place in
   electronic discussion forums can be divided into four core categories,
   i.e. information request, usage experience, business practice issues,
   and comments pertaining to new product launches.
   Research limitations/implications - The study focused on building a
   typology of conversations taking place in discussion forums on the
   internet. As such, these findings may not be generalized to the offline
   environment.
   Practical implications - Disclosing details of electronic word-of-mouth
   through four core categories has a number of implications. Perhaps more
   importantly, an understanding of WOM communication allows Managers to
   develop new, and to improve current, services that better meet
   customers' current and future needs.
   Originality/value - Disclosing details of electronic word-of-mouth and
   linking it to service innovation has never done before. As such this is
   a truly unique study.}},

Abstract = {{Decentral recommender systems appear well suited for mobile scenarios,
   but have not been investigated thoroughly or implemented very much so
   far. We have designed and implemented a system to recommend images on
   Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Our approach also incorporates
   recommending for groups of users that are present at a public shared
   display. The system exchanges rating vectors among PDAs, computes local
   matrices of item similarity and utilizes them to generate
   recommendations. Our innovation in comparison to existing systems
   includes improving the extensibility of the data model by introducing
   versioned rating vectors. In addition, we have optimized the storage
   requirements on the mobile device. We have evaluated the approach in a
   small user study. Furthermore, the scalability of our system was
   analyzed using a standard recommender data set resulting in positive
   findings.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual Prototyping is an important tool to verify and optimise product
   properties in the early design phases. By using digital product models
   many simulations of the system behaviour can be carried out. Today there
   are still deficits in modelling and evaluating the acoustical behaviour
   of technical products which is important for many industries.
   A flexible audio-visual projection system was configured which combines
   stereoscopic visualisation in a CAVE with a new spatial acoustic
   reproduction method: wavc-field-synthesis. For this, a scene
   representation is needed that provides the sound reproduction
   synchronously with the visualisation of the technical systems.
   This paper describes the goals of the new audio-visual Virtual Reality
   system and its use as an innovative tool for a realistic representation
   and presentation of audio-visual product properties, even in early
   design phases. The paper is also focused on methods to describe
   acoustical product properties of technical systems for an interactive
   presentation in real-time Virtual Reality during design process.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the ideas generated by a Romanian Research project
   ``Knowledge management architecture in environmental, social and
   economic areas, designed to support the sustainable regional development
   strategy{''}, financed under the national research budget. One major
   result of the project is represented by the development of a regional
   virtual platform as a driver for knowledge management and innovation.
   This virtual environment creates a space for integrating and
   articulating ideas and innovative solutions in a wide participative way.
   The platform represents an integrator and mediator for the regional
   business environment and main stakeholders, as well as a Connectivity
   channel for bridging other European and world networks and clusters. The
   global knowledge economy creates new challenges for the industrial space
   from at least two perspectives: tire development of knowledge products
   and services, and the increased enterprises' connectivity through
   complex networks integrating dynamic clusters. The enterprises have to
   cope with the quick technological changes, with complex organizational
   systems and with global networking requirements. Consequently, the major
   enterprise's needs focus oil innovation, in order to increase
   competitiveness in a sustainable way. In this context, the increased
   accessibility to the new technologies and innovative solutions, as well
   as the capacity to generate knowledge and innovation represent the major
   intangible assets of the global enterprise. The most of the industries,
   including the metallurgy, are already connected in networks of
   organizations, technologies, products and consumers, ensuring their
   visibility, and interactions oil the market. The capacity of increasing
   the partnerships and various associations represent a major success
   factor of the actual global enterprise. In the same time, the
   enterprises are concerned more about the global perspective than about
   the local one, and consequently have not always strong links with the
   local development. In this new perspective, the research team identified
   the gap between the local administration and the regional actors related
   to the sustainable regional development and proposed the rise of
   advanced ICT tools for creating a regional virtual platform for
   supporting the networking among the regional stakeholders and
   facilitating the development of regional knowledge base, for the benefit
   of the regional sustainable development. In this perspective, the
   business actors are more sensitive to the local environmental, economic
   and social issues, and could contribute to the regional strategy design,
   as main regional stakeholders. In the same time, the business area will
   take advantage of the open access to valuable regional knowledge
   repository and to other platforms, such as digital business ecosystems
   European platform.}},

   manufacturing process result in deviations of different character,
   deterministic and random. The contribution of random phenomena on the
   surface depends on the type of processing. The article suggests an
   innovation in applying the methods of analysis of spatial data in
   research on the geometric deviations randomness of free-form surfaces,

Abstract = {{In spite of its proven advantage, realization of affordable
   multi-functional phased-arrays, combining multiple communication
   apertures, is hindered by size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) and
   cost issues. Incremental improvements in both transmit and receive
   analog RF chains are being pursued. However, it is difficult to expect
   revolutionary advances in phased array SWaP using architectures based on
   state-of-the-art analog component efficiencies and performances. These
   difficulties are very pronounced for the multi-band, multi-beam
   applications often found in modern MILSATCOM mobile and shipboard
   systems such as the Army's HC-3, Navy's NMT and Integrated Topside and
   Air Force's FAB-T programs.
   Dramatic improvements in single or multi-purpose large phased array
   apertures require a breakthrough technology. HYPRES has been developing
   superconductor wideband Digital-RF technology - a disruptive
   technological innovation capable of enabling dramatic change in
   communication architectures. Impressive results through recent live
   demonstrations have been achieved in proving that Digital-RF technology
   can be practically applied to next generation communication systems.
   Recent advances in direct conversion Digital-RF technology show that
   affordable, reliable, large multipurpose phased arrays for

Abstract = {{Trust negotiation is an approach that establishes mutual trust between
   strangers wishing to share resources or conduct business by gradually
   requesting and disclosing digitally signed credentials. Sometimes
   negotiators do not have very strict security requirements or the
   efficiency is the most crucial need. In such cases, it is preferable to
   adopt schemes that speed up the negotiations, even if they do not
   maximize the protection of the involved resources. Therefore, in this
   paper, we present a trust negotiation framework that speeds up
   negotiations from two aspects whenever possible, disclosure sequence
   generation and credential validation, which are computationally
   expensive during negotiations. The framework we propose presents several
   innovative features, such as the support for predicting disclosure
   sequences by locally trusted peers, and the use of declaration tickets
   and proving tickets to reduce the number of exchanged credentials and
   credential validations.}},

Abstract = {{Many research teams have developed mobile computing architectures to
   support the emergency and rescue services in a range of civil
   contingencies. These proposals are based on innovative technologies and
   show considerable creativity in the design of their user inter-faces. In
   contrast, this paper presents lessons learned from the 2007 UK floods.
   Mobile telecommunications failed in many different ways and from many
   different causes, including physical damage to handsets, as well as the
   loss of base stations and UPSs. The insights gained from the floods are
   being used to inform the design of next generation mobile digital
   communications systems for UK responders. However, the technical
   problems are arguably less important than the insights that were
   obtained about `systemic' failures in the interfaces between local
   government, emergency services and the variety of agencies that must
   cooperate in major civil contingencies. Problems in information
   management led to inconsistencies and incompatibilities. In consequence,
   the output from one application could not easily be used as input to
   systems operated by other agencies. These issues must be addressed
   before we are overwhelmed by the increased bandwidth afforded by new
   mobile devices and novel sensing technologies. It is concluded that
   unless we understand the chaos, complexity and the contextual issues
   that characterise previous emergency situations then there is little
   prospect that we will be able to design effective mobile technologies
   for future incidents.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter gives an introduction to the future of electronic system
   integration as a combination of ``More Moore{''} and ``More than
   Moore{''} components, combined in one package ({''}system-in-package{''}
   or SiP). More Moore will very likely continue to be at the forefront of
   electronics development for the next decade. It is difficult, however,
   to integrate non-digital functions, such as sensors and power
   electronics, for example, monolithically with these technologies. For
   this reason the future belongs to integration technologies that combine
   several components into a highly integrated assembly in one package -
   ``wafer-level packaging{''} processes, the use of ultrathin components,
   and multifunctional interposers will all play a key role in this
   context. Often two dimensions do no longer suffice. Because of signal
   propagation delays, wiring density, or confined available space many
   future applications require considerably more compact components. 3D
   integration can help overcome this bottleneck. Examples of 3D
   integration start with silicon 3D integration with through-silicon vias
   and go up to stacking of packages or modules at all technological
   levels. Functional packaging goes one step further. It takes the
   application system and its requirements as a starting point and then
   adapts the microelectronic functions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative real time 2-dimensional position
   feedback method, which processes visual input data from a target image
   on an actively-controlled planar pixel matrix. The objective is to
   demonstrate the ability to position an X-Y stage with high resolution,
   using direct position sensing of a dynamically controlled image. In
   order to achieve high spatial resolution using a pixel array as a
   target, an algorithm that processes both the geometric shape and the
   grayscale intensities of the image is implemented. The test platform
   consists of an X-Y stage carrying a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen
   that is imaged by a stationary digital camera. The pixel intensities on
   the LCD screen are modified dynamically to provide 2-dimensional
   position command inputs that translate to the desired stage motion. The
   digital images acquired by the camera are used to provide position error
   feedback to the controller. Experimental results show that direct
   position sensing is possible to a certain degree of accuracy. However,
   in order to match today's CNC machines' accuracy levels further
   processing of the digital images is required. A noise reduction
   algorithm to filter the fluctuations of the measurements in the digital
   images is proposed as future work, as well as other considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Musculoskeletal diseases such as rheumatoid and osteo- arthritis are
   some of the major causes of chronic disability. Their incidence is
   predicted to increase as the proportion of elderly people in the
   population increases. These conditions can result in long-term and
   variable effects on the sufferer. Education is considered to be an
   integral part of their treatment equipping patients to cope with the
   different stages of these progressive diseases.
   The range and complexity of information needed has seen the medical
   discipline of rheumatology embrace technology in support of a wide
   variety of educational interventions. Early pioneers demonstrated how
   computer assisted learning could benefit both patients and medical
   students by increasing their knowledge about these conditions. The
   establishment of the Internet has provided a new medium for wide spread
   dissemination of information. As this digital evolution continues there
   is increasing interest in how video games might be used to stimulate
   learning in younger generations who have grown up with this type of
   media.
   These educational initiatives have proven to be measurably successful.
   Patients have access to a broad knowledge base from which they are able
   to increase their understanding of their illness, resulting in
   beneficial changes in behaviour. Medical students and qualified doctors
   have ready access to current research and best practise. The flexibility
   of the delivery medium supports more adaptable and distance modes of
   study whilst encouraging students to be more self-sufficient learners.
   Computer assisted education has established itself as an invaluable
   resource in support of medical teaching and learning. But it will not
   appeal to everyone. Given the challenges facing each individual in
   education, these resources can only be commended, with learners now
   having access to a range of resources from which they can meet their
   educational needs. Continued development and innovative use of new media
   is likely to broaden their appeal and enhance their educational
   efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{This study intends to investigate PHS phone and its application in an
   elementary school. The interview process targeted on the projector who
   directed the plan of PHS phone from an experimental elementary school
   located in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan. She Joined all of digital
   experimental project and observed interaction between the parents and
   their own children in that specific elementary school. In the
   experimental period, the projector observed each parents using a PHS
   phone through message transmission and mobile net communication, and the
   parents discussed and shared feelings with the teacher and other parents
   through using PHS phone. The research summarized the projector's ideas
   and provided references opinion information to instruction designers and
   mobile learning projectors to develop further innovative instruction.}},

Journal = {{NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING AND EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{3-18}},
Abstract = {{Thermal shock is an extreme form of thermo-mechanical loading. Detailed
   investigations of thermal shock and lifetime analysis close to reality
   are necessary in industrial engineering, in order to get a good
   prediction of life expectancy for high quality and safety relevant
   machine components. This paper concentrates on experimental
   investigations of structural changes of the surface due to thermal shock
   loading, as structural changes in surface-like cracks are one of the
   main parameters which influence lifetime. For this purpose, cylindrical
   specimens of heat resistant steel (X15CrNiSi20-12) are heated up by a
   gas burner and are cooled down by water quench in a cyclical manner.
   After a continuous number of thermal shock cycles the girthed area of
   the specimen is measured by eddy current to find surface embrittlement,
   crack initiation and crack progress. Signal barriers for the impedance
   signal of the eddy current sensor are introduced in order to quantify
   the two dominating categories of surface damage, micro cracks and macro
   cracks. Furthermore, a so-called accumulated crack length is introduced
   as a damage parameter. This is related to the signal barriers and
   quantifies damage with respect to the number of thermal shock cycles.
   Furthermore, for visualisation of damage an innovative 3D plotting
   method is introduced, which projects eddy current data onto the
   digitalised surface.}},

Abstract = {{Current maritime systems are to a large extent based on legacy analog
   VHF radios for ship-to-shore communications near port waters, and
   relatively low bandwidth digital satellite communications (SatCom) for
   long-range ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications. The cost of
   bandwidth for SatCom networks is expected to remain high due to the cost
   of launching satellites into orbit and also due to the stabilizers
   required for presently available on-board antennas. On the other hand,
   the legacy VHF system comprises low bandwidth radios incapable of
   supporting applications requiring high data rates. Unlike the
   terrestrial net-works, advancement in maritime networks is severely
   lagging behind its land counterpart.
   MARINTEK is the principle investigator of the MarCom project, a joint
   initiative between several national and international R\&D institutions,
   Universities and Colleges, Public Authorities and Industry, funded by
   the industry itself and The Norwegian Research Council's MAROFF program,
   and aiming at developing a novel digital communication system platform
   to ensure the proliferation of innovative mobile network applications
   presently being widely implemented on land-based wireless systems}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine trends towards ``user
   centricity{''} in web-based digital identity technologies, and analyse
   these technologies in light of universal principles of human-centred
   design and usability in order to recommend future directions.
   Design/methodology/approach - Web users' habits and relevant usability
   research are analysed and requirements for identity-enabled online
   interactions are proposed given this context. Modem identity
   technologies of various types are then studied to assess their ability
   to satisfy the requirements.
   Findings - The results of these analyses point towards a possible
   explanation for the lack of wide adoption of today's user-centric
   solutions.
   Research limitations/implications - Based on the findings of the
   analyses, practical implications and recommendations are offered.
   Originality/value - The paper's discussion of usability factors to
   consider and its set of final recommendations in light of these factors
   are new work that may be useful to identity management developers and
   deployers looking to achieve better user adoption, as well as to
   researchers and innovators in the fields of social networking and vendor

Abstract = {{The IGCP 509 project is collating global information for the
   Palaeoproterozoic era through the activities of numerous international
   collaborators. A database system (StratDB) and web interface has been
   designed to facilitate this process with links to an existing
   geochronology database (DateView). As a result, all information captured
   will remain available in a digital format for future researchers. The
   philosophy and design of the database and some of the outputs available
   from it are described. One of the principal features of the system is
   that it facilitates the construction of time-space correlation charts
   using an innovative application of GIS technology to nongeographic
   information, which permits users to query a variety of attribute
   information associated with lithostratigraphic units, metamorphic and
   deformation episodes associated with user-selected tectonic domains,
   large igneous provinces and major ore deposits. In the process, much of
   the manual labour normally associated with the construction of such
   charts in standard graphical or drafting packages is avoided.
   Associations between units, deformation, metamorphism, large igneous
   provinces and ore deposits may become more apparent once linked
   information is available for querying and investigation.
   Geochronological information from the DateView database may also be
   linked to entities stored in StratDB. GIS maps may be linked to the
   attribute information in StratDB and DateView to construct a variety of
   time-slice maps or palaeogeographic reconstructions with the same
   symbology as is used in the time-space correlation charts. This database
   system will facilitate the dissemination of lithostratigraphic
   information for many countries to a broader community and will help
   non-specialists to easily view information for various Palaeoproterozoic
   tectonic domains. The system is illustrated using a preliminary
   compilation of information for the Palaeoproterozoic of southern Africa.
   The correlation charts and time-slice maps provide insights to the
   geological evolution of this region which emphasize some aspects and
   correlations which have not previously been extensively considered; for
   instance, possible correlation of units in the central and western zones
   of the Limpopo Belt (South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana) with the
   Magondi Belt of Zimbabwe and its extension into northern Botswana.}},

   Starting from the procedures and the performance parameters of automated
   photogrammetric DEM generation, the results of some practical tests with
   large scale images are presented. The DEM are derived from images token
   by a digital large-frame aerial camera and checked by reference data of
   superior accuracy. In average, a vertical accuracy of sigma(h) = 13 cm
   or 0.20 per thousand of the mean flying height above mean terrain has
   been achieved. Some recent innovations in digital large-frame cameras
   and in the processing software give hope for even better results. In
   comparison with results from film-based cameras, it can be stated that
   both technologies are able to produce very dense and accurate DEMS.}},

Abstract = {{In the medical domain, digital images are produced in ever-increasing
   quantities, which offer great opportunities for diagnostics, therapy and
   training. So how to manage these data and utilize them effectively and
   efficiently possess significant technical challenges. Thus, the
   technique of Content-based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) emerges as
   the times require. However, current CBMIR is not sufficient to capture
   the semantic content of images. Accordingly, in this paper, an
   innovative approach for medical image knowledge representation and
   retrieval is proposed by focusing on the mapping modeling between visual
   feature and semantic concept. Firstly, the low-level fusion visual
   features are extracted based on statistical features. Secondly, a set of
   disjoint semantic tokens with appearance in medical images is selected
   to define a Visual and Medical Vocabulary. Thirdly, to narrow down the
   semantic gap and increase the retrieval efficiency, we investigate
   support vector machine (SVM) to associate low-level visual image
   features with their high-level semantic. Experiments are conducted with
   a medical image DB consisting of 300 diverse medical images obtained
   from the Hei Longjiang Province Hospital. And the comparison of the
   retrieval results shows that the approach proposed in this paper is
   effective.}},

Abstract = {{Super alloy was widely used in a variety of industry field such as
   aeronautics and astronautics, and plasma deposition manufacturing has
   provided an effective way in fabricating refractory and intractable
   parts e.g., super alloy parts directly from their digital models.
   However, there is much difficulty in fabricating parts with large
   obliquity because of the flowing of molten pool caused by gravity field.
   In this paper, an innovated method named electromagnetic-compressed
   plasma deposition manufacturing is presented which employs the
   electromagnetic field to decrease the effectiveness of the flowing of
   molten pool. The result shows that the complicated parts with big
   overhang structure and large obliquity could be fabricated under proper
   tool path and the help of electromagnetic. Some parts with complex shape
   were trial manufactured which proves that electromagnetic-assisted
   plasma deposition manufacturing is a promising technology in direct
   rapid manufacturing.}},

   current range of source-image types, such as sequences of photographs,
   laser scans, and 3D computer graphics (CG) scenes made with software
   designed for other applications. This project develops a set of
   innovative techniques for creating 3D digital content specifically for
   digital holograms, with virtual tools which enable the direct
   hand-crafting of subjects, mark by mark, analogous to Michelangelo's
   practice in drawing, painting and sculpture. The haptic device, the

Abstract = {{The blind community access to books has been done mainly through
   audiotapes. Blind readers generally have to rely on Braille books or
   talking books for their study, work, or leisure. Nowadays, the blind
   have several barriers. Blind persons face some problems and difficulties
   such as chances to learn, practice, and communicate as same as normal
   persons do, so they are in a bad situation. This is because media and
   talking books are few in number. As a result, there is a need to improve
   the production system to help solve lack of media and talking books
   problem. Thus, the purpose of the present research was to develop and to
   evaluate an innovative production system for the blinds. This system was
   an audio streaming media technology over Internet. It can interact with
   users as well as recognize and record speech to produce digital talking
   books (DTB). The program demonstrated and reflected content extraction
   of books and streaming audio for producing DTB. The system was developed
   based on the result of the problems, need and tendency of digital
   talking books production system for the blind. Then this program was
   tried explain testing before it was evaluated by five experts. The Index
   of item Objective Congruence (IOC) is .81. The program was corrected and
   improved before trial with a target group. The target groups of this
   study consisted of 49 staff and 120 volunteers of the Blind Library in
   Thailand. Subjects were selected by simple random sampling. This paper
   outlines the theory, illustrates the process, and displays sample
   program of record and DTB production. Finally, the assessments of the
   performance of the program are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of e-government services depend on the number of citizens
   who take advantage of them. The purpose of this quantitative,
   correlational research study was to determine barriers to e-government
   use as perceived by citizens at the municipal level in Mexico. The
   technology acceptance model (TAM), the diffusion of innovations (DOI)
   theory, and models of web trust formed the theoretical framework of the
   study. In this study, 15 hypotheses tested the relation of demographic
   variables, TAM, DOI, and web trust constructs to the intention to use
   e-government services of 149 taxpayers of the city of Chihuahua, Mexico,
   who did not to use the e-government services for payment provided by the
   government of their municipality. The findings of this study show that
   trust in the Internet, trust in government, perceptions of convenience,
   perceptions of compatibility, access to the Internet, perceptions of
   ease of use, and perceptions of relative advantage are related to the
   intention to use e-government services. Conversely, awareness of the
   existence of e-government services, income level, family structure, age,
   literacy level, computer literacy level, gender, and possession of
   bankcards are not individually related to the intention to use
   e-government services of those persons who made face-to-face payments at
   the treasury office. In this study, the only demographic variable found
   to be related to the intention to use e-government services was
   citizens' access to the Internet. The high levels in the constructs used
   to measure perceived usefulness, relative advantage, and compatibility
   suggest that citizens are willing to use e-government services.
   Therefore, government leaders should work on increasing Internet access,
   usability of their e-government applications, trust in the Internet, and
   trust in the perceived capability of their agencies to conduct online
   transactions securely. Government leaders must focus on expanding the
   reach of e-government services towards vulnerable groups; otherwise, the
   advantages of e-government will benefit only the more affluent groups of
   society, increasing social inequality, and will become another factor
   that widens the digital divide.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an innovative Brazilian experience of use of free
   software in public administration and its preliminary impacts on the
   Brazilian society. It describes a new concept: the Brazilian Public
   Software (BPS) developed by policy makers of the Ministry of Planning,
   Budget and Management. The policy makers were concerned with the
   limitations of Free Software Model of Production (FSMP) to public
   administration. Efforts have been made to create an ambience where
   public entities could download and install software. Issues like
   installation and operational support, quality of software (user
   interfaces, manuals, etc), bugs, etc., were not effectively solved by
   the FSMP alone. On the other hand, the Government was also interested in
   creating a virtual ambience in which private entities could also open
   and share their software. It meant having additional intellectual
   property issues, brand issues, etc. Then, the policy makers of the
   Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management shaped the new concept, the
   Brazilian Public Software that is based on code opening (FSMP), but
   includes some additional duties to the entity that makes the software
   available. To support and to make the concept operational an
   institutional, an environment was formed and so a virtual ambience named
   Brazilian Public Software Portal (BPSP) began to exist. Since their
   beginning in 2006, BPSP (www.softwarepublico.gov.br) increased their
   number of associates to 40,000 users and today it has 22 software
   solutions available, in many technological areas: geo-processing,
   health, public town management (sanitation, hospitals management, data
   management, etc) even software solutions originated from private
   entities that had public interest like textual database and web
   application server ambience. Others related portals were created like:
   4CMBr, driven to municipalities; Virtual Market focused on services;
   5CQualiBr centered on the quality of the software in a large sense and
   in the ecosystem sustainability. The 5CQualiBr is under construction and
   it is an outcome of the partnership with the Information Technology
   Center Renato Archer - CTI, from which the present article is part of.
   The preliminary impacts of BPS are concerned with: government software
   development cost reduction; reuse of software and increase of software
   longevity; improvement of technological apprenticeship inside the
   technical communities of the Government; support to small municipalities
   on introducing the Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) in
   the management process, and even introducing a digital culture where
   there was not anyone; creation of an ambience of collaborative software
   development.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the theoretical approach used to describe the
   phenomenon of a cooperative network to produce public software in
   Brazilian Government. Brazilian Public Software (BPS) is a project of
   Planning, Budget and Management Ministry of Brazil that introduces a new
   concept and operational structure to produce software. BPS project is
   based on code opening model (free software production model), but it
   also includes additional duties to the entity that make software
   available. It is supported by a new juridical and institutional
   framework that drives software to be a public good. To support and to
   make the concept operational, it was created a virtual ambience named
   Brazilian Public Software Portal (www.softwarepublico.gov.br). This
   project began in 2006 e today there is more than 40,000 people using the
   portal and 28 solutions available. The network formed has an intense
   dynamic of social interaction, but also reflecting in other variables
   domains n, like intellectual property, technological infrastructure,
   public appropriation of technology, quality patterns, juridical issues
   of software use in the government, etc. Therefore, it is a system that
   has a large amount of non linear cause-effect relationships, its
   frontiers are tenuous and a quick entrance of new variables that
   produces non trivial implications. After data surveys and several
   reflections, the Complex Thinking Theory (CTT) seems to be the better
   pathway to understand the dynamic of BPS project growth.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations such as online public consultations denote a promising
   advance, but with results which have not been properly studied up to
   this moment in Brazil. One of the goals of this research in progress is
   to assess the usage of certified scientific knowledge to sustain
   perspectives both from the Brazilian government, in the documents on
   health policies subjected to consultation from 2003 to 2008, and from
   the comments posted by contributors, with a Bibliometrics /
   Scientometrics study to verify ranking, frequency and distribution of
   sources and show areas of greater interest to government branches,
   individuals, institutions and social groups. The analysis has counted so
   far 278 citations of scientific works published from 1948 to 2008; 60\%
   (167) of them referred to works published in the last 9 years
   (2000-2008). The citation of fresh scientific achievements seemed to be
   preferred as a way of giving credibility to an argument in online
   debates created by tools of digital democracy. Books, book chapters and
   journal articles represent 67\% (186) of the sample, which indicates
   that the usual means of academic scientific communication were
   preferred, rather than official sources. English was the language of the
   majority of the cited journal articles.}},

Abstract = {{The Accelerated Radical Innovation (A RI) Methodology is an integrated
   approach to shepherding radical innovation from initial vision through
   commercialization and integration into the economy within acceptable
   levels of risk, cost, and schedule. Extending over the full life cycle
   of the innovation, the methodology encompasses two major periods, an
   inception period (identification and assessment of four key challenge
   areas, comprehensive intelligence gathering and analysis leading to a
   detailed system vision of the innovation), and an implementation period
   (execution on the system vision through full commercialization).
   Most of the ARI methodology development to date has focused on the
   analytical aspects of the inception period. This paper focuses on the
   post-vision execution period. To understand how execution is
   successfully carried out in practice, the authors conducted a detailed
   study of an investor-funded seed-stage innovation incubation firm
   (ConduIT Corp.) and four of the seed-stage companies in its portfolio.
   Six factors were found to underlie ConduIT's success: (1) careful
   culling of innovation concepts for evidence of market need, manageable
   technical risk, and alignment of business interests; (2) an ultra-lean
   operating model to improve survivability through the innovation's
   ``valley of death;{''} (3) creation of a business model to assure
   profitable commercialization; (4) internally provided coaching and
   professional services by ConduIT's principals; (5) strict accountability
   based on attainment of milestones; and (6) concentration within
   ConduIT's defined ecology (health care IT, digital media, and Web-based
   applications) so that its expertise and network can be used to greatest
   effect.
   ConduIT's experience offers five important lessons for radical
   innovation. First, an extended process of experimentation with products,
   strategies, and business models is needed. Second, early infusions of
   capital can create premature, counterproductive financial pressures on
   the innovator. Third, on the contrary, ConduIT has demonstrated that the
   early-stage experimentation process can be accomplished at a low burn
   rate (the ``bootstrapping{''} approach), allowing fundamental concepts
   of the business to gel. Fourth, at the earliest stages of a technology
   enterprise, a large dose of improvisation in unavoidable. Last, the
   bootstrapping model forces innovators to go directly to the source of
   problems (rather than papering over them with cash), leading ultimately
   to a more agile, resilient, survivable enterprise. The lessons offered
   by ConduIT are incorporated as best practices into the ARI methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Many Japanese chemical material based companies supply various kinds of
   digital materials for high technology based industries, like
   semiconductor. Their market shares are over 50\% in global. That is one
   of the hidden strongest industries in Japan.
   There are big expectations for high-tech start-up companies for play
   innovative roles at the cutting edge of high technology based
   industries; semiconductor, display, solar cell, etc.
   On the contrary, there is not enough study of digital material based
   start-up companies from new material development point of view.
   In this paper, I could report a case study of chemical material based
   Start-up Company and propose revised business model based on the cube
   model which was presented in 2007 PICMET.}},

   and broadcast industries. These products rely on embedded software to
   provide enhanced functionality such as data streaming, digital to
   analogue conversion and display driving. In this sense embedded software
   can be seen as a powerful enabler for the emergence of new technologies
   and of the industries in which they are deployed. For technologists, the
   question of how best to manage the development and commercialisation of
   the embedded software inevitably arises.
   Traditionally, techniques used for developing and managing software in
   general have also been applied to embedded software. However this
   ignores certain characteristics that are unique to embedded software. In
   particular it has been argued that dependencies on the physical world
   mean that embedded software should be treated differently.
   This paper explores one case from digital broadcasting and reports on
   the development and management methods used. The challenges faced by the
   managers are examined in the context of the proposed means of
   commercialisation. The characteristics of the approaches adopted are
   compared against those reported in literature, and learning from this
   experience will be used to assist the development of methods specially
   tailored to embedded software.}},

Abstract = {{For decades semiconductor developments have been driven by Moore's Law
   productivity gains. This led to extremely fast digital processors,
   increase in bandwidth and huge memories that boost productivity of PCs,
   mobile phones, and other applications demanding heavy data traffic and
   storage. The economics of the IC industry as well as developments in
   society, however, will cause the trend to turn, leading to a paradigm
   shift in the semiconductors world.
   Our industry is confronted with sky-rocketing cost levels for
   System-On-Chip development in advanced CMOS technology. Secondly,
   ongoing shrinking the physical dimensions will eventually cause Moore's
   Law to come to an end.
   At the same time, consumer demand shifts from ever more productive
   consumer electronics to a variety of new smart products adding value to
   daily life. A globally graying population demands for innovations in
   medical devices and food safety. Raising environmental awareness demands
   for smart ``green{''} solutions. In transportation IC innovations help
   to bring safety, to overcome traffic congestion, and to deliver all
   thinkable information to consumers on the move.
   These and many more applications are typically realized by integration
   of existing CMOS technologies with ``More-than-Moore{''} technologies,
   like Analog/Mixed-Signal, High-Voltage, and MEMS.
   In his keynote presentation we will elaborate on the paradigm shift in
   the semiconductor industry, and present a number of
   ``More-than-Moore{''} applications and underlying enabling technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Measured data of a product can be incomplete because of the
   inaccessibility or invisibility of some portions of the product surface
   for measure tools in reverse engineering, which could makes it difficult
   for reverse engineering systems to create the CAD model from those
   measured data. In this paper, a novel incomplete data repair method
   based on haptic interaction is presented. Starting from the import of a
   dataset digitized from a physical object, various haptic sculpting tools
   are explored to repair the incomplete measured data, and the shape and
   size of these tools may be changed dynamically to satisfy specific
   situations, which forms a flexible and intuitive sculpting toolbox used
   to clean and repair the measured data. A high-quality STL file can be
   obtained from the system which is ideal for rapid prototyping. Case
   study is also given to demonstrate the feasibility of this new method,
   and finally a future direction of integration repairing measured data
   with designing innovative new object through haptic interaction in
   reverse engineering is proposed.}},

   Experimental results show that the approach has achieved high accuracy
   of 98.62\%. The iris verification algorithm is designed to suit for DSP
   implementation. Templates are encoded in binary format because they are
   compact in size and can avoid the visibility of the individual iris
   images. The binary templates can be stored and processed effectively
   using DSP technology. The iris verification system is realized on
   state-of-the-art Analog Devices ADSP-BF561 to achieve fast verification
   performance. DSP technology provides a cost effective, low power and

Abstract = {{The GPS system was originally developed for military uses. It does not
   meet civil aviation requirements in terms of accuracy, continuity, and
   integrity. This has become the stimulus for the development of different
   satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS), including the Wide Area
   Augmentation System (WAAS) by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
   and EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System) by the
   European community {[}2]. Inside of all the SBAS infrastructures, the
   Ground Reference Receivers (RRx) became one of the most critical
   contributors to the system integrity and continuity.
   NovAtel has a rich experience as the world's leading supplier of Ground
   Reference Receivers to satellite augmentation systems in Europe, the
   USA, Australia, Japan and China. NovAtel was awarded a contract to
   develop the second generation RRx for the WAAS system in 2002. The
   second generation WAAS-GII receiver features: enhanced Multipath
   Estimating Delay Lock Loop (MEDLL) performance; Signal Quality
   Monitoring (SQM) measurements; digital pulsed blanking; and Narrow
   Correlator (TM) Tracking Technology. This paper reviews the innovations,
   unique features and performance of the WAAS-GII receiver.
   One of the innovations lies in the Forward Error Correction (FEC)
   decoder for the Geostationary (GEO) Navigation message. The WAAS signal
   employs a rate (1)/(2) convolutional encoding when transmitting
   navigation data bits. This encoding inherits a symbol alignment problem.
   It relies on the receiver to determine the correct symbol alignment so
   that the navigation data bits can be decoded successfully. An algorithm
   is developed for the WAAS-GII receiver to quickly and reliably detect
   the symbol alignment with the minimum CPU resources.
   This paper also reviews another important feature of WAAS-GII: Signal
   Quality Monitor (SQM). The infamous ``SV19{''} failure leads to the
   requirements for direct monitoring of the correlation function
   distortion of the signal in space. SQM has been thoroughly investigated
   in {[}1] and {[}3]. However, WAAS-GII is one of the few industrial
   GPS/WAAS receivers in the world which can provide real-time data to
   conduct GPS and GEO satellite signal quality. In this paper, the test to
   verify the SQM functionality is described. A tightly controlled
   simulator environment is created to form a determinate correlation
   function. The test results show that the measured correlation values
   agree with the theoretical expected values.}},

Abstract = {{With the fusion in the world of art and science, technology has made a
   dent in the course of art, and there is now a time and place for those
   actively interested in both the academics of art and science like never
   before. Interactive art is one of the current trends that can be seen
   from this group of creative minds. The incorporation of code into forms
   of visual art helps create a dialogue between the artwork and the
   audience. We describe the use of the Processing coding toolkit along
   with other methods for digital artists to create innovative interactive
   artworks. By furthering the application of this intriguing art form, we
   can surely gain benefits in a wide range of fields, such as promotional
   purposes or any way in creatively expressing a figure.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative technique used for categorizing motion pictures and
   television shows based on motion activity is presented First, scenes
   extracted from digitally stored movies and television programs are
   segmented into separate clips based on various editing effects such as
   hard cuts, fades and dissolves. Next, the initial frame of the sequence
   is automatically segmented into meaningful objects using color and
   texture features using any image segmentation algorithm chosen by the
   author. An object tracking algorithm utilizing motion is then applied to
   each Intra (I) frame and each Predicted (P) frame in the video sequence.
   Interesting objects undergoing the highest degree of motion are then
   automatically selected for additional analysis. The distance between
   corresponding object's centroids existing in adjacent frames is computed
   for each interesting object. These distances are then used in
   classifying the clip as being an action or non-action video.}},

Abstract = {{In a short time new demanding applications, as for instance financial
   and life critical timing and positioning services, will be included in
   the plethora of uses of new Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).
   They will require the ability to restrict access to some class of
   protected information by the user position meaning, provided by some
   GNSS technology. Access control tokens using trusted GNSS receivers will
   provide the information security core for this kind of applications,
   including banking, enterprise and secure timestamps. In this paper a
   Time-Frequency (TF) signal validation algorithm is proposed as valuable
   tool both to define metrics to quantify the trustworthiness of the
   navigation signal and to provide countermeasure to the receiver
   functionalities. This algorithm can work as a subfunction of a signal
   conditioning stage placed between the Analogto-Digital Converter and the
   acquisition block in an innovative secure GNSS receiver. The proposed
   method is based on a synthesis technique using the so called
   Orthogonal-Like Gabor Expansion in order to obtain an estimation of the
   interference to be subtracted to the input signal. Tests have been
   conducted using Continuous Wave (CW), chirp interference and combination
   of them added to GNSS signals. Baseline GPS BPSK(1), TMBOC(6,1,4/3,3),
   BOC(1,1) and Galileo CBOC(6,1,1/11) modulations are simulated for the
   scope by a software GNSS simulator. The algorithm performance are
   evaluated at the output of the acquisition stage by means of Receiver
   Operative Characteristics (ROC) curves, showing encouraging results in
   terms of mitigation effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{For 15+ years, AFRL's Advanced Concepts Exploration (ACE) team has
   orchestrated many ``first of its kind{''} simulation technologies
   including the Antenna WaveFront Simulator (AWFS), GPS Interference and
   Navigation Tool (GIANT), Virtual Flight Testing (VFT), and the
   Vertical-sensing Effectiveness and CONOPS Tool for Operational
   Requirements (VECTOR). These simulation technologies have been used
   successfully in the characterization and test of most anti-jam GPS
   technology developed since 1995. The AWFS Next Gen (ANG) continues this
   tradition of innovation by creating the most realistic GPS anti-jam
   antenna array RF hardware in the loop simulator in the world. Although
   many ``wavefront simulators{''} now exist throughout the test community,
   ANG is believed to be the first true antenna wavefront simulator. Using
   digital signal processing techniques and off the shelf signal
   generators, ANG creates a dynamic antenna frequency response that
   closely matches real world antenna elements as installed on a platform
   or groundplane. Operational for more than three years, ANG has been used
   extensively for evaluations of various GPS anti-jam technologies
   including GPS Antenna System (GAS-1), Advanced Digital Antenna
   Procurement (ADAP), Digital Antenna Control Unit (DACU) and Joint
   Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS). ANG is the basis for
   AFRL's Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) Testbed. This paper describes the
   history and motivation behind the project, overall system design,
   simulation components associated with NAVWAR VFT, verification, and a
   blended test process that includes Modeling and Simulation (M\&S),
   Hardware in the Loop (HWIL) and flight testing.}},

   Innovative receiver software, executed on a LEON processor, facilitates
   application specific tailoring of the receiver hardware. Flexibility is
   also offered by a compact low multi-path antenna concept, allowing for
   interconnecting several antenna elements to support beam-forming. The
   measured receiver performance agrees with theory and is well within the

Abstract = {{Generally, when someone refers to architectural property he inclines to
   consider only that part of architecture and monuments belonging at
   remote epochs far since our days. However authors' opinion is that the
   diffusion and the spreading of the culture cannot leave out from the
   analysis, the study and the conservation also of architecture and all
   things realized in more recent times. However, the characteristics of
   the modern and contemporary architecture with respect to those
   precedents lead to the development of a definition for new approaches
   and adequate representation forms because of the presence both of
   materials and innovative technologies like the tubular or trellis
   structures, that show then different difficulty in the interpretation
   and definition of the acquired data. In such direction, the new digital
   technologies allow, from a part, a rationalization and rapidity of the
   relief operations, from the other they allow to create some new
   representations which can easily fit to the scholars and operators
   (architects, engineers, restorers, historians, etc) demands, or to be
   used to produce faithful copies through quick prototype techniques, but
   also, more simply, to give back enjoyable such information easily by
   town councils or web users. The developed and described, in this
   article, experiences have the aim of verify the potentialities of laser
   scanner in surveying of structures, for whom traditional techniques of
   relief could result disadvantageous in terms of realization's times,
   costs and precision. A particular attention has addressed to elaboration
   phase, data filtering and 3D modeling through the use of specific and
   opportune algorithms of best-fitting, useful for individualization and
   extraction of forms.}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence of new technologies on a continual basis, it is
   imperative that Educational Institutions integrate these new
   technologies as subject matter and learning tools in their curriculums.
   One of these emerging technologies is Digital or Serious Games, and is
   receiving widespread attention from educational institutions because of
   its multi-faceted application potential. The success of Serious Games
   within an educational environment is, amongst other factors, due to
   their engaging and entertaining nature. Learners are also more
   comfortable with Gaming technologies because they are already familiar
   with similar technologies on a day to day basis. There are a number of
   Serious Games currently being used by educational institutions in this
   regard, one of these being IBM (R)'s Innov8. Innov8 is a serious game
   which was developed by IBM (R) as part of their Academic Initiative
   programme. The author's institution registered for the programme
   specifically to gain access to Innov8 as they wanted to explore the
   possibility of implementing relevant Serious Games across its
   Information Systems curriculum. The game employs a first-person
   role-playing approach where the player assumes the role of a consultant
   within a company that is experiencing challenges. The two primary aims
   of the game are to teach players who come from a more technical
   background about business processes and more specifically about Business
   Process Management (BPM, while at the same time immersing them in a
   three-dimensional world which is closely aligned to real-life scenarios.
   The author's have conducted an extensive evaluation on the first version
   of Innov8 for use within their university's Information Systems
   curriculum. The purpose of this paper is to explain the evaluation
   criteria that were used as well as highlighting the findings of the
   evaluation. This evaluation draws from established theoretical
   frameworks, from the education and psychology fields including: Bloom's
   Taxonomy, Gagne's Event's of Instruction and Keller's Attention
   Relevance Confidence Satisfaction model.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated organisational IT systems, such as enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) and digital manufacturing (DM), have promised and
   delivered substantial performance benefits to many adopting firms.
   However, implementations of such systems have tended to be problematic.
   ERP projects, in particular, are prone to cost and time overruns, not
   delivering anticipated benefits and often being abandoned before
   completion. While research has developed around IT implementation, this
   has focused mainly on standalone (or discrete), as opposed to
   integrated, IT systems. Within this literature, organisational (i.e.
   structural and cultural) characteristics have been found to influence
   implementation success. The key aims of this research are (a) to
   investigate the role of organisational characteristics in determining IT
   implementation success; (b) to determine whether their influence differs
   for integrated IT and discrete IT projects, and; (c) to develop specific
   guidelines for managers of integrated IT implementations. An in-depth
   comparative case study of two IT projects was conducted within a major
   aerospace manufacturing company. Results show that certain
   organisational characteristics were perceived to be more or less
   important and beneficial for integrated than for discrete IT
   implementation. The contribution of the paper to theory is the
   distinction and comparison between integrated and discrete IT, which
   tends to be overlooked in the implementation literature. Practically, it
   provides necessary guidance for current and future adopters of
   integrated IT (ERP, SCM, CRM and, particularly, DM) systems, by
   proposing an optimum configuration of organisational factors for
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{This study started from the intention to develop the persuasive theory
   Model explaining the adoption process of Digital Multimedia
   Broadcasting(DMB). DMB services were unveiled in Korea on December 1,
   2005, marking the beginning of a full-fledged mobile TV era for the
   country. I established hypothesis under the objectives of study such as
   which factors explain such adoption process most properly and how it can
   be structured based Expanded Technology Acceptance Model(ETAM). the
   results of hypothesis test for each, first, the application possibility
   of TAM established in this study, was found to be supported through fit
   index of structural equation model(SEM). Second, 4 factors,
   social-cultural influence, perceived price, network externalities, and
   consumer's innovativeness, was derived as the persuasive external
   factors that can expand TAM in explaining adoption of DMB. Both
   social-cultural influence and consumer's innovativeness was revealed
   that each of all relation in variables have a significant influence. But
   perceived price and network externalities, are revealed that had a
   significant influence partially.}},

Abstract = {{The 3D Web technologies known as Virtual Worlds can be characterised as
   combining the global reach of the internet with the ability to
   experience geometrically complex 3D environments in real-time
   simultaneously with other visitors. Visually and functionally rich
   virtual environments ran be created which can closely approximate
   physical world environments and activities thus enabling innovative ways
   of delivering teaching and training. This provides an opportunity to
   fundamentally re-define user engagements and educational offerings. This
   paper reports on a functionally and visually rich virtual 3D landscape,
   `Financial Services Island', designed to enable `accelerated learning
   experiences' in the financial sector for young students. The highly
   interactive, immersive and multi-modal virtual landscape exploits the
   potential for personal experiential interactions and stimulating
   learning experiences in financial services within the digital realm.
   This paper presents, in the form of a case study, the key stages of
   developments and associated methodology, the challenges of adapting new
   3D internet technology to education and reflections on the encouraging

Abstract = {{Convergence is an apparent trend in current technological and business
   environment bringing the need for fundamental changes in companies'
   innovation activities and operational practices. This paper focuses on
   product complements convergence type, which has general practical
   importance especially to technology and innovation management, and
   product development. Convergence in complements takes place when
   previously unrelated products become complementary and create greater
   value to the consumer if used in combination. Complimentary products
   come from different related industries, and companies enter new value
   systems to exploit technological opportunities. Often the key focus of
   collaboration is product interoperability and technical standards
   enabling products to work together. This type of cooperation is often
   called coopetition, when cooperation and competition happens at the same
   time. Partners cooperate in setting industry standards and developing
   added value to customers but compete for created surplus in the value
   chain. In relation to ICT industry, the recent technological
   innovations, digitalization of media, de-regulation of markets and
   changes in consumer preferences have led technologies and markets that
   previously followed distinct trajectories, to mix and partially merge.
   Products embed features from related industries and enter new markets
   leading to market enlargement and new industry value ecosystems
   creation. To adapt to new technological and market conditions, companies
   need to increasingly innovate and develop new products often by means of
   collaborative arrangements to get access to new competencies and
   knowledge. Factors determining partnering success under convergence are
   different from other environments, studied in earlier literature. This
   paper contributes to existing body of knowledge on convergence and
   inter-company collaboration from operational management level point of
   view by ranking collaboration success factors needed under product
   complements convergence type. Managers should pay particular attention
   to setting clear collaboration objectives and specifications, legal
   arrangements between parties, quality of the product, developing trust,
   ensuring management support and customer orientation.}},

Abstract = {{A regular feature of the Nigerian tertiary education context is large
   numbers of students crammed into small classrooms or lecture theatres.
   This context had long begged for the creation of innovative learning
   spaces and adoption of engaging pedagogies. Recourse to technology
   support and experimenting with the WIKI as a learning tool at the
   Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria gave us an insight into
   the benefits and challenges of the set-up and use of new knowledge
   technologies in our technology-poor context. This paper reports an
   experiment in an extra-large (XXL) class of freshmen (2000+) on a module
   of second language project writing using the WIKI. The paper emphasises
   the unique advantages of the WIKI in a large blended learning class and
   the affordances for socio-cultural and collaborative learning
   experience. In creating new learning teams and forging collaboration
   among learners leveraging one another's abilities, the wiki experience
   extended the `classroom' beyond the physical space, engaged students in
   interactional communication in the second language, encouraged
   negotiation of meaning, and challenged learners in finding their
   `solutions' to real life problems around them, aside from acquisition of
   hands-on digital literacy. The paper reports on how learners experience
   and participate in learning on a technology supported module. Data for
   the investigation and evaluation of students' learning experiences were
   collected using teacher observation of team formation and collaboration
   on activities offline and tracked students' logs, footprints and
   activities on group pages online; students' feedback on the
   end-of-course learners evaluation forms; and their reflections as
   gleaned from their comments, encouraged and freely made continually by
   many from inception through to the end of the course, on the front page
   of our wiki. The report employs both qualitative and quantitative
   parameters. Results indicated a large number of students would like more
   of their courses supported by technology and thought the medium offered
   hope for the future, as it opened up new vistas in their learning.}},

Abstract = {{Gaming is an old habit for humans and, with the advent of the PC this
   tradition has been changed by technology. Every year brings new
   challenges, in a digital format, that lead young and adults to spend
   hours in front of a computer or TV screen in the attempt to overcome
   hurdles and reach an objective. The quality, sophistication, and
   constant innovation are attained through complex computer software that
   almost has the obligation to get better at each new title released,
   making game development a challenge that is as hard or even harder for
   their developers. Considering that a game title is software and thus
   faces the same restrictions of business applications, this article
   intends to analyze, under the optics of reuse, if game development
   resorts to re-use, and where and how this happens.}},

Title = {{Exploring the Current Theoretical Background About Adoption Through
   Institutionalization of Online Education in Universities: Needs for
   Further Research}},

Year = {{2009}},
Pages = {{124-131}},

Abstract = {{Online education in institutional contexts means new organizational
   problems. The fact that universities need to change to accommodate the
   impact of technology on learning is already known and accepted. Coping
   with changes from adoption until institutionalization of online
   education represents a formidable management challenge for universities.
   Online education, under the umbrella of e-learning was perceived by
   several early researchers as an innovation per-se, ``established and
   embedded{''} in educational institutions. Nevertheless, the Department
   for Education and Skills of UK insists that e-learning is not embedded
   at any stage of education. The focus was strongly set on technological,
   practical and pedagogical aspects but there are relevant reports about
   failures in embedding innovations in educational institutions. The
   institutional lack of strategies to cope with international students and
   new technologies as well as supporting for future online developments
   clearly appeared in recent studies. Competition in the market of Higher
   Education has pushed universities towards the adoption of sophisticated
   organizational practices to ensure effectiveness. These new
   institutional models require changing traditional functions and roles,
   as online education does not usually fit into the existing university
   structure. The transition from on-campus to online education evolves in
   new roles, either in the pedagogical or in the administration domains.
   Organizational factors, more than teachers and students attitudes or
   technological features seem to mark the differences in the general
   perception about technology-mediated education getting successfully
   embedded in institutional new programs, roles, procedures, culture and
   structures. The aim of this paper is to revisit the existing theoretical
   background about the process from adoption until institutionalization of
   online education and explore the needs for further research. The overall
   purpose is to encourage researchers to fill the gaps of knowledge
   helping university managers to address a more clear understanding of the
   individual and organizational interactions that influence the
   development of strategies and institutionalization of emergent online
   educational initiatives. Exploring the current theoretical background it
   could be found that IT-innovation adoption models describe very
   extensively organizational issues, but they mainly take into account
   educational innovation take-up, adoption and implementation as isolated
   stages. They focus on factors and prescribed practices, but not on the
   human interactions during the transition from individual adoption until
   institutionalization. The disconnection between individual and
   organizational IT adoption research was remarked by the Diffusion
   Interest Group in Information Technology (DIGIT) in their 2004
   conference. Since then, several authors have claimed for a better
   understanding of this linkage. The lack of clearness about the phenomena
   and a description of how individual and group-level processes enable
   and/or hinder the development of organizational routines, were reported
   as a still under-developed topic and according to the findings of this
   review it seems to be still an ongoing theme. Consequently, under the
   circumstance of the transformation that universities are undergoing, the
   need for a systematic study analyzing the implementation of emergent IT
   innovations in education appears as significant.
   Particularly, the process from its adoption at individual level until
   its institutionalization and the linkage between individual and
   organizatinal purposes need to be addressed.}},

   findings and future perspectives. Furthermore, the article proposes an
   evolving model for using social software in foreign language learning
   and outlines future planned work. Based on the analysis of data on
   student learning and teacher experiences, the CaFoLLe project will
   contribute to improve student learning, making available transferable
   models of case-based teaching, collaborative learning, communication and
   foreign language learning in different contexts and disciplines. The
   pilot study findings show that students using an electronic platform are
   more willing to interact and share knowledge during the entire process
   of task completion, which has resulted in higher assignment quality. The
   structure of the article is as follows: the first section outlines basic
   concepts in foreign language learning, the learning processes that
   support this and assumptions related to especially the value of
   students' need for collaboration and social based learning platforms.
   The second section of the article elaborates on Sternberg's theory
   (1997) of learning and thinking styles so as to introduce an associated
   pedagogical model for adult foreign language learning. The third section
   focuses on the applications offered by Web 2.0 in relation to
   establishing collaborative, social platforms that seek to enhance
   learning outcomes for foreign language learners. The fourth section
   describes the pilot study by outlining the preliminary findings and
   challenges posed in relation to the setting up of an innovative foreign
   language learning platform that utilizes social software and draws on
   case-based teaching. Finally, the article summarizes the main concepts
   associated with the setting up of the CaFoLLe and pinpoints towards
   future work plans.}},

Abstract = {{This paper will report on a study conducted in the western region of New
   South Wales during the early part of 2009. It was concentrated in both
   primary and secondary schools around the regional city of Dubbo, about
   350 kilometres northwest of Sydney. The study is based on an adaptive
   expertise view of teachers' professional knowledge and skill.
   Self-directed, focused problem solving and reflection in the context of
   everyday practice enables teachers, like other professionals, to learn
   and develop expertise. However, only a relatively small percentage of
   teachers engage in such practices systematically and continuously. This
   can in part be explained by the fact that teachers' work is still mostly
   conducted individually and that the organisational culture of a school
   is often not conducive to teachers' individual growth and practice
   innovations. This is a particular disadvantage in rural areas, such as
   in many parts of Australia where teachers find themselves often hundreds
   of kilometres away from the next large school. Employing a teacher-led
   design approach, we used a combination of workshops and on-line, mainly
   wiki-based collaboration to engage teams of teachers into a 6-week
   innovation activity. They were challenged with the task to innovate
   their ICT use-teachers have been more or less routinely using
   Interactive Digital Whiteboards and e-learning content-by integrating
   new elements of immersive learning (such as Second Life) into their
   teaching practices. Our main research questions were: How is TLF and
   other digital content being utilized by teams of teachers who design for
   learning experiences in immersive environments? What is the nature of
   teachers' pedagogical innovations and what is the nature of their
   innovation processes? How can teachers' distributed work and knowledge
   sharing be effectively supported, including using online collaboration
   environments (web-conferencing and wiki-based document management)? How
   do teachers interpret and utilize (on-line) resources that inform about
   the nature of educational innovation processes and about research on
   learning in immersive environments? We were particularly interested in
   the question of how teachers extend their current practices rather than
   acquire (by means of ``training{''}) completely new ones. This because
   teachers have had access to The Le@rning Federation's (TLF) digital
   learning resources, available to all Australian and New Zealand schools.
   The TLF project is a collaborative initiative of all Australian and New
   Zealand governments. Since 2001 high-quality, innovative content has
   seeded and supported schools' moves into 21st-century education, and is
   an integral part of Australia's digital education revolution, the
   national strategy. Teams of teachers were encouraged to design and/or
   adapt an `immersive learning experience' for their students, for
   instance design for learning that takes place in an easily accessible
   world such as 2nd Life or Wonderland. We used a mixed-method approach,
   collecting on-line performance as well as survey and interview data. Our
   observations on the teams' work and learning will be summarised, along
   with a range of enablers and obstacles that were identified as the
   teachers tried to come to terms with immersive environments and
   web-based collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative algorithm for adding SVC Spatial
   Scalability to all existing non-scalable H.264/AVC video streams. The
   algorithmic system builds on a full-decode-full-encode method of
   conversion and employs reuse of available data by an efficient
   downscaling of video information for different layers, thus reducing the
   complexity of the algorithm by manifold whilst maintaining a high coding
   efficiency. The complexity is further reduced by bypassing of various
   time consuming processes of the encoding process by the use of sharing
   and reuse of video information coming from original bitstream. Extensive
   analysis has been done to evaluate the gains in the coding efficiency
   and complexity of the algorithm using the full-decode-full-encode
   approach as a benchmark. The ultimate reduction in complexity is at
   least 60\% from full-decode-full-encode while maintaining the output
   video quality. The modular nature of the algorithm is designed to be
   easily adaptable to other scalable video standards as well.}},

Abstract = {{Generally, when someone refers to architectural property he inclines to
   consider only that part of architecture and monuments belonging at
   remote epochs far since our days. However authors opinion is that the
   diffusion and the spreading of the culture cannot leave out from the
   analysis, the study and the conservation also of architecture and all
   things realized in more recent times. However, the characteristics of
   the modern and contemporary architecture with respect to those
   precedents lead to the development of a definition for new approaches
   and adequate representation forms because of the presence both of
   materials and innovative technologies like the tubular or trellis
   structures, that show then different difficulty in the interpretation
   and definition of the acquired data. In such direction, the new digital
   technologies allow, from a part, a rationalization and rapidity of the
   relief operations, from the other they allow to create some new
   representations which can easily fit to the scholars and operators
   (architects, engineers, restorers, historians, etc) demands, or to be
   used to produce faithful copies through quick prototype techniques, but
   also, more simply, to give back enjoyable such information easily by
   town councils or web users. The developed and described, in this
   article, experiences have the aim of verify the potentialities of laser
   scanner in surveying of structures, for whom traditional techniques of
   relief could result disadvantageous in terms of realization's times,
   costs and precision. A particular attention has addressed to elaboration
   phase, data filtering and 3D modeling through the use of specific and
   opportune algorithms of best-fitting, useful for individualization and
   extraction of forms.}},
