Abstract = {{Techniques for manufacturing organic electronic devices {[}organic
   light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), photovoltaic cells, transistors, and
   solid-state memory] are reviewed and analyzed with respect to cost and
   market fitness in comparison to competitive approaches based on silicon
   electronics. The conclusions are (i) OLED displays will be successful
   using infrastructure largely borrowed from liquid crystal displays,
   because they provide fundamental customer value not dependent on lower
   cost; (ii) OLEDs for general lighting and organic-inorganic hybrid
   photovoltaic cells currently confront substantial barriers in cost and
   efficiency, but solutions appear feasible and would lead to very large
   volume businesses; (iii) organic crossbar memories are promising, but
   require innovations in driver architecture and interconnection; and (iv)
   organic transistors have not yet found a viable major market, but have
   great promise for highly customized, small-volume product runs using
   digital patterning techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides essential information related to the various results
   and the multiple perspectives of the GEMINI IST Project. It discusses
   the development, the deployment and the use of an integrated mediation
   platform, within the context of digital television (DTV), able to
   support modern applications and innovative services, towards promoting
   an effective convergence effect between telecommunications, broadcasting
   and information technology (IT). The system solution transforms the
   traditional value chain of the media sector and introduces a new
   mediator role that will coordinate the whole market by reducing the
   current `gap' between demand and supply forces. It promotes a new
   framework to sufficiently support the dynamic value constellation form
   or organisation. We also discuss the system architecture as well as the
   functional components and their particular role and functionalities. In
   addition, we investigate the arising opportunities for the provision of
   four different interactive multimedia services (that is,
   chatting/messaging, voting, alerting and content recommendations)
   developed according to the global Multimedia Home Platform (MHP)
   standard in parallel with the major original options promoted by the
   system itself. Furthermore, we evaluate possible business benefits for
   various categories of market players involved, and conclude with
   estimations for further future development.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The efficacy of nerve sparing techniques to save potency in
   cystoprostatectomy is about 50\%. This radical surgery may be proposed
   to young men with normal sexual function. We report the results of a
   13-year experience with our innovative seminal sparing cystectomy and
   bladder replacement to maintain sexual function in such patients.
   Materials and Methods: Seminal sparing cystectomy is a modification of
   standard radical cystectomy in which the posterior bladder dissection is
   anterior to the seminal vesicle plane to preserve the vasa deferens,
   seminal vesicles, prostatic capsule and neurovascular bundles. Ablation
   of the whole bladder and the prostatic urothelium with surrounding
   hypertrophic tissue is guaranteed, and injury to the pelvic nerve plexus
   that provides autonomic innervation to the corpora cavernosa is avoided.
   From April 1990 to December 2002 we performed 68 procedures in 63
   patients (7 of whom were lost to followup) with superficial bladder
   cancer resistant to conservative therapies (18 patients with stage T1G2
   disease, 13 TaG2, 11 T1G3 and 14 TaG3) and in 5 patients with invasive
   bladder cancer (T2G3) which was monofocal and away from the bladder
   neck. All patients had normal sexual function. A complete clinical
   evaluation (with prostate specific antigen {[}PSA], digital rectal
   examination and transrectal ultrasound) to exclude concomitant prostate
   cancer was performed. Average patient age was 49 years and mean followup
   was 68 months.
   Results: Normal erectile function was preserved in 58 patients (95\%).
   Complete daytime continence was reached in 58 patients (95\%) and
   nighttime continence was reached in 19 patients (31\%). The early
   postoperative complication rate was 18\% and the delayed complication
   rate was 26.2\%. A total of 55 patients (90.2\%) are alive and 6
   patients (9.8\%) died, 5 of cancer progression. High grade prostatic
   intraepithelial neoplasia was noticed in prostatic specimens in 3
   patients and prostatic cancer was noted in 1 patient. These patients had
   a normal PSA before operation and a serum PSA less than 0.2 ng/ml at a
   mean followup of 19 months. No positive margins were identified on
   permanent histological analysis of the specimens, nor were local pelvic
   recurrences observed.
   Conclusions: Our innovative technique is safe, effective and easy to
   perform. The oncological and functional results obtained with a long
   followup justify seminal sparing cystectomy as an excellent surgical
   procedure which can be proposed to some oncological and nononcological
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a gesture-based interaction photo album (GIA)
   device which stores and manages digital images. It provides a natural
   interface-as if you are turning the pages of a photo album using
   gestural input on a touch screen. We feel that emotional satisfaction is
   more important than efficiency in this kind of task and requires a more
   natural user interface that is easily learned by novices. GIA
   demonstrates an innovative convergence between the digital and the
   analogue in this respect.}},

Abstract = {{Major modifications of the RFX load assembly and power supplies are in
   progress to allow extensive active control schemes, such as equilibrium
   and plasma position control and innovative control of the MHD modes. The
   digital control system is implemented in VME64 using a distributed
   architecture. The use of a `stable' operating system that is likely to
   survive some generations of processors can help coping with evolution of
   technology. PowerPC and Pentium processors were thus considered as
   candidates and tested and the first one has been selected due to the
   better performance in floating point computation. Wind River VxWorks has
   been chosen as real-time operating system. 100 Mbit switched Ethernet
   has been evaluated for real-time communication by using the user
   datagram protocol (UDP). Measurements have been executed on a prototype
   system to assess data transfer latency, jitter and reliability and the
   results confirm that the solution is suitable for the application. The
   paper describes in detail the reasons for the choice in the hardware
   components. Results from several tests comparing the performance of
   different solutions are also provided. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the performance improvement of a gas-sensing system by
   digital correction techniques is discussed. The considered system
   operates as a vectorial impedance meter and performs impedance
   measurements of eight sensors arranged in an array in the frequency
   range 10 Hz-15 MHz. The measurements of the chemical sensors' impedance
   is an innovative technique that allows highlighting different adsorption
   mechanisms taking place when the sensors are exposed to gases. Of
   course, impedance analyzers are commercially available, but they usually
   make measurements on only one device at time and they are very
   expensive. The proposed PC-based impedance analyzer is a versatile one
   and shows good performances for gas-sensing applications. A digital
   correction technique is used in this work to improve the impedance
   measurement accuracy of each channel of the gas-sensing system (eight
   sensors --> eight channels), in order to compensate for the conditioning
   electronics response. The latter is evaluated in a characterization
   procedure. A linear black box two-port model is used to take into
   account crosstalk, amplitude, and phase distortions. Two different
   techniques to evaluate the response of the measurement system are
   discussed in this paper, and experimental results are presented on both
   the measure of reference impedances and on the measure of chemical
   sensors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is framed into the Positron Emission Mammography (PEM)
   project, whose aim is to develop an innovative gamma ray sensor for
   early breast cancer diagnosis. Currently, breast cancer is detected
   using low-energy X-ray screening. However, functional imaging techniques
   such as PET/FDG could be employed to detect breast cancer and track
   disease changes with greater sensitivity. Furthermore, a small and less
   expensive PET camera can be utilized minimizing main problems of whole
   body PET. To accomplish these objectives, we are developing a new gamma
   ray sensor based on a newly released photodetector. However, a dedicated
   PEM detector requires an adequate data acquisition (DAQ) and processing
   system. The characterization of gamma events needs a free-running
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with sampling rates of more than 50
   Ms/s and must achieve event count rates up to 10 MHz. Moreover,
   comprehensive data processing must be carried out to obtain event
   parameters necessary for performing the image reconstruction. A new
   generation digital signal processor (DSP) has been used to comply with
   these requirements. This device enables us to manage the DAQ system at
   up to 80 Ms/s and to execute intensive calculi over the detector
   signals. This paper describes our designed DAQ and processing
   architecture whose main features are: very high-speed data conversion,
   multichannel synchronized acquisition with zero dead time, a digital
   triggering scheme, and high throughput of data with an extensive
   optimization of the signal processing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{As the librarian's traditional roles undergo significant changes
   reflecting the transition from the world of print to the digital world,
   we focus on Israeli LIS students' responses to these changes. Our study
   examined the attitudes and perceptions of 180 Israeli students regarding
   the relationship between librarianship and information science as
   professions, the roles of librarians and information scientists,
   potential places of employment for librarians and information
   scientists, comparative status and prestige of librarians and
   information scientists and finally, students own individual career
   preferences. Although most students believed that both professions are
   related, they attributed higher status and prestige to information
   science. Information science was also perceived as more highly
   associated with computer technologies. In general, students aspired to
   be information scientists. As future representatives of their
   professions in both private and public work settings, their attitudes
   and preferences will undoubtedly affect the nature of the profession.
   The present study is significant in a period of transition as schools of
   librarianship and information science modify their curricula and cope
   with the technological innovations impacting the traditional nature of
   librarianship.}},

Abstract = {{Web sites have become essential tools in the dissemination of content in
   digital format, especially in organisations where the generation,
   management and distribution of information and knowledge are among the
   major activities. This should also be true in agricultural research
   organisations, where information and knowledge are the major by products
   of agricultural research. This point is supported by the results of a
   content survey of 28 Web sites of international agricultural
   organisations, eight Web sites of regional-based agricultural research
   organisations in Africa and 21 Web sites of organisations involved in
   agricultural research in the Southern Africa Development Community
   (SADC). Overall, international agricultural organisations are way above
   agricultural research organisations in Africa and the SADC region in the
   use of Web sites in providing access to information and knowledge
   resources in digital formats. Agricultural organisations in Africa and
   the SADC region are generally behind in implementing innovative use of
   the Web. They need to be guided in the development and provision of
   digital information services using the Internet and Web technologies.}},

Abstract = {{A specific case of a four-order non-collinear light scattering in
   anisotropic media is presented. Compared to our previous studies, an
   innovation lies in the fact that now we consider passing just the
   quartet of incident light waves through a single crystal that is
   perturbed by a coherent stream of acoustic phonons. The exact and closed
   analytical model for describing this strongly nonlinear phenomenon is
   developed. In fact, a specially designed regime of a four-order light
   scattering, when transitions of four input light beams into four output
   light modes are allowed and electronically controlled, is examined. The
   feasibility of applying such an effect to perform an all-optical
   switching is analyzed. An opportunity for arranging the digital 4-bit
   register is revealed and algorithmically analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{A growing trend in broadband-networked digital consumer electronics has

   ramp-up, shorter cycle time, and high mix and low-volume ``minifab{''}
   operations involving SoC production. For minifabs, traditional

Abstract = {{A US law. the electronic signatures (E-Sign) in Global and National
   Commerce Act (signed by then President Clinton on 30 June 2000 with an
   effective date of I October 2000), grants electronic signatures legal
   validity equivalent to traditional hand-written counterparts. The
   intention of this law is to cut costs while providing more stringent
   security. In the emerging e-commerce arena. electronic signatures hold
   great potential for facilitating secure electronic transactions. But
   signatures are used in many critical business processes that occur prior
   to or independent of final transactions. Contract development and
   numerous other processes entail a series of draft modifications and
   sign-offs. Can electronic signatures provide cost savings and security
   in these activities? In this paper, we
   (i) detail fundamentals and the current status of electronic signatures:
   (ii) describe the integration of electronic signatures with electronic
   verification and authentication technologies;
   (iii) explore e-commerce applications, especially document management
   processes, that could benefit from adopting electronic signatures: and
   (iv) propose modifications to the electronic si.-nature process to
   enable innovative document management processes. We propose
   modifications using partial document ownership, soft signatures, and
   hard signatures. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has been used extensively to evaluate
   the magnitude and direction of penetration of the femoral head into the
   acetabular component of a total hip replacement as a result of
   polyethylene wear and creep. The accuracy and precision of an RSA study
   depends on several factors, including the radiographic technique, the
   analytical software, and the positioning of the tantalum markers. This
   study had three sequential purposes. First, an in vitro phantom model
   was used to quantify the accuracy and precision of digital images versus
   conventional radiography in RSA measurements of penetration of the
   femoral head into the acetabular shell in a total hip replacement. The
   Umea RSA software package was used for analysis of both the conventional
   films, which were digitized at a resolution of 300 DPI, and digital
   radiographs, which were converted from a DICOM format at a resolution of
   218 DPI. Digital radiography was found to be superior. Next, two methods
   of RSA analysis currently in use for determining femoral head
   penetration into polyethylene of total joint replacements were compared.
   Using the phantom model, we compared the Umea RSA system (Biomedical
   Innovations AB) to the RSA-CMS (RSA Clinical Measurement Solution) and
   in both cases used the digital radiographs. The Umea RSA system was
   found to be superior. Finally, two methods of marking the position of
   the acetabular component with tantalum beads were compared: one in which
   beads were inserted into previously described towers protruding from the
   back of the acetabular shell and another in which beads were placed into
   the peripheral flange of the polyethylene liner using the Umea RSA
   analysis system of the digital radiographs. The results using the two
   marker configurations were similar. (C) 2003 Orthopaedic Research

Abstract = {{All-optical digital sequential logic reduces the expense and bit rate
   constraints associated with optical-electronic-optical (OEO) conversion
   in telecommunications. Two semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are
   directly coupled by connecting the output of each to the input of the
   other. This new configuration provides positive feedback to create a
   logical NOT or inverse for complete logic. An inverted optical threshold
   improves the quality of bit modulation. At the same time, frequency
   shifting allows improvement in the quality of the optical carrier. The
   SOA pair is analyzed in closed form to show that the positive feedback
   provides an output-input slope steeper than -1, allowing connection of
   two pairs to form a flip-flop. Two SOA pairs are cross-connected by
   connecting the output of each pair to the input of the other, to
   construct a novel R-S flip-flop. Closed form analysis shows, for the
   first time, that there is an unstable state and two stable states
   forming bistability for this configuration. Simulation demonstrates
   setting and resetting the reset-set (R-S) flip-flop at more than 5 Gbps.
   Agreement between closed form analysis and numerical simulation provides
   verification of the validity of the results obtained. (C) 2004 Society

Abstract = {{The rapid transition towards a ``digital economy{''} was enabled by a
   converging set of innovations. Computing saw the development of the
   semiconductor transistor, integrated circuit, personal computers (PCs),
   operating systems, and graphical interfaces. The physical layer of
   telecommunication was enabled via the emergence of optical fiber and new
   wireless communication technologies, while networking saw the
   development of the lnternet (essentially packet switching) and the World
   Wide Web. These advances combined to realize a series of new
   applications of information and communications technologies (ICTs) such
   as business software, e-mail, and e-commerce. However, progress
   seriously stumbled with the collapse of the dot com bubble, which among
   other things revealed a huge amount of misdirected investment that could
   have been used more productively. The question of the day is thus how to
   realize new ``killer apps{''} to stimulate a new round of growth. The
   use of cell phones for communicating text, pictures, and video is a
   rapidly expanding area, but it seems unlikely that these applications
   will have a macroeconomic impact. Entertainment is a key industry whose
   fortunes are entwined with ICTs. Indeed, the application of ICT to
   innovating entertainment products is an important driver for the
   continued growth of the industry. Distribution of music and video via
   the Web could significantly stimulate demand but also raises the thorny
   question of how to protect intellectual property rights (IPR) of content
   providers. Another possible killer apps are interactive video-on-demand
   and telecalls/teleconferencing. The latter would, among other things,
   stimulate adoption of telework. The current Internet is capable of
   handing neither one-way transmissions of high-quality video nor
   interactive video-on-demand. There are bottlenecks both for the ``last
   mile{''} connection from Internet service provider (ISP) to the home but
   also the ``first miles{''} from originating server to ISP. The effective
   first miles bandwidth has not increased along with improvements in
   equipment, essentially because demand increases with capacity and thus
   traffic jams on the net continue. Digital subscriber line (DSL)
   technologies over telephone wires, and possibly wireless networks, will
   play important roles in getting over the last mile hurdle. Upgrading the
   first miles will probably require new networking protocols beyond TCP/IP
   that support multimedia and also changes in the economic model of
   information transfer via the Net. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{A substitution orbit model of competitive innovations}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Successful innovation and diffusion of technology can be attributed to
   the identification of the orbit of emerging new technologies that
   complement or substitute for existing technologies. This dynamism
   resembles the co-evolution process in an ecosystem. In an ecosystem, in
   order to maintain sustainable development, the complex interplay between
   competition and cooperation, typically observed in predator-prey
   systems, create a sophisticated balance. Given that an ecosystem can be
   used as a masterpiece system, this sophisticated balance can provide
   suggestive ideas for identifying an optimal orbit of competitive
   innovations with complement or substitution dynamism.
   Prompted by such a sophisticated balance in an ecosystem, this paper
   analyzes the optimal orbit of competitive innovations and, on the basis
   of an application of Lotka-Volterra equations, it reviews substitution
   orbits of Japan's monochrome to color TV system, fixed telephones to
   cellular telephones, cellular telephones to mobile Internet access
   service, and analog to digital TV broadcasting. On the basis of
   substitution orbits analyses, it attempts to extract suggestions
   supportive to identifying an optimal policy option in a complex orbit
   leading to expected orbit.
   Key findings include policy options that are effective in controlling
   parameters for Lotka-Volterra equations leading to expected orbit. (C)

Abstract = {{The Internet and related technologies have seen tremendous growth in
   distributed applications such as medicine, education, e-commerce, and
   digital libraries. As demand increases for online content and
   integrated, automated services, various applications employ Web services
   technology for document exchange among data repositories. Web services
   provide a mechanism to expose data and functionality using standard
   protocols, and hence to integrate many features that enhance Web
   applications.
   XML, a well-established text format, is playing an increasingly
   important role in supporting Web services. XML separates data from style
   and format definition and allows uniform representation, interchange,
   sharing, and dissemination of information content over the
   Internet.(1,2) It is thus a natural contender as a standard for marking
   up the data that distributed Web-based applications exchange.
   This interoperability paradigm lets businesses dynamically publish,
   discover, and aggregate a range of Web services through the Internet to
   more easily create innovative business processes and value chains.(3)
   This advantage, however, is accompanied by security concerns related to
   disseminating secure documents. Security has become a primary concern
   for all enterprises exposing sensitive data and business ss processes as
   Web services.
   XML and Web services provide a simplified application integration
   framework that drives demand for models that support secure information
   interchange. Examples of secure Web services that require stricter
   access controls include searching digital library contents based on user
   privileges, retrieving results from a medical center's patient database
   based on user status, and exchanging sensitive financial data between
   institutions based on user membership levels.
   Providing document security in XML-based Web services requires access
   control models that offer specific capabilities. Our XML-based access
   control specification language addresses a new set of challenges that
   traditional security models do not address.}},

   they require online annotation of the received digital channels. In
   order to achieve it, apart from high levels of success in video temporal
   segmentation-a great resource-consuming task previous to most video
   annotation techniques-a faster than real-time performance is crucial.
   This paper describes a software module for video temporal segmentation
   which is able to detect both abrupt transitions and all types of gradual
   transitions in real time, with levels of recall and precision not
   reported up to date for such a large and varied set of video sequences.}},

Abstract = {{Topographic variations affect the reflectance properties of the Earth's
   surface and are often removed in remote sensing studies, especially when
   significant terrain variations exist. In this study, however, we show
   that shading effects assessed by Landsat can be treated as a signal that
   stores important topographic information, especially when the spectral
   characteristics of a surface are homogenous. The coastal transverse
   dunes of the Ashdod area, and the desert linear dunes of Nizzana. (both
   located in Israel), were selected to investigate the abovementioned
   idea. The dune heights in these areas are 10 m on average (relative to
   their surroundings) and have maximum slopes of 33degrees. An innovative
   method for extracting slope, aspect, and height data for sand dunes
   using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
   (ETM+) images was developed, based on the regularity and periodicity of
   dunes' landscapes. Using two Landsat images representing different sun
   zenith and azimuth angles, reflectance values of each image were
   converted to cos(i) values (i=incident angle between the surface normal
   and the solar beam radiation), applying histogram matching methods. The
   slope and aspect of each pixel were determined as those that give the
   best prediction of the observed value of cos(i). Height profiles were
   then extracted, using simple trigonometric relationships. The accuracies
   of heights and slopes along selected profile lines were to the order of
   1 m and 3degrees, respectively (at a spatial resolution of 15 in). Best
   results were obtained when the images included one from the summer and
   the other from the winter, corresponding to maximum difference in solar
   zenith and azimuth angles. Errors in heights were attributed to surface
   heterogeneity (e.g., presence of biogenic soil crusts in the rainy
   season), geometric correction errors, cast shadows, and Bidirectional
   Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effects. Comparison to Advanced
   Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) 3D information showed
   that the proposed method is better in representing the topographic
   variation of the area than the digital elevation model (DEM) produced by
   ASTER. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an innovative way to establish a functional bridge
   around a spinal lesion. We disconnected the T13 nerve from its muscle
   targets, leaving the proximal end intact. The cut end was inserted
   either into an intact spinal cord, to assess regeneration of T13 axons
   into the cord and synapse formation with spinal neurons, or caudal to a
   hemisection at L2/3, to assess restoration of function below the injury.
   Four to 28 weeks later, anterograde tracers indicated that axons from
   the inserted T13 nerve regenerated into the ventral horn, the
   intermediate zone, and dorsal horn base, both in intact and hemisected
   animals. Antibodies to cholinergic markers showed that many regenerating
   axons were from T13 motoneurons. Electrical stimulation of the T13 nerve
   proximal to the insertion site 4 weeks or more after insertion into the
   intact cord evoked local field potentials in the intermediate zone and
   ventral horn, which is where T13 axons terminated. Stimulation of T13 in
   71\% of the animals (8 hemisected, 7 intact) evoked contraction of the
   back or leg muscles, depending on the level of insertion. Animals in
   which T13 was inserted caudal to hemisection had significantly less
   spasticity and muscle wasting and greater mobility at the hip, knee,
   ankle, and digits in the ipsilateral hindlimb than did animals with a
   hemisection only. Thus, T13 motor axons form novel synapses with
   lumbosacral motor circuits. Because the T13 motor neurons retain their
   connections to the brain, these novel circuits might restore voluntary
   control to muscles paralyzed below a spinal lesion.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying expertise within an organization is a critical component of
   any knowledge management effort. It is, however, an exceptionally
   resource intensive activity that. is difficult to initiate and
   problematic to maintain. The development of experimental expertise
   recommender systems has prompted innovative research into the use of
   expertise markers found on routine information artifacts. Particular
   classes of information artifacts have been identified as rich possible
   sources for expertise markers. This paper hypothesizes about the
   potential for leveraging another class of artifacts, ``micronotes{''},
   which are our ubiquitous, personal jottings of notable information.
   Lacking usable digital support, these are currently opaque to
   organizational memory systems, but may be central to our natural
   expertise mapping abilities. A field study designed to explore natural
   micronote taking behaviors is described and early findings are
   discussed. Implications for improving the design of mobile computing
   support to integrate micronotes into expertise mapping activities are
   also presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It's tough to get consumers to adopt innovations-and it's getting
   tougher all the time. That's because more and more markets are taking on
   the characteristics of networks. The interconnections among today's
   companies are so plentiful that often a new product's adoption by one
   player depends on its systematic adoption by other players. Consider the
   disparate companies involved with the popularization of digital
   photography: software vendors, camera manufacturers, broadband
   communications companies, printer manufacturers, and so on. By contrast,
   Kodak was pretty much the sole player involved with popularizing film
   photography.
   The traditional levers executives use to launch products-such as
   targeting unique customer segments or developing compelling value
   propositions-don't work as well in this new environment. Instead,
   innovators must orchestrate a change of behaviors across the market,
   unraveling the status quo so that a large number of players adopt their
   offerings and believe they are better off for having done so.
   In this article, Monitor Group's Bhaskar Chakravorti outlines a
   four-part framework for doing just that. The innovator must reason back
   from a target endgame, implementing only those strategies that maximize
   its chances of getting to its goal. It must complement power players,
   positioning its innovation as an enhancement to their products or
   services. The innovator must offer coordinated switching incentives to
   three core groups: the players that add to the innovation's benefits,
   the players that act as channels to adopters, and the adopters
   themselves. And it must preserve flexibility in case its initial
   strategy fails.
   Chakravorti uses Adobe's introduction of its Acrobat software as an
   example of an innovator that took into account other players in the
   network-and succeeded because of it.}},

   technology, from the perspective of its enabling technologies (e.g.
   fabrication, RF micromachined components and actuation mechanisms) is
   presented. A unique roadmap is given that shows how enabling
   technologies, RF MEMS components, RF MEMS circuits and RF microsystems
   packaging are linked together; leading towards enhanced integrated
   subsystems. An overview of the associated fabrication technologies is
   given, in order to distinguish between the two distinct classes of RF
   microsystems' component technologies; non-MEMS micromachined and true
   MEMS. An extensive literature survey has been undertaken and key papers
   have been cited; from these, the motivations behind different RF MEMS
   technologies are highlighted. The importance of understanding the
   limitations for realising new and innovative ideas in RF MEMS is
   discussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn as to where future RF MEMS
   technology may lead. It is likely that the switch will continue to be
   the most important RF MEMS component, with future work investigating its
   enhanced functionality, subsystem integration and volume production. The
   focus of RF MEMS circuits will shift from the digital phase shifter to
   high-Q tuneable filters.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate segmentation of the teeth from the digitized representation
   of a dental study model is an important component in computer-based
   algorithms for orthodontic feature detection and measurement and in the
   simulation of orthodontic procedures such as tooth rearrangement. This
   paper presents an automated method for tooth segmentation from the
   three-dimensional (3-D) digitized image captured by a laser scanner. We
   avoid the complexity of directly processing 3-D mesh data by proposing
   the innovative idea of detecting features on two range images computed
   from the 3-D image. The dental arch is first obtained from the plan-view
   range image. Using the arch as the reference, a panoramic range image of
   the dental model can be computed. The interstices between the teeth are
   detected separately in the two range images, and results from both views
   are combined for a determination of interstice locations and
   orientations. Finally, the teeth are separated from the gums by
   delineating the gum margin. The algorithm was tested on 34 dental models
   representing a variety of malocclusions and was found to be robust and
   accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Deviations of radiation treatment portals and dose from
   prospective treatment plans are unfavorable prognostic factors for
   lymphoma patients. Therefore, an extensive radiotherapy quality
   assurance program is used in the ongoing German lymphoma studies. The
   introduction of teleradiotherapy offered the opportunity to optimize and
   simplify the workflow of these quality assurance programs. The purpose
   of this report was to evaluate the feasibility of teleradiotherapy and
   to describe our experiences with these innovative tools.
   Methods and Materials: During this pilot phase, five radiotherapy
   centers were equipped with the hardware and software that guarantees a
   rapid and high-quality transfer of imaging data, as well as real-time
   teleconferences. The workstation consists of standard PCs with Windows
   NT as the operating system and the commercial telemedicine software
   Hipax.
   Results: As a first step, imaging communication between the radiotherapy
   reference centers in Cologne and Homburg/Saar was established.
   Subsequently, three additional radiotherapy departments (Universities of
   Berlin, Munster, and Munich) with large numbers of lymphoma patients
   were connected. Other study centers delivered digital imaging on mobile
   data carriers or via an Integrated Services Digital Network
   point-to-point connection. Communication units were completed for
   interactive teleconferences. A facility for central online documentation
   was installed. Telemedical functions were integrated into the ongoing
   radiotherapy quality assurance program. Since the introduction of a
   teleradiotherapeutic workstation in the radiotherapy reference center in
   Cologne in January 2001, the images of 10\% (n = 228 patients) of all
   reviewed cases of the ongoing Hodgkin's disease 10-12 trials were
   delivered digitally. The amount of digitally available imaging is
   continuously increasing.
   Conclusion: The introduction of teleradiotherapy improved the dialog
   between the radiotherapy reference centers and study centers and thus
   contributed toward high radiotherapy quality for lymphoma patients in
   Germany. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at focusing on the aspects concerning the physical layer
   design for an innovative satellite communication experiment. Such an
   experiment, denoted by the acronym DAVID-DCE (Data and Video Interactive
   Distribution-Data Collection Experiment) is based on the exploitation of
   the W-band (75-110 GHz) for high-bit-rate satellite transmission. The
   potential advantages of using of the W-band are mainly related to the
   great bandwidth availability, and to the absence of interference.
   Moreover, an expected result of the experiment is a substantive
   improvement in the communication system's performances in the presence
   of meteorological phenomena (e.g. rain) as compared with the more
   conventional Ka-band satellite transmission. On the other hand, problems
   to be faced concern the non-ideal behaviours of hardware devices
   employed for high-frequency digital transmission. In particular, carrier
   recovery and timing recovery are the most crucial signal-processing
   tasks to be carefully considered in the design of the physical level of
   the system, because they considerably suffer from hardware impairments.
   The purpose of this work is to illustrate the proposed solutions in
   terms of the most critical modulation, demodulation and synchronization
   design issues, together with the effects of non-ideal behaviours of
   hardware components on BER performances. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley

   impetus to debates over the social and economic implications of the

   information and technologies in ways that significantly change the
   communicative power of individuals, communities, organisations, nations

   technology, but unfold over time through the complex interplay among
   many actors, in many arenas. A framework is presented to assist in

Abstract = {{Deregulation in the electricity market has resulted in a number of
   challenges in the nuclear power industry. Nuclear power plants must find
   innovative ways to remain competitive by reducing operating costs
   without jeopardizing safety. Instrumentation and Control (I\&C) systems
   not only play important roles in plant operation, but also in reducing
   the cost of power generation while maintaining and/or enhancing safety.
   Therefore, it is extremely important that I\&C systems are managed
   efficiently and economically. With the increasing use of digital
   technologies. new methods are needed to solve Problems associated with
   various aspects of digital I\&C systems. Probabilistic Safety Assessment
   (PSA) has proved to be an effective method for safety analysis and
   risk-based decisions, even though challenges are still present. This
   paper provides an overview of PSA applications in three areas of digital
   I\&C systems in nuclear power plants. These areas are Graded Quality
   Assurance, Surveillance Testing, and Instrumentation and Control System
   Design. In addition, PSA application in the regulation Of nuclear power
   plants that adopt digital I\&C systems is also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Reference Method 9
   (Method 9) is the preferred enforcement approach-for verifying facility
   compliance with federal visible opacity standards. Supporters of Method
   9 have cited its flexibility and low cost as important technological and
   economic advantages of the methodology. The Digital Opacity Compliance
   System (DOCS), an innovative technology that employs digital imaging
   technology for quantifying visible opacity, has been proposed as a
   technically defensible and economically competitive alternative to
   Method 9. Results from the field application of the DOCS at EPA-approved
   Method 9 smoke schools located in Ogden, UT, Augusta, GA, and Columbus,
   OH, demonstrated that, under clear sky conditions, the DOCS consistently
   met the opacity error rate established under Method 9.
   Application of hypothesis testing on the smoke school data set confirmed
   that the DOCS was equivalent to Method 9 under clear sky conditions.
   Under overcast sky conditions, human observers seemed to be more
   accurate than the DOCS in measuring opacity. However, within the smoke
   school environment, human observers routinely employ backgrounds other
   than sky (e.g., trees, telephone poles, billboards) to quantify opacity
   on overcast days. Under conditions that compel the use of sky as plume
   background (e.g., emission stacks having heights above the tree line),
   the DOCS appears to be a more accurate methodology for quantifying
   opacity than are human observers.}},

   attacks, which are commonly employed in the literature. In addition, the

   GA for optimizing both the fundamentally conflicting requirements.
   Watermarking with GA is easy for implementation. We also examine the
   effectiveness of our scheme by checking the fitness function in GA,
   which includes both factors related to robustness and invisibility.
   Simulation results also show both the robustness under attacks, and the

Abstract = {{The US Department of Defense (DOD) normally pursues a closed approach to
   technological development. It captures results from its own sponsored
   research and development (R\&D), and the results are kept shielded by
   restrictions on related publications and exports. This R\&D strategy is
   no longer viable. Now most military technology has commercial origins,
   the US no longer dominates all relevant technological fields, and
   sophisticated dual-use technology is accessible to adversaries in open
   global markets. DOD can address this dilemma by drawing on external R\&D
   that tests a technology's general capabilities against a variety of
   potential uses and by placing more of its internal emphasis on
   technology integration. Historically, this approach to military R\&D
   also yields more commercial spin-offs. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The UrbanSim project provides a case study in Digital Government, and
   this article examines progress to date in developing and applying the
   system in a range of metropolitan areas. Digital Government is meant
   here in the context of an innovative, cross-cutting initiative of the
   National Science Foundation. The project integrates academic research on
   urban simulation modeling and policy evaluation with research on
   human-computer interaction and software engineering, and uses a
   value-sensitive design to ensure that the system addresses the needs of
   governments and citizens. This article addresses the importance of the
   problem domain and the project objectives, presents a range of
   challenges, and outlines the design and application of UrbanSim in
   response to these. It discusses issues arising in the application of the
   model in the Salt Lake City metropolitan region, where a lawsuit over a
   highway project has precipitated use of UrbanSim to assess the
   interactions of transportation, land use, and environmental outcomes,
   and concludes with an assessment and directions for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology holds the potential for improving the process by
   which government makes regulatory decisions affecting vital aspects of
   society and the economy. This article charts new directions for research
   on the application of information technology to regulatory policy
   making. Drawing on the deliberations from two recent workshops organized
   by Harvard University's Regulatory Policy Program, the article
   highlights avenues for expanding the objectives of digital government
   research, as well as contributing knowledge to decision makers who seek
   to improve the responsiveness, efficiency, and manageability of
   regulatory policy making. Effective innovations in applying information
   technology to regulatory policy will need to take into account both the
   capabilities of new information technologies and the institutional
   design of the federal regulatory process. By integrating perspectives
   from both the information and social sciences, digital government
   research can help shape the future of information technology and the
   making of regulatory policy.}},

Abstract = {{Maumusson Inlet, located on the French Atlantic coast, connects the
   Atlantic Ocean with the Marennes-Oleron tidal bay. The tidal range (2-6
   m) and wave climate (mean height 1.5 m) place this tidal inlet in the
   mixed energy, tide dominant, category of Hayes {[}(1979) Barrier island
   morphology. In: Leatherman, S.P. (Ed.), Barrier Island, Academic Press,
   New York, pp. 1-28]. An innovative method, combining high quality
   bathymetric data (nine accurate Digital Elevation Models since 1824)
   with a very high seismic resolution, demonstrates a major tidal inlet
   evolution from 1824 onwards and its dramatic acceleration since 1970.
   The chronology of those morphological changes suggests strong coupling
   between the location of the tidal channel and the behaviour of the
   adjacent shorelines. The recent shoaling and migration of the inlet
   channel can be attributed to a decrease in tidal prism due to the
   filling in sediment of Marennes-Oleron Bay. Seismic data give evidence
   that the inlet was located on a major incision of the bedrock. It can be
   inferred that the bedrock exerts control of channel location, this
   control varying in time as a function of channel depth. A conceptual
   model is proposed, including the inlet, its adjacent shorelines, the
   tidal bay and the time-varying bedrock control of main channel location.
   Such a model could be considered valid in similar cases along other
   coastlines, i.e. coastlines with a fine unconsolidated sediment sheet.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a carrier peak synchronous direct digital
   demodulation scheme for linear modulated signals and its innovative FPGA
   implementation. The demodulation scheme generates a carrier equivalent
   signal that is in quadrature with the modulated signal and strobes the
   modulated signal at the carrier peaks. A digitizer in the form of an
   analog to digital converter now converts the sampled data to a digital
   count, thereby producing a direct digital read-out of the modulated
   signal. This obviously eliminates the necessity of the standard sequence
   of multiplication, low pass filtering and subsequent processing common
   in existing analog and digital synchronous quadrature demodulators.
   Removal of the low pass filtering stage eliminates the inherent filter
   time lag that proves beneficial in those measurement applications where
   exact phase sensitive detection of the measurand at specific time
   instant is important. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is
   established through its FPGA implementation for reconstructing the
   modulating signal by sampling the modulated signal at every carrier peak
   and holding the sampled value till the next sampling instant. The
   implementation is found to automatically capture and remain tuned to any
   carrier frequency in the range 763 Hz to 100 kHz. (C) 2003 Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, we define the two-dimensional topological map, a model
   which represents both topological and geometrical information of a
   two-dimensional labeled image. Since this model is minimal, complete,
   and unique, we can use it to define efficient image processing
   algorithms. The topological map is the last level of a map hierarchy.
   Each level represents the region boundaries of the image and is defined
   from the previous one in the hierarchy, thus giving a simple
   constructive definition. This model is similar to two existing
   structures but the main innovation of our approach is the progressive
   definition based on the successive map levels. These different maps can
   easily be extended in order to define the topological map in any
   dimension. Furthermore we provide an optimal extraction algorithm which
   extracts the different maps of the hierarchy in a single image scan.
   This algorithm is based on local configurations called precodes. Due to
   our constructive definition, different configurations are factorized
   which simplifies the implementation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Innovative methodology based on a combination of real-time kinematic
   Global Positioning System (RTKGPS), light detection and ranging (lidar),
   and open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed to
   gain a better understanding of rapid changes in coastal topography.
   Improved spatial interpolation techniques were implemented to produce
   detailed topographic surfaces from lidar and RTK-GPS data. The
   methodology is demonstrated for two North Carolina areas: Jockey's Ridge
   State Park and Bald Head Island. The Jockey's Ridge study quantifies
   recent dune movement and identifies areas of elevation loss and rapid
   horizontal migration that threaten existing infrastructure. The Bald
   Head Island study examines pre- and post-nourishment beach evolution.
   The dynamics of beach topography, its geometric properties, and
   estimates of both eroded and deposited sand volumes were determined by
   combining lidar elevation data (1997-2000) with quarterly RTK-GPS
   measurements. Spatio-temporal analysis confirms the relative stability
   of the central `pivot point' beach section and reveals that the beach
   changed its shape from convex west of the pivot point to concave east of
   the pivot point during the period of 1997 to 1998 and reversed shapes
   during year 2000. The pivot point also divides the beach into two
   sections that exhibit markedly different responses to nourishment.
   Although the entire length of nourished beach retreated, the analysis
   reveals that in the western section, all nourished sand off-shore was
   lost, whereas in the eastern section, significant sand volume was pushed
   up onto the beach, creating potential for recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The use of wireless, DSL, and cable for broadband access has become
   increasingly prevalent in metropolitan areas. While these technologies
   are being successfully utilized in terms of both service quality
   and-economics in densely populated areas, there are still vast
   geographic regions where broadband services are either prohibitively
   expensive or simply unavailable at any price. This article examines
   several alternatives for using 2.4 GHz 802.11b (WiFi) technology to
   provide fixed broadband access in rural areas consisting of towns,
   smaller remote communities, clusters of subscribers separated by large
   intercluster distances, as well as widely scattered users. Our approach
   is to model a network based on realistic demographics, equipment and
   operations costs, service revenues, and customer demand and usage, and
   calculate the lifecycle economics in terms of capital investment and
   profitability. We consider the cost benefits of several emerging
   technologies and architectures, including high gain antennas,
   dynamically steerable beamforming antennas, and multihop routing. Our
   results show that cost-effective affordable high-speed wireless Internet
   access can be provided in rural and remote areas using nontraditional
   and innovative approaches,. bridging the so-called digital divide.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the architectural study of an innovative ultra-fast
   packet-switched transparent processor dealing efficiently with unicast
   and multicast applications. The proposed architecture aims at
   outperforming current packet processor architectures in terms of total
   throughput and efficiency. In order to cope with the limitations of
   today's on board processors, three new concepts are introduced:
   transparent burst switching, channel multiplexing, and bandwidth
   asymmetry. Some of these concepts are already well known in the field of
   optical terrestrial networks but need further improvements and
   adaptations to cope with the requirements of satellite processors and
   systems. Transparent burst switching is used to enhance the transparency
   of the processor: the packet payload is processed transparently and only
   the header is demodulated onboard. The channel multiplexing and
   bandwidth asymmetry techniques are used to consolidate bufferless switch
   architectures, which appear to be very attractive for increasing the
   overall throughput of switches. Finally, the paper introduces an
   innovative efficient and scalable hybrid optical/digital implementation
   of this processor. The focus here is on a satellite-switched
   code/time-division multiple-access type of system but the results and
   concepts provided in this paper can apply to other satellite-switched
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, digital imaging in pathology has been used by only a
   minority of practicing pathologists, primarily technology enthusiasts.
   Now, many pathology departments are considering the installation of
   networked digital imaging as part of their pathology information
   systems.
   As digital technology becomes ubiquitous, established vendors and
   innovative new companies are offering digital imaging add-on modules
   that have the potential to enhance anatomic pathology services.
   Systems that allow whole slide digital acquisition are being developed
   that have the potential to significantly impact the practice of surgical
   pathology in the future. Currently, whole slide imaging systems have
   applications such as providing case material to large numbers of
   pathologists for teaching seminars or training exercises.
   In the near future, virtual slides on central servers will allow
   pathology practices to cost effectively access immunohistochemistry
   slides and other special studies produced in technology centers for
   in-house interpretation. Pathologists should embrace the digital
   technologies that are available to enhance our specialty today and be
   aware of the possibilities and the pitfalls of a ``slideless{''} future.}},

Abstract = {{Practical implementation of convolutional turbo codec is impeded by the
   difficulty of real-time execution in high transmission rate
   communication systems due to high computational complexity, iterative
   block decoding structure, as well as the requirement of accurate on-line
   channel reliability estimation for maximum-likelihood decoding. Relying
   on innovative channel estimation techniques involving DS-CDMA specific
   noise/interference variance estimation and fading channel variation
   tracking, this paper provides a low-complexity all-digital design of an
   iterative SISO log-MAP turbo decoder for DS-CDMA based mobile
   communication systems. The issues of quantization and data flow in both
   pre-decoder processing module and iterative trellis decoding module are
   prudently addressed to ensure highly efficient hardware implementation.
   The efficient design strategies applied confine the decoding complexity
   while leading to an excellent performance within 0.2 dB of the software
   decoder.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an FIR adaptive filter implementation using a
   multiplier-free architecture is presented. The implementation is based
   on distributed arithmetic (DA) which substitutes multiply-and-accumulate
   operations with a series of look-up-table (LUT) accesses. This can be
   achieved at the cost of a moderate increase in memory usage. The
   proposed design performs an LMS-type adaptation on a sample-by-sample
   basis. This is accomplished by an innovative LUT update using a matched
   auxiliary LUT I he system is implemented on an FPGA that enables rapid
   prototyping of digital circuits. Implementation results are provided to
   demonstrate that a high-speed LMS adaptive filter can be realized
   employing the proposed architecture.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative, low-radiation 3-D Complete-Body-Screening (3D-CBS)
   medical imaging device is presented, combining benefits of the
   functional imaging capability of PET with those of the anatomical
   imaging capability of CT. Although PET technology has existed for 50
   years, its benefits have never been fully realized. In addition to the
   radiation problem, the problem of how to increase the narrow viewing
   field in a cost-effective manner so that full-body examination can be
   done quickly has always been a stumbling block - until now. The
   technological innovations, set forth in this article, are in the
   electronics that enables a different detector assembly, and together
   they enable execution of more complex algorithms measuring more
   accurately the information obtained from the collision of the photon
   with the detector. This improvement permits a cost-effective extension
   of the FOV to over one meter in length and captures more accurately
   about 1 in 10 pairs of photons emitted instead of the 1 in 10,000 pairs
   of photons captured by current PET. The innovations lie partly in the
   way existing components (available off the shelf) are assembled and
   partly in the innovative electronics (digital signal processing on each
   electronic channel). A hardware prototype implementing the innovative
   functions of the 3D-Flow(TM) architecture shows the feasibility of the
   entire system. This hardware construction is the basic element of the
   project. Several sections of the 3D-CBS have been simulated and built
   The benefit of this research lies not only in improving the PET/CT
   efficiency by a factor of several hundred, but this technology creates
   competition and lowers examination cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative architecture for a high-level
   interaction between a human and a robot via a Personal Digital Assistant
   (PDA). PDA is a design to provide small and lightweight mobile
   interaction devices. This interface architecture differs from previous
   PDA human-robot interfaces in that it uses high-level task
   decomposition, and adaptive user interface (UI) than teleoperation
   interfaces. Adaptive user interface typically refers to a flexible
   interaction strategy between a human and a computer to contribute what
   is best-suited at the most appropriate time. We extended this concept to
   human-robot interaction (HRI) {[}1] and employed the architecture into
   mobile devices (i.e. PDA and PocketPC). Such devices could provide
   mobility and durability for robot operations. This work implemented an
   agent-based high-level human-robot interface on PDA to provide
   interactions with robots. Four PDA user interfaces were developed: a
   Map-Bascd robot control screen, a Laser Range Finder screen, a Sonar
   Sensor screen, and Camera View with object selection screen. The
   proposed framework has been implemented to develop a prototypical
   PDA-based human-robot interaction system. The initial results are
   encouraging and demonstrate the capabilities of such a human-robot
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an FIR adaptive filter implementation using a
   multiplier-free architecture is presented. The implementation is based
   on distributed arithmetic (DA) which substitutes multiply-and-accumulate
   operations with a series of look-up-table (LUT) accesses. This can be
   achieved at the cost of a moderate increase in memory usage. The
   proposed design performs an LMS-type adaptation on a sample-by-sample
   basis. This is accomplished by an innovative LUT update using a matched
   auxiliary LUT. The system is implemented on an FPGA that enables rapid
   prototyping of digital circuits. Implementation results are provided to
   demonstrate that a high-speed, low logic complexity LMS adaptive filter
   can be realized employing the proposed architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) is a new technique for multi-user
   power allocation and/or detection in digital subscriber line (DSL)
   networks. In DSM transmit spectra are adapted based on the direct and
   crosstalk channels seen by the modems within a network. This allows
   binder bit rate performance maximisation.
   At the Alcatel Research and Innovation labs we have recently developed a
   DSM testbed which allows the performance of DSM algorithms to be
   evaluated in practice. This paper describes the development of this DSM
   testbed. With this testbed we have evaluated the performance of a DSM
   algorithm known as iterative water-filling. It has been demonstrated
   that iterative water-filling can yield data-rate gains of up to 500\% in
   the real world.
   Practical issues on the implementation of iterative water-filling are
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The recent rapid increase in digital signal processing (DSP)
   applications has generated a need for electrical engineers with DSP
   backgrounds; however, a university-industry gap still exists. At
   Southern Taiwan University of Technology (STUT), a sequence of
   innovative DSP courses, which emphasize hands-on experiments and
   practical applications, was developed for continuing education in
   electrical and computer engineering. These courses are taught in the
   evening for night-school students, and are separated from traditional
   classes for regular full-time students. This program requires the
   participators to have at least three years of working experience before
   enrolling in the program. It enables the night-school students to
   experiment with sophisticated DSP applications to augment the
   theoretical, conceptual and analytical material provided in DSP courses.
   The inclusion of both software and hardware developments permits
   students to undertake a wide range of real-time DSP projects in the
   field. Analysis of assessment data suggests that the introduction of
   Digital Signal Processors Fundamentals course can increase learning
   interests and overcome the prerequisite problem of DSP Laboratory
   Experiments course.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of low-complexity channel estimation and timing
   in digital ultra-wideband receivers. We extend some of our recent
   results on sampling of certain classes of parametric non-bandlimited
   signals and develop a frequency domain framework that yields
   high-resolution estimates of all relevant channel parameters by sampling
   a received signal below the traditional Nyquist rate. In particular, we
   show that the minimum required sampling rate in an UWB receiver is
   determined by the so-called innovation rate, which corresponds to the
   number of degrees of freedom of the received UWB signal. Our framework
   allows for faster acquisition compared to current digital solutions and
   potentially reduces power consumption and complexity of digital UWB
   receivers significantly. It is particularly suitable in applications
   such as ranging or positioning and can also be used for identification
   of more realistic UWB channel models, where different propagation Oaths
   undergo different frequency-selective mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{The idea reported in this paper implements an approach to transmit

   This new kind of media is defined as hypervideo. The great innovation
   the concept of hypervideo brings is the possibility to associate
   different complementary, information about the objects shown in scene.
   The association between complementary information and video is, made by
   embedding hyperlinks (references) into the image being transmitted,
   allowing the user to access such information by clicking in an area of
   the image being watched. This is an innovative approach for interactive
   television in the sense that it admits the association of video and
   context sensitive information. In other words it is possible to
   associate different complementary, information with different contexts
   presented in a video. A concept proof prototype, developed to illustrate
   the ideas proposed, is presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Digital cameras, new generation phones and in general modem image
   acquisition devices, requires algorithms for image enhancement suitable
   to work in real time and possibly with a limited power consumption.
   Unfortunately most of the systems present in the literature either
   require a very high computational effort or do not provide good
   performances.
   In this paper a new method for the improvement of the visual quality of
   a digital image will be introduced. The exposed method, substantially
   based on the ``retinex{''} approach, adopts an innovative system for the
   extraction of the illumination component, which is essentially the
   bottleneck for real-time applications based on the retinex method. In
   the retinex theory, the illumination of an image is approximated by a
   narrow-band low-pass filtering of the original image which should
   maintain the abrupt transitions unchanged. In order to obtain this
   behavior a new typology of filters is introduced, i.e. the recursive
   rational filter (RRF). The adoption of such filters concurs to obtain
   the proper behavior using a very simple structure, suitable for an
   implementation in real-time devices.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims at exploring and validating the adoption of standard
   fabrication processes for the realization of CMOS active pixel sensor,
   for particle detection purposes. The goal is to implement a single-chip,
   complete radiation sensor system, including on a CMOS IC the sensitive
   devices, read-out and signal processing circuits. The possibility of
   including versatile and performing circuitry allows for the evaluation
   of innovative active pixel architectures, different read-out strategies,
   and complex data management algorithms. A prototype chip (RAPS01) based
   on these principles has been already fabricated, and a complete chip
   characterization has been carried out; in particular, the evaluation of
   the sensitivity of the sensor response on the actual operating
   conditions was estimated, as well as uniformity response analysis.
   Optimization and tailoring of the sensor structures for specific
   applications are being evaluated in the design of the next generation
   chip (RAPS02). In particular, sparse read-out approach and power
   consumption are considered, introducing some circuit improvement, and
   discussing the organization and design of a new architecture. Basic
   features of the new chip includes: digitally configurable readout,
   power-switching techniques, fault-tolerant circuitry, multi-mode access
   (i.e., either sparse of line-scan readout). Thanks to the intrinsic
   flexibility of CMOS design, perspective application different from HEP
   experiments, can be evaluated as well.}},

Abstract = {{The Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) of the BABAR experiment at PEP-II is
   described. This is the crucial device for the measurement of the B meson
   decay vertices to extract CP-asymmetries. it consists of five layers of
   double-sided AC-coupled Silicon strip detectors, read out by a
   full-custom integrated circuit, capable of simultaneous acquisition,
   digitization and transmission of data. It represents the core of the
   BABAR tracking system, providing position measurements with a precision
   of 10 pin (inner layers) and 30 mu m (outer layers). The relevant
   performances of the SVT are presented, and the experience acquired
   during the construction, installation and the first five years of
   data-taking is described. Innovative solutions are highlighted, like the
   sophisticated alignment procedure, imposed by the design of the silicon
   tracker, integrated in the beam-line elements and mechanically separated
   from the other parts of BABAR. The harshness of the background
   conditions in the interaction region required several studies on the
   radiation damage of the sensors and the front-end chips, whose results
   are presented. Over the next five years the luminosity is predicted to
   increase by a factor three, leading to radiation and occupancy levels
   significantly exceeding the detector design. Extrapolation of future
   radiation doses and occupancies is shown together with the expected
   detector performance and lifetime. Upgrade scenarios to deal with the
   increased luminosity and backgrounds are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Scintillating and wavelength shifting (WLS) scintillating fibers have
   increasingly demonstrated advantages over traditional radiation
   detection/tracking, in high-energy, physics (HEP) experiments.
   High-gain, Geiger avalanche optical detectors, operated at bias voltage
   compatible with digital CMOS , may provide scintillating fiber readouts
   with single-photon sensitivity and digital-like output that may
   eliminate low-noise, analog amplification electronics. Using innovative
   designs based on high-volume manufacturing CAOS, we have recently
   demonstrated the feasibility of Geiger photodiode (GPD) modules with
   output drivers as high-detection efficiency readouts of scintillating
   fibers. These modules, with moderate dark count rate at room
   temperature, have demonstrated sub-nanosecond timing resolution and
   capability of detecting photon events from less than 1 Hz to 100 KHz
   when operated in gated mode. Using these GPD modules, low-rate cosmic
   muon detection with WLS fibers was demonstrated on a MINOS-style setup.
   Reliability evaluation showed no degradation over almost two years of
   operation at room temperature. Accelerated aging reliability testing
   predicts lifetimes up to seven years of operation at room temperature.}},

   resolution is lower and they are much more expensive. The new board,
   described in this paper, has been designed to improve these performances
   by an order of magnitude. In its simplest version, this board includes
   mainly 4 channels of 12-bit resolution digitizers sampling analog data
   up to 2 GSample/s with an analog bandwidth of 300 MHz. It is based on
   the custom-designed MATACQ chip. Its innovative design allows to reach
   these performances with a power consumption smaller than 1W. The boards
   are triggerable either by internal or external signals and several
   boards are easily synchronizable. The board integrates both a GPIB and a
   VME interface that permits a maximum readout speed of 500 event/s with
   all the memory cells of the 4 channels read. Several other read-out
   modes allowing to read only a limited set of cells or of channels are
   available for faster operation.}},

Abstract = {{Synchrotron based digital radiography and microtornography devices are
   powerful, non-destructive, high-resolution research tools. In this
   study, we present a linear system capable of a nominal spatial
   resolution of 22.5 micrometers over a Field-Of-View (FOV) of 13 cm long
   and about 1 nun high. The system is composed of a linear converter GOS
   screen coupled to an intensified Electron-Bombarded CCD (EBCCD) camera,
   by means of a rectangular-to-linear fiber optic adapter. This optical
   guide is composed of seven bundles, each one transporting light in a
   coherent way to preserve spatial information. In this way, a high
   spatial resolution over an extended FOV is obtained. The detector works
   as an X-ray scanner by means of a high-precision translation mechanical
   device. Here we present an investigation gained at ELETTRA synchrotron
   facility at Trieste (Italy). A monochromatic 34 keV has been used for
   imaging a human proximal femur, 9 cm in width, with our system. The
   excellent spatial resolution of the system allows the analysis of the
   trabecular structure of the bone over the entire FOV of about 10 cm.}},

Abstract = {{IntraOperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) is a technique based on delivery
   of a high dose of ionising radiation to the cancer tissue, after tumour
   ablation, during surgery. The Novac7 is a new linear accelerator
   expressly conceived for IORT that supplies electron beams at several
   energy, with high dose rate. These peculiar characteristics give rise to
   some complications with classical dosimetric techniques. In the
   framework of a research contract between ENEA and the Physics Department
   of Bologna, Italy, an original digital system has been developed to
   study and visualise the Novac7 electron beam in real time.
   The system is conceived as a grid consisting of two bundles of
   scintillating optical fibres (SOF) over-crossing each other, optically
   coupled with two arrays of photodiodes as read-out system.
   The problem of image reconstruction can be expressed as follows: there
   are only two profiles, or data arrays, which correspond respectively to
   the light emitted along the fibres perpendicular to the X-axis for the
   X-profile, and along the fibres perpendicular to the Y-axis for the
   Y-profile. This problem is not dissimilar to the reconstruction problem
   in tomography where several projections should be composed to trace them
   back to the original image. Unfortunately, here we have only two
   profiles: we have two one-dimensional profiles and are seeking one
   bidimensional image that could produce them.
   We selected a known beam image acquired by another digital instrument,
   then we extracted from it the two profiles simulating the acquisition
   arrays. Subsequently, we tested several reconstruction algorithms on
   these profiles, comparing the reconstructed image with the original one.
   We started from the simple sum algorithm until to iterative algorithms,
   searching the best compromise between the computational complexity and
   an high precision.
   We found that the iterative method is the best solution: it respects the
   geometrical characteristics and the absolute intensity values of the
   original image. Moreover it can reconstruct the image in a time of less
   than one second, a very good result.}},

Abstract = {{To realize innovative instrumentation for mammography, a digital
   mammographic head based on several gallium arsenide detectors and on the
   Medipix chip (developed by the Medipix collaboration at CERN) has been
   designed. This device is able to perform single photon counting readout
   and allows a full detection efficiency at the mammographic energies. To
   make such detection units, industrial processes for the production of
   GaAs pixel detectors and for their bump-bonding to the read-out VLSI
   electronics have been developed by Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS S.p.A.).
   The detection unit is a 200 gm thick GaAs matrix of 64 x 64 square
   pixels (170 gm pitch), previously optimized and fully characterized,
   connected via bump bonding to the electronic chip. Specific studies were
   performed to develop a process that meets the requirements of low cost,
   high yield and high reliability for the bump bonding process of the GaAs
   detector to the Silicon electronics. To ensure a high-quality electrical
   contact between the matrix detector and the silicon read out electronics
   a bump-bonding process has been set-up. It is based on a In evaporation
   process. In this work we present the technical characteristics of the
   bump bonding process and the results obtained in terms of bump-bonding
   yield and detection performance of the GaAs based detection units which
   have been realized and fully tested and are now ready to be implemented
   in the mammographic head.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a novel ultrasonic system for high precision
   relative position monitoring. An innovative combination of existing
   signal processing techniques was implemented to facilitate an accurate,
   efficient, and automated digital algorithm. A method was derived for
   physical compensation of temperature dependant water velocity through
   the design and use of a two-tiered target. A leave-in-place, couplant
   free transducer was designed and fabricated for use at elevated
   temperatures, the details of which will be discussed in presentation
   form. A prototype was developed according to wave propagation principles
   in order to produce multiple roundtrip reflections from a water immersed
   target. The digital automated processing included gate tracking
   algorithms, reference correlations, and Hilbert transformed envelopes
   which helped facilitate a phase stability of 1-3ns. This allowed for a
   precision of lambda/150 (1 mu m at 10 MHz) in relative target
   positioning. Analysis was conducted at 23 degrees C and 77 degrees C
   with velocity measurements taken over this range in order to qualify the
   systems capability of position indication at elevated temperatures.
   Repeated target movements on the order of 100 gin were measured with
   approximately 0.1\% mean square deviation from average over a
   displacement range of 1mm at both temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{The development of short-range wireless communication has become
   exceedingly important due to the emerging market of wireless WLAN and
   blue-tooth. CMOS technology has emerged as the top solution due to its
   cost advantage, performance improvement and ease of integration for
   high-performance digital circuits and highspeed analog/RF circuits.
   Accelerated scaling of CMOS technology has contributed to remove
   otherwise fundamental barriers preempting its widespread application to
   MS/RF segments. Improvements in device speed, matching, and minimum
   noise figure are all consistent with fundamental scaling trends. Other
   figures-of-merit such as linearity and 1/f noise do not scale favorably
   but are not considered roadblocks when viewed from a circuit design
   perspective. Furthermore, interconnect architectural scaling trends in
   logic technology have facilitated improvements in passive-component
   performance metrics. These improvements compounded with innovations in
   circuit design have made CMOS technology the primary choice for cost
   driven mixed-signal / radio-frequency (MS/RF) applications {[}1]. This
   paper reviews active and passive elements of CMOS MS/RF SoC technology

Abstract = {{The much-heralded concept of creating a single-processor cellular modem
   has now become reality. TTPCom's latest version of their Cellular
   Baseband Engine (CBE 2000) combines both digital signal processor and
   microcontroller functions on a single processor, resulting in a greatly
   simplified programming model. This provides a more flexible way to
   partition tasks for easier maintenance and higher programming
   efficiency. In this paper, we present an innovation that demonstrates a
   new system architecture. StarCore's VLES (variable-length execution set)
   technology allows software developers to develop both signal processing
   and control code entirely in C and compile it into a seamlessly
   integrated application.}},

Abstract = {{The growing number of instances of breaches in information security in
   the last few years has created a compelling case for efforts towards
   secure electronic systems. Embedded systems, which will be ubiquitously
   used to capture, store, manipulate, and access data of a sensitive
   nature, pose several unique and interesting security challenges.
   Security has been the subject of intensive research in the areas of
   cryptography, computing, and networking. However, security is often
   mis-construed by embedded system designers as the addition of features,
   such as specific cryptographic algorithms and security protocols, to the
   system. In reality, it is an entirely new metric that designers should
   consider throughout the design process, along with other metrics such as
   cost, performance, and power.
   This paper is intended to introduce embedded system designers and design
   tool developers to the challenges involved in designing secure embedded
   systems. We attempt to provide a unified view of embedded system
   security by first analyzing the typical functional security requirements
   for embedded systems from an end-user perspective. We then identify the
   implied challenges for embedded system architects, as well as hardware
   and software designers (e.g., tamper-resistant embedded system design,
   processing requirements for security, impact of security on battery life
   for battery-powered systems, etc.). We also survey solution techniques
   to address these challenges, drawing from both current practice and
   emerging research, and identify open research problems that will require
   innovations in embedded system architecture and design methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{Phylsyst is an intelligent system that mines phylogenetic
   classifications. Its idea stems from the work of phylogeneticists of the
   Societe Francaise de Systematique and proposes to test an innovative
   method for inferring phylogenetic classifications. The main idea in
   Phylsyst is to represent the reasoning of an expert phylogeneticist
   constructing a cladogram following Hermig principles. Several methods of
   artificial intelligence concur to Phylsyst's efficient implementation of
   a phylogeneticist expert reasoning, the main one being data mining.
   Although phylogenetic tree mining has been little addressed in the data
   mining community, we hypothesize that this community has much to
   contribute to the worldwide efforts worldwide to Assemble the Tree Of
   Life. Phylsyst is such an attempt, and has been successfully distributed
   worldwide as a digital supplement to a special issue of Biosystema

   exist both vector map error and GPS vehicle position error. The paper
   develops three important technical approaches: Digital Map Generation
   with linear geo-adjusting; Digital Map Geo-adjusting by nonlinear
   rectification; and Real-time Deviation Correction for vehicle track
   based on the traffic vector map.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for efficient display and analysis of 3D spatial data in
   geo-spatial information systems (GISs) has been growing rapidly, and
   products of digital photogrammetric systems (DPS) are among the main
   sources of spatial data for GIS. Therefore, the integration of DPS and
   GIs offers new possibilities for users. In this study, a number of
   innovative methods for the integration of GIS and DPS are proposed and
   compared. These methods are: (1) the `external interface system' where
   the output of a DPS is connected to the input of a GIs, (2) the `joint
   interface system', where the two systems connect together using
   functions of the two systems, and (3) the `integrated system' that
   contains the two systems. Based on the integrated system proposed, an
   Internet-based integration approach, consisting of DPS, GIS and CAD
   systems, has been designed and implemented. The efficient parameters in
   the designed system are: (1) new demands (3D modeling, 3D visualization
   and 3D analysis), (2) data updating (by geo-referenced images), (3)
   Internet for accessing and transforming data and (4) covering a range of
   DPS products (3D vectors data, digital terrain modeling, orthophotos and
   close range data). Internet programming languages, the importance of
   Internet in transforming and accessing data and 3D visualization in the
   integration of GIS and digital photogrammetry are discussed. The
   acquisition of 3D vector data by digital photogrammetric method, the new
   integration method and the use of CAD systems are elaborated in this
   paper. In addition, applications of aerial and close-range images in
   raster GISs using the developed method are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The Astrid-2 mission has dual primary objectives. First, it is an
   orbiting instrument platform for studying auroral electrodynamics.
   Second, it is a technology demonstration of the feasibility of using
   micro-satellites for innovative space plasma physics research. The EMMA
   instrument, which we discuss in the present paper, is designed to
   provide simultaneous sampling of two electric and three magnetic field
   components up to about 1 kHz. The spin plane components of the electric
   field are measured by two pairs of opposing probes extended by wire
   booms with a separation distance of 6.7 m. The probes have titanium
   nitride (TiN) surfaces. which has proved to be a material with excellent
   properties for providing good electrical contact between probe and
   plasma. The wire booms are of a new design in which the booms in the
   stowed position are wound around the exterior of the spacecraft body.
   The boom system was flown for the first time on this mission and worked
   flawlessly. The magnetic field is measured by a tri-axial fluxgate
   sensor located at the tip of a rigid. hinged boom extended along the
   spacecraft spin axis and facing away from the Sun. The new
   advanced-design fluxgate magnetometer uses digital signal processors for
   detection and feedback, thereby reducing the analogue circuitry to a
   minimum. The instrument characteristics as well as a brief review of the
   science accomplished and planned are presented.}},

Abstract = {{With breast cancer incidence rates showing no signs of abating, advances
   in risk stratification and increasing awareness of cancer control, there
   is interest in expanding the breast imaging arsenal. Mammography is
   still the standard of care, and a recent meta-analysis of seven large
   studies supports its value as a screening tool. There is, however, clear
   need for improved sensitivity and specificity. Imaging of function,
   metabolism and molecular activity in breast tissue is of potential
   benefit in addressing these issues. In this article we provide an
   overview of the current methods of imaging in breast cancer, including
   mammography, ultrasound, digital mammography, magnetic resonance,
   positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
   Screening and surveillance should, ideally, be tailored to an
   individual's cancer risk and breast tissue. Current evidence questions
   the recent move toward magnetic resonance imaging as a single or
   multimodality strategy for breast cancer screening. In a high-risk
   group, the cost effectiveness of technical innovations may be justified.}},

Abstract = {{Intermap Technologies is a globally active small-to-medium enterprise;
   (SME) and a world leader in the digital mapping services sector. With
   internationally deployed staff, complex technology and training
   requirements, rigorous quality management objectives, and strong
   projected growth, Intermap needed to adopt new strategies to save time,
   reduce costs, and improve quality. An integral part of the solution was
   eLearning.
   The ``TRADE{''} project (Teaching Radar Through Advanced ELearning)
   began as a standalone course, involving an eLearning delivery platform
   which allowed course structure, content and display to be organized into
   discreet learning objects.
   The TRADE project helped Intermap realize that to fully leverage its
   value, eLearning must be workflow-based and tightly aligned to
   performance requirements and business objectives.
   As eLearning at Intermap evolves, the transformation of business
   processes combined with an integrated and enterprise-wide approach to
   technology, learning, performance-, talent- and quality-management is
   becoming a precursor to sustainable and measurable improvement.
   Intermap is now working to leverage eLearning as a pervasive and
   transformative process that links learning, productivity,
   competitiveness and innovation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the methodology and results achieved in the GEM
   Project and proposes to further develop this research in GEM 2 which
   intends to fulfil the existing skills gap at engineering and management
   level of extended companies and products.
   The sustainability of present dynamic enterprise networks requires
   adequate strategies that are not sufficiently covered by exisiting post
   graduate education. Current curricula often tend to emphasize theory
   over process thus failing to meet the needs of the global manufacturing
   enterprises. This has led to industries that are poor at turning
   innovation into successful products and slow in taking full advantage of
   extended enterprises and products because they lack people with the
   right skills. We have gathered knowledge from the curricula being used
   by various universities around the World in order to create a curriculum
   truly in line with the global industry needs which we have also surveyed
   in our project.
   The results of the e-Learning delivery of GEM demonstrator to pilot test
   the curriculum contents in a large sample of Universities and companies
   is also reported in our paper, as well as the process leading to the
   creation of the GEM Alliance (GEM Virtual University) and GEM 2 Project.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial aircraft are in the process of defining new standards with
   the introduction of the, Airbus A380, which involves the latest digital
   information techniques, such as the AFDX onboard real-time network. The
   AFDX standard, a major innovation in aircraft technology, first used
   with the Airbus A380, introduces telecom Ethernet-based technology, as
   well as a switch connection topology, rather than part-to-part links or
   buses.
   Airbus and CES partnered to develop a general-purpose building block,
   which allows the simulation, test or connection of any AFDX connected
   equipment. Integrated into different packages, ranging from the small
   equipment tester, through the complete aircraft integration test bench,
   up to the full flight test computer. Hence the name ``AFDX
   General-Purpose Test Platform{''}.
   In the flight test applications, it provides the interface between the
   AFDX avionic world and the commercial Ethernet switches, through
   multiple AFDX inputs to a twin Ethernet output router. Redundancy and
   precise time control of the data transmission have been incorporated in
   the specification.
   Also of special interest, is a very advanced source synchronized
   datation system able to guarantee a perfect time alignment of all data
   directly at the entry in the flight test computer.
   This paper will describe the different modular elements of the ground
   and flight test computers, as well as the hardware and software tuning
   and performance analysis tools, which have been developed around these
   computers.
   All of these elements are now in operation and have shown that AFDX
   tools are a. real concept, which can be reused for other programs.}},

Abstract = {{The aging and obsolescence of Automatic Test Systems (ATS) is causing
   many programs to look at re-hosting their Test Program Sets (TPSs) to
   modern test systems. The major problem is that this undertaking is both
   time consuming and expensive. With budgets decreasing, program managers
   have to find innovative ways to do more with less. To find those
   innovative ways, we must look at non traditional methods of TPS
   development. We must be willing to consider that there are alternate
   solutions, and we must take them into consideration when making a
   decision on which ATS to re-host our TPSs.
   This paper will discuss one of the alternative solutions to re-hosting
   TPSs that will realize a significant savings in both time and money over
   the use of traditional ATS. Specifically it will talk about using an in,
   circuit test system (PinPoint II from DiagnoSYS Systems, Inc.) to
   re-host digital circuit boards from a legacy ATS and the techniques used
   to accomplish this task. This approach is not intended to fit all
   situations, but in the right situation, it can be very effective. To get
   the most out of this approach, it is important to identify exactly which
   TPSs are good candidates, and which are not.
   To illustrate how this can be done, the process used by the AWACS
   program to find a cost effective way of re-hosting TPSs from their
   obsolete depot tester (AN/GSM-285) will be outlined. The outline will
   describe the criteria used to determine which circuit cards are good
   candidates, and the differences in techniques used with this approach
   compared to traditional TPS development. It will also describe the
   limitations as well as the benefits obtained by using this approach.
   Examples will be given that illustrate the cost savings that can be
   realized over the use of traditional ATS.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the potential of Shibboleth, a grid middleware tool
   set and foundation technology, to support inter-domain authentication,
   in a medical information environment. Shibboleth is an open
   standards-based solution that meets the requirements of organizations
   needing to exchange information about users securely to protect the
   privacy of their information. Shibboleth is part of the Internet2
   middleware initiative, headed by a group of leading higher education
   middleware architects and corporate partners, and funded by Internet2
   and the National Science Foundation. The project targets organizations
   that need to exchange information including higher education, their
   partners, digital content providers, federal agencies and others with
   whom universities do business. The purpose of the exchange is to
   determine if a person using an application has the permissions to access
   a resource at a target site based on information such as being a member
   of an institution or some specific class. The system is engineered to
   preserve privacy and allows users to determine whether to release
   additional information about themselves or not. Shibboleth has an open
   architecture with a functioning, open source implementation. It ensures
   information exchanged between organizations can interoperate with that
   from other solutions. The presenters are engaged, with a team of
   researchers, at Georgetown University and Washington Hospital Center, to
   test the validity of Shibboleth technology. The goal is to ensure the
   secure exchange of information among users of an innovative emergency
   room management information system at their hospitals and to further
   expose that information across the network to emergency management
   decision makers. Shibboleth use in this highly private and confidential
   environment and how its design meets HIPAA and other security and
   privacy requirements are discussed. This design could connect many
   decision makers and incorporate other sources of secure information such
   as environmental data. This work will help organize medical data
   communities to support inter-domain authentication and extend its use
   for bio-surveillance on a larger scale. (C) 2004 CARS and Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The revolution in aerial photography that has embraced the global
   geographic information industry is particularly strong in the UK. The
   revolution was spawned by the increasing power of the personal computer
   that enabled users to have access to large volumes of imagery converted
   into digital ortho photos. In the UK this revolution was driven by
   commercial companies who invested in creating large databases and have
   driven the resolution down to provide more and more detail. More
   recently the Ordnance Survey has entered the market with its own image
   layer as part of its MasterMap product, the large scale digital database
   of the GB.
   However, unlike many other countries across Europe, there has been
   little experience of publishing aerial photography in the form of photo
   maps in Britain, with a few notable exceptions. With the increased
   availability of aerial imagery there is an opportunity to re-visit this
   form of mapping and produce new and innovative forms of ortho photos
   integrated with other geographic information. This paper briefly
   describes some of the experiences of creating photo maps in Britain and
   looks at the current potential for new cartographic products.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to deliver digital video over wireless networks is an
   enabling technology for many useful applications, ranging from home
   entertainment and security monitoring, to enterprise messaging and
   military reconnaissance, and thus represents the holy grail of wireless
   technology development. In this paper, we describe a wireless video
   delivery system, WiVision, which uses IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs as the
   last mile for both real-time video distribution and on-demand video
   playback. WiVision can air both live events such as on-campus seminars
   and sports activities, and pre-stored video streams such as course
   lectures and financial analysis sessions, to mobile users, who can tune
   in to selected channels of their choice from their laptops or PDAs. An
   innovative feature of WiVision is the support for random video access
   based on keyword-search, where keywords are extracted from the
   closed-caption text embedded in TV programs. In addition, WiVision is
   able to broadcast video streams on the wireless link while seamlessly
   working with commercially available media players. This paper presents
   the implementation details of the real-time acquisition and network
   transport components of a fully operational WiVision prototype, and the
   results of a performance evaluation study on that prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the features of the digital library and the integration of
   library professional work, this article discussed the virtual-reality
   service system of a library. The goal of development is to turn the

   virtual reference consultation service and personalized service, etc,
   which are based on new technology and service means, and to apply it to
   the innotive development of library of research university. It suggests
   that the high school library should strenthen the scientific research
   supporting function while emphasizing the teaching service. It also
   suggests that the library should aim at setting up organizations and
   platforms which will supply services to requirement issuance,
   coordination and scientific research communication, and also setting up
   a knowledge system and a network platformed all-direction scientific
   requiring system which combines literature information, knowledge
   information and interaction. This three-dimensional system functions as
   a combination and extension of the knowledge, which will supply network

Abstract = {{Digital image processing algorithms are usually designed for the raw
   format, that is on an uncompressed representation of the image.
   Therefore prior to transforming or processing a compressed format,
   decompression is applied; then, the result of the processing application
   is finally re-compressed for further transfer or storage. The change of
   data representation is resource-consuming in terms of computation, time
   and memory usage. In the wide format printing industry, this problem
   becomes an important issue: e.g. a 1 m(2) input color image, scanned at
   600 dpi exceeds 1.6 GB in its raw representation. However, some image
   processing algorithms can be performed in the compressed-domain, by
   applying an equivalent operation on the compressed format.
   This paper is presenting an innovative application of the halftoning
   processing operation by screening, to be applied on JPEG-compressed
   image. This compressed-domain transform is performed by computing the
   threshold operation of the screening algorithm in the DCT domain. This
   algorithm is illustrated by examples for different halftone masks. A
   pre-sharpening operation, applied on a JPEG-compressed low quality image
   is also described; it allows to de-noise and to enhance the contours of
   this image.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of sites including scientific electronic journals,
   digital libraries and collaboratories have been dedicated to scientific
   knowledge sharing and exchange in the recent years. Despite the apparent
   progress, in which traditional journals are migrating to Web and new
   forms of communication emerge, a closer look at these sites indicates
   that the scientific publishing model remains essentially unchanged. In
   this context was born the Configurable Electronic Journal (CEJ) project,
   a solution for generating configurable and extensible electronic
   journals. One of the main goals of this work is to apply open source
   technologies, including W3C Semantic Web technologies, in the design of
   an innovative environment for the definition of publication processes.
   CEJ environment is flexible to accommodate different styles of
   publications, suitable to be used in different processes and

   The progression of electronic technology in recent years has prompted

   Until very recently, this work has centred on the Liquid Crystal Display
   (LCD). These are relatively inefficient devices, whether they be
   transmissive or reflective and this low efficiency therefore requires a
   very intense source of light to illuminate them. The difficulty of
   packaging, achieving a high reliability and a long life seemed to limit
   the application of the Laser as the illumination source. However with an
   innovative Laser illuminator working with the highly efficient DMD the
   author describes a `next generation' HUD (Head Up Display) design.}},

   highlight the work we do in the role of a `critical friend' to companies
   trying to grapple with the sustainable development agenda. In this role,
   we balance support, knowledge and capacity building with a more
   challenging stance, which strives for ongoing improvement. The paper
   discusses how we actively engage with organisations and business on real
   sustainability issues. It also explains some of the cutting edge
   research we do, introducing Digital Europe (the sustainability
   implications of ICT and digital technology), Limited Edition
   (sustainable marketing) and future work on Sustainable Innovation. In
   doing this, the paper hopes to illustrate how NGO's can be a stimulus

   adopting a solutions-orientated approach - as well as indicating how the
   NGO agenda is shifted and developing over the years.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an innovative domain-specific cell based ASIC design
   flow to narrow the performance gap between the full custom ASIC design
   method and conventional standard-cell based ASIC design method. The flow
   can improve the design performance and still preserve the efficiency of
   the standard ASIC design flow. Targeting on digital signal processing
   applications, a domain-specific cell library is provided to augment of
   standard cell libraries. Experimental results of designing macros such
   as FFT, FIR etc. are shown in the paper Based on this methodology a
   64-tap FFT can achieve up to 24X performance improvement, with the Power
   x Delay x Area (PDA) criteria, over the conventional designed ASICs.}},

   (IST-2000-26267) and SCOOP (IST-2000-25200) projects, this paper
   accounts for some of the eCommerce visions that simply did not take
   place as well as for a set of sensible and critical software engineering
   practices, which largely contributed to the success of both projects.
   Also, a recent analysis is presented on the continued and growing
   positive results of the digital business solutions implemented that are
   providing our ``end users{''} with increasing differentiation and cost
   advantages over their competitors. Finally, picking up on our SME's
   existing momentum towards innovative eCommerce business practices, we
   also describe some of the concepts currently being researched for
   SMARTISAN 2, namely those of customer centric and extended enterprise
   strategies geared towards customer value co-creation.}},

Abstract = {{The simplicity of language learning depends basically on the method and
   system used. Traditional systems by direct contact with the teacher are
   usually bored and monotonous to study. Moreover, these systems are
   orientated to a more slowly learning. This paper introduced a e-learning
   hyperenvironment, HEUSKLEARNING, created to get a faster and more
   pleasant Basque learning, the second official language of the Basque
   Country. BEUSKLEARNING is made up of two digital libraries, CyberBiblio
   and Kiosko@, and of an Adaptive Hypermedia System (AHS), HEZINET.
   HEUSKLEARNING was developed to meet two main aims. The first objective
   achieved is to provide different ways of Basque language learning,
   causing better marks in the exams. The second one is to promote the
   expansion of the Basque language outside the borders of the Autonomous
   Region. With this, the Basque teaching has turned to a long distance
   method, adapted to suit the needs of the students.}},

   developed over the last five years at the Escola Tecnica i Superior
   d'Arquitectura La Salle. We have created a pedagogic methodology which
   integrates contents and methods with information technology in an
   innovative manner. The interdisciplinary nature of the course fits in
   with the nature of the technology. Visual communication, graphic design,
   art theory and computation, merge in a new conceptual framework that
   overcomes disciplinary boundaries. Ad-hoc web. based learning
   environments have been designed and implemented especially for this
   course, to support interdisciplinary and participatory thinking. The
   course is structured into six themes, each one dealing with a System of
   Representation: TEXT, FIGURE, IMAGE, OBJECT, SPACE and LIGHT. In this
   paper, we will focus on the content and methods of the theme IMAGE.}},

Abstract = {{The DialogPlus project involves two English and two American
   universities in sharing learning activities based on digital resources.
   The subject domain of Geography can draw on a wide variety of digital
   resources such as maps, databases, web pages, and images. Embedding
   these in well-designed learning activities for undergraduate and
   postgraduate students poses many challenges, including accessibility,
   accommodating learning and teaching preferences, quality, rights
   clearance and approaches to assessment. The author of this paper, a
   researcher at the University of Southampton, works with the educators,
   analysing, supporting and evaluating their innovative approaches, and
   with computer scientists charged with resolving the complex issues of
   sharing resources between four institutions each with a different
   learning management system/environment. This paper reflects on the early
   project experiences and the design of a learning activity toolkit also
   being developed at Southampton.}},

Abstract = {{Some educators enhance their classes by adding Internet materials,
   traditional library resources, or using copies of a new article. While
   such changes may work well, there just may be an even better way to
   enhance one's classes. Recently published proceedings and journal
   articles are available from AACE's Digital Library (AACE'DL) that
   affords students with options more consistent with Internet time.
   McMillan Culp, Honey, and Mandinach (2003) identify the importance of
   educators finding a personal technology policy that is predicated on
   one's personal experimentations, investigations, and experiences. The
   AACE'DL helps do that; it becomes an idea machine for innovation. This
   roundtable will demonstrate how the AACE'DL helps educators and students
   find their professional voices. Educators must become members of an
   educationally savvy computer and communication technology (CCT)
   educational culture. Teachers and students will only move forward with
   CCT when they understand how adequate equipment, re-skilling, and one's
   personal understanding all connect together. Attendees will be provided
   with recent examples of how the AACE'DL was used in graduate educational
   technology classes.}},

   predict, analyze and explain the rise and fall of businesses. In this
   paper, we question whether the concept can be used to predict the
   ultimate downfall of online learning in higher education, if
   universities continue to confuse their key mission-education with the
   much more product-oriented aim of information delivery. The
   proliferation of information-based online courses is examined within the
   context of the limitations imposed by widely-used course management
   systems, institutional impediments and other factors that encourage
   teachers to adopt information delivery in preference for more
   innovative, authentic pedagogies. Data is reported from teachers and
   instructional designers who have been successful in offering complex and

Abstract = {{Diagnosing the reinforced concrete structures by using infrared
   thermography has become considerable in Japan.(1) Infrared thermography
   has potential for detecting the defects, but is challenging due to
   unwanted thermal signals caused by surface roughness dirt, etc.(2.3) To
   prevent from misdiagnosing, an innovative concept of merged thermal with
   visible images is proposed. Several key issues exist to capture the
   merged images: (1) alignment for the optical axes of an infra-red camera
   and digital still camera, (2) parallax correction between the thermal
   and visible images, (3) aberration correction for the lenses, and (4)
   adjustment of the image view angles. An experimental setup demonstrates
   an efficient diagnosing using the merged images.}},

Abstract = {{Tecnatom is developing a new line of eddy current data acquisition
   systems (ET-DAS). The main innovations of the system consist of a
   digital reception technique approach, dynamic gain control, real-time
   signal data processing through DSP's, array probes support as well as
   electronic embedded probes support and integration with sound, video, UT
   and mechanical controllers in the same rack. Another advantage of the
   system is its small size due to the high-tech electronics components
   employed. With regards to signal processing, several tools have been
   implemented both for data acquisition and data analysis purposes. In
   this sense, a complete new enhanced tool for automatic data analysis has
   been developed. This software module, named Expert, together with the
   current automatic analysis process, makes TEDDY a powerful analysis tool
   since it can perform a complete double automatic analysis. This paper
   presents the new module as well as the new line of eddy current data
   acquisition systems, named TEDDY PLUSDIGITAL.}},

Abstract = {{Enabling technologies have led to the transformation of library services
   from traditional services incorporating card catalogs, printed books and
   periodicals, bibliographic instruction, in-person/face-to-face
   reference, to new services and delivery modes incorporating: electronic
   collections, such as e-books, e-journals and databases; virtual
   reference services, and other online services. Innovation of new
   services that are peculiar to the online/Web environment is the trend in
   modern electronic libraries. During the last decade, many libraries,
   particularly those serving academic communities, have witnessed the
   emergence of new service paradigms in areas of information access and
   delivery, reference, instruction, technology facility and support to
   patrons. Libraries continue to harness new technologies to offer
   services in innovative ways to meet the changing needs of their patrons.
   This paper explores some of these emerging service paradigms in
   electronic libraries. The concept of ``service paradigm{''} in this
   paper is used to refer to predominant service patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Over the years, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have made a
   profound impact on the electronics industry with rapidly improving
   semiconductor-manufacturing technology ranging from sub-micron to deep
   sub-micron processes and equally innovative CAD tools. Though FPGA has
   revolutionized programmable/ reconfigurable digital logic technology,
   one limitation of current FPGA's is that the user is limited to strictly
   electronic designs. Thus, they are not suitable for applications that
   are not purely electronic, such as optical communications, photonic
   information processing systems and other multi-technology applications
   (ex. analog devices, MEMS devices and microwave components). Over recent
   years. the growing trend has been towards the incorporation of
   non-traditional device technologies into traditional CMOS VLSI systems.
   The integration of these technologies requires a new kind of FPGA that
   can merge conventional FPGA technology with photonic and other
   multi-technology devices. The proposed new class of field programmable
   device will extend the flexibility, rapid prototying and reusability
   benefits associated with. p conventional electronic into photonic and
   multi-technology domain and give rise to the development of a wider
   class of programmable and embedded integrated systems.
   This new technology will create a tremendous opportunity for applying
   the conventional programmable/reconfigurable hardware concepts in other
   disciplines like photonic information processing. To substantiate this
   novel architectural concept. we have fabricated proof-of-the-concept
   CMOS VLSI Multi-technology FPGA (MT-FPGA) chips that include both
   digital field programmable logic blocks and threshold programmable
   photoreceivers which are suitable for sensing optical signals. Results
   from these chips strongly support the feasibility of this new
   optoelectronic device concept.}},

   suggests the method and metrics to be applicable for quantifying how new
   information systems affect to organizational communication as well as
   for anticipating their digitalisation impact prior to the
   implementation. The metrics provide a basis for further work on
   analysing correlation between organizational performance and adoption of

Abstract = {{In this article we report on our research that integrates photo
   annotation tasks into online chatting. Users of our system can share and
   annotate digital photos online while chatting. There are two major
   innovations: first, users can add annotations and comments to photos in
   a collaborative manner and secondly, the software itself extracts
   information from conversations to generate extra annotations. The boring
   and tedious task of annotating photos is turned into an essential part
   of an attractive fun activity, viz. online chatting. This article also
   provides a roadmap towards a systematic analysis of linguistic aspects
   of automated interpretation of message conversations.}},

Abstract = {{Cities are central to the economic and social development of European
   society, not only because over 80\% of European citizens live in urban
   areas, but also because cities are at the same time centres of
   production, innovation, employment, and culture, and loci of
   segregation, deprivation, and ethnic conflict. The emergence of a
   European-wide urban policy, has given new impetus to the need for
   comparable indicators of the quality of life to monitor development and
   policy implementation. This paper reviews the literature on quality of
   life indicators, and argues that traditional measures of the quality of
   life need to be supplemented with two new dimensions that reflect more
   recent postmodernist thinking about the composition of urban landscapes,
   and the contribution to the quality of life of the emerging information
   society. We argue that the challenges of building appropriate indicators
   reflecting these new dimensions are considerable, even in urban
   environments so rich in information systems and data sources, if they
   are to qualify as `digital cities'. There are difficulties in finding
   common workable definitions of the indicators themselves, as well as
   definitions of the relevant populations, including city residents, and
   users. By raising these issues and suggesting possible avenues for
   addressing these challenges we contribute to a much-needed debate on how
   to define such indicators, which is the prerequisite for their
   development and use.}},

   system. An important task in this field is configuring the programmable

   innovative approach for fast configuration of a reconfigurable DSP
   hardware equipped with a global H-tree communication structure that
   connects to all cells in the array. The scheme takes advantage of the
   increasing data bus bandwidth from leafs to the upper end of the tree to
   rapidly broadcast configuration data to all the cells. Additionally,
   this entails the designers to focus their configuration mapping on the
   few switches at the upper level of the tree instead of the massive
   number of cells at the lower end of the tree.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simulation research of a data network and data
   transmission for biomedical and telemedicine purposes. The information
   exchange, adaptive data waveforms for wireless channels and traffic
   simulations of data flow is the substance of this investigation.
   Simulations have been made with a Comnet 3 network traffic simulator
   package.
   First section is a motivation section showing examples of innovative use
   of data networks and emerging new terminologies. Biomedical information
   technologies combined with data network, collaboration, grid, adhoc and
   virtual organization are discussed.
   Second section is the basis of the study. It deals with customer data
   communication needs. The communication channels can be radio channels or
   wired lines (analog or digital). In the latter case digitized analog
   voice (voice coding) is transmitted by Voice over IP (VoIP). The channel
   bandwidth of the network is usually a bottleneck of performance. Thus
   the transmission capacity of the network is an important target of the
   simulation investigation. We investigate the need of the channel
   bandwidth in bits per second by simulating data transmission delays in
   connectionless data networks. Delay simulation results of some standard
   wireless data communications systems are compared with adaptive data
   waveform results.
   In third section modeling and simulation results of the network design
   are investigated. Data transmissions are evaluated by simulations of
   biomedical or telemedicine traffic using modeled data transmission
   networks. The quality of service (QOS) in digital data networks is
   measured with bit error rate (BER) or time delay. BER of a communication
   channel describes QOS of the modulation method used. It depends on the
   signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the channel.
   In last sections we propose and discuss the adaptive data communication
   design principles of the networks. We evaluate the proposal modulation
   selection system and the use of secure adaptive waveforms. We design
   end-to-end security on the physical OSI reference model level I and at
   the same time we improve throughput of data traffic of our network. The
   investigation of the sensitivity of a network structure, the message
   flow fluctuations and the growth process are important. We present
   principles for network design and channel capacity planning. The channel
   bandwidth and the S/N are well known parameters in network design by
   Shannon's formula. With this metric we get different limits for wireless
   channel traffic (bit rates), transactions in the system and data network
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{A distinguishing characteristic of field-programmable logic is the
   ability to route wires in the field, but previous authors have made
   compelling arguments for routing packets, not wires, between major
   system components. The present paper outlines the packet-switched
   network for interconnecting heterogeneous nodes in QuickSilver
   Technology's Adaptive Computing Machine (ACM). Special attention is paid
   to two truly innovative aspects of the ACM architecture: (1) the
   Point-to-Point (PTP) protocol for transferring real-time, streaming data
   and (2) the node wrapper which makes all nodes appear homogeneous
   regardless of their internal structure or functionality. The wrapper
   also provides a single, uniform and consistent mechanism for task
   management, flow control and load balancing across all node types. With
   the PTP protocol and the node wrapper, nodes as diverse as digital
   signal processors, reduced-instruction-set processors, domain-specific
   processors, reconfigurable fabrics, on-chip and off-chip bulk memories
   and input/output ports can communicate seamlessly. Moreover, once a node
   (including wrapper) has been configured, or reconfigured, by a
   supervisory node, it is able to operate autonomously without the need
   for global control.}},

Abstract = {{Globalisation and digitalisation have been presented as inescapable
   forces which signal the `death of geography'. this article takes issue
   with this fashionable narrative. The counter argument that `geography
   matters' is pursued in three ways:first, by questioning the
   `distance-destroying' capacity of information and communication
   technologies, where social depth is conflated with spatial reach;
   second, by arguing that physical proximity may be essential for some

Abstract = {{Since the first deployment of cellular phones, we have witnessed an
   almost global revolution in the development of wireless communication.
   This success has been evident for the GSM technology, whose popularity
   has exploded during the 1990s thanks to its affordable price, digital
   quality and a pervasive innovative application as SMS. However, the same
   positive conditions seems to lack in the next generations of wireless
   communication, as UMTS, thus slowing down their market penetration.
   Therefore, both mature and recent mobile technology could benefit from
   the introduction of a novel application able to shake the market. To
   this aim, mobile location could be used to facilitate the diffusion of
   many novel services for cellular systems. We present in this paper, an
   innovative location based application that involves only a minor impact
   on the current GSM architecture, while offering to customers an
   appealing means to obtain multimedia entertainment.}},

Abstract = {{The 1970s and 1980s saw a rapid take-up in the use of personal
   computers. During the same time period, society began to move towards
   providing equity for people with disabilities. As legislators around the
   world created new disability and Information Technology policies, more
   people with disabilities were given access to education and the evolving
   computing tools provided unprecedented educational opportunities. These
   opportunities were due to the use of new technologies such as outputting
   of electronic text to voice synthesizers. The provision of assistive
   technology was not only helpful; it also provided education through a
   medium that was previously unavailable, particular to the blind and
   vision impaired. For much of the 1980s the development of
   text-processing sensory technologies, connected to personal computers,
   led to a closer equality between the educational services of the
   able-bodied and people with disabilities.
   Unfortunately this evolution as not without notable difficulties: issues
   surrounding the cost of products, the lack of support from large
   corporations and choice of platform resulted in substantial difficulties
   for educators in the assessment of appropriate technology. In addition,
   many of these products became largely redundant in the late-1980s as
   corporations began to place more emphasis on the Graphical User
   Interface (GUI). Although the GUI was remarkably successful in allowing
   the general public to gain better access to personal computing, it's
   non-text nature once again caused a digital divide for people with
   disabilities. Although it is clear that the evolution of the personal
   computer has had a significant impact on the provision of education for
   people with disabilities, this paper highlights the historical
   repetition where innovation is prioritized above e-inclusion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative digital control architecture for
   low-voltage, high-current dc-dc converters, based on a combination of
   current-programmed control and variable frequency operation. The key
   feature of the proposed architecture is the low complexity: only two
   digital-to-analog converters (DACs) with low resolution (7-b) are used
   for control. An original control algorithm is used to reduce
   quantization effects to negligible levels, in spite of the low
   resolution of the DACs. Thanks to this algorithm, both static and
   dynamic output voltage regulation are improved with respect to
   traditional digital solutions. Adaptive voltage positioning and active
   current sharing are inherently provided by the new architecture. A
   detailed description of the control strategy is given with reference to
   a single-phase buck converter. Extension to multiphase converters is
   straightforward. The digital control architecture is experimentally
   verified on a FPGA-based four-phase prototype buck converter operating
   at 350 kHz/phase. Output voltage tolerance within +/-0.5\% is
   experimentally demonstrated, along with negligible quantization effects
   and fast transient response. The features and the performance of the
   proposed architecture make it a valuable candidate for the control of
   next generation voltage regulator modules.}},

Abstract = {{TanDEM-X is a mission proposal for a TerraSAR-X add-on satellite for
   high-resolution single-pass SAR interferometry. This mission proposal
   has been selected for a Phase A study within the scope of a Call for
   Proposals for a next German Earth Observation Mission to be launched in
   2008/2009. The mission has the goal of generating a global Digital
   Elevation Model (DEM) with an accuracy corresponding to the DTED-3
   specifications (12 in posting, 2 m relative height accuracy for flat
   terrain). This goal will be achieved by means of a second, TerraSAR-X
   like satellite (TanDEM-X) flying in a close orbit configuration with
   TerraSAR-X, This paper describes the mission concept and requirements,
   including several innovative aspects like operation modes, orbit
   selection and maintenance as well as PRY and phase synchronization.
   Results from a detailed performance estimation show the achievable DEM
   accuracy. Finally, an overview of the potential of the TanDEM-X mission
   for several scientific applications is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The RadSTAR initiative morges an interferometric radiometer with a
   digital beam forming scattermoter, providnig Earth surface backscatter
   and emission measurements. Heretofore these instrument developments have
   been designed for low flying known plotforms such as the NASA P-3.
   Commercial-off-the-shelf design materials can be used to inexpensively
   build antemas that approximate free-space permittivity, enabling remote
   sensing of soil moisture levels locally using small Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicles (UAVs). A form free-space sandwich can be used to minimize the
   weight of the dielectric backing structure. This technique enables rapid
   prototyping with space-grade materials. A low-mass 3-element antenna
   array of this design is already baselined for a University
   nano-satellite mission. A light-weighted version of the L-bond Imaging
   Scatteromter (LIS) radar electronics is being developed for a Small
   Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program. This lightweight wing
   antenna has a large potential payoff to NASA. For example, it may enable
   an active/passive hydrology mission using a fleet of low cost small
   UAVs. A mesh ground plane can further reduce the overall moss and
   slowability of the very large antennas required for spaceborne
   observations at L-Band. The cross track can success criterion was met al
   L-Band frequencies for radar and radiometry. That is, we designed and
   prototyped a wideband antenna patch tunable in this range and additional
   work is being carried out to improve the cross polarization isolation.
   Making the present broadband design into arrays will be limited to one
   dimension due to array spacing and the aspect ratio of the patch
   elements. A fore and aft Doppler beam synthesis and the LIS cross-track
   beam forming concept will be considered for potential application to
   surface hydrology measurements using these arrays.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical obstructions (VOs) such as radio towers, power pylons, and
   windmills present a hazard to low-flying aircraft. We describe an
   automated VO detection scheme that processes digital surface models
   (DSMs) provided by interferometric SAR (InSAR) systems to produce
   heights and locations of VOs. By using, only the height data from the
   InSAR, the resulting techniques can be applied to other DSM sources,
   such as lidar.
   Innovative morphological filtering algorithms are described, which
   optimize detection performance against various DSM resolutions over
   smooth or rough terrain. The height and position estimates of the
   detected VOs are computed, and they compare favorably to ground truth.
   Software that implements these algorithms has been packaged as an add-on
   module to ERDAS IMAGINE(R).}},

Abstract = {{The ISO TC42/WG18-20-22-23 and ANSI/13A IT10 Technical Committees have
   now been developing digital photography standards for over a decade.
   This work has led to the publication of standards on digital imaging
   terminology, digital camera ISO speed measurements, resolution
   measurements, OECF (linearity) measurements, image formats and metadata,
   and picture transfer protocol (PTP). More recently, standards on color
   encoding specifications and color architectures, a JPEG 2000 profile for
   digital cameras, camera noise and dynamic range measurements, digital
   camera specification reporting, and scanner resolution have been
   finalized. Work in progress includes image quality subjective testing
   methods, digital camera color characterization, and scanner dynamic
   range measurements. This paper will review past and current technical
   challenges, and the state of the solutions provided. In most cases,
   development includes a significant and innovative research component,
   which is discussed in relation to fundamental imaging issues. These
   standards are viewed from a broad digital photography perspective, and
   placed in context with other work in this area. In addition to providing
   a forum for the development of standards, technical committees are an
   important avenue for interaction between companies, user groups, and the
   government. Such avenues can have a great impact on emerging
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Wavelet transforms are becoming increasingly important as an image
   processing technology. Their efficient implementation using commercially
   available VLSI technology is a subject of continuous study and
   development. This paper presents the implementation using modern Altera
   APEX20K field-programmable logic (FPL) devices of reduced complexity and
   high performance wavelet architectures by means of the residue number
   system (RNS). The improvement is achieved by reducing arithmetic
   operations to modulo operations executed in parallel over small wordy
   length channels. The systems are based on index arithmetic over Galois
   fields and the key for attaining low-complexity and high-throughput is
   an adequate selection of a small word-width modulus set. These systems
   are programmable in the sense that their coefficients can be
   reprogrammed in order to make them more suitable for most of the
   applications. FPL-efficient converters are also developed and the
   overhead of the input and output conversion is assessed. The design of a
   reduced complexity epsilon-CRT converter makes the conversion overhead
   of this kind of systems be not important for their practical
   implementation. The proposed structures are compared to traditional
   systems using 2's complement arithmetic. With this and other
   innovations, the proposed architectures are about 65\% faster than the
   2's complement designs and require fewer logic elements in most cases.}},

Abstract = {{New classes of application capabilities that extend user participation
   in two significant ways are gaining popularity. Multimodal dialogs
   (involving multiple communications modes such as speech, digital ink.
   gestures, text, etc.) increase the number of communications channels
   through which users can simultaneously interact with applications.
   Adding presence-awareness (real-time knowledge of communications
   channels and modes available to all users) allows those applications to
   adapt to available communication channels and media. providing capacity
   to automatically accommodate changes in the users' environment. These
   innovations present an opportunity to create more natural, adaptive,
   human-like dialogs, but raise new concerns. The user's ability and
   desire to embrace these capabilities will depend less on the
   technology's ``wow{''} factor and more on human factors. Designers and
   developers face new challenges in bringing such applications to maturity
   and acceptance. Creation of a framework that takes various criteria as
   inputs and recommends guidelines for designing applications that do not
   result in sensory and privacy overload is necessary. This paper examines
   early-stage research in progress on this framework.}},

Abstract = {{In many studies, interface icons have been proven to be very useful in
   facilitating users to interact with a smart product and yield positive
   feedback (Caplin, 2002; Young, 1991). The purpose of this study is to
   investigate design issues pertinent to interface icon for mobile devices
   with small screens. An innovative personal entertainment device was
   adopted as an example in this study. This device is able to offer MP3
   music, FM radio, and digital photos functions to the users. However, due
   to the limitations of its small screen, to an interaction designer, the
   way to design easy-to-understand interface icons has become an important
   design issues. The results generated in this study revealed that: (1)
   The degree of understandability to most of the commonly used interface
   icons is very high. This is because these icons can be seen very often
   on many Windows-based operating systems; (2) To those unfamiliar icons,
   especially designed for this new device, users' degrees of
   understandability tended to be lower. This is mainly because the users
   had not created their mental models regarding these new interface icons.
   They need more time to learn these new icons; (3) The interview results
   also indicated that small screen interface icons should be designed with
   simplicity or with higher color contrast to enhance their clarity and
   visibility.}},

Abstract = {{Distance learning has been revolutionized by the incorporation of
   internet-based communication. Unfortunately, most online learning
   environments merely enhance traditional formats, resulting in multimedia
   books viewed through computer monitors with the aid of a keyboard and a
   mouse. Engineers at Tufts University and Lincoln University have
   collaborated to create an environment where remote groups of learners
   can interact through a technology called the ROBOTable. Inspired by the
   research and development of the HI SPACE table, the. ROBOTable consists
   of a piece of frosted glass with a computer screen projected on it, and
   a computer monitor behind it. Users interact by using the digital pen to
   write on the table surface, creating a ``shared whiteboard{''}. Users
   can also use the tab le as a platform for competition or collaboration.
   When a user places an object, such as a LEGO robot, on the table
   surface, a virtual image is created in the other location. The ROBOTable
   becomes a portal that can support group collaboration spanning remote
   locations in a ``hands-on{''} sense. By providing more effective
   communication, we theorize that the table will facilitate a more
   seamless interface between the real world and the virtual world, and a
   more powerful distance learning experience for participants.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology is gradually evolving to the era of ubiquitous
   networking from its current era of network computing. Ubiquitous
   networking refers to increasingly various information equipment such as
   cell phones, car navigation systems, PDAs, digital appliances, PCs and
   RFIDs will be connected seamlessly using protocols such as IPv6,
   Bluetooth, IEEE 802.X, 1396 etc. via broadband or other fixed mobile
   convergence technologies to enable anytime, anywhere, always-on
   networking among people, objects, enterprises and governments.
   This paper briefly reviews the ubiquitous networking development in
   Japan. We first attempt to describe the major components that make up a
   ubiquitous network such as the infrastructure, the digital networked
   appliances, the content and the content developers community, the
   standardization infrastructure that enable ubiquitous networking. We
   then argue that ubiquitous networking enables a new innovation paradigm,
   one that is not based on creative destruction but that successive new
   business models build upon the recombination of different applications
   (modules) via the digital infrastructure. This represents a new logic of
   distributed and combinatorial innovation which can sustain the continual
   self-propagation of the ubiquitous networking technology.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory measurements of gas-transfer velocity and free-surface
   hydrodynamics were made for oscillating grid-stirred turbulence.
   Air-water gas-transfer velocities were determined from the waterside
   dissolved oxygen mass balance, and an innovative digital particle image
   velocimetry technique was used to measure the two-dimensional
   free-surface flow field. The impact of adventitious and purposely
   introduced surfactant films on free-surface turbulence and gas-transfer
   rates was explored quantitatively. As expected, bulk turbulence was
   unable to provide a unique relationship for the gas-transfer rates
   observed, owing predominantly to surfactant effects. However, the
   surface divergence computed from the free-surface velocity field was
   capable of reconciling the gas-transfer data. This is possible evidence
   confirming that the free-surface divergence is an important process
   involved in interfacial gas transport. A relationship for the
   gas-transfer velocity in terms of the surface divergence and the surface
   pressure is presented that successfully relates the interactions between
   surface renewal, surfactants, and gas transfer. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The telecommunication sector is of key importance for the European
   economy. Digitization, secure broadband access and mobility are expected
   to shift an ever-growing proportion of the economy on line, thus
   creating new markets and business opportunities. With the eEurope 2002
   and eEurope 2005 initiatives, the European Union has initiated a number
   of policy actions aiming at favouring the rapid introduction of
   innovative communication systems, services and applications. Research
   and development, as supported under the IST programme of the Union, is
   closely associated to the overall policy picture. The IST programme is
   notably instrumental in supporting, with a longer-term approach, key
   policy orientations such as the pervasive introduction of low cost
   broadband access, introduction of advanced mobile systems, or migration
   of networks towards the next generation of Internet protocol, IPv6.
   Satellite communication form an integral part of this diversified
   communication landscape, and has also been significantly supported under
   the 5th Framework Programme. Even if the problematic of the satcom
   industry are to some extent similar to those of the terrestrial players
   (e.g. catalysing take up of broadband and advanced mobile markets), the
   strategies followed by the satcom sector differ from those followed by
   the terrestrial players. This paper review the current technological
   approaches of the satcom industry, their relevance in the context of the
   policy goals of the Union, and how they have been supported under the

Abstract = {{This article is based on the results of the EU-funded research project
   `MUTEIS' (Macro-economic and Urban Trends in Europe's Information
   Society), that aims to provide deeper insights in the emerging digital
   economies in urban regions. The information and communication technology
   (ICT) sector is at the centre of interest to cities. In the 1990s, many
   of them invested heavily in developing and attracting this promising
   sector. Almost every city has developed and implemented ambitious
   policies to promote the local ICT sector. But not every city has
   benefited to the same extent from its rapid growth: there are
   substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between urban
   regions. This study reviews the development of ICT clusters across
   Europe, and assesses the role of local and national policies in this
   field. It highlights the diversity of cluster development paths in
   different local and national contexts.}},

Abstract = {{To succeed in the competitive business arena, companies must leverage
   their existing knowledge and create new knowledge that favourably
   positions them in their targeted market. There has been a great deal of
   effort to develop new applications of information technology to support
   the digital capture, storage, retrieval and distribution of an
   organisation's explicitly documented knowledge. It is also recognised
   that tacit knowledge plays an important role in innovation and, thus,
   organisations need to divert attention to social capital that develops
   from people interaction and which in turn requires alignment of
   organisational structure, culture, and reward systems. However, there is
   a gap between knowledge management theories and practice, in particular
   in terms of issues related to knowledge management objectives, strategic
   implementation, and alignment of organisational parameters. This paper,
   through the case study of GKN, explores how these issues have been
   handled in the real world.}},

Abstract = {{The Digital Portfolio Project at Newcastle University aimed over one
   year (2002/2003) to support teachers in producing, storing and accessing
   assessment portfolios of learner's work using ICT. A major element of
   this was the investigation of the impact that these portfolios had on
   teachers and learners, particularly focusing on how they could be used
   to facilitate pupil talk about the learning process and metacognition.
   This paper draws on evidence of pupil views collected as part of 14
   teacher-led case studies exploring digital portfolio development in
   classrooms across the primary age phase (3-11 years). The teachers all
   approached the task in different ways and the variety of end products
   was large; however, the common result was the value placed on using the
   portfolio as a tool of reflection and celebration of children's
   learning. As part of the data collection teachers were encouraged to
   gather pupil views about the digital portfolio learning process. These
   comments provide an interesting and surprisingly analytical perspective
   of the research and learning process not commonly considered in the
   academic community. They reveal astute comprehension regarding the
   possible implications of using ICT to document achievements, the
   positive effects of recording classroom activities using digital media
   and how using this evidence to reflect on the activities can be a
   meaningful and worthwhile process. The pupils recognise the important
   role that ICT takes in this process and also appreciated the
   possibilities for themselves and their peers as learners. This paper
   documents the pupils' views and uses them to review the strength of the
   Digital Portfolio process and the benefits of using it in the primary
   classroom.}},

Abstract = {{The steel industry pioneered the use of computers for process control.
   By the mid 1960s, almost a fifth of the world's process control
   computers were installed in the steel industry. The present paper
   documents the development of direct digital control with emphasis on hot
   strip mill control, notably the installation at Llanwern using a GE 412
   computer. Early applications of computers in areas such as electric arc
   furnace control and order handling are identified. Archive sources,
   government documents, interviews, correspondence and technical papers
   show the leading role of steel in developing online control. Marked
   differences in adoption rates are identified. Two-thirds of the early
   steel installations were in the USA. Britain and Italy were also early
   adopters. Jones \& Laughlin and Inland of the USA, the Steel Company of
   Wales and Italsider were among the leading innovators.}},

   maintained at sufficient levels to volatilize chemical contaminants. An
   on-site data acquisition system is required to continuously monitor
   these temperatures for multiple sets of data points within the treatment
   zone. Accurate and reliable temperature readings must be immediately
   available to the remediation system operators at any location. An
   innovative, low-cost temperature monitoring system has been developed
   for this application. This system uses a subsurface array of digital
   temperature sensors to monitor thermal processes. Temperature data from
   the site is stored in redundant databases and immediately accessible via
   the internet. The system operators are able to respond to real-time data
   for optimal control of the remediation process.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel temperature/leakage sensor, developed for high-speed,
   low-power, monitoring of processors and complex VLSI chips. The
   innovative idea is the use of 4T SRAM cells, to measure on-chip
   temperature and leakage.Using the dependence of leakage currents to
   temperature, we measure varying decay (discharge) times of the 4T cell
   at different temperatures. Thus, decaying 4T sensors provide a digital
   pulse whose frequency depends on temperature. Because of the sensors'
   very small size, we can easily embed them in many structures thus
   obtaining both redundancy and a fine-grain thermal picture of the chip.
   A significant advantage of our sensor design is that it is insensitive
   to process variations at high temperatures. It is also relatively robust
   to noise. We propose mechanisms to measure temperature that exploit the
   sensor's small size and speed to increase measurement reliability.
   Decaying 4T sensors also provide a measurement of the level of leakage
   at their sensing area, allowing us to adjust leakage-control policies.
   Our 4T sensors are significantly smaller, faster, more reliable, and
   power efficient compared to the best previously proposed designs
   enabling new approaches to architectural-level thermal and leakage
   management.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for non-blind watermarking of still gray level images in
   the wavelet domain. The method uses the Human Visual System (HVS)
   characteristic, and an innovative entropy based approach to create an
   efficient watermarking scheme is presented in this paper. It decomposes
   original image in DWT domain in to three hierarchical levels and
   watermarks it with a logo image, which is scrambled thru a well-known
   PN-sequence. An entropy.-based method is developed for selection of DWT
   coefficients that provides an adaptive way for determining the number of
   watermarked coeffiocients and watermarking factor at each level of DWT
   decomposition. This approach shows an excellent resistance against
   almost all the attacks known in the watermarking literature. The
   detection results of the method reveal better resistance in comparison
   to the existance methods. With simple modifications, the method can be
   used for color images and in real time systems.}},

Abstract = {{This research used diffusion of innovation theory to explore factors
   that influence adoption of digital libraries for electronic theses and
   dissertations (ETD-DL) among members of the Networked Digital Library of
   Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD). Communication channels were
   categorized as being either interpersonal or mediated, and the perceived
   importance of these channels was assessed both within and between
   organizations.
   A web-based survey collected data from the 133 universities in 26
   countries that were NDLTD members in December 2002. Respondents were
   members of the university's ``ETD Committee{''} and represented academic
   administrators, faculty, librarians, and computer systems specialists.
   Surveys were received from 95 respondents representing 65 universities
   in 14 countries. Twenty-one of these universities were outside the
   United States, and represented countries with a wide range of economic
   development.
   Results provide insights into university attitudes towards distributed
   digital libraries. For example, results suggest that interpersonal
   channels of communication about digital library adoption are more
   important than mediated channels within the organization. However,
   mediated channels of communication are more important for those
   universities that have decided to adopt the ETD-DL but have not yet
   implemented the DL. There were also significant differences in the
   importance attributed to these channels by individuals in different
   jobs. The results suggest strategies that could encourage development of
   digital libraries within other social systems. The study also
   illustrates the importance of planning for the human factor in digital
   library management. Carefully constructed strategies that address all
   the parties involved in DL adoption and that account for differences in
   communication style will more readily facilitate successful adoption of
   distributed digital libraries.}},

Abstract = {{DialogPlus is one of four international projects, supported in the US by
   the NSF International Collaborative Research Program in Digital
   Libraries, and in the UK by the Joint Information Systems Committee of
   the UK Higher Education Funding Councils. The two primary objectives of
   the project are to develop:
   a distributed enabling information infrastructure for the support of
   learning and teaching in Geography;
   innovative approaches to teaching and learning, based on this
   infrastructure.
   Specifically, the project aims to show how:
   the undergraduate and postgraduate programs of study in Geography in the
   consortium universities can be enriched and developed through
   cross-national collaboration and online delivery;
   different virtual learning environments can be supported by a common,
   open and distributed digital library infrastructure;
   major geospatial resources relevant for the study of the environment and
   landscape and for the study of human populations in cities and the
   countryside can be used in student programs of study;
   important skills in the analysis of spatial information through use of
   Geographical Information Science and Earth Observation software and
   functions can be taught on-line and made available in undergraduate
   programs.
   The project plans to deliver shared UK/US electronic resources
   associated with four courses across four topic areas, namely: Human
   Geography (based on the Census); Geographical Information Science
   (applied to retailing); Geomorphology (based on river catchments); and
   Earth Observation (for land cover and land use inference).
   The project will capitalize on a variety of rich digital resources which
   have been created by both official agencies and universities and which
   can be used to enhance student learning, knowledge and skills in each of
   these topic areas. These electronic resources will be made available
   through interoperable digital library technology and integrated directly
   into course units in undergraduate programs supported by Virtual
   Learning Environments within each institution.
   A distributed version of the Alexandria geo-referenced digital library,
   developed at UCSB within the DLI2 and DLI2 programs of the NSF, will be
   used as the foundation of the technical infrastructure to support the
   project. A major aim of the project will be to show that several
   different pedagogic approaches, and a wide variety of data collections
   and teaching resources, can be supported and shared within this common
   infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{The Alexandria Digital Library, together with its follow-on - the
   Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype Project - is one of the flagship
   projects of the NSF/NASA/.... Digital Library Initiative. Uniquely among
   these projects, ADL is a georeferenced library i.e. a library in which
   the principal mode of access to information is by specifying the
   location of the information on the surface of the Earth. The most
   immediate application of this technology is in support of a library of
   maps, aerial photographs and remote sensing images, and ADL is now run
   as an operational service by UCSB's Map and Image Library, one of the
   largest such libraries in the US.
   But the longer term objective is to provide georeferenced search as an
   alternative way of accessing conventional libraries i.e. libraries of
   textual information. With the aid of a natural language parser and the
   ADL gazetteer, the locations (tat, long) of places named in a text can
   be identified. This functionality offers a quantum leap in information
   retrieval performance in the many cases in which locational information
   is involved. For example, it becomes possible to discover documents
   about California, even if the name ``California{''} does not appear
   explicitly in the text. It also offers a foundation technology for the
   concept of the Digital Earth, able to answer questions such as: ``What
   information do you have about this place?{''}
   The primary focus of the ADEPT project, however, is on the development
   of digital learning environments (DLEs) for undergraduate education.
   There are two particularly innovative strands to this research: first,
   the use of digital library technology to provide curated learning and
   teaching resources for the DLEs; and second, a pedagogic approach based
   on an explicit concept model of the chosen field of study. ADEPT has
   naturally chosen Geography as the experimental field of study, but the
   approach is quite general and could be applied to any other field. A
   first course using this approach was given at UCSB in Fall 2003.}},

Abstract = {{The computer and the digital camera provide a unique means for improving
   hematology education, research, and patient service. High quality
   photographic images of gross specimens can be rapidly and conveniently
   acquired with a high-resolution digital camera, and specialized digital
   cameras have been developed for photomicroscopy. Digital cameras utilize
   charge-coupled devices (CCD) or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
   (CMOS) image sensors to measure light energy and additional circuitry to
   convert the measured information into a digital signal. Since digital
   cameras do not utilize photographic film, images are immediately
   available for incorporation into web sites or digital publications,
   printing, transfer to other individuals by email, or other applications.
   Several excellent digital still cameras are now available for less than
   \$2,500 that capture high quality images comprised of more than 6
   megapixels. These images are essentially indistinguishable from
   conventional film images when viewed on a quality color monitor or
   printed on a quality color or black and white printer at sizes up to 11
   x 14 inches. Several recent dedicated digital photomicroscopy cameras
   provide an ultrahigh quality image output of more than 12 megapixels and
   have low noise circuit designs permitting the direct capture of
   darkfield and fluorescence images. There are many applications of
   digital images of pathologic specimens. Since pathology is a visual
   science, the inclusion of quality digital images into lectures, teaching
   handouts, and electronic documents is essential. A few institutions have
   gone beyond the basic application of digital images to developing large
   electronic hematology atlases, animated, audio-enhanced learning
   experiences, multidisciplinary Internet conferences, and other
   innovative applications. Digital images of single microscopic fields
   (single frame images) are the most widely utilized in hematology
   education at this time, but single images of many adjacent microscopic
   fields can be stitched together to prepare ``zoomable{''} panoramas that
   encompass a large part of a microscope slide and closely simulate
   observation through a real microscope. With further advances in computer
   speed and Internet streaming technology, the virtual microscope could
   easily replace the real microscope in pathology education. Later in this
   decade, interactive immersive computer experiences may completely
   revolutionize hematology education and make the conventional lecture and
   laboratory format obsolete. Patient care is enhanced by the transmission

Abstract = {{Globalization and digitalization have been presented as ineluctable
   forces which signal the `death of geography'. The paper takes issue with
   this fashionable narrative. The argument that `geography matters' is
   pursued in three ways: first, by questioning the `distance-destroying'
   capacity of information and communication technologies where social
   depth is conflated with spatial reach; second, by arguing that physical
   proximity may be essential for some forms of knowledge exchange; and
   third, by charting the growth of territorial innovation systems.}},

   broadband Internet access for the mass market (business and
   residential), and will be complementary to other existing means. The
   particular role of R-LANs as an enabler of the broadband options in the
   European Union is investigated. Furthermore, an overview of the main
   technical features of the underlying technologies is given, along with
   an evaluation of some major issues related to the effective use of the
   radio spectrum, especially for the successful penetration of new
   services. In addition various perspectives of market development are
   investigated, which could be essential for the future of the European
   (and of the global) telecommunications industry sector, in particular to
   draw the full benefits of digital technologies and the Internet in terms
   of sustainable growth, increased productivity and competitiveness,
   creation of business and social progress.}},

Abstract = {{The contributions of current agricultural practices to environmental
   degradation and the social problems facing agricultural regions are well
   known. However, landscape-scale alternatives to current trends have not
   been fully explored nor their potential impacts quantified. To address
   this research need, our interdisciplinary team designed three
   alternative future scenarios for two watersheds in Iowa, USA, and used
   spatially-explicit models to evaluate the potential consequences of
   changes in farmland management. This paper summarizes and integrates the
   results of this interdisciplinary research project into an assessment of
   the designed alternatives intended to improve our understanding of
   landscape ecology in agricultural ecosystems and to inform agricultural
   policy. Scenario futures were digitized into a Geographic Information
   System (GIS), visualized with maps and simulated images, and evaluated
   for multiple endpoints to assess impacts of land use change on water
   quality, social and economic goals, and native flora and fauna. The
   Biodiversity scenario, targeting restoration of indigenous biodiversity,
   ranked higher than the current landscape for all endpoints
   (biodiversity, water quality, farmer preference, and profitability). The
   Biodiversity scenario ranked higher than the Production scenario (which
   focused on profitable agricultural production) in all endpoints but
   profitability, for which the two scenarios scored similarly, and also
   ranked higher than the Water Quality scenario in all endpoints except
   water quality. The Water Quality scenario, which targeted improvement in
   water quality, ranked highest of all landscapes in potential water
   quality and higher than the current landscape and the Production
   scenario in all but profitability. Our results indicate that innovative
   agricultural practices targeting environmental improvements may be
   acceptable to farmers and could substantially reduce the environmental
   impacts of agriculture in this region.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the proliferation of digital information accessible over
   networks, significant changes have taken place in library and
   information science (LIS) education during the last decade. To
   understand the changes, the study examined LIS faculty members'
   innovative behavior toward the end of the decade by applying a model of
   adoption that purports that material resources, experiential resources,
   value attributed to the innovation, and communication with adopters
   influence adoption of an innovation. The particular innovation examined
   was a complex, digital information-related innovation. It was termed
   collectively as Internet resource-based value-added processes and
   included the following set of processes that add value to Internet
   resources: (1) selection of Internet resources, (2) organization of
   Internet resources, (3) Internet reference services, (4) interface
   design in digital libraries, and (5) user analysis in digital libraries.
   Survey results indicated that the value LIS faculty attached to the
   innovation was the most influential variable in their decisions in favor
   of early adoption. However, communication between early adopters and
   late adopters in LIS education was found to be weak and not influential
   in the late adopters' decisions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Science has not yet been completely successful in explaining the various
   puzzling but interesting phenomena of congested traffic flows. The
   reasons that these phenomena are poorly understood are mainly due to the
   lack of adequate data needed to develop this theory. Common measurement
   methods collect only `snapshots' of the situation (i.e. at a limited
   number of cross-sections, or a single, instrumented vehicle). Such data
   do not provide sufficient information to study the dynamics of
   individual drivers in their continuously changing traffic and roadway
   environment.
   This paper presents a new innovative traffic data collection system to
   detect and track vehicles from aerial image sequences. Besides the
   longitudinal and lateral positions as a function of time, the system can
   also determine the vehicle lengths and widths. Before vehicle detection
   and tracking can be achieved, the software handles correction for lens
   distortion, radiometric correction, and orthorectification of the image.
   Vehicle detection occurs approximately each tenth of a second, after
   which vehicles are tracked both forward and backward in time (10 frames
   in each direction). The resulting data redundancy is then used to
   improve accuracy and reliability of the traffic data. Post-processing
   furthermore entails using Iterative Extended Kalman filtering to improve
   data quality.
   The software was tested on data collected from a helicopter, using a
   digital camera gathering high-resolution monochrome images of a Dutch
   motorway near the city of Utrecht. From the test, it is concluded that
   the techniques for analyzing the digital images can be applied
   automatically without many problems, while nearly 100\% of all vehicles
   could be detected and tracked.}},

Abstract = {{Corporate Portals (CP) represents an important collaboration software
   advancement that can be used to develop and implement Knowledge
   Management (KM) initiatives. CPs are fundamentally changing how
   information, and collaboration responsibilities are shared in an
   organization: from a narrow, functional and uncoordinated focus to a
   broad, project and collaborative approach. CPs can also be designed and
   deployed to generate connections between people and
   knowledge/information sources (internally and externally). Thus,
   sparking knowledge creation, reuse of documented (explicit) knowledge or
   finding and locating people who can apply their tacit knowledge to
   specific business situations and increasing innovation capabilities
   within an organization. Whereas we acknowledge that information
   technology plays only an enabling role in KM efforts, we also believe
   that it is important for organizations to have a good understanding of
   the technology landscape in order to choose the most appropriate
   solutions to support their KM projects. In this research paper, we will
   discuss, Corporate Portal's in relation to specific KM processes:
   personalization and search; access to information sources in a
   web-friendly environment (from highly unstructured to highly structured
   digital data; internal and external information); communications and
   collaboration; and ease of publishing and access to a vast amount of
   data, information and knowledge. Readers of this research paper will
   have a clearer understanding of the technology landscape and its impact
   on KM and be better prepared to development their own firms' technical
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a novel flat-panel detector with CsI:Tl scintillator.
   The detector consists of a single piece 43cm x 43cm amorphous silicon
   thin-film transistor (TFT) array with MIS
   (metal-insulator-semiconductor) photoelectric converter having a pixel
   pitch of 160mum coated with a needle-like crystal CsI:Tl scintillator.
   Signal chain was totally revised from current detector utilizing an
   innovative sensor technology. The novel detector and current detector
   were equipped to a digital radiography system allowing a quantitative
   and comparative study. Results show that the novel detector has a linear
   response covering the radiographic exposure range. It has a moderate
   modulation transfer function (MTF) sufficient to the radiography tasks
   and effective to suppress the aliasing. The detective quantum efficiency
   (DQE) was almost twice than the current detector. The result of
   contrast-detail phantom exposed with a 1/2x dose level is equivalent to
   that of current detector with a 1x dose level. These results show that
   performance of novel detector is superior to and expected to reduce the
   patient dose in half than current detector due to higher DQE and
   innovative sensor technology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the accuracy and precision of RSA analysis using a GE
   Innova(TM) 4100 digital flat panel and a Siemens Multistar x-ray image
   intensifier (XRII) were evaluated and compared with that of a
   conventional film-screen system, in order to explore the possibility of
   real-time kinematic and dynamic RSA study. A phantom, having two rigid
   body segments with no movement, was constructed and imaged by the
   digital flat panel, XRII and conventional screen-film systems,
   respectively. The acquired images were measured and motions were
   derived. The mean and standard deviation of the repeated results were
   analyzed to determine the accuracy and precision, respectively.
   Comparing all three axes, the lowest rotational accuracy and precision
   were 0.008 +/- 0.011degrees, 0.013 +/- 0.015degrees and 0.006 +/-
   0.05degrees while the lowest translational accuracy and precision were
   25 +/- 28 mum, 17 +/- 37 mum and 4 +/- 6 mum for the film-screen, XRII
   and digital flat panel, respectively. The evaluation of the accuracy and
   precision of the RSA in this study confirms its place as a highly
   accurate method. The study shows that both digital flat panel and XRII
   systems have potential application to the kinematics and dynamics joint
   study.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing interest, for light and movable electronic systems, cell
   phones and small digital devices, drives the technological research
   toward integrated regenerating power sources with small dimensions and
   great autonomy. Conventional batteries are already unable to deliver
   power in more and more shrunk volumes maintaining the requirements of
   long duration and lightweight. A possible solution to overcome these
   limits is the use of miniaturized fuel cell. The fuel cell offers a
   greater gravimetric energy density compared to conventional batteries.
   The micromachining technology of silicon is an important tool to reduce
   the fuel cell structure to micrometer sizes. The use of silicon also
   gives the opportunity to integrate the power source and the electronic
   circuits controlling the fuel cell on the same structure. This paper
   reports preliminary results concerning the micromachining procedure to
   fabricate an arrays of microchannels for a Si-based electrocatalytic
   membrane for miniaturized Si-based proton exchange membrane fuel cells.
   Several techniques are routinely used to fabricate arrays of
   microchannels embedded in crystalline silicon. In this paper we present
   an innovative microchannel formation process, entirely based on surface
   silicon micromachining, which allows us to produce rhomboidal
   microchannels embedded on (100) silicon wafers. Compared to the
   traditional techniques, the proposed process is extremely compatible
   with the standard microelectronics silicon technology. The kinetics of
   rhomboidal microchannel formation is monitored by cyclic voltammetry
   measurements and the results are compared with a detailed structural
   characterisation performed by scanning electron microscopy. The
   effectiveness of this process is discussed in view of the possible
   applications in the fuel cell application.}},

Abstract = {{At the Department of Physics of the University of Bologna a new
   intensified linear array detector is under development. The core of the
   system is a digital intensified CCD camera, the electron bombarded
   charge coupled device (EBCCD). The main innovation is a coherent
   rectangular-to-linear fiber optics adapter coupling the 1 in. diameter
   photocathode of the camera with a linear 129 mm x 1.45 mm strip of
   GdG(2)O(2) S:Tb. In this way a high spatial resolution over an extended
   length is obtained. The detector works as an X-ray scanner by means of a
   high-precision translation mechanical device to inspect a 13 cm x 18 cm
   area. A complete characterisation of the system has been made in terms
   of linearity, dynamic range, modulation transfer function (MTF), noise
   power spectrum (NPS) and detective quantum efficiency (DQE). At last,
   radiographic tests on a set of samples have been made and will be
   presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, Field Programma le Gate Arrays (FPGA) has
   significantly influenced the landscape of the electronic industry. hi
   particular, in the areas of semiconductor manufacturing, CAD tool
   designs and a wide range of digital logic applications. Primarily,
   research efforts in the FPGA community have concentrated on improving
   the reconfigurability or programmability of present day architecture for
   digital applications. However, the digital nature of FPGA technologies
   limits their applicability to a wide range of applications that depend
   on analog circuitry, photonic and RF based technologies. As with any
   ASIC design, the turn-around time between design iterations may be
   several months which is prohibitively long for multi-technology test-bed
   systems where the system designer depends on a rapid
   prototyping/experimentation environment that allows for optimization of
   processing algorithms and system architecture. Therefore, we developed
   innovative FPGA architecture that merges conventional FPGA technology
   with mixed signal and other multi-technology device. In this paper we
   discuss the Multi-Technology-FPGA (MT-FPGA) architecture that allows the
   user to have flexible rapid prototyping environment and provides him or
   her with the benefits of a conventional FPGA in a mixed signal domain.
   We substantiate this concept by implementing this architecture in TSMC
   0.35 mum process and discussing the results of a variable threshold
   optical receiver circuit suitable for photonic information processing.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the study and implementation of a three-phase
   three-level preregulator rectifier with digital control using a DSP. A
   synchronizing circuit (DPLL - Digital Phase Locked Loop) tracks
   continuously the fundamental frequency of the system voltage. This
   digital PLL circuit determines the frequency and phase angle of the
   fundamental positive-sequence component of the measured signals to the
   phase voltages. The converter structure has a common capacitive center
   point that allows the three-level operation and a low blocking-voltage
   stress on the power switches (half of dc-link voltage). The reduction of
   blocking voltage allows the use of low cost and low losses power
   devices, increasing the efficiency and the power density with reduced
   production cost. The control technique used aims to obtain power factor
   correction (PFC), regulated, and balanced output voltages. With the
   advance of DSP controllers, digital control is increasingly used in
   power converts systems and offers a number of advantages like more
   flexibility in modification code and less sensitive to noise. However,
   sampling time delay, resolution of AID converter, word length of DSP and
   instructions cycle time are disadvantages over analog control. Nowadays,
   control optimized DSP's deliver high performance, great code efficiency
   and optimal peripheral integration for the digital control with high
   level on-chip integration to deliver system cost reduction, and powerful
   computational abilities that enable software innovation then reducing
   disadvantages of a digital control. The DSP used is the ADMC401 from
   ANALOG DEVICES.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   The purpose of this paper is to describe the meaning and the challenges
   of verification and validation (V\&V) in the fast cycle electronics
   product development. In addition, some practical ideas of how to improve
   the efficiency of V\&V in the high volume mobile terminal development
   are presented.
   Introduction
   Market share, average sales price and profit margins are the key drivers
   in the cellular terminal business. We can easier meet these goals by
   launching more new and innovative models than competitors, that means
   all the time shorter and shorter design cycles. The mobile terminal
   business is moving towards more demanding digital convergence business
   with changing requirements related to product performance, closer
   customer involvement, and usage of more subcontracting. This change in
   the business environment has increased the importance of efficient
   product creation processes including V\&V.
   Contributions
   This study is mostly based on author's several years of practical
   experience in the electronics products development industry as Design
   Engineer and also as Process Development Manager. In this paper, we
   introduce verification methods where analysis, including mathematical
   models and simulation, and testing are combined in optimum. This study
   is based on the appliance of the iterative design models.
   Key Conclusions
   Right timing and integrating verification \& validation as part of the
   design work can improve the whole product development effort remarkably
   including product development cost and time-to-market. Verification can
   be done, even without having a physical sample available, by analysis,
   comparison, and assessment, which are often more cost efficient methods
   than physical testing {[}Gilb \& Graham 1993].}},

Abstract = {{In this paper one introduces an innovative attitude propagation system
   for remote sensing satellites based on a series of overlapped images
   taken from a digital camera on the satellite. The system aims to relief
   the ground control software from the need of identifying landmarks in
   every payload image and is not based on the expensive and sensitive gyro
   technology. The attitude propagation procedure starts by fitting a space
   correlation model to the first image of the series. Then the
   ``kriging{''} technique is used to predict the next image of the series,
   as a function of its position and attitude small shifts. The attitude
   shift is such that the predicted image matches the next taken image. The
   accuracy of the procedure is evaluated by digital simulation with
   realistic Earth's surface patterns. Numerical results are presented as a
   function of the image resolution. They give a preliminary idea about the
   system feasibility envisaging its experimental implementation in space.}},

Abstract = {{A new and innovative method to measure the eye movement in a wireless
   manner was proposed. We verified the feasibility of our idea by
   fabrication and performance test of a prototype system. The prototype
   system consisted of a contact lens with a ring-shaped thin magnet, and
   eyeglasses frame-shaped PCB with analog/digital signal processing
   circuitry as well as four magnetoresistive sensors. This new method
   based on the magnetic contact lens sensing technique (MCLST) is expected
   to overcome all the disadvantages of the existing techniques.}},

   topology and shape generation, performance evaluation ( including
   structural analysis) and simulated annealing optimization to search for
   beneficial designs in highly constrained and multiobjective situations.
   Through the design of a digital canopy in Amsterdam and a novel noon m
   ark cantilever support, which has been recently built in Londons, the
   capability of STSA will be illustrated and validated.}},

Abstract = {{Stantec was hired by Duke Energy to complete a feasibility study for
   restoring the Tuckasegee River to more natural conditions following the
   proposed removal of the Dillsboro Dam. Two specific questions regarding
   restoration of the river following dam removal were asked: How will the
   river look? and How will the river sound? The first question was
   answered by using an innovative approach involving digital photo
   renderings. The digital image showed what the Tuckasegee River would
   look like after the removal of Dillsboro Dam. Stantec used a large
   number of digital images taken at various locations along the river. The
   digital photo of the actual dam was altered to show how the site might
   look before and after the restoration of the river. The question of how
   it would sound was answered using a standard traffic sound meter. Sound
   readings were taken at various locations along the river. Duke Energy
   made releases from upstream dams to allow for sound measurement under
   both high and low flow conditions. With the readings, Stantec was able
   to determine the sound would be similar before and after dam removal the
   restoration of the river.
   In addition to answering these questions, Stantec developed a conceptual
   design based on a Rosgen Level III assessment of the Tuckasegee River.
   The assessment evaluated the river's cross sections, longitudinal
   profiles of the water surface and channel thalweg, and characterization
   of the bed material above and below the dam. Stantec developed a
   conceptual design for the restoration that included the following:
   creation of a ``W{''} weir at the location of the dam; narrowing of the
   channel; and stabilization of the new banks. This design was used to
   answer the specific questions raised by local stakeholders regarding the
   proposed dam removal.
   Duke Energy has yet to make a decision whether to proceed with the
   removal of the Dillsboro Dam and restoration of the Tuckasegee River.
   The decision will depend on the results of negotiations related to the
   relicensing of hydroelectric projects on the Nantahala system. If
   project proceeds, it will be only the third dam removal project carried
   out in the State of North Carolina.}},

Abstract = {{Two major criteria are currently used in human assisted reproductive
   technologies (ART) to evaluate oocyte and preimplantation embryo health:
   (1) rate of preimplantation embryonic development; and (2) overall
   morphology. A major gene that regulates the rate of preimplantation
   development is the preimplantation embryo development (Ped) gene,
   discovered in our laboratory. In mice, presence of the Ped gene product,
   Qa-2 protein, results in a fast rate of preimplantation embryonic
   development, compared with a slow rate of preimplantation embryonic
   development for embryos that are lacking Qa-2 protein. Moreover, mice
   that express Qa-2 protein have an overall reproductive advantage that
   extends beyond the preimplantation period, including higher survival to
   birth, higher birthweight, and higher survival to weaning. Data are
   presented that suggest that Qa-2 increases the rate of development of
   early embryos by acting as a cell-signalling molecule and that
   phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase is involved in the cell-signalling
   pathway. The most likely human homologue of Qa-2 has recently been
   identified as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G. Data are presented which
   show that HLA-G, like Qa-2, is located in lipid rafts, implying that
   HLA-G also acts as a signalling molecule. In order to better evaluate
   the second criterion used in ART (i.e. overall morphology), a unique and
   innovative imaging microscope has been constructed, the Keck 3-D fusion
   microscope (Keck 3DFM). The Keck 3DFM combines five different
   microscopic modes into a single platform, allowing multi-modal imaging
   of the specimen. One of the modes, the quadrature tomographic microscope
   (QTM), creates digital images of non-stained transparent cells by
   measuring changes in the index of refraction. Quadrature tomographic
   microscope images of oocytes and preimplantation mouse embryos are
   presented for the first time. The digital information from the QTM
   images should allow the number of cells in a preimplantation embryo to
   be counted non-invasively. The Keck 3DFM is also being used to assess
   mitochondrial distribution in mouse oocytes and embryos by using the
   k-means clustering algorithm. Both the number of cells in
   preimplantation embryos and mitochondrial distribution are related to
   oocyte and embryo health. New imaging data obtained from the Keck 3DFM,
   combined with genetic and biochemical approaches, have the promise of
   being able to distinguish healthy from unhealthy oocytes and embryos in
   a non-invasive manner. The goal is to apply the information from our
   mouse model system to the clinic in order to identify one and only one
   healthy embryo for transfer back to the mother undergoing an ART
   procedure. This approach has the potential to increase the success rate
   of ART and to decrease the high, and undesirable, multiple birth rate
   presently associated with ART.}},

   propose a conceptual model for annotations in order to develop an

Abstract = {{In the area of machining, laborsaving and automation are comparatively
   realized mainly by the contribution of NC machine tools so far. However,
   conventional NC machine tools are not autonomous and intelligent because
   they don't have any feedback mechanisms during machining operations.
   Therefore, in order to realize dynamic product planning for an
   innovative autonomous machine tool, it is indispensable that machine
   tools have feedback mechanism to adapt cutting parameters to monitoring
   information. As a matter of course, it is needed for the mechanism to
   include a function of tool path generation in real time. Because the
   real time tool path generation can perform to change not only feed speed
   but also depth of cut during an operation. In this paper, digital copy
   milling system that can generate tool paths in real time is developed by
   applying the traditional copy milling principle. And also, machining
   strategy is proposed to adapt cutting parameters considering cutting
   load, and integrated into the digital copy milling. Feedback machining
   control can be realized using the digital copy milling system with the
   proposed machining strategy. Furthermore, in order to achieve dynamic
   product planning, an automatic function of product planning is added by
   customizing commercial CAD software. By using this automatic planning
   system, even in case of a cutting trouble, it is possible to reschedule
   product planning immediately. Autonomous machining based on dynamic
   product planning can enable to realize high flexibility and high
   durability in machining operations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Change from tangible and place bound production to more flexible
   production of intangible information goods has challenged traditional
   ways of organising production. Innovative operating, models-have brought
   up also new logics of doing business, therefore one might suggest that
   it is not always clear which is the cause and which is the effect. The
   attention on general discussion is often on the nature of the product,
   yet at least as interesting is the meta-level, i.e. how the value is
   created.
   The aim of the paper is to examine different operating models, i.e. ways
   to define operating environment. The focus is on the different models of
   competitiveness or how end-Users are served and functionality of media
   service is maintained. The paper contributes to discussion on sufficient
   and sound ways to organise knowledge intensive value creating
   activities. Reflections to practice are made by examining two cases of

Abstract = {{in a global economy, successful organizations constantly use innovative
   manufacturing methodologies to stay competitive in business. Among
   others, simulation is a tool which offers interesting perspectives from
   the manufacturing system optimization point of view. However, when a
   simulation model becomes large, and the entire model is simulated at a
   high level of detail or resolution, computing power tends to become a
   bottleneck. As a result, if the model is large it is seldom possible to
   calculate/simulate it in real time. Real time simulation is desirable if
   an interactive analysis of the manufacturing system is required within
   virtual environments. Secondly, in a virtual environment a user can view
   only a part of the simulation model. Hence, in our approach only this
   part is simulated in high resolution with high effort of computing
   power. The parts of the model, the user ignored or cannot view, are
   simulated on a rough level. Consequently, if the user moves, the area
   which is simulated in high resolution also moves with the user. This way
   he gets an impression of a simulation in high resolution. This also
   enables the user to analyze large simulations in real-time.
   In this paper, we illustrate a method for detecting the user attention
   based on modeling approach. These detections will stimulate adjustments
   in the level of detail. After an adjustment the starting state of the
   newly activated models have to be generated. Methods to do this are
   shown. Most of these methods have been implemented in our simulation
   tool d(3) FACT INSIGHT. Then, a short example of a multiresolution
   material flow simulation is shown followed by conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative holographic imaging technique is applied in
   characterization of MEMS switch non-linear dynamics. The Duffing's
   non-linear oscillator based phenomenological model was adopted to study
   MEMS switch non-linear response due to the complicated contact phenomena
   and corresponding boundary conditions. An experimental contact
   measurement result of MEMS cantilever response that matches theoretical
   trends is provided. Non-destructive contact measurements were performed
   by means of quantitative nanomechnical test instruments. Non-contact
   holographic characterization method yielded results comparable with
   phenomenological model and contact measurements. The proposed
   holographic characterization method consists of digitized holographic
   measurements enhanced by the FEW eigenvector problem solution. Two cases
   were analyzed for simple and perturbated sinusoidal excitations that,.
   correspond to the free and contact boundary conditions; respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Electroactive polymers (EAPs) are capable of converting energy in the
   form of electric charge and voltage to mechanical force and movement and
   vice versa. Several electroactive polymer actuator materials whose
   responses are controlled by external electric fields, e.g.
   poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) based fluoroterpolymers,
   have generated considerable interest for use in applications such as
   artificial muscles, sensors, parasitic energy capture, and integrated
   bio-microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS) due to their high
   electric-field induced strain, high elastic modulus, high
   electromechanical coupling and high frequency operation, etc. The
   combination of micro-optics and MEMS, referred to as
   micro-opto-electromechanical systems (MOEMS), makes a new opportunity
   for innovation in the EAP field. There is a lot of pioneering work on
   optical beam deflection by electromechanically driven digital
   micromirrors. In this paper we describe a flexible polymer deformable
   micromirror (PDM) light-valve technology based on high-performance
   electroactive polymer materials and microactuators for high-quality
   electronic projection display and imaging systems. The excellent
   electromechanical properties of these electroactive polymer
   microactuators greatly improve the electro-optical properties of the
   deformable micromirrors and light valves, e.g., optical switching
   behaviour, deformation amplitude and contrast, and low-voltage and
   high-frequency operation. The material selection, device fabrication,
   characterization, and a theoretical analysis using the finite element
   analysis code will be investigated. This technology is compatible with
   CMOS technology for an active matrix addressing on a chip.
   High-resolution phase-modulating polymer light valves may, permit a lot
   of future applications, and electroactive polymer micromachining lends
   flexibility to displays application.}},

Abstract = {{As computing and communications technologies evolve, there is the
   potential for new forms of digitally orchestrated interactive narratives
   to emerge. In this process, balanced attention has to be paid to
   audience experience, creative constraints, and presence and role of the
   enabling technology. This paper describes the implementation of
   HopStory, an interactive, location-based narrative distributed in space
   and time, which was designed with this balance in mind. In HopStory,
   cinematic media is housed within wireless sculptures distributed
   throughout a building. The audience, through physical contact with a
   sculpture, collects scenes for later viewing. Inspired by the history of
   the installation space the narrative relates a day in the life of four
   characters. By binding the story to local time and space and inviting
   the audience to wander, we amplify the meaning and impact of the
   HopStory content and introduce an innovative approach to a
   day-in-the-life story structure.}},

Abstract = {{The paper addresses spatial patterns of innovation and partnership in
   innovation processes in the Netherlands, building on the Netherlands'
   part of the Community Innovation Survey, conducted by Statistics
   Netherlands. Innovation is analysed from a system perspective,
   addressing both input factors (education levels of human resources and
   R\&D), throughput factors (partnership with regionally, nationally and
   internationally based partners) and output factors (results in terms of
   the launching of new products on the market and/or the implementation of
   new processes in production). Our descriptive analyses at detailed
   spatial levels (four-digit postal code areas) provide indications that
   the relation between input factors and results of innovation processes
   is highly differentiated across regions. Furthermore, international
   connectivity seems to be strongly connected to the results of innovation
   processes, whereas the relation between regional clustering and
   innovative output appears rather weak.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper concepts and results in Digital Human Modelling within the
   automotive enterprise are described. It will be shown, how targets like
   reduction of health based lack, selection and best-fit practises for
   tools and supporting elements, i.e. jigs or fixtures, as well as
   logistical devices integration and adaptation on ergonomic view can be
   easier achieved within innovative digital solutions. Furthermore, the
   integration of such technologies leads also to relevant improvements in
   optimising and balancing production processes and in increasing
   productivity and product-assembly. Within the methods described in this
   paper an opportunity for rectifying enterprise-intern ergonomic
   regulations in planning assembly tasks will be offered. Exemplary
   shop-floor personal activities within the automotive production have
   been analysed and evaluated according to international standards, like
   RULA, in order to recognize hazardous statically and dynamically
   postures. The obtained results were compared with the specific
   automotive enterprise requirements, in order to underlie
   con-/divergences. The first 3D simulation tests have shown high
   performance and adaptability motivating, thus, to investigate further
   exemplar assembly activities in order to eventually transfer the
   achieved results to the real assembly plants.}},

   evidence and trust in an autonomic communications and computing
   environment. A combination of security, privacy enhancing technologies,
   trustworthy computing interfaces and techniques, advocacy, and greater
   understanding of the socio-economic and technical aspects of this new
   electronic phenomena must be covered to establish a sound e-business
   operating environment on a global level. Some possible solutions
   pertaining to this environment are also reviewed and examples of some
   key research areas outlined. Finally a brief overview of directions for

Abstract = {{The Mastrit Skin project intends to develop two new technologies in two
   consecutive phases: Stage 1, a device to capture and catalogue in an
   automatic way defects on worked skins providing leather digital maps
   with measurable quality parameters and Stage 2, a B2B platform capable
   of providing new services such as the e-procurement and the nesting of
   leather. The proposed device to be developed, MSkin Intelligent Quality
   Control System, is composed of three main elements: 1) the Leather
   Quality Reference Model, 2) the Modular Acquisition System and 3) the IT
   system (the database and leather e-configurator). The integration of
   these components into a unique product and its launch to the market is
   planned to be accomplished by the MSkin co-engineering network. This
   collaborative net will merge different SME's competencies in order to
   design, manufacture and sell in the best efficient way the innovative
   MSkin Intelligent Quality Control System (iQCS). The current paper will
   describe: the MSkin Collaborative Net strategy, the market analysis
   realized, the proposed business model and the core business processes to
   be carried out to develop and launch the proposed new technology. The
   prototype of the MSkin Intelligent Quality Control System is planned to
   be delivered in June 2006, so the formation and integration of the
   network should be accomplished during the same period of time to deliver
   the expected results.}},

Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{The boom-to-bust cycle for Internet start-ups has been remarkably
   compressed. This article reports on a longitudinal study of eight
   industries which found that only 43\% of independent B2B exchanges
   survived in the two years following Spring 2000. Most of these start-ups
   failed because they misdiagnosed their advantage over existing ways of
   doing business. In reality, the Internet is mainly about re-formed
   applications that facilitate interactions and squeeze costs but do not
   change the basic structure and functioning of existing markets.
   incumbents prevail when a technological disruption re-forms an existing
   market rather than completely redefining industry boundaries and norms.
   Building on the lessons of past industry shakeouts, this article
   suggests that the prospective winners in digital markets will be found
   in three camps: adaptive survivors who find a protected niche by
   retooling their strategy for reformed markets; acquisitive incumbents
   who acquire the assets of pure-play companies at steep discounts; and
   pure play start-ups that capitalize on their early mover advantages in
   breakthrough markets.}},

Abstract = {{The biomedical sciences are a rapidly changing discipline that have
   adapted to innovative technological advances. Despite these many
   advances, we face two major challenges: a) the number of experts in the
   field is vastly outnumbered by the number of students, many of whom are
   separated geographically or temporally and b) the teaching methods used
   to instruct students and learners have not changed. Today's students
   have adapted to technology - they use the web as a source of information
   and communicate via email and chat rooms. Teaching in the biomedical
   sciences should adopt these new information technologies (IT), but has
   thus far faded to capitalize on technological opportunity. Creating a
   ``digital textbook{''} of the traditional learning material is not
   sufficient for dynamic processes such as cellular physiology. This paper
   describes innovative teaching techniques that incorporate familiar IT
   and high-quality interactive learning content with user-centric
   instruction design models. The Virtual Labs Project from Stanford
   University has created effective interactive online teaching modules in
   physiology (simPHYSIO) and delivered them over broadband networks to
   their undergraduate and medical students. Evaluation results of the
   modules are given as a measure of success of such innovative teaching
   method. This learning media strategically merges IT innovations with
   pedagogy to produce user-driven animations of processes and engaging
   interactive simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The drive for cost reduction has led to the use of CMOS technology in
   the implementation of highly integrated radios. This paper presents a
   single-chip 5-GHz fully integrated direct conversion transceiver for
   IEEE 802.11a WLAN systems, manufactured in 0.18-mum CMOS. The IC
   features an innovative system architecture which takes advantage of the
   computing resources of the digital companion chip in order to eliminate
   I/Q mismatch and achieve accurately matched baseband filters. The
   integrated voltage-controlled oscillator and synthesizer achieve an
   integrated phase noise of less than 0.8degrees rms. The receiver has an
   overall noise figure of 5.2 dB and achieves sensitivity of -75 dBm at
   54-Mb/s operation, both referred to the IC input. The transmit error
   vector magnitude is -33 dB at -5-dBm output power from the integrated
   power-amplifier driver amplifier. The transceiver occupies an area of
   18.5 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with jitter measurement in telecommunication networks
   based on plesiochronous (PDH) or synchronous (SDH) digital hierarchies.
   The attention is mostly focused on PDH/SDH analysers compliant to the
   ITU-T recommendations, the accuracy of which seems to be unsatisfying
   for both designers and manufacturers. Trying to give an answer to this
   problem, a digital signal-processing method was already proposed by the
   author. It succeeded in improving jitter measurement accuracy by
   avoiding the use of timing recovery circuitry, always needed, on the
   contrary, in the aforementioned analysers.
   The method is here optimised with the aim both of automating jitter
   performance test of network elements that operate at the PDH bit rate of
   140 Mbit/s and the SDH bit rate of 155 Mbit/s, and further enhancing the
   accuracy on jitter estimates. In particular, an innovative procedure for
   automatically recovering the binary information conveyed by the jittered
   signal under analysis is introduced, and a proper strategy for carrying
   out instantaneous jitter measurements at uniform time intervals is
   developed.
   After a brief outline of the old version of the method, the proposed
   enhancements are described in detail. Then, the performance of the
   optimised method is assessed through many laboratory tests on emulated
   signals, the results of which are given and discussed. At the end, the
   outcomes of real automatic tests, conducted on PDH/SDH-based equipment
   produced by Marconi Sad S.p.A., are also presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Information technology (IT) innovation can be defined as the creation
   and new organizational application of digital computer and communication
   technologies. The paper suggests that IT innovation theory needs to be
   expanded to analyze IT innovations in kind that exhibit atypical
   discontinuities in IT innovation behaviors by studying two questions.
   First, can a model of disruptive IT innovations be created to understand
   qualitative changes in IT development processes and their outcomes so
   that they can be related to architectural discontinuities in computing
   capability? Second, to what extent can the observed turmoil among
   systems development organizations that has been spawned by Internet
   computing be understood as a disruptive IT innovation?
   To address the first question, a model of disruptive IT innovation is
   developed. The model defines a disruptive IT innovation as an
   architectural innovation originating in the information technology base
   that has subsequent pervasive and radical impacts on development
   processes and their outcomes. These base innovations establish necessary
   but not sufficient conditions for subsequent innovation behaviors. To
   address the second question, the impact of Internet computing on eight
   leading-edge systems development organizations in the United States and
   Finland is investigated. The study shows that the adoption of Internet
   computing in these firms has radically impacted their IT innovation both
   in development processes and services.}},

Abstract = {{Although the hardware platform is often seen as the most important
   element of real-time imaging systems, software optimization can also
   provide remarkable reduction of overall computational costs. The
   recommended code development flow for digital signal processors based on
   the TMS320C6000(TM) architecture usually involves three phases:
   development of C code, refinement of C code, and programming linear
   assembly code. Each step requires a different level of knowledge of
   processor internals. The developer is not directly involved in the
   automatic scheduling process. In some cases, however, this may result in
   unacceptable code performance. A better solution can be achieved by
   scheduling the assembly code by hand. Unfortunately, scheduling of
   software pipelines by hand not only requires expert skills but is also
   time consuming, and moreover, prone to errors. To overcome these
   drawbacks we have designed an innovative development tool-the Software
   Pipeline Optimization Tool (SPOT(TM)). The SPOT is based on
   visualization of the scheduled assembly code by a two-dimensional
   interactive schedule editor, which is equipped with feedback mechanisms
   deduced from analysis of data dependencies and resource allocation
   conflicts. The paper addresses optimization techniques available by the
   application of the SPOT. Furthermore, the benefit of the SPOT is
   documented by more than 20 optimized image processing algorithms. (C)

Abstract = {{Americans' views on racial issues are regularly captured in sample
   surveys. The survey interviews themselves, however, may not be neutral
   measurement tools, and indeed may reflect the racial tensions existing
   in society. The answers given to an interviewer of one race may differ
   from those given to an interviewer of another This study incorporates
   innovative technological advances to overcome methodological
   shortcomings in existing studies. We contrast live interviewers with
   ``virtual{''} interviewers, using a computer-assisted self-interviewing
   system that displays digital videos of interviewers. We administered a
   series of survey items on race and race-related issues to both African
   American and white respondents, using both black and white interviewers,
   in a controlled laboratory setting. Results varied by question topic.
   Where effects occurred, African Americans provided less liberal racial
   attitudes to white interviewers in both the live and the virtual
   condition. For some categories of questions, however, whites gave more
   racially conservative responses to the virtual black interviewer than to
   the virtual white interviewer; this suggests an effect of stereotype
   activation rather than of social presence.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To report repair and reconstruction of massively damaged burn
   wounds under unusual condition. Methods: One hundred forty-eight
   patients with deep burn tissue defects admitted from January 1993
   through December 2000 were analyzed, among them 96 patients suffered
   from electrical injury which constituted 65.3\% of all cases, 18
   patients with hot press injury, 18 cases with deep burns as a result of
   CO poisoning or epileptic seizure, accounting for 12.2 and 12.2\%,
   respectively, 6 cases with radiation injury, comprising 4.0\% of all
   cases, 2 cases with explosive injury, 2 cases with chemical burn and 6
   cases caused by erosive chemicals and wound infection. One hundred
   seventy-six flaps were transferred with mostly local flaps to repair
   deep burn wounds in 148 patients with tissue defects, in which necrotic
   tendons were replaced by acellular allogeneic tendons simultaneously in
   seven cases. Sixty-one iliolumbar arterial axial skin flaps for coverage
   of soft-tissue defects in hands or wrists were transplanted. Technical
   innovations to repair large soft-tissue defects of temporal region and
   ear, chin and lip, and dorso-lateral aspect of foot due to deep burn
   were explored. New technics to define necrotic tissue and vascular
   damage as a result of electrical injury were developed. Results: The
   biggest dimension of flaps in this group was 22 cm x 30 cm. The survival
   rate of flap was 96.5\%, while necrosis of the tip of flap occurred in
   3.5\%. The function and configuration were satisfactory after 4 months
   to 8 years follow-up. The technique of 99Tcm-methylene di-phosphonate
   (99Tcm-MDP) scintigraphy helped identify necrotic tissue before
   operation, and with the help of digital subtraction arteriogram (DSA)
   arterial injury could be identified. B-mode ultrasound was helpful to
   show the extent of endothelial injury, and Colour Doppler was useful to
   show luminal blood flow signal and filling defect in the injured artery.
   Conclusions: Repair and reconstruction of massively damaged burn wound
   at early stage could be achieved. Techniques which helped define the
   extent of damage to the soft tissues, including arteries and tendons
   were essential preoperatively for successful reconstruction. Functional
   and aesthetic reconstruction, as well as the general condition of the
   patients, could thus be significantly improved early after the
   devastating injuries. Further innovations of operative technics would
   benefit more patients with such injuries. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the relationship between place and individualised
   creativity in micro and small enterprises within the creative
   industries. The paper uses the findings from qualitative interviews with
   workers in the craft metalwork and digital design sectors of the
   creative industries in the UK to analyse how the perceived attributes of
   a location may provide inspiration in the creative process. Current
   spatial theory on the creative industries has emphasised both collective
   creativity and ways in which clusters of creative enterprises in
   particular places can promote creativity. This paper analyses the
   empirical evidence obtained in the interviews and argues that the links
   between place and creativity can be important and influential in the
   creative process and that current theory needs to be extended to take
   greater account of individual creativity and the ways in which the
   attributes of localities can be used as a catalyst for individual
   creativity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Techniques are proposed to dramatically reduce the impact of
   quantization noise in DeltaSigma fractional-N synthesizers, thereby
   improving the existing tradeoff between phase noise and bandwidth that
   exists in these systems. The key innovation is the introduction of new
   techniques to overcome nonidealities in a phase-frequency detector
   (PFD)/digital-to-analog converter (DAC) structure, which combines the
   functionality of both phase detector and cancellation DAC into a single
   element. The proposed architecture achieves better gain matching between
   the phase-error signal and cancellation DAC than offered by previous
   approaches. Dynamic element matching techniques are introduced to
   mitigate the effects of PFD/DAC unit element and timing mismatch on
   synthesizer phase noise performance. We present behavioral simulations
   of an example application of this technique that demonstrates 36-dB
   reduction in broad-band quantization-induced phase noise with the use of
   a 7-b PFD/DAC. Simulations further demonstrate that fractional spurs are
   rejected to levels < -90 dBc when a low-cost, low-overhead digital gain
   correction technique is employed.}},

Abstract = {{Terms such as ``digital divide,{''} normally understood to mean the gap
   in access between technologically disenfranchised populations and the
   information elite, take on a different resonance when the focus of
   university faculty, administrators, and an increasing number of
   potential students is on how education is to be conducted. This paper
   discusses the pedagogical, technological, and business trends that
   together affect the direction of innovation in virtual education. A
   discussion is presented on how traditional higher education
   (campus-based, lecture-bound, and faculty-driven) can benefit from the
   explosion of opportunities born of technological innovation and
   development by adopting changes in operational models-both
   administrative and pedagogical. Also addressed are the scope of services
   that comprise the engagement of information technology in academic
   environments necessary to fulfill evolving charters and missions that
   respond to current trends and future demands of educational innovations
   in the digital age where education and business-in their operational
   models and management styles-are moving toward complementary, even
   comparable strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increasing interest among researchers and practitioners in the
   field of Internet commerce, significant controversy remains regarding
   the large incumbent versus nimble newcomer dynamic. This paper explores
   issues related to firm age and size and the firm's propensity to engage
   in Internet-enabled process digitization by conducting an empirical
   investigation based on a sample of 150 firms in the magazine publishing
   industry. Results suggest that (a) differences exist as a function of
   firm age and size in the degree and manner in which firms digitize
   business processes through the Internet, (b) Internet-enabled
   digitization of business processes is associated with both strategies of
   innovation and of low cost, and (c) the digitization-strategy
   relationship is stronger for new versus established firms and for
   smaller versus larger firms. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{We have developed an innovative application of high-precision geologic
   mapping with an electronic total station to assess the potential for
   seismic surface rupture in areas of Los Alamos National Laboratory
   (LANL). Our method of total station mapping enables recognition of
   secondary faults, with as little as 30 cm of vertical displacement that
   are not exposed at the surface, have no topographic expression, and
   would otherwise likely go unnoticed. It has been applied to preclude the
   presence of faulting in large areas (several km(2)) of proposed and
   existing critical facilities at LANL. The method involves surveying of
   points on geologic features, and detailed computer-aided and field
   analyses of anomalies in the elevations of surveyed points. We examine
   vertical anomalies in elevations that are the result of dominantly
   normal and reverse faulting; however, the method could also be applied
   to strike-slip faulting. Surveying of geologic contacts allows for easy
   integration of geologic data into a Geographical Information System
   (GIS) and detailed 3D analysis of small-scale structures. Field data are
   analyzed in profiles, 3D surface diagrams, and maps that are constructed
   with a variety of commercially available software packages. We apply the
   method to delineate volcanic map-unit boundaries in the
   1.2-million-year-old Tshirege Member of the Bandelier Tuff to
   characterize portions of the Pajarito fault system. The ability of this
   method to identify faults with very small displacements that otherwise
   might be unrecognizable allows for discrimination of varying styles of
   deformation, decreases in displacement along strike through splaying
   into many smaller faults, monoclinal flexures, and cross structures
   between faults. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Software stopping rules are tools to effectively minimize the time and
   cost involved in software testing. The algorithms serve to guide the
   testing process such that if a certain level of branch or fault (or
   failure) coverage is obtained without the expectation of further
   significant coverage, then the testing strategy can be stopped or
   changed to accommodate further, more advanced testing strategies. By
   combining cost analysis with a variety of stopping-rule algorithms, a
   comparison can be made to determine an optimally cost-effective stopping
   point. A novel cost-effective stopping rule using empirical Bayesian
   principles for a nonhomogeneous Poisson counting process compounded with
   logarithmic-series distribution (LSD) is derived and satisfactorily
   applied to digital software testing and verification. It is assumed that
   the software failures or branches covered, whichever the case may be,
   clustered at the application of a given test-case are positively
   correlated, i.e., contagious, implying that the occurrence of one
   software failure (or coverage of a branch) positively influences the
   occurrence of the next. This phenomenon of clustering of software
   failures or branch coverage is often observed in software testing
   practice. The r.v. w(i) of the failure-clump size of the interval is
   assumed to have LSD(theta) and justified on the data sets by employing a
   chi-square goodness of fit testing while the distribution of the number
   of test cases is Poisson(lambda). Then, the distribution of the total
   number of observed failures, or similarly covered branches, X is a
   compound Poisson <\^{}> LSD, i.e., negative binomial distribution, given
   that a certain mathematical identity holds. For each checkpoint in time,
   either the software satisfies a desired reliability attached to an
   economic criterion, or else the software testing is allowed to continue.
   By using a one-step-look-ahead formula derived for the model, the
   proposed stopping rule is applied to five test case-based data sets
   acquired by testing embedded chips through the complex VHDL models.
   Further, multistrategy testing is conducted to show its superiority to
   single-stage testing. Results are satisfactorily interpreted from a
   practitioner's viewpoint as an innovative alternative to the ubiquitous
   test-it-to-death approach, which is known to waste billions of test
   cases in a tedious process of finding more bugs. Moreover, the proposed
   dynamic stopping-rule algorithm can validly be employed as an
   alternative paradigm to the existing on-line statistical process control
   methods static in nature for the manufacturing industry, provided that
   underlying statistical assumptions hold. A detailed comparative
   literature survey of stopping-rule methods is also included in terms of
   pros and cons, and cost effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Information system (IS) innovation can be defined as a novel
   organizational application of digital computer and information
   communication technologies (ICT). This paper discusses how modalities of
   applying ICT technologies in their form and scope exhibit radical
   breaks, which are introduced herein as `disruptive IS innovations'. This
   notion of disruptive IS innovation is developed by drawing upon and
   extending Swanson's (1994) theory of IS innovation as well as the
   concept of radical innovation. Disruptive innovations strongly influence
   the future trajectory of the adoption and use of ICT in organizational
   contexts and make the trajectory deviate from its expected course. In
   doing so, these disruptive innovations distinctly define what an IS is
   and how it is deployed in order to address current and future
   organizational and managerial prerogatives. Such changes are triggered
   breakthroughs in the capability of ICT that lead to the revision and
   expansion of associated cognitive models (frames) of computing.
   Disruptive IS innovations are those that lead to changes in the
   application of ICT that are both pervasive and radical. The pervasive
   nature implies that innovative activity spans all innovation subsets of
   the quad-core model of IS innovation introduced herein. Innovation types
   include: IS use and development processes; application architecture and
   capability; and base technologies. Radical in nature, disruptive is
   innovations depart in significant ways from existing alternatives and
   lead to deviation from expected use and diffusion trajectory. This paper
   demonstrates the importance of a concept of disruptive IS innovation by
   investigating how changes triggered by internet computing (Lyytinen et
   al., 1998) meet the conditions of a disruptive IS innovation defined
   herein. The analysis also affirms both the pervasive and radical nature
   of internet computing and explains how internet computing has
   fundamentally transformed the application portfolio, development
   practices and IS services over time. The analysis demonstrates that,
   with the concept of disruptive IS innovation, we can fruitfully analyse
   `long' waves of ICT evolution - an issue that has largely been
   overlooked in the IS community. On a theoretical plane, the paper
   advocates the view that we need to look beyond linear, unidirectional,
   and atomistic concepts of the diffusion of IS innovations where
   innovative activity takes places in a linear fashion by oscillating
   between small technological innovations and small organizational
   innovations. In contrast, IS innovation can exhibit fundamental
   discontinuity; we need to theoretically grasp such disruptive moments.
   The recent influx of innovation, spurred by internet-based technology,
   offers one such moment.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative high-resolution maskless lithography system is designed
   employing a combination of low- and high-numerical-aperture (NA)
   projection lens systems along with integrated micro-optics, and using
   Texas Instruments' super video graphic array (SVGA) digital micromirror
   device (DMD) as the spatial and temporal light modulator. A mercury arc
   lamp filtered for the G-line (lambda = 435.8 nm) is used as the light
   source. Exposure experiments are performed using data extraction and
   transfer software, and synchronous stage control algorithms derived from
   a point array scrolling technique. Each exposure scan produces a field
   width (L/S) of approximately 8.47 mm with a field length (longitudinal
   field) limited only by onboard memory capacity. DMD frame rates of up to
   5 kHz (kframes/s), synchronized to the stage motion, are achievable. In
   this experiment, TSMR-8970XB10 photoresist (PR), diluted to 3.8 cP with
   PR thinner is prepared. The PR is spin-coated onto a chrome-coated glass
   substrate to 1.0-mum thickness with 0.1-mum uniformity. A 0.4-mum scan
   step is used and 27,000 DMD data frames are extracted and transferred to
   the DMID driver. Results indicate consistent 1.8-mum line space (US)
   resolved across the entire field width of 8.47 mm. Given optimized
   exposure and development conditions, 1.5-mum L/S is also observed at
   certain locations. The potential of this maskless lithography system is
   substantial; its performance is sufficient for applications in
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), photomasking, high-resolution
   LCD, high-density printed circuit boards (PCBs), etc. Higher
   productivity is predicted by a custom Wine (X = 405 nm) lens system
   designed and used in conjunction with a violet diode laser systems and
   the development of a real-time driver. (C) 2003 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{The performance of high-end routers will soon reach the limits of
   conventional technology. Single flux quantum (SFQ) digital technology is
   a key technology for achieving a breakthrough. We have already proposed
   a high-end router using SFQ technology. In this paper, we report on the
   latest innovation of SFQ router technology. First we describe a design
   methodology development. We have developed a new SFQ logic cell library
   for cell-based top-down circuit design. To expand the circuit scale
   further, a novel pseudo-automatic Josephson transmission line (JTL)
   routing technique has also been developed. And then, we discuss issues
   of passive interconnection, and show the operation of a passive
   transmission line interconnected circuit up to 40-Gbps throughput.
   Second we describe a packet switch circuit demonstration. We designed a
   2 x 2 crossbar packet switch circuit, which is a key element in the
   packet switch. We successfully tested the circuit up to a clock
   frequency of 35 GHz. Finally we discuss an SFQ circuit application in
   the optical router as an alternative application strategy. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Background: Energized dissection systems facilitate laparoscopic
   dissection and hemostasis and reduce instrument traffic. However, they
   can introduce undesirable thermal collateral/proximity damage to
   adjacent structures mainly by heat conduction, although other mechanisms
   may be involved. The latest generation devices have the potential to
   reduce the incidence of such problems through use of active feedback
   control over the power output. This effectively regulates the delivery
   of energy to the target tissue with minimal thermal collateral damage.
   In addition, innovative heat-sink engineering of the device head ensures
   that the surface of the instrument tip remains cool (<45\&DEG;C). In
   this study, we evaluated the performance of this technology (LigaSure)
   by using dynamic infrared thermography. The thermal imaging measurements
   were then correlated with histopathologic studies. The overall value of
   in situ thermography as an adjunct to energized surgical dissection
   systems was also assessed.
   Methods: Eight anesthetized pigs underwent open surgery to mobilize
   eight target vessels/organs in a randomized fashion. The LigaSure vessel
   sealing system with Instant Response Technology was used with three
   different interchangeable heads. In situ dynamic thermography was
   undertaken with a thermal imaging camera operating in the mid-infrared
   (3-5 \&mu;m) waveband and with each fully digitized 12-bit thermographic
   frame acquired at a rate of 60 Hz. Following sacrifice at the end of the
   dissection, tissue from the dissected regions was harvested for
   histology by an independent pathologist who was blinded to the
   thermographic data.
   Results: Seals made with both the LS1000 5-mm laparoscopic head
   (predominantly to the small bowel and colon) and the LS1100 10-mm
   (Atlas) device (on the liver and short gastric tissues) were outwardly
   satisfactory. The average thermal spread (<(Theta)over bar>) with the
   LS1000 was (\&UTheta;) over bar = 4.4 mm, and the exposed surface of the
   instrument tip developed a temperature of approximately 100degreesC.
   This instrument thus has the potential, albeit small, for heat-related
   proximity iatrogenic injury. The more technologically advanced LS1100
   10-mm laparoscopic instrument exhibited a superior performance, with
   (\&UTheta;) over bar = 1.8 mm, and with a maximal temperature on the
   exposed surface of the jaws well within tolerable limits (approximately
   35degreesC) for use during surgery (laparoscopic or open). This was
   confirmed by histological studies that demonstrated negligible evidence
   of thermal damage.
   Conclusions: In situ thermal imaging represents a powerful modality for
   the monitoring of energized dissection/coagulation during surgery. The
   LigaSure system used with the LS1100 head constitutes a very safe option
   for energized dissection and hemostasis of vessels with a diameter of up
   to approximately 7 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Music filesharing systems based on peer-to-peer technology are
   increasingly menacing the entire music industry. After neglecting the
   issue in the beginning, the major music labels are now struggling to
   enforce their property rights in the Internet in order to maintain their
   profits - up to now without substantial impact.
   The iTunes Music Store, presented by Apple Inc. in April 2003 is the
   first commercial service able to persuade a considerable number of
   internet users to pay for digital music they down-load. This article
   discusses the major factors which contribute to iTunes' success and
   analyses the service from different perspectives.
   From a technological point of view, the digital rights management
   systems stand out as they are quite liberal and even include
   peer-to-peer elements. The business perspective suggests that its
   success lies in the integration of the music industry's need for
   compensation with the customers' requirements,to exchange music files
   and to write them to CD. Taking a new institutional economics approach,
   the service pays attention to the fact that in the Internet age some
   (intellectual) property rights can not be enforced in a way the music
   industry was used to in pre-Internet times: Leaving some property rights
   not allocated the remaining property rights can be enforced more
   efficiently by presenting an innovative and easy-to-use service.}},

Abstract = {{Archives of mediateques, theaters, music schools, conservatories,
   universities, etc., are the most important sources of cultural heritage.
   Such institutions are interested in digitizing content to (i) improve
   the service towards their attendees thus increasing the number of
   collections provided; (ii) add new multimedia and innovative
   functionalities to the service already provided within the content
   available; and (iii) save fragile materials otherwise settled to time
   deterioration, such as tapes, disks, documents, etc. Publishers are
   interested in digitizing only content which guarantees a certain return
   of investment and at the same time they are inclined to limit the
   distribution of the content located in archives, so as to control its
   exploitation and to preserve the content ownership. WEDELMUSIC has been
   defined to allow content providers to share and distribute ``interactive
   music'' with respect paid to the owner's rights. This permits the
   creation of a network for content-sharing mediateques that can form
   while respecting the owner's rights. The WEDELMUSIC solution permits the
   creation of a virtuoso mechanism which increases the amount of content
   owned by each mediateque and adds several new multimedia functionalities
   that can be enforced into the WEDELMUSIC objects, with a limited effort,
   by using and integrating the content of any format and media. The
   proposed solutions, models, and tools were defined and developed,
   including adequate protection and monitoring solutions. The solution was
   validated by a real music mediateque in Milan that has completely
   adopted the solution.}},

Abstract = {{Background The assessment of colours is essential for the diagnosis of
   malignant melanoma ( MM), both for pattern analysis on dermoscopic
   images, and when employing semiquantitative methods.
   Objectives To develop a computer program for colour assessment in MM
   images mimicking the human perception of lesion colours, and to compare
   the automatic colour evaluation with one performed by human observers.
   Methods A colour palette comprising six colour groups ( black, dark
   brown, light brown, blue grey, red and white) was created by selecting
   single colour components inside melanocytic lesion images acquired by
   means of a digital videomicroscope, and was implemented in the image
   analysis program. Subsequently, colours were assessed by the computer
   program on 331 melanocytic lesion images composing our image database,
   and the results were compared with the evaluation of lesion colours
   performed by the clinician.
   Results The black, white and blue - grey colours were more frequently
   found in MMs than in naevi, both by the clinicians and by the computer.
   In MM images we observed 4.27 +/- 1.14 colours (mean +/- SD) per lesion,
   as opposed to 3.22 +/- 0.68 in naevi. The correlation between clinical
   and computer evaluation of the colours was very good, with a value of
   0.781 for overall assessment.
   Conclusions This innovative method for automatic colour evaluation,
   reproducing clinical assessment of melanocytic lesion colours, may
   provide numerical parameters to be employed for computer-aided diagnosis
   of MM.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on outcomes from a White Rose Centre for Enterprise
   funded project Managing Innovation in the Digital Economy. This project
   aims to incorporate learning for enterprise into undergraduate and
   postgraduate curricula in information management and information
   systems. The paper presents results from a survey distributed to
   postgraduate information management and information systems students
   following completion of a module in E-Business and E-Commerce delivered
   by the Department of Information Studies at the University of Sheffield.
   The findings suggest that differences in levels of prior knowledge of
   business studies and in cultural background can impact on students'
   acquisition of domain knowledge and intellectual and information
   research skills during collaborative development of a business plan.
   Implications of the results for web-based instruction are addressed, by
   identifying teaching and learning strategies that support differential
   treatment of learners in terms of content and process. It is concluded
   that empirical investigation of individual differences within a student
   body can inform more effective methods for information systems and
   information management graduates to learn about and for
   entrepreneurship.}},

Abstract = {{Few information systems today offer a flexible means to define and
   manage the automated part of radiology processes, which provide clinical
   imaging services for the entire healthcare organization. Even fewer of
   them provide a coherent architecture that can easily cope with
   heterogeneity and inevitable local adaptation of applications and can
   integrate clinical and administrative information to aid better
   clinical, operational, and business decisions. We describe an innovative
   enterprise architecture of image information management systems to fill
   the needs. Such a system is based on the interplay of production
   workflow management, distributed object computing, Java and Web
   techniques, and in-depth domain knowledge in radiology operations. Our
   design adapts the approach of ``4+1{''} architectural view.
   In this new architecture, PACS and RIS become one while the user
   interaction can be automated by customized workflow process. Clinical
   service applications are implemented as active components. They can be
   reasonably substituted by applications of local adaptations and can be
   multiplied for fault tolerance and load balancing. Furthermore, the
   workflow-enabled digital radiology system would provide powerful query
   and statistical functions for managing resources and improving
   productivity. This paper will potentially lead to a new direction of
   image information management. We illustrate the innovative design with
   examples taken from an implemented system.}},

Abstract = {{The MPEG-4 audio standard provides several toolsets for natural and
   synthetic sound coding. Among them, the most innovative in terms of
   multimedia applications is Structured Audio (SA), which implements a
   high level, structured description of sound instead of the usual
   compression techniques based on psychoacoustics and subband analysis. SA
   permits to encode synthesis and processing algorithms by its Structured
   Audio Orchestra Language (SAOL), and it can theoretically be used to
   specify any other audio decoder. This great flexibility introduces a
   challenging implementation problem, which in a normative framework has
   to be solved by a systematic approach.
   In the first part of the paper, it is described how the SA decoding
   process can be analyzed in a platform independent way in order to
   determine the fundamental figures of this coding technique; it is then
   shown how the proposed method is being used for the MPEG-4 SA
   conformance test. In the second part the design of a virtual digital
   signal processor (DSP) architecture is presented, based on the results
   of the complexity analysis. This architecture is able to exploit the
   intrinsic data level parallelism of many Audio algorithms and to
   consistently reduce the implementation cost. Experimental results prove
   the effectiveness of the approach and its suitability for
   implementations on modern superscalar DSPs and multimedia processors.}},

Abstract = {{Bridging the digital divide between information and technology haves and
   have-nots has waned from the top of the national policy agenda in the
   United States during a time in which the sunken investments of the 1990s
   need to be leveraged. A national information network now exists yet this
   infrastructure-largely hardware-needs to be continually modernized and
   parlayed with commitments to building human capacity, developing
   relevant content, and scaling socially beneficial technology
   applications, such as telemedicine, in order to optimize these initial
   multi-billion-dollar outlays. This article makes the case that
   sidestepping public private initiatives aimed at accelerating digital
   opportunity is imprudent, given the mounting empirical evidence
   highlighting the payoffs of information and communications technologies,
   when properly integrated and applied, especially in enhancing the life
   chances of underserved Americans. Policy next steps should advance the
   goals of expanding universal service initiatives, including hastening
   broadband deployment to homes and learning institutions, and deepening
   programs which leverage the utility of the existing infrastructure, such
   as expanding human-capital development, producing relevant content, and
   innovating socially beneficial technology applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a mobile learning project, where mobile devices are
   used for educational activities. The main focus of this paper is teacher
   training. Experiences on the use of mobile technology and how it was
   used in teacher training, especially how trainees and supervising
   teachers felt about it, are presented. The pilot study was carried out
   at the Department of Home Economics and Craft Science in University of
   Helsinki. The idea of the pilot was that the supervising teacher and
   trainee students could discus and share their ideas about teaching
   methods through the mobile device and use of a short message service
   (SMS) and digital pictures as a part of the supervising process. The use
   of digital pictures which were delivered via the mobile device proved to
   be surprisingly successful. The goal of these innovative pilot projects
   is to create flexible teaching solutions, which will enable access to
   information using different devices, and support learning in a variety
   of situations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Previous techniques to delineate the human flexor digitorum
   profundus (FD) vasculature have been innovative but potentially
   imprecise, resulting in uncertainty as to the existence of avascular
   zones in the flexor tendon. We aimed to use a novel immunohistochemical
   technique to determine more accurately the vasculature of the human
   flexor tendon.
   Methods: Thirty fresh cadaveric human FDP tendons were harvested, fixed,
   wax embedded, sectioned, and stained using the anti-CD31 monoclonal
   antibody to allow vessel visualization. Vessel numbers and vascularity
   density ratios were determined by computed image analysis.
   Results: Vessel density ratios varied with anatomic location, with a
   decrease between the A2 and A4 pulleys. There also was variation in
   vascularity ratios in the anteroposterior plane, with the palmar surface
   of the tendons having a lower vessel density.
   Conclusions: We have shown that although areas of low vascularity exist
   on the palmar aspect of the tendon, there are no truly avascular zones.

Abstract = {{This paper discusses how firms can use slight information advantages to
   obtain preferential access to complementary assets and create
   multi-level dominant designs. It does this by using an analysis of
   several cellular phone industries and the literature on standards and
   dominant designs. In the most prominent case, the leading Japanese
   cellular service provider (NTT DoCoMo) offered preferential information
   about the ``open{''} Japanese digital phone standard in return for
   preferential access to the lightest phones from four phone suppliers.
   These four phone suppliers used the preferential access to this
   information to obtain preferential cooperation from parts suppliers and
   to make better design tradeoffs between parts than the other phone
   suppliers. These superior design tradeoffs enabled the DoCoMo suppliers
   to create various dominant designs within the Personal Digital Cellular
   (PDC) standard. The creation of these dominant designs forced other
   phone and part manufacturers to change their design strategies and copy
   the designs used by the DoCoMo phone and part suppliers. The result is
   that DoCoMo and its four phone suppliers have substantially reversed the
   slides in their market shares. By comparing this case with several other
   cellular phone industries in which different modes of competition exist,
   the paper discusses how market conditions determine the way in which
   standards and dominant designs emerge. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{In this paper the process of exit and entry of firms in the Swedish
   manufacturing industry is investigated within the framework of the
   product life cycle. The product life cycle theory explains how the high
   degree of uncertainty, as regards product designs and production
   methods, which is connected to the early stages of the product life
   cycle requires a high level of knowledge-intensity. Since uncertainty
   decrease over the product life cycle, less knowledge is needed in
   production during later stages of the product life cycle. This implies
   that knowledge-intensity differs for firms that exit and enter in
   different stages of the product life cycle. Four hypotheses regarding
   these relationships are stated and empirically tested in this paper,
   using data at the 5-digit SIC-level for the Swedish manufacturing
   industry during 1990-1996. The empirical results show that entrants in
   the early stages of the product life cycle are more knowledge-intensive
   than incumbent firms. It is also found that firms exiting in early
   stages of the product life cycle are more knowledge-intensive than firms
   exiting in later stages.}},

Abstract = {{The proposed strategy formulation (SF) framework, integrates three
   widely used business management strategic tools and makes use of the
   Education Criteria 1999 adopted from the Malcolm Baldrige National
   Quality Award (MBNQA) for strategy development in vocational education.
   The methodology of the proposed framework used is to conjoin the SWOT
   matrix with the balanced scorecard (BSC) identifying the four critical
   successful perspectives. The next step is to analyse the MBNQA Education
   Criteria 1999 for education performance excellence using quality
   function deployment (QFD) methodology. This paper presents an
   illustration in the strategic planning of new curriculum by making use
   of the proposed framework.
   The emergence of an information and knowledge-based economy in recent
   years, coupled with the advancement in Internet technology, has placed a
   significant emphasis on training of the youngsters in these fields. It
   is the intention that they can play a vital role in the HKSAR
   Government's information technology vision and innovation such as the
   Digital 21 and the Cyberport. They need to create agile, therefore,
   change-adaptive business processes is the key to success in business
   world. The ability to reduce cycle-time, to provide high value-added
   services and to integrate business across many functions and
   geographical locations through e-Commerce, information technology and

Abstract = {{In this paper, an innovative measurement system for odor classification,
   based on quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs), is presented. The
   application proposed in this paper is the detection of typical wine
   aroma compounds in mixtures containing ethanol. In QCM sensors, the
   sensitive layer is, e.g., a polymeric layer deposited-on a quartz
   surface. Chemical mixtures are sorbed in the sensitive layer, inducing a
   change in the polymer mass and, therefore, in the quartz resonance
   frequency. In this paper, the frequency shift is measured by a
   dedicated, fully digital front-end hardware implementing a technique
   that allows reducing the measurement time while maintaining a
   high-frequency resolution {[}1]. The developed system allows, therefore,
   measuring variations of the QCM resonance frequency shifts during
   chemical transients obtained with abrupt changes in odor concentration.
   Hence, the reaction kinetics can be exploited to enhance the sensor
   selectivity. In this paper, some measurements obtained with an array of
   four sensors with different polymeric sensitive layers are presented. An
   exponential fitting of the transient responses is used for feature
   extraction. Finally, to reduce data dimensionality, principal component
   analysis is used.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to visualize and document the architecture
   of the human soleus muscle throughout its entire volume. The
   architecture was visualized by creating a three-dimensional (3D)
   manipulatable computer model of an entire cadaveric soleus, in situ,
   using B-spline solid to display muscle fiber bundles that had been
   serially dissected, pinned, and digitized. A database of fiber bundle
   length and angle of pennation throughout the marginal, posterior, and
   anterior soleus was compiled. The computer model allowed documentation
   of the architectural parameters in 3D space, with the angle of pennation
   being measured relative to the tangent plane of the point of attachment
   of a fiber bundle. Before this study, the only architectural parameters
   that have been recorded have been 2D. Three-dimensional reconstruction
   is an exciting innovation because it makes feasible the creation of an
   architectural database and allows visualization of each fiber bundle in
   situ from any perspective. It was concluded that the architecture is
   non-uniform throughout the volume of soleus. Detailed architectural
   studies may lead to the development of muscle models that can more
   accurately predict interaction between muscle parts, force generation,
   and the effect of pathologic states on muscle function. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{We present a novel visualization technique to align whole bacterial
   genomes with millions of nucleotides. Our basic design combines the
   descriptive power of pixel-based visualizations with the interpretative
   strength of digital image-processing filters. The innovative use of
   pixel enhancement techniques on pixel-based visualizations brings out
   the best of the recursive data patterns and further enhances the
   effectiveness of the visualization techniques. The result is a fast,
   versatile, and cost-effective analysis tool to reveal hidden structures
   that might lead to the discovery of functional identifications as well
   as phenotypic changes of whole bacterial genomes. Nine different whole
   bacterial genomes obtained from public genome banks are used to
   demonstrate our designs and prove their viability. Although the design
   of the new visualization technique is targeted at analyzing genomic
   sequences, we show with examples that it can be used to study other
   types of sequential data sets with a priori orders.}},

Abstract = {{The design of high performance, high precision, real-time digital signal
   processing (DSP) systems, such as those associated with wavelet signal
   processing, is a challenging problem. This paper reports on the
   innovative use of the residue number system (RNS) for implementing
   high-end wavelet filter banks. The disclosed system uses an enhanced
   index-transformation defined over Galois fields to efficiently support
   different wavelet filter instantiations without adding any extra cost or
   additional look-up tables (LUT). A selection of a small wordwidth
   modulus set are the keys for attaining low-complexity and
   high-throughput. An exhaustive comparison against existing two's
   complement (2C) designs for different custom IC technologies was carried
   out. Results reveal a performance improvement of up to 100\% for
   high-precision RNS-based systems. These structures demonstrated to be
   well suited for field programmable logic (FPL) assimilation as well as
   for CBIC (cell-based integrated circuit) technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the concept and development of an innovative
   combination of conventional fluxgate magnetometer readout electronics
   with the control loop of a sigma-delta modulator in order to achieve a
   new magnetometer design that provides direct digital output without the
   use of a separate analogue-to-digital converter chip. The new concept is
   especially aimed at the measurement of extraterrestrial magnetic fields
   within a dynamic range of approximately +/-2000 nT aboard scientific
   space missions which are affected by high radiation doses.
   A digital domain model of the new magnetometer electronics is presented,
   which is essential for a successful hardware implementation, and the
   test results of a single-axis prototype are discussed.
   The test results show that the fluxgate and sigma-delta modulator
   control loops can be merged for dynamic ranges up to +/-2000 nT without
   significant deterioration of the overall performance of the
   magnetometer. The remaining quantization noise in the signal bandwidth
   (10 Hz) was minimized to below the sensor's noise level (7 PT Hz(-1/2)
   at 1 Hz) due to the noise-shaping effect of the sigma-delta principle.
   An offset stability of 0.25 nT over four days was achieved and the
   linearity error is less than +/-3.3 x 10(-5) even though the fluxgate
   sensor is not kept at near-zero field as for traditional fluxgate
   magnetometers.
   A technological model of this new fluxgate magnetometer concept will be
   built for a test flight aboard the NASA discovery mission DAWN.}},

Abstract = {{A three-layer detector prototype, obtained by stacking three edge-on
   single photon counting silicon microstrip detectors, has been developed
   and widely tested. This was done in the framework of the Synchrotron
   Radiation for Medical Physics/Frontier Radiology (SYRMEP/FRONTRAD)
   collaboration activities, whose aim is to improve the quality of
   mammographic examinations operating both on the source and on the
   detector side. The active surface of the device has been fully
   characterized making use of an edge-scanning technique and of a
   well-collimated laminar synchrotron radiation beam. The obtained data
   (interlayer distances, channel correspondence, etc.) have then been used
   to combine information coming from each detector layer, without causing
   any loss in spatial and contrast resolution of the device. Contrast and
   spatial resolution have also been separately evaluated for each detector
   layer. Moreover, imaging techniques (phase contrast, refraction, and
   scatter imaging), resulting in an increased visibility of low absorbing
   details, have been implemented, and their effectiveness has been tested
   on a biological sample. Finally, the possibility of simultaneously
   acquiring different kind of images with the different detector layers is
   discussed. This would result in maximizing the information extracted
   from the sample, while at the same time the high absorption efficiency
   of the detector device would allow a low dose delivery. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Contrast-enhanced MR angiography and
   extracranial color-coded duplex sonography are noninvasive, preoperative
   imaging modalities for evaluation of carotid artery stenosis. Innovative
   techniques and improvements in image quality require frequent
   reassessment of accuracy, reliability, and diagnostic value compared
   with those of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We evaluated
   contrast-enhanced MR angiography and duplex sonography compared with DSA
   for detection of high-grade carotid artery stenoses.
   METHODS: Four readers, blinded to clinical symptoms and the outcome of
   other studies, independently evaluated stenoses on contrast-enhanced MR
   angiograms in 71 vessels of. 39 symptomatic patients. Duplex sonography
   was also performed in all vessels. The severity of stenosis was defined
   according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial
   criteria (0-29\%, 30-69\%, 70-99\%, 100\%). Results of both modalities
   were compared with the corresponding DSA findings.
   RESULTS: Contrast-enhanced MR angiography had a sensitivity and
   specificity of 94.9\% and 79.1\%, respectively, for the identification
   of carotid artery stenoses of 70\% or greater. Sensitivity and
   specificity of duplex sonography were 92.9\% and 81.9\%, respectively.
   Combining data from both tests revealed a sensitivity and specificity of
   100\% and 81.4\%, respectively, for concordant results (80\% of
   vessels).
   CONCLUSION: Concordant results of contrast-enhanced MR angiography and
   duplex sonography increase the diagnostic sensitivity to 100\%. The
   reliability of MR angiography is comparable to that of DSA. The
   combination of contrast-enhanced MR angiography and duplex sonography
   might be preferable over DSA for preoperative evaluation in most
   patients, thus reducing the risk of perioperative morbidity and
   improving the overall outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The paper focuses on the interferometric capabilities of current and
   future SAR systems, like ENVISAT, RADARSAT-2, etc. The authors introduce
   a technique to obtain interferometric surveys by combining two images,
   coming from any SAR mode, together with a digital elevation mode (DEM).
   The DEM is exploited during the interferogram generation to provide, at
   one time, effective noise removal and compensation for the
   topographic-dependent fringes. The final product is a `differential'
   (topography-compensated) interferogram, to be used for monitoring over
   landslides, upswelling, etc. An innovative technique is also discussed
   to estimate local coherence maps, to be used for classification and
   change detection. Such a technique exploits windows whose shapes and
   sizes adapt locally to the target features, to attain at one time the
   highest resolution and the best statistical confidence. Finally,
   applications involving the various ENVISAT ASAR modes are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent technology advances in mobile networking have ushered in a new
   era of personal communication. Users can ubiquitously access the
   Internet via many emerging mobile appliances, such as portable
   notebooks, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and WAP-enabled cellular
   phones. While the transcoding proxy is attracting an increasing amount
   of attention in this environment, it is noted that new caching
   strategies are required for these transcoding proxies. We propose, in
   this paper, an efficient cache replacement algorithm for transcoding
   proxies. Specifically, we formulate a generalized profit function to
   evaluate the profit from caching each version of an object. This
   generalized profit function explicitly considers several new emerging
   factors in the transcoding proxy and the aggregate effect of caching
   multiple versions of the same object. It is noted that the aggregate
   effect is not simply the sum of the costs of caching individual versions
   of an object, but rather, depends on the transcoding relationship among
   these versions. The notion of a weighted transcoding graph is devised to
   evaluate the corresponding aggregate effect efficiently. Utilizing the
   generalized profit function and the weighted transcoding graph, we
   propose, in this paper, an innovative cache replacement algorithm for
   transcoding proxies. In addition, an effective data structure is
   designed to facilitate the management of the multiple versions of
   different objects cached in the transcoding proxy. Using an event-driven
   simulation, it is shown that the algorithm proposed consistently
   outperforms companion schemes in terms of the delay saving ratios and
   cache hit ratios.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this special issue on eTransition is to offer an insight
   and some explanation to the exciting analytical and computational
   manufacturing systems engineering methods, tools and technologies that
   enable companies to move from traditional CIM-enabled enterprises, to
   truly collaborative, lean and distributed digital enterprises, which
   will prosper even when surrounded by dynamically changing market
   conditions. This major change process, affecting every aspect of the
   enterprise, is driven by national and international competition, which
   forces advanced manufacturers continuously to innovate and make their
   product design, manufacturing and service processes lean, flexible and
   market driven. Simultaneously, the time to market is still shrinking.
   This means that marketing and sales departments have to explain and sell
   their increasingly more complex hardware and software integrated
   products to an increasingly more educated and globally distributed
   customer base, via a dynamically changing supply chain, at a competitive
   price and in a short time.}},

Abstract = {{During the past two decades the computing industry has developed several
   different, at the time, dominating user interfaces. These initially
   offered text-based screens, such as DOS, and then, with the invention of
   the MIT-, then Xerox- and then (the significantly faster and better)
   Apple Computer-created windowing interfaces, a graphical environment was
   born. With various modifications and enhancements, this was adopted by
   most leading software vendors, and it is widely used today in any
   computer-integrated device, or machine. (It is important to mention that
   the latest and best of these innovations come from Apple computers
   again, with the introduction of the new OS X Aqua windowing interface.
   There is no doubt, that all major software vendors will try to mimic
   this seamless graphical design, with vector-based fonts, professional
   colour management, and fast, animated objects; just as they did in the
   past.) Since most knowledge workers, and even operators and line
   managers on the shop floor, spend over half--or even more--of their time
   looking at various computer screens in a digital enterprise, eTransition
   user interface design issues are critical. The objective of our research
   was to create an object/component oriented requirements analysis method
   and software tool that enables enterprises to analyse and design all
   critical aspects of their user interfaces for product/process design,
   manufacturing, demanufacturing, and other process, including total
   quality control and even software engineering over the web and/or their
   company intranets. (Note that we did not limit our approach to computer
   user interfaces; nevertheless, since even CNC machine tools, robots,
   smart sensor interfaces, vision systems, and other web-linked devices on
   the shop floor offer browser readable multimedia interfaces, we included
   in our study and analysis all web-linked and web-enabled devices that
   enterprises use.) Our solution is generic, nevertheless, due to the
   importance of this method during the multi-lifecycle eTransition
   process, we focus here on providing an analytical method for evaluating
   various disassembly line manager and operator user requirements, based
   on appropriate engineering solutions, including the parameter ranges and
   their correlation matrices of such solutions. One of the results of this
   R\&D effort is our implemented and validated, web-enabled, open source
   CORA Tool (Object/Component Oriented Requirements Analysis Tool).}},

Abstract = {{The advanced design and manufacturing/assembly industry is increasingly
   operating on a globally integrated, Internet-based collaborative model
   of design, production and support in which OEMs (Original Equipment
   Manufacturers) assemble products out of components and objects (both
   hardware and software) by a network of distributed suppliers. This
   distributed client-server digital enterprise collaboration and creation
   model is enabled by the Internet, company intranets and consortium-based
   extranets. This eTransition process leads towards waste reduction,
   innovation and prosperity at all levels, including not just machines and
   traditional engineering processes and resources, but also biomedical
   engineering, medical sciences and human resources, since the integrated,
   collaborative opportunities of product and process design, information
   technology and management, must be performed by a highly skilled,
   collaborating and continuously learning, dynamic workforce. This needs a
   sound methodology and a firm architecture for documenting, distributing
   and managing knowledge, the critical resource of any company with a
   future. In order to fulfil this need, we have created an
   object/component-oriented methodology and architecture, that is
   analytical, quantitative, and open-source computational. We have also
   implemented over 30 open source, 3D browser readable, interactive
   multimedia, web-enabled library cases, covering a wide range of topics.
   Each case in this library first looks at the real-world customer
   requirement, then experts offer one or more solution(s) by explaining
   real-world solutions, working with real machines, or processes, or
   systems, and/or engineering management tasks, and then they discuss
   further development, service, maintenance, integration, connectivity and
   many other issues with several feedback loops, sound methods, and
   practical examples. During the discussion, as well as at the end, each
   3D multimedia eBook case in the library offers plenty of discussion and
   improvement opportunities, as well as open-source computational
   solutions and templates for real or virtual teams to test and validate
   their own logic, and data. This paper introduces the methodology, to
   some extent the object/component knowledge documentation architecture,
   and offers examples of this industry/academia sponsored R\&D effort. As
   our validation results and the over 30 supporting enterprises clearly
   indicate, our solution can be applied to satisfy a large variety of
   knowledge documentation and learning, as well as hi-tech product
   marketing needs. For education, the created CBL Library is an effective
   method for outcome-oriented problem solving and assessment because it
   forces both the student as well as the tutor to focus on, and then
   create, new wealth, and to encourage outcome-oriented educational
   practices and follow US ABET (Accreditation Board of Engineering and
   Technology in the USA), and European educational principles.}},

Abstract = {{There is a rising tide of `digital' citizens now clamouring for more and
   better government services and these expectations have profound
   implications on the delivery of services. Many governments have thus
   undertaken major transformation processes that maximize the utilization
   of information and communication technologies through e-government
   initiatives aimed at facilitating a collaborative and efficient
   administrative environment and enhance delivery of government services.
   Challenges facing e-government are varied and multi-faceted and require
   innovative uses of technologies to ensure that services can be provided
   to citizens in a seamless fashion. The article also describes the
   Malaysian experience in implementing e-government by highlighting
   several of the key programmes undertaken and the lessons learned. It is
   also imperative for governments to actively and continuously monitor and
   measure e-government outcomes against targeted key performance
   indicators as well as to leverage on international benchmarking to

Abstract = {{Metro wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) networks play an important
   role in the emerging Internet hierarchy; they interconnect the backbone
   WDM networks and the local-access networks. The current circuit-switched
   SONET/synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)-over-WDM-ring metro networks
   are expected to become a serious bottleneck-the so-called metro gap-as
   they are faced with an increasing amount of bursty packet data traffic
   and quickly increasing bandwidths in the backbone networks and access
   networks. Innovative metro WDM networks that are highly efficient and
   able to handle variable-size packets are needed to alleviate the metro
   gap. In this paper, we study an arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG)-based
   single-hop WDM metro network. We analyze the photonic switching of
   variable-size packets with spatial wavelength reuse. We derive
   computationally efficient and accurate expressions for the network
   throughput and delay. Our extensive numerical investigations-based on
   our analytical results and simulations-reveal that spatial wavelength
   reuse is crucial for efficient photonic packet switching. In. typical
   scenarios, spatial wavelength reuse increases the throughput by 66\%
   while reducing the delay by 40\%. Also, the throughput of our AWG-bAsed
   network with spatial wavelength reuse is roughly 70\% larger than the
   throughput of a comparable single-hop WDM network based on a passive
   star coupler, (PSC).}},

Abstract = {{As information technologies have developed, the digital library is
   making the library undergo a changing paradigm of its role to create,
   organize, and distribute information resources. Digital libraries have
   created and promoted innovative information services with digitization
   of resources. The development of digital libraries has been attracting
   the attention of many countries and South Korea is no exception. This
   article provides an overview of recent developments in digital libraries
   in South Korea. To build the digital library, various innovative
   projects are currently in progress involving a range of different
   libraries and institutions. This article also discusses information
   policies, standards, and technical issues in South Korea in recent
   years. Until now, the various projects involving digital collections and
   digital libraries in South Korea have been carried out with very little
   coordination. If a more coordinated and coherent approach to building
   digital libraries is to succeed in South Korea, all libraries and
   institutions will need to work closely together to establish the
   appropriate framework for cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Agility is vital to the innovation and competitive performance of firms
   in contemporary business environments. Firms are increasingly relying on
   information technologies, including process, knowledge, and
   communication technologies, to enhance their agility. The purpose of
   this paper is to broaden understanding about the strategic role of IT by
   examining the nomological network of influences through which IT impacts
   firm perfor By drawing upon recent thinking in the mance, strategy, -
   entrepreneurship, and IT management literatures, this paper uses a
   multitheoretic lens to argue that information technology. investments
   and. capabilities influence firm performance through three significant
   organizational capabilities (agility, digital options, and
   entrepreneurial alertness) and strategic processes (capability-,
   building, entrepreneurial action, and,coevolutionary adaptation). We
   also propose that these, dynamic capabilities and strategic processes
   impact the ability of firms. to launch many and varied competitive
   actions and that, in. turn, these competitive actions are a significant
   antecedent of firm Performance. Through our theorizing, we draw
   attention to a significant and reframed role of IT as a digital options

Abstract = {{This paper presents innovative algorithms for optimum filtering,
   rise-time discrimination and proper correction of solid-state detector
   pulses based on digital pulse processing (DPP) techniques and on a
   Linear Sliding Method. These techniques allow a significant improvement
   on the spectral resolution by taking into account both the electronic
   noise and the pulse rise time fluctuations mainly due to the incomplete
   charge collection in the CZT crystal. In order to develop these
   algorithms pre-amplified pulses coming from a planar XR100-T detector
   (Amptek) were digitized by a 12-bit PCI acquisition card (125 MHz)
   hosted by a PC platform. The presented results show that, due to the
   possibility of fine adjustments on the discrimination and correction
   parameters during the processing stage, this flexible DPP implementation
   leads to significantly better results than the analog hardware
   discrimination solution. Comparative analysis of Am-241 spectra show a
   significant reduction of the low-energy ``tail{''} on the 59.5 keV
   photo-peak. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{UCLA LAW REVIEW}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The anticircumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
   penalize both the circumvention of technical protection measures, and
   supplying the means for such circumvention. These prohibitions are
   entirely separate from the exclusive rights under copyright, causing
   some commentators to dub the anticircumvention right as
   ``paracopyright.{''} Such paracopyright effectively grants copyright
   holders sweeping new ability to impose terms of access on content users:
   Consumers who access content without accepting the content owner's terms
   would violate the owner's paracopyright even if the material accessed is
   not itself copyrighted or copyrightable.
   Additionally, where a particular use would be permissible under
   copyright law, content owners may be able to exclude the use as a
   condition of access. For example, the content owner might require that
   users contractually agree not to engage in reverse engineering or fair
   uses as a condition for access to the material. Content owners may use
   ``paracopyright{''} to require purchase or use of related products; for
   example, DVD access controls require that the disc be played on approved
   hardware, effectively dictating the consumer's purchase of playback
   equipment.
   At some point, such leveraging of access control seems certain to
   overstep the bounds militated by sound policy or intended by Congress.
   In the past, abuse of intellectual property rights has been curtailed
   under the doctrine of misuse. This Article argues that because DMCA
   ``paracopyright{''} is ripe for abuse, limits on overreaching may be
   imposed by applying the misuse doctrine in this new area. just as
   improper leveraging of patent and copyright may be curtailed by
   application of the misuse doctrine, so improper leveraging of
   paracopyright should be curtailed by application of misuse. This new
   application of misuse doctrine may be guided by the standards
   established in previous applications to patent and copyright law, and
   may serve a similar function in regulating the excesses invited by the
   anticircumvention right.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray topography (XRT) is recognized as being a powerful too] for
   directly imaging defects in single crystals, semiconductor wafers and
   epitaxially grown layers. The timely identification of defects can lead
   to increased yields and significant cost savings in wafer processing.
   The primary limitation to its general usage within the semiconductor
   community has been the difficulty in system use and difficulty in
   integration into an in-line analytical tool. We have developed a novel,
   high-speed digital XRT method that can be implemented on a standard
   high-resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD) system equipped with a wafer
   translation stage and a microfocus tube (or a small aperture in front of
   a standard point source). It is also appropriate for an in-line fab tool
   with robot loading and automated operation. In this paper, we discuss
   the theory and present examples from work undertaken on a variety of
   materials, including: silicon, compound semiconductors and ionic
   crystals. Reflection and transmission methods are illustrated. Data were
   collected on a HRXRD system with a microfocus source and a CCD detector,
   and an innovative software integration and processing algorithm.
   Algorithms for full automation of the alignment, exposure and data
   collection processes have been worked out. It is estimated that the
   dedicated XRT tool now in prototype form will be capable of scanning a
   full 300 mm wafer in reflection in under two hours at 50 mum resolution
   and can achieve <15 mum resolution.}},

Title = {{The Yarkovsky-driven origin of near-Earth asteroids}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the relevance of the Yarkovsky effect for the origin of
   kilometer and multikilometer near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The Yarkovsky
   effect causes a slow migration in semimajor axis of main belt asteroids,
   some of which are therefore captured into powerful resonances and
   transported to the NEA space. With an innovative simulation scheme, we
   determine that in the current steady-state situation 100-160 bodies with
   H < 18 (roughly larger than 1 km) enter the 3/1 resonance per million
   years and 40-60 enter the nu(6) resonance. The ranges are due to
   uncertainties on relevant simulation parameters such as the time scales
   for collisional disruption and reorientation, their size dependence, and
   the strength of the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. These flux rates to the
   resonances are consistent with those independently derived by Bottke et
   al. (2002, Icarus 156, 399-433) with considerations based only on the
   NEA orbital distribution and dynamical lifetime. Our results have been
   obtained assuming that the main belt contains 1,300,000 asteroids with H
   < 18 and linearly scale with this number. Assuming that the cumulative
   magnitude distribution of main belt asteroids is N(< H) proportional to
   10(gamma'H) with gamma' = 0.25 in the 15.5 < H < 18 range (consistent
   with the results of the SDSS survey), we obtain that the bodies captured
   into the resonances should have a similar magnitude distribution, but
   with exponent coefficient gamma = 0.33-0.40. The lowest value is
   obtained taking into account the YORP effect, while higher values
   correspond to a weakened YORP or to YORP-less cases. These values of
   gamma are all compatible with the debiased magnitude distributions of
   the NEAs according to Rabinowitz et al. (2000, Nature 403, 165-166),
   Bottke et al. (2000b, Science 288, 2190-2194), and Stuart (2001, Science
   294, 1691-1693). Hence the Yarkovsky and YORP effects allow us to
   understand why the magnitude distribution of NEAs is only moderately
   steeper than that of the main belt population. The steepest main belt
   distribution that would still be compatible with the NEA distribution
   has exponent coefficient gamma' similar to 0.3. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative 155 Mb/s burst-mode laser transmitter
   chip, which was designed and successfully demonstrated. arid contains
   several new subsystems: a digitally programmed current source,
   programmable up to 120 mA with a resolution of 0.1 mA. a fast but
   accurate intermittent optical level monitoring circuit, and a digital
   Automatic Power Control (APC) algorithm. This generic arid intelligent
   chip was developed in a standard digital 0.35 mum CMOS process.
   Extensive testing showed a high yield and algorithm stability, as well
   as excellent performance. During initialization, when the transmitter is
   connected to the Passive Optical Network (PON) for the first time.
   maximum three Laser Control Fields (LCF) are needed. with a length of 17
   bytes (0.88 microsecond at 155 Mb/s), to stabilize the laser output
   power. In this short time, the chip can regulate the launched optical
   output power of any FSAN (Full Service Access Network) compliant laser
   diode to the required level, even in the extreme circumstances caused by
   outdoor operation or by battery backup operation during power outages.
   Other tests show that the chip can further stabilize arid track this
   launched optical power with a tolerance lower than 1 dB over a wide
   temperature range. during the burst mode data transmission. The APC
   algorithm intermittently adjusts the optical power to be transmitted in
   a digital way, starting from loosely specified but safe preset values,
   to the required stable logic ``1{''} and ``0{''} level. No laborious
   calibration of the laser characteristic curve and storage of the
   calibration values in lookup tables are needed, nor any off-chip
   adjustable component. The power consumption is significantly reduced by
   disabling inactive circuitry arid by gating the digital high-speed
   clock. Although this laser transmitter was developed for FSAN PON
   applications, which are standardized at a speed of 155 Mb/s upstream,
   the design concept is quite generic arid can be applied for developing a
   wide range of burst mode laser transmitters, such as required for
   Gigabit PON systems or other TDMA networks.}},

Title = {{A geographic information systems based landscape classification model to
   enhance soil survey: A southern Illinois case study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative geographic information systems
   (GIS)-based model that can assist soil scientists in soil survey by
   providing quantitative data on soils and landscape characteristics.
   Using GIS data exploration techniques, nine data layers (percent slope,
   slope length, profile curvature, tangential curvature, mean curvature,
   flow accumulation, flow tine density, distance to troughs, and distance
   to summits) were extracted from U.S. Geological Survey 30-m (98-43 ft)
   digital elevation models. A G IS clustering algorithm identified 50
   landscape signatures from the nine data layers. A maximum likelihood
   discriminate analysis classifier was employed using the nine data layers
   and the 50 landscape signatures to create landscape classification
   information. This model provides an objective understanding of the
   soil-landscape relationship. The model was tested at a case study site
   in a quarter section of Massac County, Illinois, an area of homogeneous
   loess. Preliminary analysis indicates that the statistical relevance of
   the model is high, as a regression equation obtained a coefficient of
   determination (R-2) of .88. Thus the potential predictive capabilities
   of the model are great, and should be extended to heterogeneous
   landscapes through further testing. This GIS landscape model could be
   used by soil scientists to advance their knowledge of the soil-landscape
   relationship, and ultimately enhance soil survey in the future.
   The objective of this research is to develop a quantitative tool to
   model landscape elements using GIS and digital elevation models for
   application in soil survey. Soils are closely related to the landforms
   in which they reside. Hall and Olson (1991) observed that landscapes
   have a strong nonrandom variability component, which makes landscapes
   predictable, and since soils are strongly related to landscapes they
   should also be predictable. Quantitative procedures are available, but
   are sometimes met with resistance that can impede progress within soil
   survey. The next generation of soil survey needs to incorporate a major
   conceptual change in the way soils are mapped, specifically a change in
   the cartographic model. A continuous mapping cartographic model should
   be the future of soil survey. But this requires changing current views
   about the spatial distribution of soil. The current view that ``soil
   types fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle{''} (USDA-NRCS, 1999:
   P. 26) needs to be replaced with the view that soils are a continuum
   with spatial variations. Indeed this model bridges the gap between the
   ``discrete{''} mapping of current soil survey and the ``continuous{''}
   mapping efforts of the future.}},

Abstract = {{Digital radiography (DR) has become integral to modern diagnostic
   radiology. One of the earliest forms of DR, computed radiography (CR)
   using storage phosphors, has established itself as the mainstay of
   DR-based diagnostic imaging over the past 20 years. More recently,
   flat-panel DR systems based on solid state X-ray detectors with
   integrated, large-area, active-matrix readout electronics are promising
   further improvements in clinical workflow and image quality. Despite
   CR's longevity, innovations continue to be made. New developments in CR
   screen technologies, like structured (needle) screens, and new scanner
   concepts based on line-at-a-time reading promise major improvements in
   image quality (comparable to that of flat-panel systems), system
   throughput and physical size, at a cost comparable to that of today's
   systems.Thus, despite the advent of flat-panel acquisition systems,there
   will still be an important role for CR in the foreseeable future. After
   a brief review of the current state of CR technology,this paper will
   explore several of these new CR developments and present some examples
   of their potential clinical impact.}},

Abstract = {{Timely introduction of emerging new technologies that substitute for
   existing technologies is essential for enhancing a nation's
   international competitiveness in a globalizing economy. However, such
   substitution is generally slow because of a lack of information about
   new technologies, fear of substitution and a reluctance to pay the cost
   of switching to new technologies. While hasty substitution sometimes
   accomplishes nothing, delayed substitution can result in a loss of
   national competitiveness. Thus, policy options for the diffusion orbits
   of competitive innovations are crucial. This is particularly the case
   with respect to Japan's transition from analog to digital TV
   broadcasting, as the Japanese government, in order to minimize the
   impact of a transition delay, is urging a rapid shift from analog to
   digital TV broadcasting.
   In an ecosystem, in order to maintain sustainable development,
   predator-prey systems demonstrate a sophisticated balance. Given that an
   ecosystem can be used as a masterpiece system, this sophisticated
   balance provides suggestive ideas in deciding an optimal orbit of
   competitive innovations.
   This paper analyzes the optimal orbit for Japan's transition from analog
   to digital TV broadcasting, and on the basis of an application of
   Lotka-Volterra equations that analyze the sophisticated balance of
   predator-prey systems, it demonstrates the optimality of the Japanese
   government's scenario for shifting from analog to digital TV
   broadcasting. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The early applications of microarrays and detection technologies have
   been centered on DNA-based applications. The application of array
   technologies to proteomics is now occurring at a rapid rate. Numerous
   researchers have begun to develop technologies for the creation of
   microarrays of protein-based screening tools. The stability of antibody
   molecules when bound to surfaces has made antibody arrays a starting
   point for proteomic microarray technology. To minimize disadvantages due
   to size and availability, some researchers have instead opted for
   antibody fragments, antibody mimics or phage display technology to
   create libraries for protein chips. Even further removed from antibodies
   are libraries of aptamers, which are single-stranded oligonucleotides
   that express high affinity for protein molecules. A variation on the
   theme of protein chips arrayed with antibody mimics or other protein
   capture ligand is that of affinity MS where the protein chips are
   directly placed in a mass spectrometer for detection. Other approaches
   include the creation of intact protein microarrays directly on glass
   slides or chips. Although many of the proteins may likely be denatured,
   successful screening has been demonstrated. The investigation of
   protein-protein interactions has formed the basis of a technique called
   yeast two-hybrid. In this method, yeast ``bait{''} proteins can be
   probed with other yeast ``prey{''} proteins fused to DNA binding
   domains. Although the current interpretation of protein arrays
   emphasizes microarray grids of proteins or ligands on glass slides or
   chips, 2-D gels are technically macroarrays of authentic proteins. In an
   innovative departure from the traditional concept of protein chips, some
   researchers are implementing microfluidic printing of arrayed
   chemistries on individual protein spots blotted onto membranes. Other
   researchers are using in-jet printing technology to create protein
   microarrays on chips. The rapid growth of proteomics and the active
   climate for new technology is driving a new generation of companies and
   academic efforts that are developing novel protein microarray techniques
   for the future. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that asteroid families have steeper absolute magnitude
   (H) distributions for H < 12-13 values than the background population.
   Beyond this threshold, the shapes of the absolute magnitude
   distributions in the family/background populations are difficult to
   determine, primarily because both populations are not yet
   observationally complete. Using a recently generated catalog containing
   the proper elements of 106,284 main belt asteroids and an innovative
   approach, we debiased the absolute magnitude distribution of the major
   asteroid families relative to the local background populations. Our
   results indicate that the magnitude distributions of asteroid families
   are generally not steeper than those of the local background populations
   for H > 13 (i.e., roughly for diameters smaller than 10 km). In
   particular, most families have shallower magnitude distributions than
   the background in the range 15-17 mag. Thus, we conclude that, contrary
   to previous speculations, the population of kilometer-size asteroids in
   the main belt is dominated by background bodies rather than by members
   of the most prominent asteroid families. We believe this result explains
   why the Spacewatch, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and Subaru asteroid
   surveys all derived a shallow magnitude distribution for the dimmer
   members of the main belt population.
   We speculate on a few dynamical and collisional scenarios that can
   explain this shallow distribution. One possibility is that the original
   magnitude distributions of the families (i.e., at the moment of the
   formation event) were very shallow for H larger than similar to 13, and
   that most families have not yet had the time to collisionally evolve to
   the equilibrium magnitude distribution that presumably characterizes the
   background population. A second possibility is that family members
   smaller than about 10 km, eroded over time by collisional and dynamical
   processes, have not yet been repopulated by the break-up of larger
   family members. For this same reason, the older (and possibly
   characterized by a weaker impact strength) background population shows a
   shallow distribution in the range 15-60 km. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Tangibles, in the form of physical artefacts that are electronically
   augmented and enhanced to trigger various digital events to happen, have
   the potential for providing innovative ways for children to play and
   learn, through novel forms of interacting and discovering. They offer,
   in addition, the scope for bringing playfulness back into learning. To
   this end, we designed an adventure game, where pairs of children have to
   discover as much as they can about a virtual imaginary creature called
   the Snark, through collaboratively interacting with a suite of
   tangibles. Underlying the design of the tangibles is a variety of
   transforms, which the children have to understand and reflect upon in
   order to make the Snark come alive and show itself in a variety of
   morphological and synaesthesic forms. The paper also reports on the
   findings of a study of the Snark game and discusses what it means to be
   engrossed in playful learning. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Journal = {{PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{223-247}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The major purpose of this article is to examine new dynamics in the
   economic spaces in the Pacific Rim with regard to the recent transition
   of the techno-economic paradigm. The logic of the new dynamics is
   related to the importance of regions or places in the space of flows and
   in the creation and transfer of knowledge in the Internet era. It is
   clear that most of the flows are directional and are grounded in
   physical places via material flows and social relations. Place becomes
   even more important in the era of the digital economy, due to the need
   for spatial proximity in the transfer of tacit knowledge. Three major
   patterns can be identified. First, innovation centers and
   knowledge-intensive service centers have been newly developed in the
   Asian Pacific Rim. Second, regional innovation systems are emerging in
   some of the major metropolitan areas of this part of the world, while
   diverse types of regional innovation systems have been developed with
   the restructuring of existing innovation centers and newly emerging
   innovation clusters. Third, diverse city regions have been developed and
   interactions between both sides of the Pacific Rim will be strengthened
   through business networks and innovation networks.}},

Abstract = {{AGILE (Light Imager for Gamma-ray Astrophysics) is the first small
   scientific mission of ASI, the Italian Space Agency. It is a light (100
   kg for the scientific instrument) satellite for the detection of
   gamma-ray sources in the energy range 30 MeV-50 GeV within a large field
   of view (1 of the sky). It is planned to be operational in the years
   2003-2006, a period in which no other gamma-ray mission in the same
   energy range is foreseen.
   AGILE is made of a silicon tungsten tracker, a CsI(Tl) minicalorimeter
   (1.5X(0)), an anticoincidence system of segmented plastic scintillators
   and a X-ray imaging detector sensitive in the 10-40 keV range. The
   tracker consists of 14 planes, each of them made of two layers of 16
   single-sided, AC coupled, 410 mum thick, 9.5 x 9.5 cm(2) silicon
   detectors with a readout pitch of 242 mum and a floating strip. The
   readout ASIC is the TAA1, an analog-digital, low noise, self-triggering
   ASIC used in a very low power configuration (<400 \&mu;W/channel) with
   full analog readout. The trigger of the satellite is given by the
   tracker. The total number of readout channels is around 43 000.
   We present a detailed description of the tracker, its trigger and
   readout logic, its assembly procedures and the prototype performance in
   several testbeam periods at the CERN PS. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {{Sharing digital teaching resources: Breaking down barriers by addressing
   the concerns of faculty members}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. Regional and institutional databases have been created to
   improve access to educational resources and to avert unnecessary
   duplication. The growth and success of these databases depend upon the
   willingness of faculty members to contribute their materials. This
   qualitative study seeks to identify the barriers that block the free
   exchange of educational multimedia and the incentives that could be
   created to overcome educators' concerns.
   Method. In 2001, 34 faculty members from 13 U.S. medical schools each
   participated in one of five focus groups. They responded to three
   hypothetical scenarios depicting opportunities for sharing educational
   resources. Participants' responses were categorized hierarchically and
   sent back to them for feedback.
   Results. Participants strongly supported multimedia databases,
   particularly those that serve a national audience. Obstacles for
   contributing materials included the lack of institutional recognition
   for educational innovation, confusing intellectual property policies,
   the hassle involved in sharing materials, and the perceived commercial
   potential of the materials. Peer review of educational materials was
   seen as an important incentive.
   Conclusions. Medical schools could benefit from the free exchange of
   high-quality educational multimedia but need to address the concerns of
   faculty by clarifying institutional copyright rules, streamlining the
   donation process, and providing assistance with cataloging assets.
   Removing departmental pressures to commercialize materials and
   recognizing peer-reviewed donations as academic achievement could foster
   a culture of sharing.}},

Abstract = {{SIREV (Sec. tor Imaging Radar for Enhanced Vision) is an innovative
   airborne radar system which can supply high-quality images in any
   desired direction under almost every weather condition. In contrast to
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, no relative motion between
   sensor and targets is required, in SIREV. The high frame repetition
   frequency in SIREV allows to detect even very rapid changes in the
   imaged scenes. Besides providing a map of the earth's surface, the
   complex-valued radar images can be further processed to supply
   additional information about the topography and objects in the field of
   view. A fast processing algorithm has been developed for SIREN which
   allows a very accurate, phase preserving and efficient image formation.
   A prototype of a forward-looking SIREN system has been built up at the
   German Aerospace Center and raw data were obtained by a first
   demonstration flight using a helicopter as a moving platform. Motion
   errors of the platform could be extracted from the range compressed raw
   data avoiding the need of an inertial navigation system. The data
   processing results show good agreement with the theory. After image
   formation, coherent and incoherent image averaging processes have been
   applied to improve the image quality. The evaluation of the
   computational effort shows that a real-time hardware realization can be
   carried out using off-the-shelf digital components. (C) 2002 Editions

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: A clear understanding of the intricate spatial relationships
   among the structures of the pelvic floor, rectum, and anal canal is
   essential for the treatment of numerous pathologic conditions.
   Virtual-reality technology allows improved visualization of
   three-dimensional structures over conventional media because it supports
   stereoscopic-vision, viewer-centered perspective, large angles of view,
   and interactivity. We describe a novel virtual reality-based model
   designed to teach anorectal and pelvic floor anatomy, pathology, and
   surgery. METHODS: A static physical model depicting the pelvic floor and
   anorectum was created and digitized at I-mm intervals in a CT scanner.
   Multiple software programs were used along with endoscopic images to
   generate a realistic interactive computer model, which was designed to
   be viewed on a networked, interactive, virtual-reality display (CAVE(R)
   or ImmersaDesk(R)). A standard examination of ten basic anorectal and
   pelvic floor anatomy questions was administered to third-year (n = 6)
   and fourth-year (n = 7) surgical residents. A workshop using the Virtual
   Pelvic Floor Model was then given, and the standard examination was
   readministered so that it was possible to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the Digital Pelvic Floor Model as an educational instrument. RESULTS:
   Training on the Virtual Pelvic Floor Model produced substantial
   improvements in the overall average test scores for the two groups, with
   an overall increase of 41 percent (P = 0.001) and 21 percent (P =
   0.0007) for third-year and fourth-year residents, respectively. Resident
   evaluations after the workshop also confirmed the effectiveness of
   understanding pelvic anatomy using the Virtual Pelvic Floor Model.
   CONCLUSION: This model provides an innovative interactive educational
   framework that allows educators to overcome some of the barriers to
   teaching surgical and endoscopic principles based on understanding
   highly complex three-dimensional anatomy. Using this collaborative,
   shared virtual-reality environment, teachers and students can interact
   from locations world-wide to manipulate the components of this model to
   achieve the educational goals of this project along with the potential
   for virtual surgery.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an innovative, low-power, high-performance, programmable
   signal processor (DSP) for digital communications. The architecture of
   this processor is characterized by its explicit design for low-power
   implementations, its innovative ability to jointly exploit
   instruction-level parallelism and data-level parallelism to achieve high
   performance, its suitability as a target for an optimizing high-level
   language compiler, and its explicit replacement of hardware resources by
   compile-time practices. We describe the methodology used in the
   development of the processor, highlighting the techniques deployed to
   enable application/architecture/compiler/implementation co-development,
   and the optimization approach and metric used for power-performance
   evaluation and trade off analysis. We summarize the salient features of
   the architecture, provide a brief description of the hardware
   organization, and discuss the compiler techniques used to exercise these
   features. We also summarize the simulation environment and associated
   software development tools. Coding examples from two representative
   kernels in the digital communications domain are also provided. The
   resulting methodology, architecture, and compiler represent an advance
   of the state of the art in the area of low-power, domain-specific
   microprocessors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative approach called box method for feature
   extraction for the recognition of handwritten characters. In this
   method, the binary image of the character is partitioned into a fixed
   number of subimages called boxes. The features consist of vector
   distance (gamma) from each box to a fixed point. To find gamma the
   vector distances of all the pixels, lying in a particular box, from the
   fixed point are calculated and added up and normalized by the number of
   pixels within that box. Here, both neural networks and fuzzy logic
   techniques are used for recognition and recognition rates are found to
   be around 97 percent using neural networks and 98 percent using fuzzy
   logic. The methods are independent of font, size and with minor changes
   in preprocessing, it can be adopted for any language. (C) 2002 Pattern

Abstract = {{Objective. The purpose of this research is to examine why some states
   have embraced digital government more extensively than others. Methods.
   Multivariate regression analysis is used to empirically test
   explanations for state innovation in e-government. The primary dependent
   variable is the percent of state-level government websites offering
   online services to citizens. Results. Republican-controlled legislatures
   are more likely to embrace e-government, implying that efficiency
   concerns may drive reliance on digital government. Innovators in
   e-government were states with fewer households with Internet access and
   less use of the initiative process, indicating that citizen demand was
   not a factor. More extensive use of e-government is also associated with
   legislative professionalization and professional networks-factors that
   may be useful for explaining the diffusion of other administrative
   reforms, and technical issues lacking political salience. Conclusions.
   These data suggest e-government implementation is driven by legislative
   professionalism and, to a lesser extent, state professional networks,
   rather than citizen demand. These indicators fit Lowi's (1972)
   conception of ``constituent policy{''} as a top-down process, confined
   to administrative or legislative circles, compared to distributive,
   regulatory, and redistributive policy. We hypothesize that other
   administrative reforms, particularly those lacking political salience,
   may exhibit similar relationships with legislative professionalization
   and professional networks.}},

Abstract = {{The processes of technological innovation have been widely researched,
   but their interactions with another type of innovation that is
   particularly important in sectors like the fashion and the media content
   industries have been neglected: stylistic innovation. This paper puts
   forward the idea that a better understanding of such interactions
   between content and technology in the media industries might help
   explaining differences in the receptiveness of firms towards new
   technological opportunities. The nature of the interactions, so it is
   argued in this paper, depends on three groups of key factors at the
   level of the product, the organization and the industry: among them,
   first, the locations of the different types of innovation in the media
   product's components; second, organizational factors like the identity
   and the reputation of a firm with respect to the above types of
   innovation; and third, the industry-specific characteristics of the
   certification environment in which the firms operate. Awards are
   discussed as specific instantiations of micro certification environments
   indicating quality with respect to stylistic and/or technological
   product features. To round off the theoretical part, a definition of
   stylistic innovation is developed with reference to the key concepts
   discussed in this paper. Within the media sector the literary publishing
   industry has been chosen to provide the subject of the empirical part.
   Two cases related to the introduction of eBook technology are presented:
   one is a study of the first digital literary publisher in Europe and the
   other is a case study of the first international eBook award, which
   mixes technological and stylistic criteria. Theory and cases lead to a
   number of hypotheses offered as potential departure points for future
   research into the interactions between innovation in style and
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated, multimedia-geographic information system (GIS) approach
   to inventorying and characterizing thirty-nine wetland sites identified
   on the Winnebago Upper Pool Lakes in Wisconsin, USA was developed.
   Available black-and-white aerial photographs recorded in 1937, 1957, and
   1981 and color digital orthophotos of 2000 were employed as primary data
   sources to develop a spatio-temporal GIS database using a combination of
   digital image processing, GIS, Global Positioning System (GPS), and
   field survey techniques. Ten representative sites were selected to
   investigate the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of
   the wetland habitat in the study area further. Multimedia information as
   text, graphics, ground photographs, and digital video was then developed
   to highlight the ecosystem function and structure of those
   representative wetlands. A computer-based interactive multimedia system,
   consisting of a graphical user interface and a GIS application module,
   was constructed to allow easy access to both the spatial data sets and
   the multimedia information. Given the increased concern over
   environmental preservation, expansion of urban development, and
   agricultural land use, it is anticipated that the database will prove
   valuable for a series of management tasks. The integrated approach
   provides an innovative way for integrating, analyzing, and presenting
   wetland information, thus enabling truly interactive collaborations
   among resource managers, policy makers, researchers, and stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{The central nervous system of crayfish consists of a chain of segmental
   ganglia that are linked by cables of intersegmental axons. Each ganglion
   contains a highly-ordered core of longitudinal tracts, vertical tracts,
   commissures, and synaptic neuropils. We review from a technical
   perspective the history of the description of these ganglia, and
   recognize four episodes of progress. Each major innovation in anatomical
   methods has led to new insight into the structure and function of this
   nervous system, and new awareness of the structural patterns that are
   common to the CNS of all arthropods. Ganglia in different segments of
   the body differ in size, and appear to differ in anatomy. From a
   comparison of the structures of the cores of abdominal, thoracic, and
   subesophageal ganglia, we argue that this apparent difference is
   illusory. Rather, each of these ganglia is organized on the same plan, a
   plan also found in insect segmental ganglia. The apparent differences
   follow from longitudinal compression during development and from
   allometric growth of particular neuropils associated with innervation of
   the walking legs. Different authors have described the internal
   organization of ganglia in different segments, so we provide a
   cross-reference to the nomenclatures they have introduced. We compare
   the locations of cell bodies of motor neurons and accessory neurons that
   innervate different peripheral structures, and demonstrate
   double-labeling of certain GABAergic peripheral inhibitory neurons.
   Finally, we describe the construction of digital movies of serial
   sections of these ganglia, and discuss their utility. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Esthetically appealing, externally invisible, lingually applied
   orthodontic brackets are in increasing demand. Because the brackets are
   placed lingually, however, they appear to cause some problems with
   respect to speech. This study is the first to present a prospective
   evaluation of the articulation of 23 patients with lingual brackets by
   means of an innovative combination of test methods. An acoustic,
   objective evaluation of articulation measured by digital sonagraphy was
   related to a semiobjective auditive evaluation by 10 speech
   professionals, to a semiobjective auditive evaluation by close contacts
   of the patients, and to a subjective auditive evaluation by the patients
   themselves, the latter 2 using standardized questionnaires. The tests
   were performed before (T1), within 24 hours after (T2), and 3 months
   (+/- 1 week) after (T3) the start of therapy. In comparison with the
   initial findings, a significant deterioration in articulation was
   recorded with all test methods at T2 and T3. Using a new combination of
   methods, our investigations show the need for detailed briefing of
   patients about the extent and duration of changes in speech resulting
   from lingual brackets.}},

Abstract = {{The basic job of a public key infrastructure (PKI) is to define the
   mechanisms used both to allow a recipient of a signed message to trust a
   digital signature and to allow a sender to find the encryption key for a
   recipient. It is comprised of those elements needed to manage and enable
   the effective use of public key cryptography technology, particularly in
   medium and large-scale. Nowadays, PKIs are considered to be a key
   element for providing security to new distributed application
   environments. However, the sole use of a PKI as a mechanism to create a
   link between an identifier and a public key is not enough to offer
   effective mechanisms to those environments. New security services based
   on PKI try to address some existing drawbacks of current distributed
   systems. On the one hand, they can provide mechanisms to alleviate the
   lack of support for decentralized and automated management of access
   control and authorization policies, which are usually configured using
   inefficient and error-prone methods. On the other hand, new security
   services can also be used to link authorization information to the
   public keys being certified by the PKI, therefore enabling new
   opportunities for. distributed access control procedures. In this paper,
   we describe two of these innovative security services built over our own
   designed and implemented Java. IPv6 PKI: a distributed security policy
   management architecture and a distributed credential management system.

Abstract = {{Drawing on the theoretical work of Hill et al. and Straub et al., this
   study examines culture-specific inducements and impediments to using the
   Internet in the Arab world. Research questions were 1) to what extent
   does the process of technology culturation affect the acceptance of the
   Internet 2) to what extent do social norms (SNs) affect the acceptance
   of the Internet?
   Of the two research methods employed, the first was a quantitative field
   study of knowledge workers. The instrument measured the extent to which
   respondents and their organizations are influenced by advanced
   technology cultures. Using partial least squares (PLS), the first of two
   models tested links between SNs; technological culturation and Internet
   usage for each respondent. The second model investigated links between
   technological culturation and Internet utilization for the respondent's
   organization. Findings show strong support for both models, explaining,
   respectively, 47\% and 37\% of the variance. The second method was a
   qualitative analysis of respondents' free-format comments, These
   findings reinforce the quantitative findings, on the one hand, and
   reveal additional cultural barriers that still need to be studied, on
   the other. Findings identify how culture can both inhibit and encourage
   technological innovation and how Arab cultures can move their economies
   more quickly into the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We report our management of stage 11 testicular nonseminomatous
   germ cell tumor in 2 patients with horseshoe kidney and discuss the
   technical challenges posed by this renal fusion anomaly. The embryology
   and clinical anatomy of horseshoe kidney are discussed with particular
   reference to the anomalous vascular pattern and routes of testicular
   lymphatic drainage in this setting. Modifications and innovations of the
   standard technique of retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in the presence of
   horseshoe kidney are discussed in light of our experience with these
   patients at 2 major tertiary care cancer centers. The significance of
   contemporary advanced noninvasive radiological techniques, such as
   helical computerized tomographic angiography with digital 3-dimensional
   reconstruction and magnetic resonance angiography, in the surgical
   planning and safe performance of surgery is emphasized.
   Materials and Methods: Two young male patients treated at 2 major
   American teaching hospitals who had coexistent stage II testicular
   nonseminomatous germ cell tumor and horseshoe kidney underwent salvage
   retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.
   Results: There was no evidence of recurrence in these 2 patients 12 and
   15 months after surgery, respectively.
   Conclusions: Horseshoe kidney poses special technical problems during
   retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy for testicular tumors due to anomalous
   renal and intra-abdominal vascular patterns. Helical computerized
   tomography angiography is useful for meticulous surgical planning and
   the safe performance of surgery in this setting.}},

Abstract = {{Digital identities and profiles are precious assets. On one hand they
   enable users to engage in transactions and interactions on the Internet.
   On the other hand, abuses and leakages of this information could violate
   the privacy of their owners, sometimes with serious consequences.
   Nowadays most of the people have limited understanding of security and
   privacy policies when applied to their confidential information and
   little control over the destiny of this information once it has been
   disclosed to third parties. In most cases this is a matter of trust.
   This document describes an innovative approach and related mechanisms to
   enforce users' privacy by putting users in control and making
   organizations more accountable. As part of our ongoing research
   activity, we introduce a technical solution based on sticky policies and
   tracing services that leverages Identifier-based Encryption (IBE) and
   TCPA technologies. Work is in progress to build a full working prototype
   and deploy it in a real-life environment.}},

Abstract = {{Space applications have very stringent requirements in term of system
   integration and packaging density efficiency. For instance, the on-board
   data processing package for Telecommunication Digital Payload requires
   large and fast memory resources. Despite the diminution of the Power
   Supply level, the power consumption of the application, as well as its
   size and weight has increased.(1)
   The system integration goals cannot be met by integrating new functions
   because of the niche nature of the space market which doesn't allow to
   amortize the cost of new designs with every new silicon technology
   generation, or the merging of antagonist technologies on the same die
   (CMOS and AsGa, Analog and Digital, ...)
   The packaging density, as it will be described, can be improved through
   specific 2-D package styles (BGA like) and specific die assembly
   technics (flip-chip), but, so far, it was not sufficient to offer an
   affordable answer to both challenges: system integration and packaging
   density.
   A solution for miniaturizing these applications is the use of a 3-D
   interconnection technology allowing significant board space and weight
   reduction as well as performance enhancement by reduction of the
   interconnection parasitic elements and buffer stages. In addition, this
   is a competitive alternative to monolithic larger size memories,
   potentially minimizing or delaying next generation development costs.
   The paper will describe the technology and the performances of a cost
   effective, very integrated and versatile 16 Mb to 64 Mb SRAM Module
   designed within a consortium including ATMEL, France, and 3D PLUS,
   France. This Memory module achieves a density of 5 to 20 Mb SRAM per
   cm(2) and 0.11 to 0.45 g per 1 Mb SRAM. It is based on monolithic 1 Mb
   or 4 Mb RAD Tolerant SRAM die from ATMEL and is integrated using the 3D
   PLUS space qualified 3-D packaging technology.
   The 3-D technology being ideally suited to System-In-Package
   applications (e.g. computer modules,...) was already base lined for
   various European Space Missions like Rosetta, Mars Express,...and the
   paper will demonstrate how it helps populating an innovative product and
   packaging road map for Space applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an innovative software-defined radio (SDR) approach to
   advanced communication design lab courseware is proposed and illustrated
   by an audio-band OFDM transceiver design example. To implement this new
   approach, it only needs the most common PC sound card and Matlab
   software, making such a lab course extremely easy to setup at a minimum
   cost. Moreover, all system parameters and algorithms are embodied in the
   form of high-level RX and TX programs, which can be modified and tested
   very flexibly. In this aspect, this approach has all the advantages of
   simulation-based experiments. However, it further touches the real-world
   implementational issues. A real-world passband signal in audio band can
   be physically generated and simultaneously recorded by the full-duplex
   sound card, and then the received digitized signal can be demodulated by
   an SDR receiver which implements all the required DSP algorithms in
   Matlab code.}},

Abstract = {{Java Digital Signal Processing (J-DSP+) is a java-based object-oriented
   programming environment that was developed at Arizona State University
   (ASU) for use in undergraduate- and graduate-level engineering classes.
   J-DSP is written as a platform-independent Java applet that resides on
   the web and is thereby accessible by all students using a web browser.
   In this paper, we describe an innovative software extension to J-DSP,
   called 2D J-DSP, to accommodate on-line laboratories for two-dimensional
   digital signal processing. Two-D DSP capabilities in J-DSP include: 2D
   signal generation, 2D FIR filter design \& implementation, and 2D
   transforms. Image processing capabilities include: Image Restoration and
   Enhancement. In order to illustrate 2D concepts graphically, contour
   (2D) and perspective (3D) plots have been incorporated in 2D J-DSP.
   Online laboratory exercises have been developed in the aforementioned
   areas for use in the graduate-level Multidimensional Signal Processing
   and Image Processing courses at ASU, and are posted on the web site
   (http://idsp.asu.edu). Statistical and qualitative evaluations that
   assess the learning experiences of the students that use 2D J-DSP are

   Several tools based on simulation techniques exist which support the

   contrast to this, we introduce an innovative approach to realize the
   Digital Plant. Rest upon 3D graphical simulation we are able to process
   enlarged simulation models using distributed computing of the complex
   environment. The flexibility of the evolved interface between
   simulator's instances facilitates the coupling of other simulation tools
   to our system. Adapted from the identical interface we connect real
   controller systems to the partitions to simulate production control. The
   integration of the different software components extends the use of
   manufacturing simulation. In this article, we focus on distributing and

   navigation space is very narrow, there are many blood vessels and
   delicate structures which could be damaged by manoeuvres and large
   forces and, finally, the Cerebro-Spinal Fluid (CSF) is a peculiar
   environment which must be preserved. An innovative method for active
   safe navigation in the sub-arachnoid space has been devised, based on
   hydrojets sustentation of the endoscope. The hydrojets, if appropriately
   tuned and oriented, allow the tip of the endoscope to avoid the delicate
   structures of the spinal cord and could also assist propulsion. A MATLAB
   simulation of the hydrojets is illustrated and a digital controller for
   the regulation of the hydrojets is demonstrated. The pressure ripple is
   about 5\%, as tested experimentally on a 2D simulator. A prototype of
   steerable microendoscope whose tip is equipped with hydrojets has been
   fabricated and tested in an artificial path simulating the sub-arachnoid
   space. Performance are quite interesting.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the study and implementation of a three-phase
   three-level pre-regulator rectifier with digital control using a DSP.
   The structure has a common capacitive center point that allows the
   three-level operation and a low blocking-voltage stress on the power
   switches (half of dc-link voltage). The reduction of blocking voltage
   allows the use of low cost and low losses power devices, increasing the
   efficiency and the power density with reduced production cost. The
   control technique used aims to obtain power factor correction (PFC),
   regulated and balanced output voltages. With the advance of DSP
   controllers, digital control is increasingly used in power converts
   systems and offers a number of advantages like more flexibility: in
   modification code and less sensitive to noise. However, sampling time
   delay, resolution of A/D converter, word length of DSP and instructions
   cycle time are disadvantages over analog control. Nowadays, control
   optimized DSP's deliver high performance, great code efficiency and
   optimal peripheral integration for the digital control with high level
   on-chip integration to deliver system cost reduction, and powerful
   computational abilities that enable software innovation then reducing
   disadvantages of a digital control. The DSP used is the ADMC401 from
   ANALOG DEVICES}},

Abstract = {{Engineering drawings are ubiquitously used for capturing, conveying and
   archiving innovative engineering designs. Many engineering companies'
   core intellectual property resides in their proprietary engineering
   drawings. Therefore, protection of such vital data is extremely
   important. This paper provides a swap-transformation matrix based
   approach to scramble engineering drawings in order to enable
   confidentiality. An engineering drawing involves the topological
   information and vertex information. The vertex information is more
   valuable than the topological information, since the vertices
   information primarily determine the content of engineering drawings. We
   argue that the vertex information is more valuable than the topological
   information, even if some topological information is lost, a drawing may
   be reconstructed from the vertex positions. We provide for three keys to
   ensure the security of the drawing. The technique can facilitate digital
   rights management of engineering drawings. The advantages of our
   technique are that scrambling is computationally less intensive than
   encryption and it allows for partial obfuscation.}},

Abstract = {{Array sensors such as Focal Plane Array Detectors, IR Imagers, X-Ray
   detectors and the like, have dense arrays of detector cells that capture
   ultra-low levels of energy. The energy received in each array pixel is
   in the form of low levels of UV, IR, or visible light, X-Rays,
   microwaves or other electromagnetic energy and is converted in each
   array pixel into electrical signals. These sensor arrays are used in
   military imaging or detection or in medical or industrial diagnostic
   imagining. In all of these areas, the pixel density is being continually
   increased as fabrication photolithography attains finer resolution and
   the device performance is improved. This leads to arrays with ever
   decreasing levels of stored energy per pixel and ever-increasing number
   of pixels per device. These trends lead to lower pixel output signals
   that are more susceptible to interconnect signal losses, cross-talk and
   external noise, all of which are made worse by the increase in the
   number of pixels and in the pixel density. One approach to overcoming
   these issues is to move the signal processing closer to the array,
   minimizing the number of interconnects and the interconnect length the
   raw pixel signal outputs must travel prior to pre-processing, such as
   amplification, noise suppression, and digitization. One innovative
   approach to achieving this is to use 3-D stacking of the preprocessing
   electronics for each pixel directly behind the sensor array. This paper
   will describe the development of a high density, 3-D stacking technology
   that is being applied to an 8000 pixel array sensor.}},

Abstract = {{the wireless communication market, trends are moving towards smaller
   size, fewer parts, longer lifetime and higher frequency operation. These
   trends imply that wireless communications circuits must incorporate
   higher integration and that their design and IC technology must be
   optimized for low power and high frequency system. One innovative method
   to increase the frequency of programmable divider is discussed. The new
   method not only increases the frequency of operation but also decreases
   circuit complexity and power dissipation. This new design use
   synchronous counters instead of asynchronous counters. The digital gates
   are optimized for minimum propagation delay and loading effect using
   progressive sizing of the transistors. This is better configuration in
   every aspect in terms of frequency, power dissipation and chip area.}},

Abstract = {{The digital revolution and the increased value accorded information have
   elevated expectations regarding the timeliness, relevance, reliability,
   comparability and scope of statistics. This is particularly true within
   the context of the European Union, where exacting requisitions are made
   of all countries, regardless of the efficacy of their statistical
   systems. At the same time, there is a constant pressure to reduce data
   collection costs, lighten the burden on data providers and protect
   confidentiality. Such demands require traditional statistical concepts,
   measures and technologies to adapt continuously in order to retain their
   pertinence and effectiveness for users.
   A proliferation of new technologies promises to redefine the survey
   process, raising implications for sampling, data collection, analysis
   and dissemination, whilst enhancing the possibilities for secondary and
   comparative data usage. Recognising this, considerable research and
   development effort has been expended within this problem space, often
   yielding potentially far-reaching results. However, realising the
   underlying expectations presents a number of challenges.
   For many years, key stakeholders within the European Statistical System
   have been concerned about the poor take-up of the results of R\&D in
   statistics, notably technological innovations, together with the limited
   transfer of technology and associated know-how amongst statistical
   agencies. Following the under-utilisation of technological outputs from
   both the 3(rd) and 4(th) Framework Projects, AMRADS (an Accompanying
   Measure to Research And Development in Statistics) was initiated in a
   bid to prevent 5(th) Framework products suffering a similar fate. In
   addition to strengthening the conditions for ensuring concrete and
   tangible technology transfer, AMRADS sought to ascertain why some NSIs
   are good at adopting new products and ideas, whilst others are less
   assimilative.
   As the 5(th) Framework draws to a close, this paper explores the reasons
   for the apparent disconnect between the promise of emergent technologies
   and actual applications to the survey process. The experiences of two
   specific European R\&D projects are considered, armed with insight
   secured via AMRADS and recommendations to address the emergent issues
   are made.
   Technological advancement presents a clear means of addressing the
   apparently conflicting demands made of survey producers, but in turn
   introduces a series of organisational, cultural and indeed further
   technological concerns. It is vital that these inherent issues are
   understood and characterised if future innovations are to be fully
   exploited and ultimately, the information needs of policy-makers,
   businesses and the citizen are not to be under-serviced.}},

   of log statistics indicating relatively low use of videos as compared to

   tended to be avid seekers of information, who saw the service as a first
   port of call to obtain general information for wider consultation later.
   Differences emerged between medical professionals and the lay public
   regarding the use of language and involvement of patients in the videos.
   Text was regarded as a better medium for conveying some types of

Abstract = {{Control charts, and their simpler cousins run charts, have found
   widespread application in manufacturing environments - the environment
   in which they were first applied by Dr. Shewart and Dr. Deming. Their
   use, however, was never intended to be so restricted. Control charts are
   ideally suited, and are often the best tool to use when reporting
   performance information - from sales levels to customer satisfaction
   data and from production data to staff turnover and attitude data. The
   need to understand variation is critical in service industries and in
   the public sector and really anywhere people need to get a handle on
   ``what is going on{''}.
   The good news is that organizations are beginning to realize the
   benefits of control charts. They are being used in a variety of
   applications - from quality of life measurements for a major urban area
   to customer satisfaction data, to providing a digital dashboard for a
   medium sized bank, to measuring switching network performance of a
   national cellular provider and even to finance and budgeting. Equally
   important, these organizations are demonstrating real benefits in their
   efforts to better understand, and separate, common cause and special
   cause variation through the control chart.
   This paper first reviews the appropriateness of using control charts in
   these applications and then reviews a number of case studies regarding
   more innovative uses.}},

Abstract = {{In radio frequency application field often arise the need of using
   inductor models whose intrinsic characteristics are correctly
   represented on the basis of the various working frequencies. Several
   publications have treated modeling of integrated inductors based on a
   more or less resistive substrate. Undoubtedly the most interesting
   approaches are those based on distributed models of turns synthesized as
   ladder network. The main disadvantage of these innovative models is
   their intrinsic complexity and therefore the difficulty to implement
   them as spice device models to be easily used in circuit simulation
   tools. Researchers have mainly focused their attention on the modeling
   of inductors based on classic CMOS substrate but there is no work on
   distributed inductor model made on substrate with little resistive
   buried layer. At present, technologies that deal with such profiles are
   integrated in STMicroelectronics for analog and digital designs. In this
   paper, our aim is, firstly, to describe an innovative distributed
   inductor model integrated on substrate with buried layer and, secondly,
   to show an innovative automatic methodology which allows synthesizing,
   through an optimization procedure, an usable spice model based on the
   new model described above.}},

Abstract = {{The US Visible Human Project data set acquired in 1995 consists of a
   visible male and a female, which is the worlds first image resource for
   human simulation. With the production of Chinese Visible Human (CVH)
   male in October 2002 and Visible female in February 2003 at Third
   Military Medical University, China becomes the second country in the
   world which owns Visible Human couple. Hence another image resource for
   human simulation completed. Up to Apt: 6, 2003, the third CVH data set
   was acquired. The data set consists of images of 18398 serial sections
   at 0.1 mm intervals. The images are 11,000,000-pixel resolution.
   Compared with the data set of US VHP the following features of our data
   set represent innovations:
   Acquired from serial sections of the whole body, our data set presents
   no sectional data loss.
   Our digital images achieve a higher resolution.
   Vascular perfusion was performed to allow easier blood vessel
   identification.
   Measures were taken to prevent small structures from falling off from
   milling surface. Thus, integrity of images was ensured.
   The selected subjects were of moderate age, size and height so as to be
   more representative.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is the development of an automatic system which
   could be useful for radiologists in the investigation of breast cancer.
   A breast neoplasia is often marked by the presence of
   microcalcifications and massive lesions in the mammogram: hence the need
   for tools able to recognize such lesions at an early stage. Grid
   Platform Computer-Assisted Library for MAmmography (GPCALMA), a
   collaboration among Italian physicists and radiologists, has built a
   large distributed database of digitized mammographic images (at this
   moment about 5500 images corresponding to 1650 patients). This
   collaboration has developed a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) system
   which, installed in an integrated station, can also be used for
   digitization, as archive, and to perform statistical analysis. With a
   GRID configuration, it would be possible for clinicians tele- and
   co-working in new and innovative groupings ('virtual organizations'),
   and using the whole database, by the GPCALMA tools, several analysis can
   be performed. Furthermore, GPCALMA allows to be abreast of the CAD
   technical progressing into several hospital locations always with remote
   working by GRID connection. We report the results obtained by the
   GPCALMA CAD software implemented with a GRID connection. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The automotive industry is now facing keenest competition due to
   increasing globalization of its business processes. In addition, the
   rapid evolution and the influence of information technology has had an
   innovative impact on engineering processes in the automotive industry.
   This impact is concerned not only with steady enhancements of
   traditional processes but also with crucial transformation of
   engineering processes into completely new concepts. The true integration
   of entire manufacturing processes is being achieved, from the early
   product concept to the finest-grained specifications through the
   extension of the capabilities of digital product models to offer all the
   necessary technological and management information for design and
   manufacturing. Furthermore the availability and flexibility of digital
   process models accommodate the engineering processes throughout the
   product lifecycle. And targeting higher profitability or a stronger
   positioning in the market means relying on efficient technologies for
   designing and managing the overall manufacturing processes through
   maximum reuse of available resources. This paper reviews current trends
   in the integration of product, process, and resources in the area of car
   body engineering using an integrated data model and suitable technology
   and goes on to discuss future trends of implementing cooperative
   engineering methods in the automotive industry in order to improve
   competitiveness by offering attractive products.}},

Abstract = {{Digital printing systems are widely established in traditional as well
   as in newer companies oriented toward print media production and
   publishing. The establishment and the operation of digital printing
   systems within these companies is undertaken with the aims of entering
   new markets, gaining new customers and increasing profit. In particular,
   innovative digital printing characteristics such as short-run, print on
   demand and variable printing appear to offer the possibility of
   producing added-value products in print media markets. However, data
   provided from various studies and surveys, conclude that the
   penetration. of digital printing in print media markets, in as far as
   these characteristics are concerned, have not yet reached their.
   potential. This paper explores the possible reasons for the less than
   expected take up of digital printing and its disappointing degree of
   penetration in print media markets. Among the factors investigated are:
   the maturity of the market, customer behaviour as well as the
   application of appropriate business models. The importance of the
   business models to the content industry will be shown, in terms of their
   relevance to the issue of cross media, with regard to media production
   techniques.}},

   successful advertising systems, as well as absolutely targeted. The
   innovation proposed enables advertisers to combine their infrastructure
   on one media delivery platform and ensures a continuous and superior
   consumer experience. We focus our attention on the idea to use
   interactive advertising methods through cross platform and cross media,
   to achieve integration of media and optimum success for an advertising
   campaign. The first open platform of digital media products and
   applications for any format, operating system or device is also
   introduced. We present our approach towards personalised cross and multi
   platform interactive advertisement, which has been developed as part of
   the Multi Platform Interactive Advertising System (MPIAS) research
   project. Interactive media can significantly involve the consumer in the
   advertising process, far beyond the extent to which traditional media
   can.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Television (DTV) was the first major advance in the television
   industry since the establishment of color TV sets in the 50's. However,
   despite the ambitious anticipations, most DTV operators offering
   subscriber TV services are facing serious economic problems. Many
   believe that significantly increasing the DTV operator revenues is
   closely linked to the provision of advanced interactive TV applications
   which, on one-hand, based on content enhancements will attract more
   subscribers, and on the other hand will also generate indirect revenues
   through services like TV-commerce or on-line betting. In this paper an
   end-to-end interactive TV application is presented. The application has
   been developed for accompanying sport broadcasts, given that sports
   content is very attractive for the majority of subscribers. This
   application enhances sport broadcasts With relevant content (statistics,
   news, information) appearing on user-demand, as well as with an
   innovative interactive entertaining game of predictions challenging
   users to make predictions and to prove their anticipatory skills and
   sport knowledge. The application supports multiple types of forward and
   return channels and STB middleware systems. Furthermore, its components
   can be used in content distribution networks targeting multiple
   network-enabled information appliances.}},

Abstract = {{Globalisation and international competition force the AEC industry to
   change its work and collaboration practices. The traditional way of
   working is evolving into a more integrated process, and the traditional
   use of ``synchronised passive{''} files and paper-based communication is
   being replaced with ICT based solutions. Currently, the AEC community is
   at an intermediate stage, i.e., it is shifting to ``online{''}
   electronic documents. In this paper, a new concept called
   ``eDocument{''} (eDoc) is introduced. The eDoc project is a cooperative
   effort in order to develop and implement a generic dynamically
   structured, multimedia, multi-channel, and multimodal information system
   as a means for communication in AEC projects. The major innovation in
   the concept is that, although it uses a repository, the focus is on the
   ``logical and physical{''} specifications of the eDoc concept as a
   shared tele-workspace that is accessible through multiple platforms.}},

   geometry is and how design process and principles are innovated. Two
   demonstrative projects are presented to illustrate how designers can
   better analyse and define the best choice of medium and design tools,

Abstract = {{Digital libraries can support education, as is being shown through work
   on the US National Science Digital Library. We explain this approach,
   highlighting issues and innovations, by considering three case studies.
   The Digital Library in a Box project aims to make construction of
   digital libraries fast, easy, and effective, building upon a suite of
   powerful components. The Computing and Information Technology
   Interactive Digital Educational Library (CITIDEL) project supports the
   community interested in computing-related areas with a large and growing
   collection of resources and services. The OCKHAM project aims to move
   the DL field into a next generation, through peer-to-peer services,
   lightweight reference models, lightweight protocols, and pools of
   components. Altogether, these parts of NSDL suggest that it is possible
   for many nations to support teaching and learning with digital
   libraries, and that it may be time to launch an International Education
   Digital Library Association.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a roadmap of emerging legal problems in the area
   of Digital Rights Management (DRM). It argues against adopting
   fundamentalist viewpoints in the DRM policy debate. In particular, DRM
   technology is much more flexible than many DRM critics acknowledge. The
   article covers various problems that are less frequently discussed in
   legal and policy circles. It analyzes the relationship between DRM, fair
   use, and innovation, using rights locker architectures, dynamic DRM
   systems, the Creative Commons project, DRM technology license
   agreements, and security research as examples. It addresses the alleged
   dichotomy between DRM and copyright levy systems as well as the
   implications of DRM for privacy protection. By analyzing various
   technology platforms, it describes the implications DRM has for
   competition in platform markets as well as in complementary
   aftermarkets. Finally, the article assesses recent efforts to
   standardize DRM technology, both by the private sector (in particular
   TCPA and Palladium), and by the legislature.}},

   systems using the Internet, such as the ARIEL system of Research
   Libraries Information Network (RLIN), the North Carolina State
   University Digitized Document Transmission Project (DDTP), and the Ohio
   State University Network Fax Project. The paper also presents the
   results of a survey conducted to determine the availability of required
   hardware and software in the Gulf academic libraries to use the Internet
   for EDD. The survey confirmed the availability of required equipment in
   the Gulf academic libraries and their willingness to participate in the
   EDD. Their adoption of the Internet for EDD for resource sharing is

Abstract = {{Traditional color management for visual effects feature-film production
   relied on output-referred techniques derived from film laboratory
   process control. The introduction of HDTV-originated content and a new
   goal of transferring the HDTV `look' to film caused us to try and move
   beyond process control, and to experiment with graphic arts color
   management technology and techniques in our application domain. A
   feature-length motion picture, shot with HDTV cameras, was successfully
   recorded to film using a new workflow based on spectral measurement, CIE
   colorimetry and ICC profiles.
   The path to delivery was a challenging one. In retrospect it is unclear
   whether off-the-shelf tools for the ICC-profile-based workflows of the
   graphic arts industry can be made to naturally encompass video encodings
   with legacy broadcast encodings, or films with extremely nonlinear
   reproduction characteristics in regions of shadow or highlight. There
   are also unique challenges in the metrology of projected film.
   This paper describes some of the metrology and processing innovations we
   developed to support the abovementioned transfer. Although the client
   response was positive, the internal experience of production using an
   ICC-profile-based workflow was not uniformly so. It seems likely that in
   the near future, a hybrid approach combining laboratory process control
   techniques with colorimetric measurement and modest color appearance
   modeling may succeed where a pure ICC-profile-based system did not.}},

   processing time in the different RNS channels. Experimental results,
   obtained trough RDSP implementation on FPGA and ASIC, show that not only
   a significant reduction in circuit area and power consumption but also a
   speedup may be achieved with RNS when compared with a binary DSP.}},

Abstract = {{With the continued emergence of various wireless applications, industry
   initiatives and activities have been targeted at enabling wireless
   access and mobile networking technologies. Diversified applications
   using various wireless technologies, such as wide-area cellular
   networks, personal communication systems and wireless local area
   networks (LANs), have created an increased demand on handsets and
   portable internet access appliances, such as 3G cellular phones, PDAs
   and mobile PCs. With widespread consumer acceptance of these
   applications, there is an ever-increasing demand for electronic systems
   and sub-systems with more functionality, higher performance, smaller
   size and lower cost, which has brought the microelectronic packaging
   toward a high-level technology challenge.
   System-in-package (SiP) products have been growing rapidly in recent
   years as an alternative to system-on-chip (SoC) products. As a packaging
   technology platform, SiP technology allows a high degree of flexibility
   in package architecture, particularly for RF applications. Radio
   frequency system-in-package (RF SiP) is a powerful packaging platform
   for wireless communication and data access and enables the integration
   of digital integrated circuits (ICs), logic ICs and radio frequency
   integrated circuits (RFICs) into a compact RF system or sub-system
   within a single module format using the state-of-the-art technology
   converged from IC packaging and SMT assembly.
   In this paper, the trends of wireless access and mobile networking
   technologies are reviewed Technical challenges and constraints to
   wireless systems for handset and mobile access appliance are discussed
   The packaging technology choice, performance and cost trade-offs are
   presented using RF SiP as a packaging platform. Finally, a novel SiP
   scenario is presented, which aims to provide an innovative solution
   through integration to help meet the demands of miniaturization,
   performance and cost for wireless handset and other mobile products.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of branching patterns occurring within Digitaria sect.
   Trichachne is presented. The general growth form type can be
   characterized as `lax tuft'. The proximal portion of the tillers is
   typically plagiotropous and bears short internodia. It is usually
   thickened and corm-like. Nevertheless, in D. swalleniana and D.
   catamarcensis the internodia are elongated and form a well-developed
   rhizome. In all cases this region of the culm bears cataphylls and
   behaves as an innovation zone. The culms grow upright to form
   synflorescences composed of a main flowering unit which can be
   accompanied by proximal enrichment shoots. As usual among grasses, the
   synflorescences are polytelic, and comprise a distal portion bearing
   short paraclades composed each of two spikelets, and a proximal portion
   bearing long paraclades, each reproducing the structure of the distal
   portion. All axes bear terminal spikelets. The number of long paraclades
   shows a wide range of variation within the section, ranging from a 1 or
   2 paraclades in D. tenuis and D. brownii to about 50 in D. insularis and
   D. laxa. Second order long paraclades only were observed in D. laxa. The
   short paraclades occur always in two rows along inflorescence axes, but
   the arrangement of long paraclades is usually polystichous. Some
   controversial issues related to branching patterns are discussed on the
   basis of SEM-observations.}},

Abstract = {{The 20th century Spanish sound history has been preserved in digital
   format and can now be consulted online through intranet. This is a
   pioneer project in the broadcasting industry around the world finished
   in December 2002. The Radio Nacional de Espana (RNE) sound archive has
   been massively digitized and several applications to access this
   information online have been developed. This archive is considered the
   most important audio archive in Spanish language in the world. Special
   innovation has been used in four areas: the development of a complex
   system designed for the supervision of the project defined workflow, the
   creation of a solution for the massive and automatic importation of the
   contents in CD format, the definition of an algorithm that maximizes the
   documental information to be inserted in the metadata file of the
   documental typology and the usage of information technology longitudinal
   tape to store the content. Successful team work was implemented by RNE
   sound archivists, documentalists, audio engineers and IT professionals;
   IBM Global Services consultants, digitization operators and systems
   engineers; IBM product managers and sales representatives.}},

Abstract = {{Our presentation gives an outlook on some of the main results of a
   strategic European study entitled ``EP2010 - The Future of Electronic
   Publishing Towards 2010{''}. The paper puts forward the thesis that,
   driven by the emerging knowledge economy, ``traditional{''} publishing
   industries will have to face the technological and economic challenges
   of knowledge-enhanced publishing: Novel publishing objects will provide
   different information layers (adapters) including an underlying
   knowledge structure to enable value adding (in a very broad sense) along
   various steps in the publishing workflow. We introduce the concept of
   ``smart content{''} to define, along the digital content value chain,
   the major technological challenges and market scenarios for the future
   of the electronic publishing sector in the knowledge economy. Smart
   content objects will, among other properties, be personalised,
   adaptable, evolvable, unobtrusive, interoperable and ubiquitous. A
   proposed research map including foundational research,
   application-oriented research on the publishing and knowledge management
   workflow and integrative research, e.g. on semantic interoperability,
   reflects the needs of the publishing industries regarding the paradigm
   change from traditional ``canned{''} publishing towards knowledge based
   publishing in 2010.}},

Abstract = {{The Japanese broadband Internet market has been increasing dramatically
   since ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) services started in
   2000, and its growth is currently the fastest in the world. The main
   factors driving this growth are the Japanese Government's ``e-Japan
   Strategy,{''} technology innovations, and a cheap usage rate. IP
   telephony services started emerging in 2002 based on the development of
   the broadband Internet market. The IP telephony services market in,
   Japan is also increasing dramatically because of its low costs and cheap
   usage rates. Fujitsu is committed to providing its customers with the
   best outsourcing services by exploiting IP telephony. Fujitsu created
   the FENICS IP Telephony Services so that enterprise customers can
   exploit IP telephony technology, broadband Internet technology, and
   Fujitsu's knowledge of outsourcing and the network services business. In
   the short time that this service has been available, it has already
   become the market leader. The key feature of the FENICS IP Telephony
   Services is that it enables customers to reduce their total costs and
   simultaneously accelerate their business operations.
   This paper describes the background of IP telephony services in Japan
   and outlines the FENICS IP Telephony Services and some related best

Abstract = {{The innovative use of QuickTime Virtual Reality (QTVR) and panoramic
   image-creation utilities for recording field observations and
   measurements during routine bridge inspections is reported. A virtual
   reality approach provides the ability to document a bridge's physical
   condition by using different media types at a significantly higher level
   of detail than is possible in a written bridge inspection report.
   Digitally recorded data can be stored on compact disc for easy access
   before, during, or after an inspection. The development of a QTVR bridge
   record consists of four major steps: selection of the camera stations,
   acquisition of the digital images, creation of cylindrical or cubic
   panoramas, and rendering of the QTVR file. Specific details related to
   these steps are provided, as applied to various bridge inspection
   projects. The potential impact of QTVR on bridge management-in which
   routine inspection data are a factor in making decisions regarding the
   future maintenance, rehabilitation, or replacement of a bridge-is

Abstract = {{The major goal is to develop a software-centric system; the hardware can
   be any generic computer system that meets minimal requirements for the
   system. The VIPVote system will incorporate an innovative
   ``Plug-and-Vote{''} approach, wherein the IT includes self-organizing
   and auto-connecting networks, online voter ID and eligibility
   determination, and browser-based software controls.
   The VIPVote system is a software- and network-based system that includes
   biometric voter identification (e.g., voice print or facial recognition
   via driver's license picture, or on-line voter identification collected
   during voter registration), and on-line eligibility information by
   recording at the county voting server when a voter votes. This
   innovative approach allows for distance voting, defined as the ability
   to vote at any county-authorized voting location.
   The VIPVote Lab would duplicate a small voting precinct within a county,
   including connections to a computer server representing a county level
   ``voting server.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally two different algorithms are used for the estimation of
   angular velocity with an incremental encoder. At steady state, both of
   them ensure good performances only in a restricted range of velocity. In
   the paper an innovative hybrid algorithm specifically conceived for
   digital control system is proposed. The algorithm is quite easy to
   implement and guarantees a reduced relative error in a wide range of
   velocity variation. The algorithm is analyzed with an analytical
   approach and the results are confirmed by numerical simulations. Since
   in dynamic conditions the error in the measurement of the angular
   velocity with an encoder is strictly connected with the observation
   time, a correct method for the dimensioning of the observation time is
   discussed. The method can be combined with the preceding algorithm to
   obtain adaptive capabilities.}},

   the structuring of an organizational community. A case study of early

   played a pivotal role in the acceptance of Internet based economic
   activity. In particular cultural and social activists played a role in
   envisioning applications of internet in this early phase. In the social,
   cultural and economic sectors new organizations sprang up that formed a
   network of that helped to start and legitimate internet companies. We
   describe the main organizations, Digital City, XS4ALL and De Waag
   Society, that emerged from this early phase and which constituted the
   core group of organizations for the early Internet community in
   Amsterdam. The dynamics of this early phase suggest that a closer look
   at mix of organizations will be useful to understand the creation of
   successful microclimates for technology adaptation and the formation of

Abstract = {{Digital beamforming on receive is an innovative concept to gather
   additional information about the direction of scattered radar echoes
   during the acquisition of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This
   additional information can be used to suppress range and azimuth
   ambiguities, to improve geometric and/or radiometric resolution, and to
   increase the unambiguous swath width. It is shown that this technique is
   especially promising in combination with bistatic SAR constellations,
   where digital beamforming on receive will allow for more compact antenna
   structures. Furthermore, an extension of digital beamforming to
   multistatic SAR formations will enable a reduced antenna aperture for
   each receiver, thereby allowing cost-effective and powerful SAR missions
   with wide swath coverage in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Power quality monitoring pushes to study novel voltage and current
   transducers, capable to overcome the limits of the classic measurement
   transformers. In particular, wide bandwidth, high linearity, and proper
   galvanic insulation are requested. Recent researches in this topic are
   oriented following two different ways: by developing transducers based
   on innovative physical principles (electro-optical, magnetic field
   measurement, etc.) and by employing new technologies in classical
   measurement approach.
   Following this second way, in this paper we propose a current-to-voltage
   transducer, which employs a Rogowski coil as a pickup device. The
   innovation is represented by electromotive force processing, that is
   completely performed in a digital way, by using a simple and inexpensive
   board. In this way, the well-known limits of the analog processing of
   the Rogowski coil signal are overcome, obtaining a transducers that
   features overall performance well suitable for industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of the uncertainty of the result of a measurement
   performed by a DSP-based instrument is usually a complex and difficult
   task. The sources of uncertainty are the instrument input stage and the
   Analog-to-Digital Converter; so that each input sample to the instrument
   can be considered a measurement result with its associated uncertainty.
   The uncertainty on the final measurement result is obtained as the
   combination of the uncertainty values of each sample, according to the
   measurement algorithm implemented on the DSP system. This paper proposes
   an innovative approach, based on the representation of the measurement
   result and its associated uncertainty in terms of Random-Fuzzy
   Variables, that, after having suitably characterized the metrological
   performance of the input stage and Analog-to-Digital Converter, provides
   an on-line estimation of the measurement uncertainty. The method has
   been validated experimentally, and the results of the experimental work
   are reported.}},

Abstract = {{As teachers adopt technology in their classrooms and develop the
   pedagogical models that will allow them to make use of the affordances
   of the technology, we are seeing improved learning outcomes and
   high-quality learning demonstrated. The pedagogical models that are
   showing the most promise come from ideas about how designers can
   implement the class of theories referred to as constructivism. Designers
   of technology-based learning environments can draw on the work of the
   many writers who have sought to develop guidelines and heuristics to
   support new modes of learning (see for example, Grabinger, 1996;
   Hannafin Land, 1997; Squires, 1996). Constructivist frameworks are based
   upon the argument for learners being placed in authentic environments
   that incorporate sophisticated representations of context through such
   constructs as virtual ``worlds{''}. Learning experiences, which adopt
   these approaches, designed around bounded resources, such as CD-ROM
   technologies, are now well documented and many teachers have been making
   extensive use of these environments for some time. One such project,
   Exploring the Nardoo, which has been developed within constructivist
   frameworks as a virtual world has been acclaimed for its illustration of
   these concepts. The product displays varying degrees of fidelity of
   representation, learner immersion and active participation and has been
   shown to offer learning advantages for users.
   However, teachers need to continue to address the constantly changing
   nature of the capability of the technology, and potential learning
   opportunities offered by these changes. Unbounded environments, such as
   the World Wide Web, have offered a new set of affordances and now the
   concept of learning objects is set to again require teachers to
   re-conceptualise learning experiences for their students. The concept of
   a `learning object' has developed from the movement to create reusable
   learning resources. Significant investment in content, described in
   terms of standards, which can be reused and re-purposed in education
   settings, is becoming a priority nationally (The Le@rning Federation,
   http://socci.edna.edu.au/newcms/view\_page.asp) and internationally
   (Ariadne: http://ariadne.unil.ch/. Merlot: http://taste.merlot.org/,
   LRX: http://www.lrx.com.au/). Teachers are now seeking tools to make
   effective use of the myriad of learning objects that are now being
   developed, in such entities as digital libraries, to construct
   meaningful learning environments.
   This paper will review the changes in pedagogy which ICT based learning
   environments have been able to facilitate, report on research findings
   on learning outcomes for a series of innovative bounded CD-ROM learning
   environments, and review the potential of learning object technologies
   to again challenge teachers striving for high quality learning from
   their students.}},

Abstract = {{France's early adoption of Minitel and EDI in the 1980s was both a
   stimulus and an inhibitor to Internet-based e-commerce. It hindered the
   adoption of the Internet, but it also created the conditions for a rapid
   catch up when France switched to the Internet in 1997. The French were
   already open to the use of IT, a dense network of online specialists and
   information service providers already existed, and many investments
   required to go digital were already made. On the other hand, by mid-2001
   France was still far behind the early adopters of e-commerce over the
   Internet. This is because the French catch-up was checked by the
   implosion of the Internet financial bubble in 2000. Second, many
   Internet-based business models did not fit the French distribution
   channels. These differences suggest that e-commerce paths of development
   can be differentiated among nations, because both needs and solutions
   differ. This conclusion goes against the conventional wisdom that
   e-commerce will lead to the emergence of an integrated global
   marketplace in which common commercial practices will be implemented.}},

Abstract = {{Until today, almost all objective lenses and windows of LIR imagers use
   crystal Germanium (Ge) as the optical material. Germanium is heavy,
   expensive and very sensitive to the environmental temperature change.
   When the temperature rises above 120degrees C, the lens becomes opaque.
   It is necessary to overcome these shortcomings.
   Using the analytic universal skew ray tracing formula and the automatic
   optical system design software developed by us, we successfully designed
   a 150mm/F1 objective lens using Ge and non-Ge materials for the LIR
   imager of the missile seeker and airborne surveillance. We also
   successfully designed a 25mm/F1 objective lens with large FOV of
   30degreesx40degrees using only non-Ge materials for the LIR imager of
   the helmet mounted search and rescue system. Good image quality is
   obtained. The cost is less than half of the Ge lens and the high
   temperature resistance is much better. In order to increase the S/N
   ratio 4 times for the. low-sensitivity UFPA, an immersed Ge lens for the
   UFPA is also successfully designed.
   Currently, most of UFPAs use high-cost Digital Signal Processing
   (DSP)-module. The LIR imager needs at least two circuit boards. We
   present a design that uses low-cost Altera processor and the imager only
   needs one board without Thermal Electrical Cooler (TEC). Therefore,
   three ``AA{''} batteries can operate the imager for more than 4 hours.
   By inserting data between pixels and enhance the contrast, the image
   from the 120x120/50mu UFPA is even better than the image from the
   240020/50mu array. This gives us an opportunity to reduce the imager
   cost to 2/3 of the larger format without degrading the image quality.
   These innovative researches give us a chance to build a small,
   lightweight, inexpensive, and good image quality LIR imager for homeland
   security and many other military and commercial applications. Two
   patents were pending and one was granted.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an innovative approach for noise cancellation at
   infrared (IR) wireless receivers. Ambient noise due to artificial
   lighting and the sun has been a major concern in infrared systems. The
   background induced shot noise typically has a power from 20 to 40 dB
   more than the signal induced shot noise and varies with time. Due to
   these changing conditions, infrared wireless receivers experience high
   level of non-stationary noise. The objective of the work mentioned in
   this paper is to develop digital signal processing algorithms at the
   infrared wireless system to combat high power non-stationary noise. The
   noisy signal is decomposed using a joint time and frequency
   representation such as wavelets and wavelet packets, into transform
   domain coefficients and the lower order coefficients are removed by
   applying a threshold. Denoised version is obtained by reconstructing the
   signal with the remaining coefficients. In this paper, we evaluate
   different wavelet methods for denoising at an infrared wireless
   receiver. Simulation results indicate that if the noise is uncorrelated
   with the signal and the channel model is unavailable the wavelet
   denoising method with different wavelet analyzing functions improves the
   signal to noise ratio (SNR) from 4 dB to 7.8 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Design can be described as a highly complex and sophisticated skill
   where designers need to integrate knowledge in new ways, according to
   each specific situation and needs. Redesign or reverse design
   capabilities may represent truly useful tools to create new and
   innovative design strategies. Redesign has been extensively studied and
   several computer-aided design implementations have been reported, though
   the traditional methods to generate models from existing buildings
   present a few disadvantages. The process is too labour-intensive,
   implying the survey of the site, the digitisation, if available, of
   architectural drawings, or the modification of existing CAD data. There
   is no effective process for the rapid generation of computer models from
   existing buildings. The use of contact probe or laser-scanning systems
   is common to perform such work in small objects, but these machines are
   not adequate for large objects such as buildings.
   This study aims to solve this limitation through the replication of the
   human vision process into a computer programme, using an image-based
   modelling approach. This system uses a commercial digital camera as the
   retina of the computer to take two-dimensional photos of existing
   buildings. These photos are then used by a robust computer routine,
   working as the visual cortex of the computer that converts the observed
   photos into three-dimensional computer models. This proposed image-based
   modelling system intends to be a very robust, versatile and flexible
   computer tool to perform architectural reverse design of buildings from
   non-existing digital models.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient management of information during the construction process
   has a major influence on project success. Many companies have different
   ways of dealing with this, from paper based documentation to customised
   digital systems. The previous use of electronic document management
   systems (EDMS) has represented a means of standardising on communication
   of documentation, and has, for some time, been embraced by large
   construction organisations. The use of such technology by small and
   medium enterprises, however, would tend to represent innovative change
   from previous modes of communication. And without the knowledge of
   appropriate implementation procedures, companies may be discouraged and
   resist utilisation of the technology which, may otherwise, contribute to
   project success.
   This paper covers the implementation of an EDMS system for a medium
   sized organisation by means of a project-based case study. Issues of
   strategy development for an EDMS are discussed, together with project
   characteristics. System design and document control on site are also
   considered in addition to implementation progression. Human aspects in
   connection with project personnel are addressed which covers staff
   attitudes and system usage. A post implementation review is also
   included which highlights the lessons learnt and promotes the
   development of a revised strategy for the future implementation of EDMS
   in construction.}},

Abstract = {{First we analyze true intelligent systems with emphasis on
   supercomputing mechanisms, in particular the principle of multiple
   knowledge. The first part of the paper lays some background for further
   AI research towards true intelligence, and provides some practical clues
   for innovative applications. In the second part of the paper we present
   successful applications mimicking intelligence, especially in the
   information extraction area. These systems offer several advantages over
   classical computer systems, and currently represent the best
   intelligence that humans can implement on digital computers. We present
   a couple of advanced applications developed or being developed in our
   group: an employment agent, a speech agent, a semantic web speaking
   system, a still-mill application, an agent-based group server, and an
   e-commerce agent. The major conclusion is that the field is ripe for
   innovative applications, and that in this way we can significantly
   enrich information society in any country.}},

Abstract = {{institutions that protect and improve: life-circumstances would appear
   to be a fundamental right of citizens. For many in developing countries
   this is not the case. Exclusion from social and economic institutions
   compounds with poverty to increase risk and worsen outcomes for many.
   Pro-development projects that work to include the excluded in market
   based institutions have the potential not only to alleviate poverty
   among the target group, but also to develop the markets and institutions
   with which they interface. Many information and communication technology
   (ICT) based projects seek inclusion in the information society by
   bridging the digital divide. This typically implies providing computing
   equipment and infrastructure. While these projects have had some
   success, without complimentary applications that strike at the root
   causes of exclusion and poverty, they may not reach their full
   development potential. This paper reports on a project that leverages
   ICT to provide stability for community-based health insurance programs.
   hi so doing it furthers the community's ability to address the causes of
   underdevelopment (poverty and exclusion from market institutions) while
   promoting ICT capacity and strengthening market relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Improvement of the quality of education, and even educational reform is
   goal for most the educational systems in the world. But, it has been
   proven historically that changing and improving an educational system is
   probably one of the most difficult and complex tasks in our societies
   specially, if it is externally and top-down imposed. My proposal here is
   that change and reform in an educational system must empower educators
   to take the lead and prove we are able to change and promote change. And
   to do so, we need show innovation and be credible. We need to empower
   ourselves from within. In this paper I will present the case of the
   Faculty of Education of the University of Costa Rica that, with its
   project LUMEN is leading an impressive innovation process, not only
   among its different departments and faculty members, but amongst other
   Faculties at the University such as Engineering and Medicine, for
   example. I will present also the vital role that the constructionist
   vision and very new digital technology have played in this case.}},

Abstract = {{Standards and market uncertainties, non-recurring engineering costs, and
   lack of access to (or knowledge of ) application IP will require the
   next generation of embedded computing platforms to be fully
   programmable. In terms of silicon cost and power, practical yet fully
   programmable embedded computing platforms are enabled by reconfigurable
   accelerators that replace fixed ASIC coprocessors in current standard
   platforms. The AVISPA reconfigurable accelerator is a landmark
   commercial offering, embodying the processor and compiler design
   technology that bridges the industry to fully programmable platforms in
   applications with extreme real-time performance requirements. The
   accelerator and its associated programming tools were created using a
   proprietary automatic processor and tool generation flow. As a result
   AVISPA could be easily tailored to achieve high computational efficiency
   (MOPS/W) in the acceleration of critical digital signal processing
   kernels for software-defined radio. An innovative C-compiler, generated
   from the same methodology, aggressively exploits massive instruction
   parallelism in application kernels mapped onto the core. This paper
   explains the concepts behind AVISPA, discusses its architecture, gives
   details on its supporting compiler, and provides benchmarks for a number
   of application kernels.}},

Abstract = {{The use of formal probabilistic modelling together with advanced
   statistical inference in communications engineering, has the potential
   of providing a powerful workbench for deriving conclusions about the
   behaviour of systems and sources of data and therefore developing
   innovative and efficient control and management strategies of
   communication systems.
   Targeting the efficient dimensioning of systems and resources in order
   to make possible the provision of high quality and larger-choice
   services to the end-users, this paper proposes the use of a Bayesian

Abstract = {{The UK Government see digital interactive television (DiTV) as an
   effective delivery platform for health information. This study examines
   use of a one-way DiTV video-conferencing facility whereby the public
   received advice from a nurse visible on their TV A multi-method approach
   was used, combining computer logs, telephone and face-to-face interviews
   with users and nurse cad-handlers and consultation scripts. Although the
   service was wed received, usage was low, possibly due to the novelty of
   the system. Clear differences of opinion emerged between nurses and the
   public regarding its benefits. Nurses enthused about the facility to
   transmit images and video-clips to aid patients; whereas service users
   praised more the closer inter-personal communication afforded by seeing
   the nurse. The relative ease of system use, and advantages over
   traditional telephone enquiry services indicate that this exciting and
   innovative initiative may well feature in future National Health Service
   plans.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the role of European standardisation in the
   promotion as well as the development of various Information Society
   technology (IST) applications. In a global environment where competition
   dominates, digital technologies are radically transforming our lives.
   However, although technology is a principal factor in accelerating
   development, it has to follow certain rules and obligations, mainly
   imposed by the corresponding standardisation activities, within the
   context of EU policies.
   The article goes on to discuss the challenges resulting from the rapid
   development of the IST sector within the framework of the European
   Single Market, and more specifically within the latest eEurope
   initiative, to accelerate the uptake of digital technologies across
   Europe. The major principles governing European standardisation, the
   potential involvement of the public authorities and the activities of
   the existing European standardisation organisations (ESOs) are then
   reviewed. Standards should be fit for purpose, have a high degree of
   acceptability, be coherent and well identified with each other and allow
   for technological innovation and competition; meanwhile standards have
   to support health, safety and environmental provisions in legislation as
   well as to continue to develop new policies to adapt to evolving market
   needs. Simultaneously, public authorities have to ensure
   interoperability of infrastructure and to strengthen economic and social
   cohesion within an `open' and competitive European environment. The
   article also discusses the `nature' of standards as practical A
   measures-initiatives' to promote market activities and to strengthen
   competition, specifically within a wide range of major key-digital
   applications (such as for example, e-commerce, e-security, e-education,
   e-accessibility, etc.). Finally, there are some concluding remarks on
   the relationship between European and international standards.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an integrated information system is presented that offers
   enhanced search and retrieval capabilities to users of heterogeneous
   digital audiovisual (a/v) archives. This innovative system exploits the
   advances in handlings a/v content and related metadata, as introduced by
   MPEG-4 and worked out by MPEG-7, to offer advanced services
   characterized by the tri-fold ``semantic phrasing of the request (
   query){''}, `` unified handling{''} and `` personalized response{''}.
   The proposed system is targeting the intelligent extraction of semantic
   information from a/v and text related data taking into account the
   nature of the queries that users my issue, and the context determined by
   user profiles. It also provides a personalization process of the
   response in order to provide end-users with desired information. From a
   technical point of view, the FAETHON system plays the role of an
   intermediate access server residing between the end users and multiple
   heterogeneous audiovisual archives organized according to the new MPEG

   Communication Technologies (ICT) in support of the sharing of knowledge
   and expertise of digital culture. In both sites for advanced learning,
   cooperative team projects provide a way for stakeholders to exchange
   knowledge and become enabled by new technologies. Professional
   development provides advanced teacher knowledge on learning, motivation
   and engagement in problem-based learning as a basis for the use of
   hand-held computers and networks to support strategic cooperative
   thinking among teams. The skills and confidence of young students using
   networked ICT is shared with less technically confident teachers. Expert
   teacher design of the learning context continually draws students'
   attention to the kinds of capabilities, knowledge, thinking and tools
   that are used to achieve different goals.
   Networked learning also has high economic value. A networked community
   comprised of teachers, students, scientists, and business people was
   developed to enable advanced learning in innovation. Three key features
   of the research projects were: The younger members of the community had
   the greatest knowledge of and commitment to communication and knowledge
   building in a digital culture; the development of authentic cooperation
   required all members to adopt new roles and rethink the traditional
   patterns of behaviour; teachers have made a particularly valuable
   professional contribution as they applied their expertise to facilitate
   learning and relationships for knowledge exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Ranger is a local area radio frequency ranging system implemented in the
   2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical band. Roundtrip
   time-of-flight measurements are made in a two-stage process: a coarse
   measurement provides +/- 3.4 m accuracy, followed by a fine measurement
   correction that reduces error to below 20 cm. This innovative approach
   can be implemented in other parts of the radio frequency spectrum; the
   2.4 GHz band was chosen both for regulatory acceptance and availability
   of commercial components.
   The Ranger system consists of fixed and mobile radios. Fixed location
   radios provide the reference from which distances are measured to the
   mobile radio. A single distance measurement requires approximately 50
   ins, therefore with a network of four fixed radios, the position of the
   mobile can be updated five times per second. Additionally, the digital
   communications link that is used for distance measurement is also used
   for concurrent high-bandwidth data communication.}},

Abstract = {{As technology advances, new and innovative ways of viewing and
   visualizing the human body are developed. Medicine has benefited
   greatly, from imaging modalities that provide ways for us to visualize
   anatomy that cannot be seen without invasive procedures. As long as
   medical procedures include invasive operations, students of anatomy will
   benefit from the cadaveric dissection experience. Teaching proper
   technique for dissection of human cadavers is a challenging task for
   anatomy educators. Traditional methods, which have not changed
   significantly for centuries, include the use of textbooks and pictures
   to show students what a particular dissection specimen should look like.
   The ability to properly carry out such highly visual and interactive
   procedures is significantly constrained by these methods. The student
   receives a single view and has no idea how the procedure was carried
   out. The Department of Anatomy at Mayo Medical School recently built a
   new, state-of-the-art teaching laboratory, including data ports and
   power sources above each dissection table This feature allows students
   to access the Mayo intranet from a computer mounted on each table. The
   vision of the Department of Anatomy is to replace all paper-based
   resources in the laboratory (dissection manuals, anatomic atlases, etc.)
   with a more dynamic medium that will direct students in dissection and
   in learning human anatomy. Part of that vision includes the use of
   interactive 3-D visualization technology. The Biomedical Imaging
   Resource (BIR) at Mayo Clinic has developed, in collaboration with the
   Department of Anatomy, a system for the control and capture of high
   resolution digital photographic sequences which can be used to create
   3-D interactive visualizations of specimen dissections. The primary
   components of the system include a Kodak DC290 digital camera, a
   motorized controller rig from Kaidan, a PC, and custom software to
   synchronize and control the components. For each dissection procedure,
   the images are captured automatically, and then processed to generate a
   Quicktime VR sequence, which permits users to view an object from
   multiple angles by rotating it on the screen. This provides 3-D
   visualizations of anatomy for students without the need for special
   ``3-D glasses{''} that would be impractical to use in a laboratory
   setting. In addition, a digital video camera may be mounted on the rig
   for capturing video recordings of selected dissection procedures being
   carried out by expert anatomists for playback by the students.
   Anatomists from the Department of Anatomy at Mayo have captured several
   sets of dissection sequences and processed them into Quicktime VR
   sequences. The students are able to look at these specimens from
   multiple angels using this VR technology. In addition, the student may
   zoom in to obtain high-resolution close-up views of the specimen. They
   may interactively view the specimen at varying stages of dissection,
   providing a way to quickly and intuitively navigate through the layers
   of tissue. Electronic media has begun to impact all areas of education,
   but a 3-D interactive visualization of specimen dissections in the
   laboratory environment is a unique and powerful means of teaching
   anatomy. When fully implemented, anatomy education will be enhanced
   significantly by comparison to traditional methods.}},

   enabling easy and flexible distribution of digital multimedia contents.
   However, such rapid progress has brought about various problems on
   intellectual properties and security. We are investigating a technique
   to solve the problem called active contents based on hierarchical
   structures of mobile agents. The agents work as wrappers of contents and
   can easily manage the policies for contents distribution. In this paper,
   we give a formal model of active contents in order to establish rigorous
   foundations for the active contents technique, especially the system of
   the policy control mechanisms. Using the model, we can verify if the
   behaviors of the active contents satisfy the given policies or not. An
   example of the redistribution prohibition policy illustrates how the
   verification works.}},

Abstract = {{Since Gutenberg invented printing in the fifteenth century, the book has
   become one of the most important information carriers for knowledge
   distribution, academic research, cultural heritage, and preservation.
   With advancements in technology both of electronic publishing and
   universal distribution and access on the Internet, the electronic book
   is supposed to become another revolution for information dissemination.
   This paper examines electronic books by giving a review of their
   historical development, definition and scope, characteristics and
   constraints, typology, related issues for library services, and user
   preferences. Consequently, this paper finds that electronic books only
   bring several evolutionary changes to the current operations of
   publishing and distribution in comparison with traditional books. The
   electronic book is just as much a consequence of the application of
   innovative information technologies as Gutenberg's were for paper books.
   A revolutionary change is still required for the electronic book to
   become ubiquitous.}},

Abstract = {{Review of holographic terrestrial aerospace research and in-orbit
   holographic investigations performed in microgravity conditions during
   the last century is given. Terrestrial aerospace research by means of
   opto-digital laser speckle metrology is considered. The prospects of
   holographic in-orbit research in the 21st century are regarded. Outlook
   for holographic research during future interplanetary missions in the
   21st century is discussed.
   Advanced holographic techniques are presented. These innovative
   techniques suit ideally for monitoring of various physical processes,
   studying of vibrations and static deformations, testing of
   microelectronics and MEMS. They enable quite novel possibilities of
   rapid, elegant, high volume production of holograms and holographic
   interferograms both in the terrestrial environments (industrial, natural
   outdoor environments) and in microgravity outside the Earth. Advanced
   holographic techniques are so simple that their usage in the planetary
   environments of the future space missions seems quite natural. They can
   be used right now for holographic research aboard currently orbiting
   International Space Station. Advanced holographic techniques might be
   utilized quite soon on Mars. One of the early variants of advanced
   techniques invented by this author was used to obtain the first ever
   holograms and holographic interferograms of different physical phenomena
   outside the Earth aboard navigating spaceships. The unique feature of
   innovative techniques is the possibility to work in real time in situ.
   It is possible to obtain holograms and holographic interferogam in any
   brightly lit environment, including sunlit environments. The last might
   be very important in the future planetary missions. Holographic
   minirobot for planet-based investigations is proposed. Quite novel
   modifications of advanced techniques permit to process holographically
   tremendous amounts of data per second; far exceeding near future
   potentialities of sophisticated computer systems applied to the tasks of
   3-dimensional imaging or to the tasks of optical metrology. Experimental
   data properly illustrating novel vast possibilities and prospects for
   the future in-orbit and interplanetary space research are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The Center for Art/Science Studies (CASS) was established at the
   University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1974 in order to foster
   formal interactions between students and faculty in the arts with
   students and faculty in the sciences. The majority of these
   cross-disciplinary activities have involved members of the Schools of
   Visual Arts, Theater, Oceanography, Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, Space
   Sciences, and Applied Mechanics. In its early years CASS developed into
   a program of ``science in the service art{''}. Technologies such as
   isotopic analyses, holography, laser illumination and surface
   modification, digital-computer image processing, ultrasonic imaging, and
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were applied to art in the areas of
   display, history, interpretation, performance, restoration,
   conservation, and creation. For the most part the stimulus for
   developing such connections came from searching for ways of applying
   current scientific innovation to the arts. However, it was a surprising
   revelation to eventually realize that the artists were contributing to
   the sciences, as well. This reversal that we experienced has roots going
   back to the earliest civilizations and includes notable recent artistic
   contributions to general relativity, quantum electrodynamics, and
   cosmology. At the present time the activities of CASS are being carried
   on by the Center for Research in Computing for the Arts (CRCA).}},

Abstract = {{Modern 3D scanning technologies allow to reconstruct 3D digital
   representations of Cultural Heritage artifacts in a semi-automatic way,
   characterized by very high accuracy and wealth of details. The
   availability of an accurate digital representation opens several
   possibilities of utilization to experts (restorers, archivists, museum
   curators), or to ordinary people (students, museum visitors). 3D scanned
   data are commonly used for the production of animations, interactive
   visualizations, or virtual reality applications. A much more exciting
   opportunity is to use these data in the restoration of Cultural Heritage
   artworks. The integration between 3D graphic and restoration represents
   an open research field where many new supporting tools are required; the
   David restoration project has given several starting points and
   guidelines to the definition and development of innovative solutions.
   Digital 3D models can be used in two different but not subsidiary modes:
   as an instrument for the execution of specific investigations and as a
   supporting media for the archival and integration of all the
   restoration-related information, gathered with the different studies and
   analysis performed on the artwork.
   In this paper we present some recent work done in the framework of the
   Michelangelo's David restoration project. A 3D model of the David was
   reconstructed by the Digital Michelangelo Project, using laser-based 3D
   scanning technology. We have developed some tools to make those data
   accessible and useful in the restoration. Preliminary results are
   reported here together with some directions for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Infrared reflectography is a prominent optical technique for
   non-destructive diagnostics of paintings, which allows the visualisation
   of details hidden by the paint layers, because of their transparency
   characteristics to IR radiation. High-resolution reflectography was
   introduced around the end of the 80s by the Istituto Nazionale di Ottica
   Applicata, where a prototype of an innovative scanner device was
   developed. This technique was recently improved with the introduction of
   a new optical head, able to acquire simultaneously the reflectogram and
   the colour image, perfectly superimposing. The technical characteristics
   of the IR-colour scanner guarantee: a high spatial resolution (16
   points/mm(2)), a high tonal dynamics (thousands of grey levels), a
   uniform lighting of the scanned area and the punctual superimposition of
   the colour and IR images. Moreover we can print distortion-free
   reflectograms, false-colour and colour images of paintings on a 1:1
   scale. The quality of the acquired reflectogram is presently higher than
   that obtainable with any traditional detection system, like CCD or

Abstract = {{Image processing, signal processing and computer vision are increasing
   in importance, and are indeed slowly being considered as core
   competences in computer science.
   The specification of computing curricula by the ACM and the IEEE
   Computer Society states that technical advances over the past decade
   have increased the importance of topics such as graphics and multimedia,
   and considers as a core topic Graphics and Visual Computing. With the
   advent of courses in digital media in electrical engineering and
   computer science, the increasing importance of computer imaging and
   vision is manifest, and not only in electrical engineering and computer
   science departments.
   The need for development and training of research students is more often
   than not badly catered for at the present time in Irish universities
   (Republic, Northern Ireland). Research students are often from diverse
   discipline and educational system backgrounds. A characteristic of a
   dynamic and effective graduate and research student environment is not
   just the raw numbers of PhDs produced, but also relative consensus on
   the part of the ``community{''} on the most effective major directions
   of innovation and of focus. On any such qualitative characteristic,
   Irish universities, institutes of technology and research institutes are
   not performing well.
   Successful models for such community-strengthening include doctoral
   networks at European level, and summer schools at national or regional
   level.
   This paper addresses specific issues: (i) the means by which the needs
   for graduate research level community-strengthening in the areas of
   signal processing, and image processing and computer vision, can be
   satisfied; (ii) what the most crucial elements of these fields are, i.e.
   proposed key areas and curricula.}},

   (ICTs), e.g. telecenters and cyber cafes, have been considered as one
   means to reduce the digital divide. Cyber cafes in particular have
   proliferated in some locales yet not in others with apparently similar
   characteristics. This paper questions the prevailing emphasis on the
   ``cyber{''} characteristics of access, e.g. computing and internet
   access as is currently known, and attempts to refocus the conversation
   by considering computing and access in the context of the ``cafe{''},
   e.g. as public life in the sense of Habermas. This analysis is based on
   extant literature and direct ethnographic research in several public
   places in six countries. We offer design perspectives based on a
   reflection of ``third places{''} as inspiration for appropriate
   innovation in the provision of computing and communications.}},

Abstract = {{In Australia, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), particularly rural
   SMEs, are perceived as being on the wrong side of the digital divide.
   Government at local and state levels have taken a leading role in the
   development of electronic marketplaces with an aim of improving the lot
   for SMEs. Many government departments now either own or sponsor
   electronic marketplaces. Government aims in creating e-marketplaces are
   often motivated by regional economic development issues. Whilst
   government entities may think e-marketplaces are an effective channel
   for implementing government policy a number of complications can arise
   from this model, not least is being seen as stifling free trade. Despite
   the community development motivation a major argument for e-marketplace
   development being put forward is the economic one and this has
   contributed to a narrow view of the e-marketplace concept and one, which
   for the time being at least, is likely to restrict its impact.
   Government sponsored e-marketplaces should consider the value of on-line
   business networks to share knowledge and potentially increase levels of
   innovation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is about using technology to help people who share knowledge
   orally. The objective is to appreciate the social and technical needs of
   this preference so as to narrow the divide developing between these
   people and those who earn their living from written knowledge sharing.
   Writing is not the preferred method of knowledge sharing for the
   majority of peoples on earth nor is it appropriate for the majority of
   problems. A mix of both literacy and orality is believed to be the
   ideal, so a failure to develop cheap and relevant synchronous and
   asynchronous oral knowledge sharing technology may down play the
   importance of orality in the social and economic development of both the
   developed and developing nations. This paper will argue that IS
   designers interested in global diversity, equity, innovation and
   economic development through communication technology need to place more
   emphasis on orality. The difference between oral and written knowledge
   sharing will be discussed to explain the need for both synchronous and
   asynchronous communication technologies. A small study comparing
   asynchronous oral and written communication is presented as is an
   attempt to design an Internet based oral conferencing system to link
   Aboriginal communities. It was found that there was a need for
   developing cheap community based conferencing facilities and to improve
   the asynchronous oral communication technologies.}},

Abstract = {{A new method based on parsing the concavity code is used to partition a
   digital contour into concave and convex sections. Innovative features of
   the technique include: (1) coerced two-state classification of every
   point into a concavity or a convexity; (2) linguistic explanation for
   each point's classification; (3) curvature validation via the residue
   (that portion of the boundary remaining after curvature extraction); (4)
   preservation of original contour shape; (5) symbolic logic methodology
   (no floating point operations); (6) parameter-free implementation; (7)
   linear time and space complexity. No other currently available contour
   partitioning method exhibits all of these features. The parser achieves
   two-state partitioning by implementing simple notions of cumulative
   curvature, vertex adjacency, shallow curvature absorption, and residue
   sharing. Concavities and convexities are color-coded to help
   disambiguate complex images such as topographic contour maps and radio
   frequency propagation plots. To gauge product quality, the observer may
   appeal visually to the residue for validation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A specific case a four-order non-collinear light scattering in
   anisotropic media is presented. Compared to our previous studies, an
   innovation lies in the fact that now we consider passing just the
   quartet of incident light waves through a single crystal that is
   perturbed by a coherent steam of acoustic phonons. The exact and closed
   analytical model for describing this strongly nonlinear phenomenon is
   developed. In fact, specially designed regime of a four-order light
   scattering, when transitions of four input light beams into four output
   light modes are allowed and electronically controlled, is examined. The
   feasibility of applying such an effect to perform an all-optical
   switching is analyzed. An opportunity for arranging the digital 4-bit
   register is revealed and algorithmically investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Array sensors (e.g., focal plane array detectors) have densely
   aggregated cells to capture low energy levels that are converted in into
   electrical signals. In hybrid assemblies, where focal plane arrays are
   bump-bonded to readout ICs, pixel density is being continually increased
   as processing and assembly technologies improve. Denser arrays, combined
   with extremely high frame rates (e.g. > 10(6) frames/sec) create a
   formidable explosion in signal content. One approach to overcoming this
   issue is to move the signal processing closer to the array, minimizing
   the number of interconnects and the interconnect length the raw pixel
   signal outputs must travel prior to digitization, providing opportunity
   to buffer bursts (<64 frames) of high-rate collection sessions. One
   innovative approach to achieving this is to use 3-D stacking of the
   pre-processing electronics for each pixel row directly behind the sensor
   array. This paper describes the development of a high density, 3-D
   stacking technology that is being applied to an 8000-pixel array sensor
   cube that can eventually be scaled to mega-pixel densities through
   tiling.}},

Abstract = {{A biologically based CAD tool (BioCAD) is developed for the rapid
   generation of computer models from existing large objects and is based
   on the replication of the human vision process. The BioCAD system will
   enable to enhance creativity and innovation in the engineering field
   namely in reverse engineering and design activity. Commonly, engineers
   use contact probe or laser-scanning systems to perform reverse
   engineering activities, but these machines are not adequate for large
   objects. The BioCAD system is an hybrid method as it combines
   photogrammetric procedures to produce high quality models with computer
   vision techniques to be fully automatic. This process uses
   two-dimensional photos to create three-dimensional computer models
   either to produce sophisticated photo-realistic renderings or to
   generate surface models for simulation purposes and rapid prototyping
   applications. A detailed analysis for digital images distortion is
   performed in order to achieve high accuracy results through a novel and
   automatic calibration procedure called ``ciliary{''}.}},

Abstract = {{The described 3-D measuring system enables an adapted digitising
   strategy: acquirement of characterising elements - generating a surface
   topology - surface description. The procedure works on light contours
   i.e. transition areas between light and shadow in 2-D images. These
   light contours assign feature lines to surface characteristics which
   occur under varying lighting. The processing of colour and texture data
   can be integrated because of the given connection of colour and texture
   data with 3-D surface coordinates. Thus, the innovation of the strategy
   is to be seen in the co-existence and simultaneously processing of 2-D
   and 3-D data which allows the context-sensitive acquirement of
   information in physical models.
   The procedure will provide fast and suitable tools for the verification
   and development of physical and virtual shape models to the conceptual
   designer, the design engineer and the mould maker. It also opens new
   ways of communication within the product development.}},

   is strategic for industry-wide efforts to improve the quality and reduce
   the cost of health care. The implementation of electronic medical record
   systems has been hindered by inadequate security provisions. This paper
   describes the use of trust negotiation as a framework for providing
   authentication and access control services in healthcare information
   systems. Trust negotiation enables two parties with no pre-existing
   relationship to establish the trust necessary to perform sensitive
   transactions via the mutual disclosure of attributes contained within
   digital credentials. An extension of this system, surrogate trust
   negotiation is introduced as a way to meet the security requirements of
   healthcare delivery systems based on mobile computing devices and
   wireless communication technologies. These innovative technologies have
   enormous potential to improve the current state of security in
   healthcare information systems.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, there has been a deregulation in the Japanese
   Higher Education System caused by the mass education era. Usually, the
   Japanese University is difficult to get into and easy to get out of;
   however, recently, more universities have become more easy to get in and
   easy to get out of, because of the mass education era and decreased
   population of 18 years old students. The faculty has to face the less
   motivated students who come to class without the basic knowledge of
   science and engineering. Therefore, there is a need for changes in the
   teaching and learning system. A pilot study of an experimental design
   for assessing impact on changes in student motivation on the Japanese
   higher education system is presented. This paper will discuss the
   experiences over the last eight years from 1993 to 2001 in the course of
   digital circuit design of biomedical engineering study in the Toin
   University of Yokohama by using the Interactive Operational Control,
   IOC. The IOC technique combines innovative learning strategies, such as
   interactive and cooperative learning, with uses of the discipline, the
   role model, the presentation and the feedback. The students have reacted
   positively to this novel approach, which can be adapted to many others
   courses. The technique has been proven to be effective, shown by the
   students' grades. In this paper, the teaching strategy and responses of
   the students will be presented.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative method of designing a class of analog cellular neural
   networks - Recursive Cellular Nonlinear (Neural) Networks (RCNNs) - for
   ultra-low noise digital arithmetic computation is presented. The
   intended application of the RCNN is for digital arithmetic in a
   sensitive mixed-signal environment, such as a digital interface to a low
   output sensor, where digital noise is to be kept to a minimum. Our ultra
   low-noise approach essentially employs asynchronous analog circuit
   concepts. In this paper we have analyzed and summarized the recursive
   architecture of our RCNN networks at the mathematical and circuit level.
   An analog CMOS design of a 4-bit RCNN adder, which will be used to
   verify the low-noise behaviour of our approach, is also presented.}},

   for measuring an object without contact. The measuring system works
   according to the principle of optical fringe projection. The advantages
   of the overall system are shown using a 100\% inspection within a
   production process of workpieces as an example. These are manufactured
   with rapid technologies. For this purpose, an optical, surface-measuring
   3D-sensor system was mounted on a standard industrial robot. In
   addition, the robot was equipped with a digital camera for setting
   photogrammetric marks for sensor navigation. Besides the introduction of
   the measuring system and the robot setup, the future possibilities of
   this innovation in process and production technology are to be

Abstract = {{For its new acute care hospital, the University of California at Los
   Angeles is evaluating innovative technology involving high-resolution
   flat panel display devices configured as ``network appliances{''} that
   can be wall mounted for use in the retrieval and display of medical
   images and data. Physicians and healthcare providers can log on with
   wireless handheld computers, which can serve as an identification device
   as well as a navigational tool for selecting patient records and data.
   These data are displayed and manipulated on the flat panel display
   without the need for a keyboard or mouse. A prototype was developed with
   commercially available image display software, which was modified to
   allow the remote control of software functions from a handheld device
   through an infrared communication port. The system also allows
   navigation through the patient data in a World Wide Web-based electronic
   patient record. This prototype illustrates the evolution of radiologic
   facilities toward ``shareable{''} high-quality display devices that
   allow more convenient and cost-effective access to medical images and
   related data in complex clinical environments, resulting in a paradigm
   shift in data navigation and accessibility.}},

Abstract = {{Although the hardware platform is often seen as the most important
   element of real-time imaging systems, software optimization can also
   provide remarkable reduction of overall computational costs. The
   recommended code development flow for digital signal processors based on
   the TMS320C6000(TM) architecture usually involves three phases:
   development of C code, refinement of C code; and programming linear
   assembly code. Each step requires a different level of knowledge of
   processor internals: The developer is not directly involved in the
   automatic scheduling process. In some cases, however, this may result in
   unacceptable code performance. A better solution can be achieved by
   scheduling the assembly code by hand. Unfortunately, scheduling of
   software pipelines by hand not only requires expert skills but is also
   time consuming, and moreover, prone to errors. To overcome these
   drawbacks we have designed an innovative development tool - the Software
   Pipeline Optimization Tool (SPOT(TM)). The SPOT is based on
   visualization of the scheduled assembly code by a two-dimensional
   interactive schedule editor, which is equipped with feedback mechanisms
   deduced from analysis of data dependencies and resource allocation
   conflicts. The paper addresses optimization techniques available by the
   application of the SPOT. Furthermore, the benefit of the SPOT is
   documented by more than 20 optimized image processing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an innovative electronic nose, based on Quartz Crystal
   Microbalances (QCMs), is presented. The system comprises a dedicated
   fully digital front-end hardware that measures the QCM resonance
   frequency shift using a technique proposed by Cantoni {[}1]. This
   technique allows reducing the measurement time while maintaining a high
   frequency resolution. The developed system allows measuring variations
   of the sensor resonance frequency shifts during chemical transients
   obtained with abrupt changes in gas concentrations. Hence the reaction
   kinetics can be exploited to differentiate among different compounds. In
   this paper the application of the developed electronic nose to the
   detection of CO in presence of ethanol is presented. The results
   obtained by an array of 4 sensors with different sensitive layers are
   presented. An exponential fitting of the transient responses is used for
   feature extraction.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to present a number of features that can
   be extracted from handwritten digits and used for author verification or
   identification of a person's handwriting. The features under
   consideration are mainly computational features some of which cannot be
   easily evaluated by humans. On the other hand, these features can be
   extracted by computer algorithms with a high degree of accuracy.
   The eleven features used are described. All features were appropriately
   binarized so that binary feature vectors of constant lengths could be
   formed. These vectors were then used for author discrimination, using
   the Hamming distance measure. For this task a writer database consisting
   of 15 writers was created. Each writer was asked to write random strings
   of 0 to 9 at least 10 times. The results indicate that the combined
   features work well at discriminating writers and warrant further
   detailed investigation.
   Although the set of features was designed for dealing with handwritten
   digits (as may be written on cheques), it may also be used for isolated
   alphabetic characters.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, innovative vibro-modulation technique has been
   introduced for detection of contact-type interfaces such as cracks,
   debondings, and delaminations. The technique utilizes the effect of
   nonlinear interaction of ultrasound and vibrations at the interface of
   the defect. Vibration varies on the contact area of the interface
   modulating passing through ultrasonic wave. The modulation manifests
   itself as additional side-band spectral components with the combination
   frequencies in the spectrum of the received signal. The presence of
   these components allows for detection and differentiation of the
   contact-type defects from other structural and material inhomogeneities.
   Vibro-modulation technique has been implemented in N-SCAN(R) damage
   detection system. The system consists of a digital synthesizer, high and
   low frequency amplifiers, a magnetostrictive shaker, ultrasonic
   transducers and a PC-based data acquisition/processing station with
   N-SCAN(R) software. The ability of the system to detect contact-type
   defects was experimentally verified using specimens of simple and
   complex geometries made of steel, aluminum, composites and other
   structural materials. N-SCAN(R) proved to be a very effective for
   nondestructive testing of full-scale structures ranging from 24
   foot-long gun barrels to stainless steel pipes used in nuclear power
   plants. Among advantages of the system are applicability for the wide
   range of structural materials and for structures with complex
   geometries, real time data processing, convenient interface for system
   operation, simplicity of interpretation of results, no need for sensor
   scanning along structure, onsite inspection of large structures at a
   fraction of time as compared with conventional techniques. This paper
   describes the basic principles of nonlinear vibro-modulation NDE
   technique, some theoretical background for nonlinear interaction and
   justification of signal processing algorithm. It is also presents
   examples of practical implementation and application of the technique.}},

Abstract = {{The sophisticated Physical Plant at San Jose State University has become
   a state of the art, high efficiency hybrid plant. Strategic campus
   planning has allowed San Jose State University to remain energy
   resourceful, despite the recent energy crises. Innovative, well planned
   projects have permitted this high tech showcase to support future growth
   demands with sustainable system approaches.
   The existing San Jose State University Physical Plant has evolved over
   the years as expansion has occurred. It has become the most efficient
   and diversified heating, cooling and generating power plant in the CSU
   system (See Figure 1). The plant consists of a 5 MW gas fired generator,
   which converts waste heat to steam for re-injection in the turbine
   (Cheng cycle) and for steam driven absorbers (two at 1300 ton). The
   plant also contains two 750 ton electric chillers. The hydraulic system
   consists of primary pumps for each chiller, multiple secondary pumps
   with variable speed drives serving the campus loop, with tertiary pumps
   being added to the buildings in phases. The entire plant is controlled
   and monitored by a digital control system.
   Expansion of the campus plan included a new 500,000 sq.ft. Library,
   which was to be the first joint city and university library in the U.S.
   Also planned was an expansion in student housing.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of property rights and notions of public and private are
   social constructions with a long history. In western society, the term
   ``enclosure{''} dates from 16(th) century Britain, where the Enclosure
   Movement was used to describe the political economic process of the
   privatization of ``pubic{''} or ``common{''} land. This term has been
   recently appropriated in legal discourse as the 2(nd) Enclosure Movement
   to describe the increasing privatization of knowledge and information as
   ``intellectual{''} property in a new electronic information environment.
   This paper further applies this notion of Digital Enclosure-enclosure in
   the digital age-to a particular form of knowledge that has an inherently
   quasi-public nature, technical standards and the standardization
   process.
   Standards and the practice of standardization are vital to an industrial
   and technological society. Standardization practice has been
   institutionalized on a global basis over the past century and a half but
   is undergoing significant challenge and change. It exists in the
   political economic environment of capitalism and market economics where
   there is a basic tension between competition and cooperation, resulting
   in an interweaving of three elements: standardization, intellectual
   property rights (IPR) and antitrust/competition policy. This paper
   explores current trends in standardization from the perspective of
   Digital Enclosure, including the rise of the consortia movement, IPR
   policy, business and commercial strategies, the open source movement,
   and technical innovation.}},

Abstract = {{The incredibly fast pace of technological development was up until
   recently the key growth factor in the mobile communications industry.
   Recently, however, as the market for the mobile communications equipment
   became saturated and competitive pressure intensified, the demand-side
   growth factors grew in importance. As a consequence, consumer
   preferences are likely to play the key role in determining the direction
   in which the mobile communications technology will develop.
   At present, multimedia services are the priority areas of the mobile
   communications technological progress. The multimedia services such as
   VOD (Video On Demand), video telephony services using streaming video
   technology as well as technological fusion with the other digital
   Appliances like PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant) and digital cameras,
   will attract more consumers' attention when the next generation of
   mobile communication services reaches the market. For example, color
   displays in cellular phones are one of the most important milestones in
   the path to the new paradigm of the multimedia technology.
   In this study, we analyzed consumers' valuation of color displays in
   cellular phones. At the time of the survey implementation, the market
   data was not available because it was a very early stage of adopting the
   color displays in cellular phones. Instead of adopting the revealed
   preference approach, a conjoint experiment was conducted where
   respondents were asked to rank cellular phone specification alternatives
   differing in the following attributes: the type of display (black and
   white or-color display), brand,and price. The ordered logit model
   applied to the survey data. allowed us to decompose the cellular phones'
   values by the attributes, additional profit due to color display and the
   brand value, among others. Using our empirical estimates we also derived
   several implications for the competition strategy in the cellular phone
   market.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past five years tremendous advances have been made in the
   design of copper-based transmission line interconnects capable of
   propagating high-speed broadband digital signals over long lengths of
   printed circuit boards (PCBs) and backplanes. Data rates of 5 Gb/s
   transmitted over a single differential pair routed across more than one
   meter of PCB and backplane interconnect using low-cost FR-4 dielectric
   material is no longer all that unusual. And leading industry experts
   predict there is still plenty of bandwidth left to extend copper
   interconnects to well beyond 10 Gb/s.
   The high performance interconnects needed to sustain these high data
   rates are attained through the application of many different engineering
   design and manufacturing disciplines including active pre/post
   compensation circuits, cost effective mixed-dielectric PCB and backplane
   stackups, and innovative PCB via interconnect geometries. By applying
   these interdisciplinary technologies to the design of copper-based
   interconnects, signal attenuation and deterministic jitter distortions
   caused by frequency dependent interconnect materials and energy-storing
   geometric structures are minimized.}},

Abstract = {{Today's competitive business environment imposes daunting challenges to
   leading manufacturing companies. To achieve business success in such an
   enviornment, they should constantly provide innovative products that
   capture customers' imaginations and meet their expectations. How can a
   manufacturing company realize this? The best answer is to implement
   product lifecycle management (PLM). PLM is a strategic business approach
   that applies a consistent set of business solutions to help
   manufacturing companies to achieve their business goals of reducing
   costs, improving product quality, and shortening time to market through
   managing all the activities related to a product and its related
   services in an integrated way across the lifecycle from customer need to
   recycling and disposal.
   In this paper, key business challenges faced by today's global
   enterprises and the PLM solutions that enable businesses to meet these
   challenges are first presented. A high-level PLM definition describes
   its core functions and structure. The benefits of PLM and relationships
   between PLM and other major business solutions are elaborated. Finally
   several factors influencing the performance of PLM are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A coloring method using a laser system has been proposed in our
   laboratory. This method has the features as follows. i) The processing
   objects are plastic materials such as acrylic, nylon, epoxy, polyester
   etc. ii) Heating the dye solution by the irradiation of a laser, a
   material can be dyed at a local area of laser irradiation. iii) The
   images which printed by this method. have persistence for erasing such
   as washing or rubbing. iv) Since the absorptivity of CO2 laser to the
   dye solution is high, a slab, RF excited CO2 laser was used: as a
   heating source. This method, however, could be expressed only one-color
   image. In order to perform expression based on the digital image, not
   one-color but the colors printing of the image has been required.
   In this study, the innovative laser coloring method has been introduced
   for the colors printing. This method combines the laser processing dots
   which are possessed different colors. For example, by combining the dots
   of two colors, another color printing can be created. Otherwise, by
   changing the combining rate of the dots of two colors, more other color
   printing has been possible. A color printing on plastics using the
   innovative laser coloring method has been successfully attempted.}},

Abstract = {{Travel and air-quality benefits often are cited as among the many
   benefits of promoting smart growth. Through a recently released
   guidance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officially
   acknowledged the role of smart growth in improving air quality and has
   offered three ways to account for air-quality benefits. The state of
   Maryland's effort-the first of its kind-to quantify travel and
   air-quality benefits in the state implementation plan (SIP) for air
   quality is presented. As one of the three demonstration projects in the
   state's smart growth and innovative SIP, the Digital Harbor is a
   collection of redevelopment and infill development projects in the areas
   surrounding Baltimore's harbor. These areas are historically Baltimore's
   base for manufacturing and port trade and are now being renovated and
   transformed into a hub for high-tech and tech-driven companies.
   Quantification of travel and air-quality benefits was conducted at two
   levels: at the macro level, a regional transportation model was used to
   evaluate travel and air-quality effects of these projects' central
   location; and at the micro level, the Smart Growth INDEX model was used
   to quantify travel effects and air-quality benefits of land use density,
   diversity, and design. Benefits were estimated through comparison of a
   smart growth scenario with two alternative growth scenarios. Subsequent
   model runs were conducted to examine the sensitivity of potential
   benefits to different combinations of land use density and land use mix.
   Policy implications are presented for the roles of planning and
   designing in achieving the goal of air-quality improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of microsystems is introduced. Review of holographic
   terrestrial aerospace research and in-orbit holographic investigations
   performed in microgravity conditions during the last century is given.
   Prospects of holographic in-orbit research of microsystems in the 21th
   century are regarded. Prospects of holographic research during future
   interplanetary missions in the 21th century are discussed.
   Advanced holographic techniques are presented. They enable quite novel
   possibilities of producing holograms and holographic interferograms of
   MEMS, microelectronic components and other microsystems. These
   innovative techniques suit ideally for testing of MEMS and
   microelectronics, monitoring of various physical processes, studying of
   vibrations and static deformations in microgravity aboard current
   orbital International Space Station. Minimal hardware is required. The
   hardware is very compact, portable and user-friendly. It is so simple
   that it can be operated by an astronaut having practically no skill in
   optics. One of the early variants of holographic techniques invented by
   this author was used to obtain the first ever holograms and holographic
   interferograms of different physical phenomena outside the Earth aboard
   navigating spaceships. The unique feature of innovative techniques is
   the possibility to work in real time in situ. It is possible to obtain
   holograms and holographic interferogams in any brightly lit environment;
   including sunlit environments. The last might be very important in the
   future planetary missions. Novel very small holographic device is
   presented. It is portable device with no lenses and no alignment
   problems. Holographic minirobot for planet-based investigations is
   proposed. Experimental data properly illustrating novel vast
   possibilities and prospects for the future in-orbit and interplanetary
   space research are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A differential burst-mode optical receiver in digital 0.18mum CMOS
   technology for SoC applications with sensitivities of -30.7dBm and
   -23.7dBm for lambda=1310nm at data rates of 622Mb/s and 1.25Gb/s,
   respectively, is presented. These values are compared to sensitivities
   of -24.5dBm at 622Mb/s and -24.1dBm at 1.25Gb/s of a 0.6mum BiCMOS OEIC
   being also introduced with an integrated pin photodiode at lambda=670nm.
   Additionally, an innovative OEIC in 0.6mum BiCMOS technology with an
   integrated voltage-up-converter (VUC), which generates a bias voltage of
   16.3V for the integrated pin photodiode from the chip. supply voltage of
   5V is described. Due to the VUC, the data rate for the given technology
   was increased from 50Mb/s to 1.5Gb/s. The VUC-OEIC represents a complete
   SoC consisting of sensor, analog and digital part.}},

Abstract = {{Flood disasters cause massive loss of human lives and immense damage to
   the infrastructure and economic activities, not only in Turkey but also
   all over the world. Governments consider several long-term and
   short-term precautions for flood control. The numerical simulation of
   dam-break problems could be accomplished with geographic information
   systems and innovation maps. Spread of the flood wave after a dam break
   can be predicted using these enabling technologies. This kind of
   advanced modelling technology is becoming an inevitable tool for the
   decision-making process. Data produced by GIS are used as initial values
   for FLDWAV. ArcView GIS has been used to produce a Digital Elevation
   Model and visualization of dam-break effects and propagation of a
   possible flood wave. Using GIS techniques and hydrologic modelling
   software, possible effects and damage of a dam-break flood have been
   investigated and results were simulated to show significant dam break
   effects on the region.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative coloring method for whole plastic materials using a laser
   system (Laser Plastic Coloring: LPC method) has been developed in this
   work. Irradiating a laser beam to a dye which is diluted with water, the
   dye solution is heated and a material can be dyed at a laser exposed
   local area. A CO2 laser was used as a heating source since the
   absorptivity of a CO2 laser to water is higher than that of the others
   laser. Using this LPC method, laser color marking and color image
   expression has been attempted. Four colors of cyan, magenta, yellow, and
   black (CMYK) figures and characters have been created using laser
   marking method. By mixing the dots of two colors, another color printing
   have been created. It makes possible to create more other color printing
   that the mixing rate of the dots of two colors change variously. From
   digital image which includes color information, a colorful image
   expression on a plastic object has been successfully obtained using the
   LPC method combined with a segmented pixel drawing (SPD) method
   developed in our laboratory in order to make an artistic drawing.}},

Abstract = {{Since China opening to outside world, the economy in the Pearl
   (Zhujiang) River Delta (PRD) has been double digit growth. It has been
   known as one of mature fast growth areas in the world and become the
   model and hope of Chinese reform and opening to outside world. The
   regional development in PRD is the outcome of polarization effects. The
   polarization effects actually are extension of international regional
   division and a combination of Hongkong's influence and reform and
   open-door policies on the mainland. Since the 1990s, driven by
   knowledge-based economy, the PRD has further adjusted the industrial
   structure and achieved good progress in upgrading industrial structure.
   Its high technology industry has developed quickly and the economic
   internationalization has deepened, meanwhile, the region is going
   through transformation and some new trends have begun to appear, which
   include: university towns springing up, industrial globalization and the
   construction of Hi-tech development zones. The paper suggests that with
   the economic growth changing from relying on the low level production
   elements to relying on high level production elements, the regional
   policies in Guangdong Province should develop correspondingly: 1) make a
   plan to prohibite the blind construction in innovative spatial
   constructions; 2) make measures to attract the overseas talents to
   establish a pool of talent; 3) work out the favorable policies for
   absorbing larger capital; 4) formulate the policy of attracting a
   cluster of industries to speed up the upgrade of industrial development.}},

Abstract = {{PaleoNet is an electronic communications system that realizes the
   concept of a global `paleontological community'. It was begun in a
   conscious attempt to overcome the disciplinary, geographical, and
   occupational barriers that subdivide that community into sectors and
   impede information flow. Operationally PaleoNet consists of a listserver
   and associated web sites in the US and UK. Over the past 8 years of
   operation PaleoNet has more than met expectations set for it to become
   one of the most unconventional and innovative aspects of the
   contemporary paleontological scene. In particular, PaleoNet challenges
   conventional notions of formal scientific publication as the primary
   means paleontologists use to communicate with colleagues. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A nomadic information environment is a heterogeneous assemblage of
   interconnected technological, and social, and organizational elements
   that enable the physical and social mobility of computing and
   communication services between organizational actors both within and
   across organizational borders. We analyze such environments based on
   their prevalent features of mobility, digital convergence, and mass
   scale, along with their mutual interdependencies. By using a framework
   that organizes research topics in nomadic information environments at
   the individual, team, organizational, and interorganizational levels and
   is comprised of both service and infrastructure development, we assess
   the opportunities and challenges for IS research. These deal with the
   design, use, adoption, and impacts of nomadic information environments.
   We conclude by discussing research challenges posed by nomadic
   information environments for information systems research skills and
   methods. These deal with the need to invent novel research methods and
   shift our research focus, the necessity to question the divide between
   the technical and the social, and the need to better integrate
   developmental and behavioral (empirical) research modes.}},

   model to examine the sources of growth between 1987 and 1993 in four
   East Asian economies-Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and South Korea. Using
   data for 20 manufacturing sectors at the three-digit SIC level, this
   study provides the first comprehensive examination of sources of growth
   that allows one to decompose total factor productivity growth,
   separating out technical efficiency changes (TECs) from technological
   progress (TP). We find that while there is ample evidence of the
   importance of increasing inputs in growth, and there is some support for
   technical efficiency change, or catching up to the frontier over this
   period, there is weak or even negative evidence for the role of
   technological progress, measured as a shift in the estimated production
   frontier. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The paper analyses the data collected in 10 schools in Israel which have
   incorporated ICT in unique ways and have succeeded in devising
   innovative classroom pedagogies and changes in teachers and students
   roles and outcomes. The major research questions addressed are: What
   levels of innovation were observed in the participant schools, and in
   which domains? How did the level of innovation in the various domains
   vary among and within schools? What correlation patterns among levels of
   innovation in the various domains can be identified? The data were
   analysed by mean of the innovation analysis schema developed for
   characterising ICT-based educational innovations. The findings indicate
   that most schools were in a transition stage towards fully innovative
   pedagogical implementation; school activities were effected
   differentially by ICT, thus creating `islands of innovation'; these
   islands however, have the potential to pull forward other areas of
   activity and people in the school; the domains most affected by ICT were
   the school's digital space, the didactic solutions implemented and the
   students' roles and outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Discussion about information and communication technologies in education
   are often conducted at a general level. To increase understanding about
   new technologies and learning it is necessary to be more specific about
   what kinds of tools are being used and how they are related to knowledge
   construction by students within specific subject domains. Three
   Norwegian cases studies are reported so that different school cultures
   on how the learning environments are implemented are exposed. One
   important conclusion from the cross-case analysis is the diversity among
   cases. What is the added value or changes that these technologies
   represent? Within a Norwegian context the paper shows how technology
   contributes to the design of new learning environments and how it might

Abstract = {{The ubiquity of information makes it easy to overlook the local
   character of innovative knowledge. Nowhere is this local character more
   overlooked yet paradoxically more evident than in Silicon Valley. The
   Valley persists as a densely interconnected innovative region, though
   its inhabitants loudly proclaim that the information technology they
   develop renders distance dead and place insignificant. It persists, we
   argue, because of the local character of innovative knowledge, which
   flows in social rather than digital networks. The locality of innovative
   knowledge highlights the challenge of developing other regions for the
   modern economy. Should these abandon traditional local strengths and
   strive to become another Silicon Valley? Or should they concentrate on
   their traditional strengths and rely on Silicon Valley and the other
   established high-tech regions to provide the necessary technology to
   survive in the digital age? We argue that they should do neither, but
   instead develop new technologies in service of their existing
   competencies and needs. Finding new ways to address indigenous problems
   is the right way, we believe, to tie to the region expertise, talent,
   and capital that might otherwise be lost to the lure of existing
   high-tech clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Much has been written about digital television. Mainstream reports range
   from a vague televisual utopia where one need never unplug oneself from

   the rate of diffusion the role that media communication (language) plays
   in this process. It uses a content analysis methodology to examine 1836
   digital television articles, drawn from mainstream newspaper
   publications from 1996 to January 2002. Results from the analysis show a

Abstract = {{The geographical location of a wireless device is acquiring a
   significant importance under the boost of innovative applications in the
   wireless market, and under the research activities related to the
   development of a new generation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems
   (GNSS). In the US a new phase of the Global Positioning System is
   foreseen, and Europe has decided to proceed with the Galileo program. In
   addition, different government institutions worldwide are working toward
   the definition of navigation plans, and regulations will set as
   mandatory the location identification of mobile users in emergency
   situations (US E-911 law and the European. E-112 directive).
   Considering all the navigation/positioning systems and techniques that
   will be available in the near future, it is clear that a central role
   will be played by the user handset; in fact, if navigation signals from
   different sources will be available, the unique possibility to obtain
   the best navigation performance from the user perspective will be the
   employment of enhanced receivers able to fuse different data.
   With this aim, this paper presents the design of an innovative
   navigation receiver based on Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology.
   The reconfigurability and flexibility issues are guaranteed by the use
   of reprogrammable high-speed hardware (FPGA-Field Programmable Gate
   Array and DSP-Digital Signal Processor) and thus a deep integration at
   the raw signal level between GPS and the future Galileo has been
   obtained. The interoperability issue among different systems is then
   solved at the receiver level.
   This paper discusses the implementation of a baseline architecture of a
   reconfigurable GNSS receiver over a FPGA + DSP prototype platform. The
   receiver is able to deal with different input Signals-In-Space (SIS),
   and can operate with present GPS ranging signals or with the future
   Galileo SIS. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint extension is primarily resisted by the
   digital flexor tendons and suspensory ligament. A variety of external
   support techniques are used to protect these supporting structures from
   or after injury by resisting MCP joint extension, although not all are
   effective and/or practical for. use in an exercising horse. In this
   study, 7 forelimbs were loaded in vitro to determine the effect of a
   simple gamgee bandage, a 3-layered bandage with and without a contoured
   palmar splint, a neoprene exercise boot, and an innovative carbon fibre
   composite exercise boot (Dalmar tendon support boot). There was no
   significant resistance to MCP joint extension by the gamgee or neoprene
   exercise boot. The 3-layered bandage had a significant (P<0.01)
   supporting effect at MCP angles of greater than or equal to245degrees,
   and when combined with the contoured splint at angles of greater than or
   equal to230degrees. The Dalmar tendon support boot resisted MCP
   extension at angles of greater than or equal to245degrees (settings 1
   and 2) and greater than or equal to225degrees (setting 3). These data
   demonstrate that the contoured splint and the Dalmar tendon support boot
   (which is also easily fitted for use during exercise) are useful for the
   management of tendon/ligament injury and during rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{We've all heard the stories about corporate giants who ignored
   disruptive innovations and paid a steep price: Think what the personal
   computer did to Digital or Japanese economy cars did to the Big Three
   automakers. Big companies now spend a lot of time and money trying to
   make sure they don't get blindsided by their smaller, leaner
   counterparts.
   But it's not easy to distinguish genuine threats from also-rans as they
   emerge. Most of the nascent technologies that typically bombard
   executives will not amount to competitive threats and deserve to be
   ignored. As a result, disruptions are usually not taken seriously until
   they become obvious - when it's often too late.
   A disruptive innovation is a technology, product, or process that creeps
   up from below an existing business and threatens to displace it.
   Usually, the disrupter offers lower performance and less functionality
   at a much lower price. The product or process is good enough to meet
   some customers' needs; others welcome the disruption's simplicity.
   Gradually, it improves to the point where it displaces the incumbent.
   But, the authors argue, disruption isn't inevitable. They have developed
   a tool that can help companies detect potential disruptive innovations
   while management still has time to respond effectively. The tool's
   decision-making methodology harnesses the organization's collective
   wisdom to determine how likely it is that a particular innovation will
   seriously damage an incumbent's business. The methodology has two
   components: an analytical instrument and an organizational process.
   There's nothing magical about it - but it gets managers to think
   systematically about identifying and addressing threats to the core
   business. And the tool's rigorous approach can spell the difference
   between flailing around and acting effectively in the face of a serious
   competitive threat.}},

Title = {{Remote sensing for environmental protection of the eastern Mediterranean
   rugged mountainous areas, Lebanon}},
Journal = {{ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{13-23}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Lying along the eastern Mediterranean coast with elevated mountain
   chains higher than 2500 m straddling its terrain, Lebanon is a country
   of natural beauty and is thus attracting tourism. However, with a
   population density exceeding 800/km(2) and a rugged steep sloping land,
   problems abound in the country calling for holistic-approach studies.
   Only remote sensing, whose use is new in Lebanon can secure such needed
   studies within a scientific and pragmatic framework. The paper
   demonstrates for the concerned themes, the innovative use of remote
   sensing in such a difficult terrain, giving three examples of major
   environmental problems in the coastal mountains. Only few studies have
   so far focused on those mountains, notably application of remote
   sensing. The rugged mountainous terrain receives considerable rain, but
   the water is quickly lost running on the steep slopes, or infiltrating
   through fractures and the karstic conduits into the subsurface. Field
   investigations are difficult to achieve, therefore, remote sensing helps
   reveal various surface land features important in reflecting water
   feeding into the subsurface. Optical, radar and thermal infrared
   remotely sensed data cover a wide spectrum serving that purpose. A map
   of preferential groundwater accumulation potential is produced. It can
   serve for better water exploitation as well as protection. Because the
   terrain is karstic and rugged, the subsurface water flow is difficult to
   discern. Any pollution at a certain spot would certainly spread around.
   This constitutes the second example of environmental problems facing the
   mountainous areas in Lebanon. An integrated approach using remote
   sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) gives good results in
   finding out the likelihood of how pollution, or contaminants, can
   selectively move in the subsurface. A diagnostic analysis with a
   GIS-type software acts as a guide producing indicative maps for the
   above purpose. The third example given deals with the problem of losing
   soil, which is a very vital source in such mountainous land. With steep
   slopes, torrential rain and improper human interference, run-off is high
   and water-soil erosion is continuously deteriorating the land cover.
   Remote sensing can facilitate studying the factors enhancing the
   process, such as soil type, slope gradient, drainage, geology and land
   cover. Digital elevation models created from SAR imagery contribute
   significantly to assessing vulnerability of hydric-soil erosion over
   such a difficult terrain. GIS layers of the above factors are integrated
   with erosional criteria to produce a risk map of soil erosion. Results
   indicate that 36\% of the Lebanese terrain is under threat of high-level
   erosion, and 52\% of that is concentrated in the rugged mountainous
   regions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of two decision support systems are traced from their
   roots in academia to deployment to technical advisors in USDA Natural
   Resource Conservation Service. The Grazing Lands Application (GLA)
   decision support system (DSS) was designed to provide forage inventories
   for grazing management of ranches. The other tool, NUTBAL, evolved as a
   stand alone DSS, emerging as a component of GLA when a supporting
   monitoring technology for nutritional profiling of free-ranging animals
   provided the user rapid estimates of diet quality from fecal scans with
   near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). The adoption pattern of
   GLA and NUTBAL were quite different, with GLA experiencing less
   widespread adoption in USDA NRCS. The primary causes were (1) limited
   adoption rate of GLA within NRCS associated with changing culture in the
   information technology development group, (2) time overloading and staff
   reassignments for new programs, (3) changing software/hardware
   development environments imposed by the client disrupting development
   and System design and (4) large up front conversion of a largely
   paper-based system to a digital form. GLA was transformed to web-based
   delivery and streamlined to gain greater acceptance by users and ease
   time constraints on use of spatial tools. The NUTBAL system experienced
   more of a user driven evolution since it emerged from the GLA suite of
   tools and was supported by on-ranch monitoring systems capability of
   directly linking the livestock producer's animals with the software.
   NUTBAL's linkage to animal monitoring systems seems to have accelerated
   adoption rates. Ease of access to supporting input data coupled with
   early involvement of the target user and extensive analysis of the
   decision environment were critical to future success of these systems.
   Targeting technical advisors instead of livestock producers appears to
   be a more viable development track unless new innovations in DSS
   delivery systems can emerge using the internet. (C) 2002 Published by

   that were threatened by wildland fires in Greece are reported. A
   conceptual flowchart that combines optimal fire protection objectives
   with the protected values and functions of the national parks and
   cultural monuments is analyzed. A case-study presents the development of
   an electronic forest fire protection support system in the forest around
   the Ancient Olympia site in Greece, as an example of the potential
   deployment of innovative technologies in wildland fire protection. The
   aim of the system is twofold. First, the system supports remote
   monitoring of an extensive hydraulic network of pipelines, pumps and
   water-storage tanks build in the vicinity of the site. Second, the
   system provides means for remote operation of numerous revolving
   water-jets installed on top of heavy-duty tree-high metal towers, spread
   at key-locations inside the surrounding forest. All system telemetry
   data and command signals are transmitted through a single underground
   wire link requiring no external electric power at sensor/actuator
   locations inside the forest. Special user interfaces allow immediate
   system deployment either from a central graphics-based console screen or
   from purpose-build remote consoles installed at selected locations in
   the forest, thus achieving a high degree of readiness.}},

Abstract = {{Forecasting the diffusion of innovations in the telecommunications
   sector is a constantly recurring problem for national providers. The
   problem is characterised by short data series making the estimation of
   model parameters unreliable. However, the same innovation will be
   diffusing simultaneously in other national markets, although with a
   different start date. The use of this cross-sectional data in
   constructing innovation diffusion models is investigated here. Four
   models for pooling the cross-sectional data are described and two
   diffusion models are discussed although only one, the Gompertz model is
   used throughout. Three innovation data sets are used in the evaluation
   of the models: digital cellular telephones, ISDN connections and fax
   connections. The pooled diffusion forecasts proved to be more accurate
   in several comparisons relative to a naive benchmark and to individual
   forecasts when available. (C) 2002 International Institute of

   it possible to obtain simultaneous high-resolution digital measurements
   of the x, y and z coordinates at any point on the bacteria surface. The
   images obtained before and 2, 4 and 6 h after incubation with
   erythromycin A (32 mg/L) and rokitamycin (2 mg/L) clearly show that not
   even high concentrations of erythromycin A interfere with the M
   phenotype of S. pyogenes, whereas rokitamycin has a progressive action
   that leads to the formation of abnormally large cells, the loosening of

Abstract = {{Scaling of analog CMOS in deep submicron regime is challenging,
   particularly for mixed mode system on chip applications due to the
   tradeoff in design requirements for analog and digital applications. The
   conventional approach employing aggressive gate oxide and S/D junction
   scaling to suppress the two-dimensional (2-D) electrostatic coupling and
   related short channel effects that degrade the device behavior in deep
   submicron regime, though, improves the digital performance. However,
   this approach is not sufficient to get reasonable analog performance.
   This paper presents comprehensive study on the analog performance of
   scaled MOSFETs and explores alternative ways for improving analog
   performance of these devices. It is shown that easily integrable
   innovative channel engineering scheme in the form of single pocket
   structures can be used in the standard logic CMOS process to
   significantly improve the device analog performance of the deep
   submicron devices.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory analyses may generate multiple data types that may reside in
   disparate systems, and combining data into a report often requires
   laborious, error-prone methods. Kidney stone analysis, which includes
   biochemical composition analysis and gross feature documentation, is an
   example of such a situation. Me developed the kidney stone reporting
   system (KISS) that integrates patient and specimen information from the
   laboratory information system, digital images of stones, and analytic
   instrument data into a concise report for the ordering clinicians. The
   database management environment facilitates archival and retrieval
   capabilities. Implementation of the system has reduced the number of
   manual steps necessary, to produce a report and has saved approximately
   30 technologist hours per week. Transcription errors have been
   virtually, eliminated. The KISS represents an innovative use of standard
   tools to integrate text, image, and graphic data from disparate systems
   into an integrated laboratory report, without the need for expensive

Abstract = {{Speeder Reader is an interactive reading station built around two
   primary ideas: dynamic text (especially RSVP, that is, rapid serial
   visual presentation), and the interface metaphor of driving. As words
   flash one at a time on a screen in front of the reader, he or she
   controls the rate of speed of the words with a gas pedal (up to 1850
   words per minute in the current instance). Text stream selection is
   performed with a steering wheel. Thus, one can ``drive through a
   book{''}. We leverage people's knowledge of the familiar activity of
   driving an automobile (or, in the case of children, operating a
   speed-racing video game) to allow comfortable and intuitive access to a
   possibly less familiar world of interactive text. We emphasize the power
   and case of the familiar driving metaphor as a navigation device.
   Speeder Reader was first installed at the Tech Museum of Innovation in
   San Jose, CA, as part of a larger exhibit on the impact of digital
   technologies on reading. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of power quality is becoming an impelling need in a
   deregulated electricity market where the sources producing distortion
   and disturbances are steadily increasing in number and power. The
   instruments for power quality measurement are based on complex digital
   processing of the input signals, whose waveforms are highly variable.
   The calibration of this kind of instruments is therefore an open topic,
   especially when the uncertainty propagation through the digital signal
   processing (DSP) algorithm is concerned. This paper proposes an
   innovative procedure, based on the Monte Carlo method. Starting from the
   determination of the probability density function of the uncertainty
   contribution of every device from the signal input stage to the
   analog-to-digital conversion stage, this procedure estimates the
   probability density function of the measurement results and the
   measurement standard uncertainty as the standard deviation associated
   with this function. The result of the experimental work done on a
   prototype of a power quality measurement instrument is reported.}},

Abstract = {{Daptomycin is a novel, rapidly bactericidal in vitro antibiotic that is
   under investigation for the treatment of serious Gram-positive
   infections. Although daptomycin appears to disrupt membrane function,
   the precise mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) is an innovative technique that allows
   high-resolution visualization and digital image manipulation of cell
   surface structures in 3 dimensions without the use of photons and
   electrons. The aim of this study was to use AFM to investigate the
   morphostructural changes in Bacillus cereus that occur upon daptomycin
   administration. The effects of daptomycin at 4x and 8x the minimal
   inhibitory concentration were visualized during an 8-hour incubation
   period. Atomic force microscopy images showed aberrant bacterial surface
   formations, including flattening and shrinking of cells and leakage of
   cytoplasm through the membrane. In addition to structural changes, the
   destabilization of flagella was also observed. These results support
   previous data suggesting that daptomycin disrupts membrane function.}},

Title = {{Mismatch-tolerant distributed photonic analog-to-digital conversion
   using spatial oversampling and spectral noise shaping}},
Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1674-1687}},

Abstract = {{The analog-to-digital (A/D) interface is generally considered to be the
   most critical part of any signal acquisition and processing system.
   Because of the difficulty in achieving high-resolution and highspeed A/D
   converters, this interface has been a barrier to the realization of
   high-speed, high-throughput systems. Recently, there has been renewed
   interest in new and innovative approaches to A/D conversion, with a
   significant emphasis on photonic techniques. Interleaving is a common
   approach applied to high-speed photonic A/D conversion; it reduces the
   wide-bandwidth input signal to one that can be converted using
   conventional high-speed A/D converters. The high-speed sampled input is
   interleaved to N individual channels with each channel operating at 1/N
   of the sampling rate. These channelization techniques are known to
   suffer from performance degradations due to channel-to-channel mismatch.
   Within the electronic A/D converter community, temporal over-sampling
   and spectral noise shaping have become common practice in high-fidelity
   audio applications. Here, a low-resolution quantizer is embedded in a
   feedback architecture in an effort to reduce the quantization noise
   through spectral noise shaping. A large error associated with a single
   sample is diffused over many subsequent samples, and then linear
   filtering techniques are applied to remove the spectrally shaped noise,
   thereby improving the overall SNR of the converter. The approach to
   photonic A/D conversion described here leverages the 2-D nature of an
   optical architecture to extend the concept of spectral noise shaping to
   include 2-D spatial noise shaping. The proposed approach uses a
   mode-locked laser to generate the optical sampling pulses, an
   interferometer to modulate the electronic analog signal onto the optical
   pulses, and a 2-D smart-pixel hardware implementation of a distributed
   error-diffusion neural network. (C) 2002 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{We have developed an adaptive, automatic, correlation- and
   clustering-based method for greatly reducing the degree of picking
   inconsistency in large, digital seismic catalogs and for quantifying
   similarity within, and discriminating among, clusters of disparate
   waveform families. Innovations in the technique include (1) the use of
   eigenspectral methods for cross-spectral phase estimation and for
   providing subsample pick lag error estimates in units of time, as
   opposed to dimensionless relative scaling of uncertainties; (2)
   adaptive, cross-coherency-based filtering; and (3) a hierarchical
   waveform stack correlation method for adjusting mean intercluster pick
   times without compromising tight intracluster relative pick estimates.
   To solve the systems of cross-correlation lags we apply an iterative,
   optimized conjugate gradient technique that minimizes an L-1-norm
   misfit. Our repicking technique not only provides robust similarity
   classification-event discrimination without making a priori assumptions
   regarding waveform similarity as a function of preliminary hypocenter
   estimates, but also facilitates high-resolution relocation of seismic
   sources. Although knowledgeable user input is needed initially to
   establish run-time parameters, significant improvement in pick
   consistency and waveform-based event classification may be obtained by
   then allowing the programs to operate automatically on the data. The
   process shows promise for enhancing catalog reliability while at the
   same time reducing analyst workload, although careful assessment of the
   automatic results is still important.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies during the last few years have discussed automated
   crack detection and mapping using digital image processing technologies
   in roadway maintenance and rehabilitation. Many recent studies have
   applied digital image processing to the recognition or sealing of cracks
   in pavement. There have been great discrepancies, however, among various
   segmentation methods that extract crack types and locations or classify
   the extent of cracking. Since all sensing systems also produce some
   spurious data and experience noise due to the varied topological and
   color conditions of the pavement surface, accurately mapping and
   representing the pavement cracks to be sealed using such segmentation
   methods would be even harder. This paper illustrates an innovative
   machine vision algorithm developed for accurate crack mapping and
   representation in the University of Texas (UT) automated road
   maintenance machine (ARMM). The paper mainly focuses on illustrating the
   detailed logic and descriptions of the algorithm. Efficiency evaluation
   results of the ARMM man-machine balanced crack mapping and
   representation process, including the line-snapping and path-planning
   functions, are also shown. Using the algorithms as an edge-describing
   tool can have broader applications in automation of infrastructure
   maintenance and inspection of civil works and in the domain of digital
   image processing.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Consider classes of signals that have a finite number of degrees of
   freedom per unit of time and call this number the rate of innovation.
   Examples of signals with a finite rate of innovation include streams of
   Diracs (e.g., the Poisson process), non-uniform splines, and piecewise
   polynomials.
   Even though these signals are not bandlimited, we show that they can be
   sampled uniformly at (or above) the rate of innovation using an
   appropriate kernel and then be perfectly reconstructed. Thus, we prove
   sampling theorems for classes of signals and kernels that generalize the
   classic ``bandlimited and sine kernel{''} case. In particular, we show
   how to sample and reconstruct periodic and finite-length streams of
   Diracs, nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials using sine and
   Gaussian kernels. For infinite-length signals with finite local rate of
   innovation, we show local sampling and reconstruction based on spline
   kernels.
   The key in all constructions is to identify the innovative part of a
   signal (e.g., time instants and weights of Diracs) using an annihilating
   or locator filter: a device well known in spectral analysis and
   error-correction coding. This leads to standard computational procedures
   for solving the sampling problem, which we show through experimental
   results.
   Applications of these new sampling results can be found in signal
   processing, communications systems, and biological systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the empirical evidence to determine whether Asian
   countries, despite having captured a disproportionately high share of
   global production of ICT goods, have as a group been laggard in the
   adoption of ICT in comparison to non-Asian countries. Using regression
   analysis, it is shown that as a group Asian countries have indeed had
   generally lower rates of ICT adoption relative to their levels of
   potential as predicted on the basis of their current level of
   development (GDP/capita) and competitiveness (world competitiveness
   index). In addition, disparities in ICT diffusion are found to be
   significantly higher among Asian countries than among non-Asian
   countries. In particular, a significant `digital divide' is found to
   exist between the five more advanced countries of the region (Japan and
   the four Asian NIEs) and the other seven developing Asian countries.
   Policy implications of the findings for the Asian countries are
   highlighted. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose the Net-Enabled Business Innovation Cycle (NEBIC) as an
   applied dynamic capabilities theory for measuring, predicting, and
   understanding a firm's ability to create customer value through the
   business use of digital networks. The theory incorporates both a
   variance and process view of net-enabled business innovation. It
   identifies four sequenced constructs: Choosing new IT, Matching Economic
   Opportunities with technology, Executing Business Innovation for Growth,
   and Assessing Customer Value, along with the processes and events that
   interrelate them as a cycle. The sequence of these theorized
   relationships for net-enablement (NE)(1) asserts that choosing IT
   precedes rather than aligns with corporate strategy. The theory offers a
   logically consistent and falsifiable basis for grounding research
   programs on metrics of net-enabled business innovation.}},

   dynamic linkages across Italian manufacturing sectors. We perform a very
   disaggregated analysis in order to identify, for each 3-digit industry,
   which composition of industrial activity is more conducive to growth. We
   find that diversity matters for growth, but each industry needs its own
   diversity. We provide some evidence of clustering of industries based on
   dynamic externalities. We find that many spillovers occur within
   input-output relationships. They often originate in downstream sectors
   favouring the growth of upstream industries. Lastly, the importance of
   spillovers does not depend on the technological intensity of the

   transitory effect on measured productivity, whereas external effects
   should produce permanent effects. It is found that persistent aggregate
   fluctuations have a permanent effect on productivity of four-digit US
   manufacturing industries. While a number of alternative explanations of
   this evidence are discussed and ruled out, the findings are consistent
   with a simple model with external or thick market effects.}},

Abstract = {{Explanations of the patterns of vertebrate fin and limb evolution are
   improving as specific hypotheses based on molecular and developmental
   data are proposed and tested. Comparative analyses of gene expression
   patterns and functions in developing limbs, and morphological patterns
   in embryonic, adult and fossil limbs point to digit specification as a
   key developmental innovation associated with the origin of tetrapods.
   Digit development during the fin-to-limb transition involved sustained
   proximodistal outgrowth and a new phase of Hox gene expression in the
   distal fin bud. These patterning changes in the distal limb have been
   explained by the linked concepts of the metapterygial axis and the
   digital arch. These have been proposed to account for the generation of
   limb pattern by sequential branching and segmentation of
   precartilagenous elements along the proximodistal axis of the limb.
   While these ideas have been very fruitful, they have become increasingly
   difficult to reconcile with experimental and comparative studies of fin
   and limb development. Here we argue that limb development does not
   involve a branching mechanism, and reassess the concept of a
   metapterygial axis in limb development and evolution. (C) 2002 Wiley

Abstract = {{The goal of the present work was to develop and test an innovative
   system for the training of paraplegic patients when they are standing
   up. The system consisted of a computer-controlled stimulator, surface
   electrodes for quadricep muscle stimulation, two knee angle sensors, a
   digital proportional-integrative-derivative (PID) controller and a
   mechanical device to support, partially, the body weight (weight
   reliever (WR)) A biomechanical model of the combined WR and patient was
   developed to find an optimum reference trajectory for the PID
   controller. The system was tested on three paraplegic patients and was
   shown to be reliable and safe. One patient completed a 30-session
   training period. Initially he was able to stand up only with 62\% body
   weight relief, whereas, after the training period, he performed a series
   of 30 standing-up/sitting-down cycles with 45\% body weight relief The
   closed-loop controller was able to keep the patient standing upright
   with minimum stimulation current, to compensate automatically for muscle
   fatigue and to smooth the sitting-down movement. The limitations of the
   controller in connection with a highly nonlinear system are considered.}},

Abstract = {{A gradual transition from electrical to optical networks is accompanying
   the rapid progress of telecommunication technology. The urge for
   enhanced transmission capacity and speed is dictating this trend. In
   fact, large volumes of data encoded on optical signals can be
   transported rapidly over long distances. Their propagation along
   specific routes across a communication network is ensured by a
   combination of optical fibers and optoelectronic switches. It is
   becoming apparent, however, that the interplay between the routing
   electrical stimulations and the traveling optical signals will not be
   able to support the terabit-per-second capacities that will be needed in
   the near future. Electrical inputs cannot handle the immense parallelism
   potentially possible with optical signals. Operating principles to
   control optical signals with optical signals must be developed.
   Molecular and supramolecular switches are promising candidates for the
   realization of innovative materials for information technology. Binary
   digits can be encoded in their chemical, electrical, or optical inputs
   and outputs to execute specific logic functions. We have developed a
   simple strategy to gate optical signals with optical signals by using a
   photoactive molecular switch. We have demonstrated that NAND, NOR, and
   NOT operations can be implemented exclusively with optical inputs and
   optical outputs coupling from one to three switching elements. Our
   remarkably simple approach to all-optical switching might lead to the
   development of a new generation of devices for digital processing and
   communication technology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a summary of a research programme at BTexact
   Technologies which is aimed at helping a technology innovation company
   to ground its innovations, to see opportunities for the exploitation of
   its technologies, and to create socio-technical visions which can help
   to drive technological innovation itself. As a by-product, the programme
   has also created strategic knowledge that is of critical importance to
   public and private policy/decision makers alike. This research is a key
   part of BTexact Technologies' approach to the creation of and response
   to disruptive technologies. Understanding `usage by people' is
   absolutely critical to figuring out what is disruptive about
   technologies, why this is so, and therefore how to make money out of
   them. Since this is critical to several of BTexact's core competencies
   (and to those of its customers), the value of the research reported here
   is self-evident both to BTexact and to its customers. Without it, they
   will only ever make money by accident, a strategy that shareholders do
   not seem to find amusing.}},

Abstract = {{This essay illustrates how scientific information has become a sort of
   private property of publishing companies since the beginning of the
   activity in industrial printing, and how there has been an intention to
   recover public libraries by those researchers who produce such
   information.
   Authors do not normally participate in benefits from their own works,
   though they do collaborate in editorial boards as well as in the quality
   control of commercial publications. They are peer reviewers and
   customers who stimulate, support and encourage academic libraries of
   research centers and institutes for the acquisition of journals and
   magazines.
   The most significant initiative in electronic publication known so far
   is the pre-print of High Energy Physics at Los Alamos, USA. This
   initiative permitted to redefine printed texts and to specify the
   functions of scientific publications. The effects of e-print development
   are obviously an innovation in information systems. The particular
   experience at Los Alamos was followed by other organizations such as the
   PubMed Central, which comprises Health publishing companies.
   The main topic of discussion with publishing houses centers on copyright
   and on the development of e-print mechanisms that may spread the
   information to the scientific community before final printing.
   It is necessary to establish government policies that may contribute to
   the design of a national or regional strategy for free access to the
   information produced by academic organizations. In spite of the fact
   that Information is a government affair, these organizations are leading
   this initiative.}},

Abstract = {{The aim was to measure the angle of elevation of the soft palate during
   the separate conditions of swallowing of pudding, swallowing of liquid
   and during production of `may/pay', using videofluoroscopy and
   innovative computer software. We then determined whether soft palate
   elevation (as reflected in measures of an angle) differed in those
   separate conditions. Twelve female participants were studied, aged 40-70
   years. The trends observed were that the highest soft palate elevation
   was displayed in the liquid-swallowing condition and the lowest soft
   palate elevation was displayed in the speech conditions. The results did
   not reach statistical significance, but the findings support the
   suggestions of Rubesin et al. (1987) and Fritzell (1969) that soft
   palate elevation is higher during swallowing than during speech. This
   same method was then used to measure soft palate elevation under the
   same three conditions in nine females, all aged >40 years, who had motor
   neuron disease. Again, the highest soft palate elevation was displayed
   when swallowing liquid, but this time the lowest elevation occurred when
   swallowing pudding. Owing to small numbers, results did not reach
   statistical significance, but the trends may be important to replicate
   in a larger study. This pilot study developed a comprehensive and
   accurate method of measuring the soft palate elevation using
   digitization and computer software.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid advance of digital control hardware, it is time to take
   the simple but effective proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control
   technology to the next level of performance and robustness. For this
   purpose, a nonlinear PID and active disturbance rejection framework are
   introduced in this paper. It complements the existing theory in that (1)
   it actively and systematically explores the use of nonlinear control
   mechanisms for better performance, even for linear plants; (2) it
   represents a control strategy that is rather independent of mathematical
   models of the plants, thus achieving inherent robustness and reducing
   design complexity. Stability analysis, as well as software/hardware test
   results, are presented. It is evident that the proposed framework lends
   itself well in seeking innovative solutions to practical problems while
   maintaining the simplicity and the intuitiveness of the existing
   technology. (C) 2002 ISA-The Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation

Abstract = {{Purpose. Early detection of breast cancer enables for the reduction of
   mortality. The purpose of this article is to describe commercially
   available systems for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for mammograms and
   to analyze their diagnostic potential and utility.
   Materials and methods. Up to now, there are three CAD-systems
   available,the Image Checker(TM) M 1000 (R2-Technology, USA), the Second
   Look(TM)-system (CADx Medical Systems) and the Mammex TR(TM) (Scanis
   Inc., USA). Most of the present studies are done with the R2-system. The
   mammographies have been digitalized secondarily. Different algorithms
   recognized microcalcifications and masses. The connection between full
   field digital mammography systems and DICOM-networks is possible.
   Results. : In retrospective and one large prospective study with 12.860
   patients it could be shown that sensitivity of the investigator with CAD
   could be improved up to 19\%, microcalcifications are yielded with CAD
   in 100\%, masses in up to 80\%.
   Conclusion. Double-reading with CAD-systems can increase early breast
   cancer detection effectively. Regarding the development of full field
   digital mammography we are looking forward to further innovations.}},

Abstract = {{Polycapillary x-ray optics provide an innovative new way to control
   x-ray beams. Placing these optics after the object to be imaged provides
   very efficient rejection of Compton scatter, while allowing image
   magnification without loss of resolution, image demagnification, or
   image shaping to match with digital detectors. Measured scatter
   rejection optics had primary transmissions greater than 50\% and scatter
   transmission of less than 1\%. For a 5-cm thick Lucite phantom, this
   resulted in a contrast enhancement of nearly a factor of two at 20 keV
   and three at 40 keV. The magnification from the tapered capillary optics
   improved the MTF at all frequencies out to 1.8 times the original system
   resolution. Increases below the system resolution are most important
   because clinically relevant structures generally occupy lower spatial
   frequencies.
   Alternatively, placing a collimating optic and diffracting crystal
   before the patient provides sufficient monochromatic beam intensity for
   medical imaging. Contrast, resolution, and intensity measurements were
   performed with both high and low angular acceptance crystals. At 8 keV,
   contrast enhancement was a factor of 5 relative to the polychromatic
   case, in good agreement with theoretical values. At 17.5 keV,
   monochromatic subject contrast was more than a factor of 2 times greater
   than the conventional polychromatic contrast. An additional factor of
   two increase in contrast, for a total factor of four, is expected from
   the removal of scatter in a large beam clinical system. The measured
   angular resolution after the crystal was 0.4 mrad for a silicon crystal.}},

Abstract = {{The digital economy has significantly altered the way business is
   conducted and financial information is communicated. A rapidly growing
   number of organizations are conducting business and publishing business
   and financial reports online and in real-time. Real-time financial
   reporting is likely to necessitate continuous auditing to provide
   continuous assurance about the quality and credibility of the
   information presented. The audit process has, by necessity, evolved from
   a conventional manual audit to computer-based auditing and is now
   confronted with creating continuous electronic audits. Rapidly emerging
   information technology and demands for more timely communication of
   information to business stakeholders requires auditors to invent new
   ways to continuously monitor, gather, and analyze audit evidence.
   Continuous auditing is defined here as ``a comprehensive electronic
   audit process that enables auditors to provide some degree of assurance
   on continuous information simultaneously with, or shortly after, the
   disclosure of the information.{''} This paper is based on a review of
   related literature, innovative continuous auditing applications, and the
   experiences of the authors. An approach for building continuous audit
   capacity is presented and audit data warehouses and data marts are
   described. Ever improving technology suggests that the real-time
   exchange of sensitive financial data will place constant pressure on
   auditors to update audit techniques. Most of the new techniques that
   will be required will involve creation of new software and audit models.
   Future research should focus on how continuous auditing could be
   constantly improved in various auditing domains including assurance,
   attestation, and audit services.}},

Abstract = {{Advancements in computer technology and telecommunications have meant
   that all diagnostic images can now be acquired as digital signals,
   however the ethicolegal concepts surrounding this innovation remain
   unclear. In the UK there are limited practice guidelines on legal issues
   relating specifically to telemedicine or teleradiology. It is not yet
   clear whether the current law relates to telemedicine in the same way
   that it does for other medical specialties, or whether telemedicine
   raises new legal issues that need clarification. This article attempts
   to outline some of the potential legal issues, but the absence of case
   law and legislation in this area will ensure that many questions remain
   unanswered. The legal implications of teleradiology/ telemedicine are
   addressed, and literature, laws and professional guidelines from the UK,
   USA, Australia and New Zealand are reviewed, focusing on the American
   licensure laws, professional relationships with patients with regards to
   liability. responsibility, accountability and duty of care issues, as
   well as issues of missed diagnosis, misdiagnosis, security and
   confidentiality. Teleradiology, while being actively practised
   worldwide, gives rise to many unanswered medicolegal questions. It is
   suggested that guidelines need to be implemented to safeguard patients
   and professionals alike.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound (US) has undergone dramatic changes since its inception three
   decades ago; the original cumbersome B-mode gantry system has evolved
   into a high resolution real-time imaging system. This review describes
   both recent advances in ultrasound and contrast media and likely future
   developments. Technological advances in electronics and computing have
   revolutionized ultrasound practice with ever expanding applications.
   Developments in transducer materials and array designs have resulted in
   greater bandwidths with improvements in spatial and contrast resolution.
   Developments in digital signal processing have produced innovations in
   beam forming, image display and archiving. Technological advances have
   resulted in novel imaging modes which exploit the non-linear behaviour
   of tissue and microbubble contrast agents. Microbubble contrast agents
   have dramatically extended the clinical and research applications of
   ultrasound. Not only can Doppler studies be enhanced but also novel
   non-linear modes allow vessels down to the level of the microcirculation
   to be imaged. Functional and quantitative studies allow interrogation of
   a wide spectrum of tissue beds. The advent of tissue-specific agents
   promises to improve the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in the
   detection and characterization of focal liver lesions to rival that of
   computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Ultrasound has recently moved into therapeutic applications with high
   intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and microbubble assisted delivery of
   drugs and genes showing great promise. (C) 2002 The Royal College of

Abstract = {{Social reformer Charles Booth undertook a massive survey into the social
   and economic conditions of the people of London at the end of the 19th
   century. An important innovation of his Inquiry was the construction of
   large, detailed maps displaying social class of inner London on a
   street-by-street basis. These provide a detailed and vivid picture of
   the geography of poverty and affluence at this time. These maps have
   been digitised, georeferenced and linked to contemporary ward boundaries
   allowing Booth's measurement of social class to be matched to the
   measurement of social class in the 1991 census of population and
   standardised mortality ratios derived for all causes of death in the
   survey area between 1991 and 1995. The social class data were used to
   derive an index of relative poverty for both time periods and a
   comparison of the geographies of relative poverty and their relationship
   with contemporary mortality was made. Although the overall standard of
   living had increased, the geography of poverty at the end of the 19th
   century was very similar to that at the end of the 20th century.
   Moreover, the geography of all causes of death for people over the age
   of 65 was more strongly related to the geography of poverty in the late
   19th century than contemporary patterns of poverty. This relationship
   was also true for mortality for specific diseases that are related to
   deprivation in early life. The paper concludes that the spatial patterns
   of poverty in inner London are extremely robust and a century of change
   has failed to disrupt it. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) will remain the backbone of
   digital logic, silicon technology will evolve in directions driven by
   system needs that are not met by CMOS alone. It is argued that BiCMOS
   (bipolar complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor), particularly SOI
   (silicon-on-insulator) BiCMOS, will emerge as an important technology
   platform for mixed-signal systems. The bipolar transistors will be used
   primarily for the rf (radio-frequency) and analog functions, while the
   CMOS will be used for most digital functions. The SOI substrate provides
   dc and ac isolation, as well as opportunities for further device and
   circuit innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Libraries (DLs) introduce several challenging requirements with
   respect to the formulation, specification, and enforcement of adequate
   data protection policies. Unlike conventional database environments, a
   DL environment typically is characterized by dynamic user population,
   often making accesses from remote locations, and by an extraordinarily
   large amount of multimedia information, stored in a variety of formats.
   Moreover, in a DL environment, access policies are often specified based
   on user qualifications and characteristics, rather than user identity
   (for example, a user can be given access to an R-rated video only if he/
   she is older than 18 years). Another crucial requirement is the support
   for content-dependent authorizations on digital library objects (for
   example, all documents containing discussions on how to operate guns
   must be made available only to users who are 18 or older). Since
   traditional authorization models do not adequately meet access control
   requirements typical to DLs, in this paper, we propose a content-based
   authorization model suitable for a DL environment. Specifically, the
   most innovative features of our authorization model are: 1) flexible
   specification of authorizations based on the qualifications and
   characteristics of users (including positive and negative), 2) both
   content-dependent and content-independent access control to digital
   library objects, and 3) varying granularity of authorization objects
   ranging from sets of library objects to specific portions of objects.}},

   that innovation has characteristics that make it unique froth other

   non-routine social process that involves the creative deployment of
   knowledge. By examining the individual, the social and the geographic

Abstract = {{In today's hypercompetitive environment, new sources of product and
   process innovation are continually being sought to reinforce companies'
   competitive advantages. In the recent past, the digital revolution
   inspired new managerial applications to strengthen positions within
   market arenas. In the case of airlines, early web applications were in
   the form of asynchronous sites, where customers could get little more
   than the same information on timetables and fares provided by travel
   agents albeit in new formats. Later, carriers started selling tickets on
   the web to make use of the cheaper distribution channel than the
   standard computer reservation systems (CRSs). Today, Internet
   potentially permits carriers to LT,et significant economic and
   competitive benefits beyond those simply coming from e-commerce. A wider
   e-business perspective may assure a one-to-one relationship with target
   customers, with a consequential fine-tuning of a firm's system offer. At
   the same time, carriers may exploit the significant cost savings from
   their procurement processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   access to digital documents in a structured form on the Web. The
   existing library classification schemes serve as good bases for
   achieving this goal. This paper presents a brief review of the various

   activities fulfilled with-in various research projects to make possible
   the effective automatic indexing and classification of Web sources. It
   describes the approaches taken in the Nordic WAIS/WWW;DESIRE II -

Abstract = {{This article notes the difficulty in defining cyberterrorisin and
   several problems associated with identifying the potential misuses of
   the Internet and the World Wide Web by terrorist groups. In particular;
   the use of digital steganography has recently been identified as an
   emerging and alarming trend by law enforcement and intelligence
   agencies. This technological innovation is used as a case study of the
   complexities surrounding cyberterrorisin, its definition, and how
   democracies can deal with these advances in communication technology.
   Supplementing this discussion is a review of the various social,
   regulatory, and legal forms of social intervention related to
   controlling electronic communications. The conclusion of this article
   includes an analytical framework from which additional research into
   these issues could be conducted and suggests how policy solutions for
   said complexities could be formulated.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet-led digital economy is changing both the production and
   consumption patterns at the global scale. Although great potential
   exists to harness information technology in general and the Internet in
   particular and improve the environment, possible negative impacts of
   e-commerce on the environment should also be considered and dealt with.
   In this forum, we discuss both the potential positive and negative
   impacts of e-commerce. Drawing from insights gained from the complexity
   theory, we also delineate some broad contours for environmental policies
   in the information age. Given the paradoxical nature of technological
   innovations, we wart to caution the scientific community and
   policymakers not to treat the Internet as the Holy Grail for
   environmental salvation.}},

Abstract = {{Digital watermarking is well known as enabling technology to prove
   ownership on copyrighted material, detect originators of illegally made
   copies, monitor the usage of the copyrighted multimedia data and analyze
   the spread spectrum of the data over networks and servers. Research has
   shown that data hiding techniques can be applied successfully to other
   application areas like manipulations recognition. In this paper, we show
   our innovative approach for integrating watermark and cryptography based
   methods within a framework of new application scenarios spanning a wide
   range from dedicated and user specific services, ``Try\&Buy{''}
   mechanisms to general means for long-term customer relationships. The
   tremendous recent efforts to develop and deploy ubiquitous mobile
   communication possibilities are changing the demands but also
   possibilities for establishing new business and commerce relationships.
   Especially we motivate annotation watermarks and aspects of M-Commerce
   to show important scenarios for access control. Based on a description
   of the challenges of the application domain and our latest work we
   discuss, which methods can be used for establishing services in a fast
   convenient and secure way for conditional access services based on
   digital watermarking combined with cryptographic techniques. We
   introduce an example scenario for digital audio and an overview of steps
   in order to establish these concepts practically.}},

   diode was designed to achieve a coupling efficiency of 90\%, enabling

   Embedded optical fibers in a printed circuit board were used to achieve
   precise control of the optical propagation delay times and permit a high
   packaging density. We developed small laser-diode and photo-diode
   modules suitable for optical coupling with the embedded fibers. A
   fabricated prototype optical backboard bus controlled by a controller IC
   mounted on a function board was able to successfully distribute

Abstract = {{The usual numerical methods for removing the depressions of a Digital
   Elevation Model (DEM) gradually fill the depressions and merge the
   embedded ones. These methods are complex to implement and need large
   computation time, particularly when the DEM contains a high proportion
   of random noise. A new method is presented here. It is innovative
   because, instead of gradually filling the depressions, it first
   inundates the surface with a thick layer of water and then removes the
   excess water. The algorithm is simple to understand and to implement,
   requiring only a few tens of code lines. It is much faster than usual
   algorithms. Moreover, this method is versatile: depressions can be
   replaced with a surface either strictly horizontal, or slightly sloping.
   The first option is used for the calculation of depression storage
   capacity and the second one for drainage network extraction. The method
   is fully detailed and a pseudo-code is provided. Its practical
   computation time, evaluated on generated fractal surfaces, is
   asymptotically proportional to N-1.2 where N is the number of grid
   points. The theoretical computation time is asymptotically proportional
   to N-1.5 in all cases, with the exception of some exotic ones with no
   practical interest. By contrast, existing methods have a computation
   time asymptotically proportional to N-2. Applications are done for both
   generated and measured surfaces with 256 cells to 6.2 million cells. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper describes the implementation of a white noise generator to be
   used as the input signal of a new method for testing analog-to-digital
   converters in order to detect and to evaluate integral and differential
   non-linearity errors. The main goal of this method is to avoid the
   comparison of the analog-to-digital output with a known and very precise
   reference input. The proposed white noise generator is easily
   implemented, and can reduce the complexity to generate other excitation
   signals. The proposed innovative method uses noise as the excitation
   signal. The use of this kind of signal avoids concerns about the
   inherent noise present in all electronic systems. The testing technique
   is based on the analysis of the spectral response of the ADC output.
   This paper covers the generation of the excitation signal, and
   simulation and practical results are presented to prove the efficiency
   of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Carry propagation chains are commonly found along the critical paths of
   many digital VLSI systems and, in particular, arithmetic circuits. The
   carry propagation delay, therefore, has a significant effect on system
   performance. Innovative design approaches, such as carry-lookahead
   adders and redundant arithmetic, trade off area, delay, and power
   through shorter carry-propagation paths. The focus of this paper is an
   alternative and complementary solution for decreasing the
   carry-propagation delay, particularly for those cases where chains of
   transmission gates are used. The behavior of transmission gate chain
   tapering, supported by simulation results, is presented. With this
   proposed circuit technique, the area, delay, and power of the carry
   propagation chain may be significantly improved.}},

Abstract = {{Development and use of leading-edge engineering and business practices
   provides firm footing for tremendous advances in the aerospace
   community. When applied together and systemically across multiple
   missions, these practices can yield tremendous reduction of technical,
   schedule and cost risks for project development. An example of this
   synthesis can be found in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL's) Flight
   Hardware Logistics Program (FHLP), which uses space systems engineering
   expertise and supply-chain business acumen to achieve breakthroughs in
   the delivery of space flight hardware.
   To support the evolution from a few large projects to many smaller
   projects developed in shorter time, flight hardware delivery must evolve
   from serial, independent and resource-intensive processes to those
   characterized by commonality, multi-project support, anticipation,
   industry-partnering, reuse and easy access to information. These
   processes are fundamental to the communication, coordination and
   collaboration that FHLP provides to enhance JPL project success.
   The heart of FHLP centers on the commonality of flight hardware across
   multiple projects. As an example, FHLP has demonstrated significant
   schedule, cost and technical risk reduction using a common buy of 31
   flight computers for 9 different projects. Understanding and
   coordinating similar product requirements for multiple subsystems,
   instruments, projects and companies can yield even greater savings.
   Knowledge of upcoming missions, their flight product needs, hardware
   capabilities and supply sources allow anticipatory procurements of
   flight hardware to reduce or eliminate lead-time. This is being done for
   flight electronic parts, connectors and fasteners with replenishment
   funded by compensation from users for supplied hardware.
   Partnering with industry is achieved with suppliers and users of
   hardware. Open contracts and supplier early parts buys are examples of
   supplier agreements while synchronized procurement and inventory
   exchange are examples of user agreements between JPL and its
   contractors.
   Improved tracking, coordination, record keeping and storage of residual
   flight hardware can provide crucial cost and schedule benefits to future
   projects. FHLP has developed a low-cost, JPL-wide system and facilities
   to significantly increase the capability for current project use of
   residual material from past projects.
   Having the right hardware information at the engineer's fingertips saves
   considerable time and reduces the risk of missing important knowledge.
   FHLP provides limited hardware information today; tomorrow it will
   provide much more comprehensive ``one-stop shopping.{''} The FHLP
   information tools include an on-line JPL-wide hardware catalog of
   available inventory (,with reports, shopping carts and digital
   pictures), on-line product documentation and database of hardware usage
   by projects.
   The many simultaneous smaller projects implemented today do not enjoy
   the substantial infrastructure and stable expertise more prevalent in
   the past on fewer large projects. FHLP fills these gaps with services of
   hardware information, availability, investigation, delivery and storage.
   Likewise, proposed projects hungry for higher fidelity information,
   increased heritage and lower costs welcome a menu of support from FHLP
   that includes information about available hardware, costs, lead-times
   and suppliers.
   FHLP's early focus on hardware delivery and inventory will be augmented
   by enhanced hardware information and expand to include other NASA
   Centers and industry partners. Breakthroughs will be limited only by
   imagination, innovation, commitment and energy.}},

Abstract = {{Classical Electro Optical Automated Test Equipment (EO ATE) inherently
   has several design limitations due to trying to satisfy the entire EO
   spectrum requirements. Problems such as a fixed number of targets, ease
   in changing stimulus and measurement devices and finally, reconfiguring
   to cover multiple sensor fields-of-view yields a tester that compromises
   the support many Units Under Test (UUT)'s individual needs. In addition,
   targets are static with no dynamic scene projection of realistic,
   in-band targets in a clutter background environment (targets in
   defilade, moving targets, smoke, dust, rain, fog, etc.).
   The Developmental Test Command has a major instrumentation development
   with Simulation, Training \& Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) for a
   Mobile Extended Spectrum Electro-Optical Test capability as part of the
   Mobile Infrared Scene Projection (MIRSP) program. A prototype system
   that utilizes the Texas Instruments (TI) Digital Micro-mirror Device
   (DMD(TM)) to project both static and dynamic targets to the UUT is
   currently under development. This EO tester is modular and programmable
   allowing the target stimulus sub-system to interface with existing and
   future optical systems required to support Army sensors across multiple
   fields-of-view. Targets are defined/programmed in software, and then
   ``replicated{''} using the DMD for presentation to the UUT within
   microseconds. The EO ATE supports typical laboratory tests as well as
   dynamic scene projection to EO sensors. This paper describes the new
   design techniques implemented to transform standard EO UUT testing as
   well as scene projection in spectral bands continuous from 0.2 to 14
   micrometer (mum) wavelengths. In addition, other innovative techniques
   have been incorporated to address problems inherent in current EO ATE
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{We describe in this paper an original system of localization for an

   made by an array of 6 large photodiodes (1cm) fixed on the vehicle. The
   active beacon is a rotating laser, fixed on a wall of the manoeuvring
   area, with vertical line generation lens. This beacon includes an
   innovative laser modulation, based on a frequency variation which is a
   function of its absolute angular position. In the first part, we will
   describe the beacon and receiver functioning and explain the theoretical
   principle of this system. In the second part we will describe the
   results provided by our simulators with the aim of determining the
   optimum values of physical parameters and the limits of our system. In
   the final part we will explain our experimental system and analyse the
