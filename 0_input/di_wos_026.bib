Abstract = {{Background, Recent technologic innovations have created possibilities
   for restorative dentistry such as computer-aided design and
   computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM).
   Purpose. This article presents a new CAD/CAM process that has been
   developed for the fabrication of dental restorations.
   Methods. This process uses an improved imaging technique, successfully
   applied in other industries. Imaging is accomplished with 2-dimensional
   line grids projected onto an object, which allows for a mathematical
   reproduction of prepared and unprepared tooth surfaces, including those
   that are outside the direct line of light. The relative position of the
   sensor to the surface of the object is controlled automatically
   Conclusions. This system, which is undergoing clinical testing, allows
   the generation of various types of highly accurate dental restorations
   (inlays, onlays, crowns, and fixed partial dentures) from a number of
   different materials. Acquired digitized data points are directly
   translated from the sensor to the electronic controls of the milling
   machine to provide various manufacturing possibilities, including copy
   milling and accurate reproduction of occlusal tooth surfaces in various
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{A new optimal digital-redesign approach for the input time-delay
   continuous-time cascaded system is proposed in this paper. It shows that
   the states of the sampled-data system with the digitally redesigned
   control law closely match those of the original cascaded continuous-time
   closed-loop system with analogue control law at any instant between
   sampling periods. Moreover, the developed digital control law can be
   implemented using low-cost microcomputers with a relatively longer
   sampling period. Also, it utilizes the innovative one-duration
   description of input time-delay sampled-data system, that is suitable
   for any value of input time delay, even larger than one sampling period.
   An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed design methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The use of cepstral parameters is gaining importance in many areas.
   However, their introduction is usually through an approach which often
   mars their simplicity and beauty. The differential cepstrum is an
   important variant of this class of signal transformations. It has been
   defined in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the z transform of a
   given signal. However, a more useful approach is through the Cauchy
   residue theorem, which yields additional insight and properties. The
   entire concept and additional properties may be developed in a way that
   leads naturally to the celebrated Newton identities. These identities
   are developed and elaborated in the paper. Furthermore, they are
   employed innovatively in signal-processing problems, including the
   determination of the minimum phase component of a signal, a stability
   test for linear systems and the detection of abrupt changes in a signal.}},

Abstract = {{The recent explosive growth in the use of endoscopic techniques in the
   performance of surgical procedures has created an important need for
   educational materials on this subject. However, limitations of currently
   available teaching tools frustrate the user and hamper the teaching and
   spread of these procedures. To improve on currently available methods,
   we developed a CD ROM video atlas of techniques in endoscopic sinus
   surgery (ESS). The multimedia CD ROM video atlas combines the best
   features of the surgical atlas with conventional videotapes. The
   component steps of procedures in ESS are presented to the viewer as
   brief, individual video sequences, accompanied by narration and a text
   of the highlights of each procedure. The use of digital video allows the
   user to access the segment of interest directly, in the order of
   preference, without having to sift through the other segments, as with
   conventional videocassettes. An interface allows control over playback
   of the video, and sequences can be reviewed instantly. Storage capacity
   of the CD ROM allows up to 60 minutes of video to be stored on each
   disk. The CD ROM combines the best elements of currently available
   educational tools and may represent a new approach for medical
   education.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new level of integration and innovation required
   to meet the integrated circuit (IC)- and system-level challenges of the
   21(st) century. We present a technology platform in which chip-scale
   modules (CSMs) provide greater functionality, higher performance, lower
   cost, and faster time to market for many of today's emerging products.
   Our approach is to build CSMs that overcome formidable integration
   barriers without compromising individual IC technologies. By integrating
   various IC technologies and their supporting components, we exceed
   single on-chip performance. Functionality is increased through
   integration, and performance is improved by maintenance of an on-chip
   electrical environment. Applications include integrating large blocks of
   memory with logic, mixing analog and digital IC technologies, and
   integrating high-frequency ICs with high-quality (high-Q) passive
   components. The CSM technology platform is poised to unlock the full
   potential of IC technology and unleash the innovations of designers.}},

Abstract = {{The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendations for

   DTMF detectors. We present an efficient DTMF detection algorithm based
   ore the nonuniform discrete Fourier transform that meets all of the ITU
   recommendations. The key innovations are the use of two sliding windows
   and development of sophisticated timing tests. Oar algorithm requires no
   buffering of input samples. To perform DTMF detection on n telephone
   channels, our algorithm requires approximately,, MIPS on a digital
   signal processor (DSP), 75 + 30n words of data memory, and 1000 words of
   program memory, Using the new algorithm, a single fixed-point DSP can
   perform ITU-compliant DTMF detection on the 24 telephone channels of a
   T1 time-division multiplexed telecommunications line.}},

Abstract = {{Technology assessments during the 1980s projected the development of
   advanced military fighter aircraft that would require propulsion systems
   that could accommodate multimission capability with super
   maneuverability. These propulsion systems would be required to provide
   significantly improved thrust to weight, reduced thrust specific fuel
   consumption and up and away thrust vectoring capabilities. Digital
   electronic control systems with significantly expanded capabilities
   would be required to handle these multifunction control actuation
   systems, to integrate them with flight control systems, and to provide
   fail-operational capability. This paper will discuss the challenges that
   were presented to propulsion system control designers, the innovation of
   technology to address these challenges, and the transition of that
   technology to production readiness. Technology advancements will be
   discussed in the area of digital electronic control capability and
   packaging, advanced fuel management systems, high pressure fuel
   hydraulic actuation systems for multifunction nozzles, integrated flight
   propulsion controls, and higher-order language software development
   tools. Each of these areas provided unique opportunities where
   technology development programs and flight prototyping carried concepts

Abstract = {{A test carrier for obtaining qualitative PSA-findings from 50 mu l EDTA
   whole blood is described. Results visually traced with this test system
   were compared with PSA-values obtained by wet chemistry (Abbott IMx,
   EIA) and their correspondence (< 4.0 ng/ml and greater than or equal to
   4.0 ng/ml, respectively) analyzed. PSA-determination with this test
   system requires a reaction time of 10 min. Of 74 blood samples with
   quantitatively traced PSA-values < 4.0 ng/ml, this PSA-test showed
   83.8\% true negatives (equivalent to diagnostic specificity). Of the 116
   samples with PSA greater than or equal to 4.0 ng/ml, 90.5\% true
   positives were found (sensitivity). The observed deviations appeared
   primarily around the cut-off value of 4.0 ng/ml, i.e. within the
   concentration, ranges 3.0 to < 4.0 and 4.0 to < 5.0 ng/ml. Similary good
   results obtained by a parallely used strip test for PSA in serum
   confirmed these findings. Both tests showed good reproduction of the
   PSA-results. The qualitative PSA one-step test is universally applicable
   and easy in handling. This test makes an outstanding contribution to a
   favourable and economical program for early detection of prostate
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to analyse the evolution of the technology
   performance of Digital Signal Processing components (DSPs) using the S

   established through a comparative study between the S curve model and
   other concepts with which it is closely related: innovation diffusion
   models and life cycle models. The purpose of this study is to use the
   solid analytical foundation of these models to increase the theoretical
   consistency of the S curve model. In the second part of the article, a
   methodology that facilitates the application of this model is proposed.
   At the same time, the usefulness of the S curve as a strategic analysis
   tool is discussed as well as the problems that can arise when the model
   is put into practice. This methodology is used in the analysis of the
   technology of DSPs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The SYRMEP (SYnchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics) collaboration is
   presently taking data at a beamline at the synchrotron ELETTRA in
   Trieste to study the performances of a digital silicon pixel imaging
   system for mammography. Images are obtained with a scanning technique in
   the energy range 15-30 keV. The readout electronics operates in a single
   photon counting mode with a photon rate of about 10(6)/(mm(2) s), which
   is still 4 times lower than the maximum rate reachable with the present
   beamline configuration. Two different detector layouts have been
   designed, the first one consisting of a single-layer silicon microstrip
   detector positioned edge-on with respect to the beam, and the second
   innovative one represented by a matrix of these detectors stacked to
   cover the full beam dimension (100 x 4 mm(2)). We present here the
   results obtained with a single-layer detector and a double-layer
   detector (both 5 cm wide) with mammographic phantoms and human breast
   tissue. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The KTeV fixed target experiment at Fermilab is using an innovative
   scheme for reading out its 3100 channel CsI electromagnetic calorimeter.
   This pipelined readout system digitizes photomultiplier tube (PMT)
   signals over a 16-bit dynamic range with 8-bits of resolution at 53 MHz.
   The crucial element of the system is a custom Bi-CMOS integrated circuit
   which, in conjunction with an 8-bit Flash ADC, integrates and digitizes
   the PMT signal charge over each 18.9 ns clock cycle (53 MHz) in a
   deadtimeless fashion. The digitizer circuit is local to the PMT base,
   and has an in-situ charge integration noise figure of 3 fC/sample. In
   this article, the readout system will be described and its performance
   including noise, cross-talk, linearity, stability, and reliability will
   be discussed. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: We present a critical evaluation of the use of ultrasound for
   prostate disease examination in urological practice, and provide
   perspectives on ultrasound applications that may become important for
   the future evaluation of prostate problems.
   Materials and Methods: Based on an evaluation of clinical data in cases
   suspicious for prostatic malignancy, we addressed the apparent
   shortcomings of transrectal ultrasound for accurately diagnosing
   prostate cancer. Future applications presented in the literature were
   noted.
   Results: Evaluating the ultrasound data in cases suspicious for
   malignancy indicated that imaging has little advantage over digital
   rectal examination for detecting malignant areas. The new applications
   of ultrasound that hold great promise for use in the urology clinic
   include the injection of contrast agents to obtain information on blood
   supply, temperature estimation for the noninvasive assessment of
   temperature distributions during heat treatment and a therapeutic
   application for local treatment of prostate cancer.
   Conclusions: While differential diagnosis with ultrasound appears to
   result in disappointing sensitivity and specificity values, its use in
   volume measurement and biopsy guidance is unquestioned. The development
   of new applications may improve the clinical value of ultrasound in
   urological practice. The application of ultrasound contrast agents for
   the detection and clinical staging of prostate cancer is especially
   promising. Future research will indicate whether the promise evolves in
   clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{This article details the design of a wideband, high dynamic range
   downconverter from concept through production. The downconverter is a
   part of the Smart Adaptive Applique (SAA) used in cellular base stations
   to increase channel utilization and reduce the impact of multipath in
   congested urban cellular systems. Because the system employs a wideband
   approach that digitizes the entire cellular spectrum in a single
   converter, maximizing the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) is a
   primary design requirement. Innovative packaging techniques enable the
   downconverter to realize the full potential of the individual
   components, resulting in better than 89 dB SFDR. The initial design
   phase involves determining the requirements, frequency plan and
   gain-noise-intercept (GNI) strategy. Following the initial design,
   critical circuits are breadboarded and tested to confirm computer
   predictions. Then the most important part of the design begins: the
   layout of the printed wiring board (PWB). The best paper designs can
   fail easily due to poor isolation between circuit card components,
   resulting in needless hours of debugging to correct layout problems.
   High isolation layout techniques, including grounding, shielding and
   signal routing, are discussed at length. Finally, the circuit card
   assembly (CCA) is tested and the card's performance is presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of optimal detection of a linearly modulated
   digital signal transmitted over a fading channel is addressed. First,
   the issue of preliminary front-end processing in order to extract a
   sufficient statistics for information sequence detection from the
   continuous-time received signal is considered. Then, recursive
   algorithms are derived, which approximate optimal detection under the
   assumption of a linear and noisy channel modeled by a stochastic
   time-varying impulse response with arbitrary known statistics. Specific
   solutions are proposed for the Rayleigh fading channel typical of mobile
   radio communications. The information symbols are assumed to be grouped
   into blocks which are preceded and followed by known preamble and
   postamble, respectively. This model encompasses both Time Division
   Multiple Access (TDMA) schemes and pilot symbol assisted transmission.
   Two detection schemes are considered and relevant recursive formulations
   proposed. More specifically, optimal detection in complete absence of
   Channel State Information (CSI) (blind detection) or in presence of
   perfect CSI at the beginning of the data block (trained detection) are
   investigated. It is shown that optimal detection performance may be
   practically attained by sampling the received signal with few samples
   per symbol interval and searching a trellis diagram of adequate size by
   means of a Viterbi algorithm. State-complexity reduction techniques
   based on Per-Survivor Processing (PSP) for both types of detection
   schemes are also considered.}},

Abstract = {{The amplitudes of seismic waves have always been a foremost concern of
   the seismologist to which considerable ingenuity was devoted. In the
   1920s the problem was to magnify the ground motion sufficiently for
   detection. This was done at first by simple levers that moved mechanical
   pens. But at the start of exploration seismology, this had already been
   superseded by optical levers, photographic recording, and (soon after)
   electromechanical transduction followed by amplification.
   From the 1930s to about the early `60s, devices of increasing complexity
   were introduced to compress the large amplitude difference between the
   first arrivals and the weakest reflections of interest to the limited
   dynamic range of the recording medium: first the paper record, then
   magnetic storage media, and finally the digital magnetic tape. This
   period can be identified with techniques known as automatic gain control
   (AGC).
   Soon after the introduction of digital recording techniques, the
   emphasis shifted: with intermediate digital storage, the limit to the
   dynamic range was no longer controlled by the properties of the storage
   medium. Now everything that passed through the acquisition unit could,
   in principle, be stored on magnetic disk or tape. At that time the aim
   became to record the ground motion as faithfully as possible. There were
   several technical developments on the way to achieve ``true
   amplitudes{''} that, in turn. made exploration concepts like bright
   spots, seismic stratigraphy, and amplitude-versus-offset evaluation
   possible. However, the most significant innovation was what became known
   as floating-point amplifier. It dominated seismic acquisition for about
   25 years. Floating-point representation of seismic signals allowed
   storage of the entire dynamic range in relatively economic words of
   about is bits.
   During the last decade, the quest for ever-greater resolution-and the
   availability of mass-produced components for hi-fi audio equipment-led
   to the introduction of the sigma-delta (Sigma-delta) converter. With
   this device, the full range of the seismic signal (or lather the
   geophone output) is recorded in binary fixed-point formats with 24 bits.
   With this development, the full seismic signal can be stored without
   distortion or loss of resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Challenging issues for processing queries specified over large-scale
   information spaces (e.g., Digital Libraries or the World Wide Web)
   include the diversity of the information sources in terms of their
   structures, query interfaces and search capabilities, as well as the
   dynamics of sources continuously being added, removed or upgraded. In
   this paper, we give an innovative solution for query planning in such
   environments. The foundation of our solution is the Dynamic Information
   Integration Model (DIIM) which supports the specification of not only
   content but also capabilities of resources without requiring the
   establishment of a uniform integration schema. Besides the development
   of the DIIM model, contributions of this paper include: (1) the
   introduction of the notion of fully specified queries that are
   semantically equivalent to a loosely-specified query; (2) a translation
   algorithm of a loosely-specified query into a set of semantically
   equivalent feasible query plans that are consistent with the binding
   patterns of query templates of the individual sources (capability
   descriptions in DIIM) and with interrelationships between information
   sources (expressed as join constraints in DIIM); and (3) a search
   restriction algorithm for optimizing query processing by pruning the
   search space into the relevant subspace of a query. The plans obtained
   by the proposed query planning process which is composed of the search
   restriction and translation algorithms can be shown to correspond to
   query plans semantically equivalent to the initial loosely-specified
   input query.}},

Abstract = {{A complex 12-year development of high-definition television (HDTV)
   production standards has vied with consecutive generations of HDTV
   program origination equipment. While aspiring to the full promise of the
   ever-evolving standards, equipment designers have grappled with a
   multiplicity of marketplace realities as separately defined by the
   world's broadcasters and program producers, HDTV program origination
   continues to be frustrated by unrealistic equipment costs and a lack of
   mobile battery-powered HDTV acquisition systems. The latter is central
   to the proper exploitation of the significant enhancement to television
   imagery latent within the technical parameters defined by the latest
   SMPTE 274M HDTV production standard, This paper describes a bold
   development thrust that sought to simultaneously lower costs and produce
   a high-performance, highly compact, HD acquisition system. Thee
   technological leap from contemporary HDTV cameras and digital recorders
   to an all-digital one-piece HD camcorder called for the best in
   engineering innovation, pragmatic design decisions, rind a massive
   commitment to custom-built VLSI, This paper specifically describes the
   prototype of the 1920 x 1035 (SMPTE 260M) based camcorder. A modified
   product based on the later SMPTE 274M standard (1920 x 1080 format) will

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative, fuzzy-based, adaptive approach to
   the metering of power and mts voltage and current employing a genetic
   algorithm. The fuzzy-based adaptive metering engine adjusts the number
   of points per cycle to be processed and the location of these points.
   Adjustments are based on the optimal fuzzy rules constructed by a
   genetic algorithm to satisfy overall metering-error criteria under
   different operating environments while minimizing the number of points
   actually employed in the metering computation. This results in a
   reduction in the metering-computation effort, which frees up the
   processor for other tasks such as communication or power quality
   measurements. The fuzzy-based adaptive metering algorithm has been
   implemented on a microcontroller-based power metering system that
   employs a multitasking operating system which exploits the efficiencies
   achieved by the reduced metering rate. The fuzzy-based adaptive metering
   algorithm has been tested with a variety of actual and synthesized
   power-system waveforms and the experimental evaluations have
   demonstrated excellent accuracy in the metered power system quantities.}},

   developing a novel imaging device to be used with a laminar
   monochromatic synchrotron radiation X-ray beam for applications in

   detectors and a dedicated VLSI readout chip based on the single photon
   counting concept. The innovative geometry - several overlapped detectors
   with strips parallel to the beam direction - determines a matrix of
   pixels, each of them having an area of 200x300 mu m(2), which can detect
   up to 10(6) photons/(mm(2) s) with 90\% efficiency at 25 keV.
   Front-end and readout electronics are expandable in a modular fashion
   and can be coupled to successive receptor versions with increasing
   number of channels, while a VME based DAQ system offers full testing
   facilities.
   In our view this system is providing specific and original contributions

Abstract = {{The MIRAGE (Multispectral Infrared Animation Generation Equipment)
   Dynamic infrared Scene Projector, is a joint project developed by Santa
   Barbara Infrared, Inc. end Indigo Systems Corporation. MIRAGE is a
   complete infrared scene projector, accepting 3-D rendered analog or
   digital scene data at its input, and providing all other electronics,
   collimated optics, calibration end thermal support subsystems needed to
   stimulated a unit ender test with high-fidelity, dynamic infrared
   scenes. At the heart of MIRAGE is a 512 x 512 emitter army with key
   innovations that solve several problems of existing designs The read-in
   integrated circuit (RIIC) features ``snapshot{''} updating of the entire
   512x512 resistive array, thus solving synchronization end latency
   problems inherent in ``rolling-update{''} type designs, where data is
   always changing somewhen, on the emitter array at any given time. This
   custom mixed-signal RIIC also accepts digital scene information at its
   input, and uses on-board D/A converters end individual unit-cell buffer
   amplifiers to create analog scene levels, eliminating the complexity,
   noise, and limitations of speed end dynamic range associated with
   external generation of analog scene levels. The proprietary process used
   to create the advanced technology micro-membrane emitter elements allows
   a wide choice of resistor end structure materials while preserving the
   dissipation end providing a thermal time constant of the order of Sms.
   These innovations, along with a compact electronics subsystem based on a
   standard desktop PC, greatly reduce the complexity of the required
   external support electronics, resulting In a smaller, higher performance
   dynamic scene simulator system.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of multiscale techniques to signal and image processing
   has provided a new tool to create innovative methods for solving
   problems in the areas of data compression, signal analysis, and noise
   removal. Although these techniques are popular and used extensively in
   research and in engineering applications, their use in signature
   detection and classification is still an area open to extensive
   investigation. This paper discusses multiscale techniques working in
   synergy with other processing techniques to detect and recognize
   abnormal and cueing signatures that are important to diagnostic medicine
   - detection and recognition of microcalcification clusters in
   mammograms. In this application, an innovative detection algorithm that
   takes advantage of multiresolution analysis and synthesis is developed
   to assist radiologists looking for clusters of microcalcifications in
   digitized mammograms. The algorithm presented in this paper successfully
   limits the false positives. An algorithm description and examples are
   shown in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Tiernan Communications, Inc. (Tiernan) designs, develops, manufactures
   and markets digital video compression and transmission products used by
   Television Broadcasters, Common Carriers and Cable Television operators
   worldwide. The company's products have become central to digital
   television satellite news gathering and in digital television program
   distribution over satellite and terrestrial microwave and fiber
   networks. Tiernan is a privately held corporation based in San Diego,
   California, USA. The company has become recognized for its excellence in
   technology, product innovation, overall value and customer support. The
   effort to digitize American Television has been greatly influenced by
   the founders and employees at Tiernan.
   The company was formed in 1988 by Dr. James Tiernan, a recognized expert
   in digital signal processing and digital video technology. The company's
   focus was initially centered on consulting in digital television
   systems. This led to the design, development and marketing of the
   company's first digital television product in 1994. Since then, the
   company has expanded its product range to meet the increasing demand for
   digital television and communication products. Tiernan has to date
   supplied over 400 digital television systems to a variety of users in
   some 25 countries around the globe. Building on this substantial base,
   the company has positioned itself to provide new and innovative product
   solutions in the global development of digital infrastructure in
   television, data and multimedia.
   This paper will describe the issues driving the digital television
   revolution, products developed to enable the transformation, and
   technical issues facing modern multi-media designers in this industry.
   Domestic broadcasters and their affiliates will be supplying both
   standard and high definition television signals (SDTV, HDTV) to network
   affiliates and subsequently to consumers in the fourth quarter 1998.
   Equipment needed by broadcasters to make the transformation from analog
   to digital service is now reaching maturation. MPEG-2 compressed video
   from 2.5 to 50 Mbps is now available. Additionally, digital audio,
   auxiliary, and teletext signals can be multiplexed together before
   satellite or terrestrial distribution. Sophisticated filtering
   techniques are applied to digital video when image resizing is required.
   Tiernan Communications, Inc., based in San Diego, California, is a
   premier provider of video CODEC and supporting equipment for the digital
   television revolution.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to discuss the requirement for innovative
   silicon solutions for modern automobiles and the specific technologies
   which are being developed for automotive applications.
   There are now many Electronic Control Units (ECUs) being implemented on
   vehicles which require high-speed communications for data sharing over
   several networks. In order to deal with the increasing bandwidth
   requirements and to interface efficiently with the many sensors and
   actuators on the modern vehicle, significant advances are being made in
   electronic systems. The scope of the problem and types of systems
   affected will be discussed along with the solutions which are being
   generated.
   `System chips' are being developed which integrate monolithically
   different semiconductor technologies in order to reduce chip-count,
   cost, size and increase performance and reliability; all the key drivers
   in the automotive industry. Analog, power, digital and sensor
   technologies are now being merged to meet the requirements of the
   automotive industry. Examples of these developments will be cited.
   Smart sensors are being developed to facilitate distributed processing
   and address the problem of massive sensor implementation in automotive
   systems. The smart sensor concept allows easier sharing of information
   between related systems such as chassis control systems (braking,
   steering, suspension, etc,). The concept and application of smart
   sensors will be discussed.
   The other key advances in semiconductor technologies for automotive
   applications will be discussed such as flash NV memory, mechatronics,
   power consumption issues and vehicular communications protocols. The
   impact of these technologies on simplifying development of complex
   systems will be made clear.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an internet-based laboratory for an introductory digital
   signal processing (DSP) class is presented. The laboratory consists of
   Ave exercises covering topics like discrete- and continuous-time
   convolution, Z-transform, pole-zero plots, filter design, and fast
   Fourier transform (FFT). The software includes webpages which describe
   the laboratory exercises and supporting Java(1) programs. The Java
   programs enable visualization of complicated mathematical concepts and
   allow students to design active simulations of DSP systems. This virtual
   laboratory has the advantage that students can perform the exercises
   from remote locations.
   The paper presents the different programs which were developed for this
   laboratory and describes several exercises that involve interactive DSP
   simulations in a user-friendly object oriented environment.
   The software has been used at Arizona State University for a
   senior/graduate level digital signal processing (DSP) course. The paper
   presents experiences gained by using this innovative software in a class

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, a wide variety of digital X-ray imaging
   technologies have been developed which offer image quality capabilities
   suitable for many industrial applications. At the same time, there has
   been increased pressure to reduce the use of X-ray film and processing
   chemicals. The environmental hazards associated with the use and
   disposal of these chemicals and products, in addition to the cost of
   these disposable products is placing strong pressures on the reduction
   of X-ray film usage. The United States Air Force is a major user of
   X-ray film and chemistry in support of their various aircraft systems.
   Under a Small Business Innovation Research Program with the Air Force,
   Industrial Quality, Inc. has been investigating the potential for the
   implementation of a variety of these digital, non-film X-ray imaging
   technologies. Initial experimental evaluations included storage
   phosphors, scintillator-camera systems, flat panel imagers and the
   reverse geometry method. Both quantitative image measurement test tools
   and actual or simulated aircraft structure were used to evaluate the
   various systems. More extensive system evaluations are planned as the
   program continues into an SBIR Phase II project.}},

Abstract = {{The design and implementation of a real-time super-resolution imaging
   processor was conducted as a benchmark for the Rapid Prototyping of
   Application Specific Signal Processors (RASSP) program. RASSP is a
   DARPA/Tri-services sponsored program aimed at accelerating the design
   process for digital electronic systems. The super-resolution subsystem
   is part: of a Semi-Automated Image-intelligence Processing (SAIP)
   system. The benchmark project required a reduction in the size and
   increase in performance of the prototype system, which had been
   implemented on an array of workstations. The RASSP methodology was
   applied to guide the design process and RASSP-related analysis tools
   were used to accelerate the software development. The numerical and
   run-time performance goals were achieved through a combination of
   software innovations in the imaging algorithm and porting to a
   high-density commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) high-performance parallel
   processor. The selected processor consisted of four Alex Computer boards
   containing a total of 72 ADSP-21060 (SHArc) signal processors.}},

Abstract = {{The High Altitude Balloon Experiment (HABE) is being developed by the
   U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicle Directorate at
   Kirtland Air Force Base, to investigate technologies needed to perform
   acquisition, tracking and. pointing (ATP) functions against boosting
   missiles in near-space environments. HABE is designed to demonstrate ATP
   sequence steps that start with acquisition of a missile plume,
   transition through passive IR tracking of the plume, and handover to
   precision tracking which employs an active laser illuminator and imaging
   camera to image and track the missile nose. The Inertial Pseudo Star
   Reference Unit (LPSRU) provides inertially stabilized line-of-sights
   (LOSs) for the illuminator laser, active fine track (AFT) camera, and
   the marker scoring. The latter serves to measure and score the payload's
   pointing performance. The payload will be operated and carried aloft
   under a large, scientific balloon. The engagement parameters and
   timelines for the HABE ATP payload are consistent with scenarios
   encountered in space-based missile defense applications. In HABE
   experiments, target missiles will pass at ranges from 50 to 200 km. The
   performance goals of the ATP payload's LOS stabilization and marker
   laser pointing are required to exceed 1 microradian RMS or better in
   jitter, drift, and accuracy (two axis, one sigma metrics), a requirement
   which stresses testing capabilities.
   This paper describes an integration and test program that verifies
   correct performance of the HABE ATP payload in its state-of-the-art
   alignment, stabilization, and tracking functions. In contrast to earlier
   ATP designs that used analog electronics for control systems
   implementations, the HABE control systems architecture employs multiple
   digital processors and coprocessors to measure sensor outputs and
   generate actuator commands. It is feasible to test all of these digital,
   multirate control systems by using software procedures that are more
   autonomous and flexible than the traditional equipment employed for
   system tests. New, innovative real-time built-in-test algorithms and
   procedures have been devised to measure performance characteristics of
   each HABE ATP control system and to confirm its readiness for flight
   missions. Software connections inject stimulus signals, and the response
   signals from the digital control system are evaluated in real-time for
   pass/fail criteria of built-in-test functions. Additionally, test
   results may be conveyed to ground work stations where the payload
   performance can be analyzed and compared to design requirements. The
   paper provides the basis for the test procedures and presents
   illustrations of its application for tests of the HABE 500 Hz optical
   autoaligament control system, the inertial LOS stabilization, and the
   precision active tracking loop.}},

Abstract = {{This study measures the changes in dimension and weight resulting from
   water sorption in light-cured resin-based materials using an innovative
   computer-controlled laser micrometer and a precision digital balance.
   Three materials are examined in this study: a micro-filled composite, a
   dual-cure luting composite and a compomer. Five discs of each test
   material were prepared, weighed and the size of each disc was measured
   across sequential diameters by a computer-controlled laser micrometer.
   Measurements were carried out at intervals over a 24-month period.
   Significant changes in the rate of percentage weight gain and the rate
   of percentage linear expansion occurred for up to 90 days for the
   composite restorative and the luting material and up to 150 days for the
   compomer. This study concludes that over a period of 24 months, the
   hygroscopic expansion of the compomer material is significantly greater
   than that of the conventional composites tested. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{The use of computers to store and represent geometric information was an
   important innovation in engineering. The digital representation of
   design has greatly improved the efficiency of drafting, substituting
   mouse and monitor for pen and paper. However, the full potential of
   computers to aid in the production of geometric models has yet to be
   exploited. This paper describes the implementation of a scheme to
   automate the generation of geometries in a CAD environment, A natural
   language translator has been devised which is used in combination with a
   logic-based CAD system. The translator uses the language processing
   technique of keyword matching to transform the linguistic description of
   an artifact into a logic program. The logic program may then be used by
   the logic-based CAD system to generate the geometry of interest. The
   strategy employed in the natural language translation engine is
   discussed in terms of a simple model of a retaining wall.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative experimental methodology has been developed to analyse the
   microstructural characteristics of concrete, responsible for many
   peculiar features of the fracture phenomenon. By means of a completely
   authomatised laser system, the three-dimensional morphologies of
   concrete can be digitised. Considering planar cross-sections of the
   virgin material, the pore and void distribution can be easily extracted
   from the laser-scanned topography. This procedure, which yields the
   effective depth and shape of the pores, permits to overcome the
   drawbacks and ambiguities of traditional image analysis techniques,
   where dark particles often confuse with pores. Calculating the fractal
   dimension by means of two different algorithms, allows us to confirm the
   lacunar fractal character of the stress-carrying section.}},

Abstract = {{This paper looks at the developing line transmission techniques being
   proposed for use in the domestic environment in the UK and potential EMC
   problems which could arise from advances in broadband networking. These
   issues will be looked at from the point of view of one group of users of
   the lower h.f. spectrum where the reception of weak signals is of
   significant importance - amateur radio operators.
   The desire to provide high speed access to services such as the
   Internet, Home Shopping and Video-on-Demand has caused new digital
   techniques to be developed with the object of utilising existing
   delivery systems such as the telephone network and more recently, the
   mains electricity supply, to carry high speed data.
   Although innovative and exciting, these nero techniques may also
   generate interference problems. In particular leakage of RF energy
   infrequencies at the lower end of the h.f. band could cause a serious
   problem.
   Emphasis will be placed on Digital Subscriber Line techniques,
   especially ADSL, VDSL and a system which has been in the development
   stage for some 3 years and which will provide Internet access ten times
   faster than current ISDN links, utilising the mains electricity supply
   infrastructure.
   This latter technology is due to be launched in April 1998. At the time
   of writing this paper the hard facts are veiled in commercial
   confidentiality. It is hoped that the fears regarding the possible EMC
   problems which might arise rom such a system are unfounded!}},

   of an innovative 128:1 analog multiplexer, we show how we drastically
   reduced the mean power consumption without sacrificing constraining
   specifications such as the input range and the readout rate. Testing
   mixed A/D, but strongly analog IC is also a big issue which is addressed
   here. Specific built-in test analog sub-circuits have been implemented
   in the ASIC, along with a JTAG module used to choose the type of test to
   perform. This module is also used to central and tune the biasing
   currents of the circuit. Finally, test results are presented and show
   that all the specifications are satisfied.}},

Abstract = {{This paper tries to describe overwhelming importance of the Information
   Technology especially Wide Area Networks (WAN) in research and
   development process. Changing usage pattern of WANs, new and enhanced
   network services and their technological consequences reviewed in the
   light of Turkish experience.
   Information Technology and Science Community
   Information technology (IT) is now one of the most important resources
   available to science system. IT based relationships that have arisen in
   the science community over the last two decades validated the potential
   of using WANs to link scientists around the world, to promote
   collaboration, to disseminate new ideas, and to make efficient use of
   scientific information.(1)
   WANs have brought new possibilities for the communication of ideas that
   in turn restructuring the ways in which institutions and individuals
   interact. The originator of the restructuring, scientific community, has
   also facing a paradigm shirt. IT have profoundly influenced the way
   scientists work and the way the scientific work conducted. A plenty of
   new tool mainly for information retrieval and storage, remote sensing
   and tele-experimenting besides advanced laboratory equipment have been
   introduced by IT and WANs. The way the scientific work conducted has
   also a social organization. The rate of change is limited by the
   adaptation rate of organizations and institutions.
   IT brings the capability to scientist to introduce their new ideas to
   the attention of the scientific community as soon as they arise.
   Electronic journal and pre-print archives accelerate the dissemination
   of information by eliminating the delay in the paper publication. The
   potential of the electronic publication is not fully used mainly because
   the quality assessment system of the scientific community is still based
   on peer reviewed paper publication. As the peer reviewed electronic
   publication phase out peer review paper publication, dissemination of
   scientific result will further accelerate. In the new paradigm, access
   to WAN facilities and to scientific information in digital form is
   necessity for high-quality training and education. One of the new goal
   of the training and education is now to explore and extensively use the
   possibilities of WANs and new information services.
   WANs are setting np a virtual community which brings new possibilities
   for the interaction between the actors of the national innovation
   system. The proper use of the possibilities may help the improvement of
   collaboration between the universities and the industry.
   Changing Usage Patients of WANs and The Technical Consequences
   The usage patters of WAN services in the above four area, namely the way
   scientist work, the way the scientific information disseminate, the way
   the new researchers trained and the way of interaction between actors of
   national innovation has been changed since the WAN services had
   introduced in early 1970s.
   In the early 1970's the main goal of the WANs was to effectively use the
   expensive computation power. As the computation power and communication
   has became cheaper and cheaper, main goal had shifted to create a
   communication environment. By the end of 1980s an other important goal
   is concatenated to communication goal : access to information. With the
   advent of World Wide Web (WWW) in 1991, the form of communication and
   information has been shirting from text to multimedia. Multimedia mail
   and video phone over WANs will phase out text based e-mail and chat
   applications.
   Today WANs are using TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
   Protocol) for transmission and addressing of computers respectively But
   the changing usage patterns and especially multimedia communication and
   multimedia documentation forces the limits of TCP/IP and routing. To
   assess the performance of the TCP/IP and routing it is necessary to
   review the design requirements of the TCP/IP.
   Like most of the other technological progress, the conceptual
   development of the wide area network had inspired from a military need.
   As a result redundancy and reliability requirement of the military use,
   TCP operate in connectionless mode based on packet switching circuit
   technology. Each packet in this operation mode is forwarded trough the
   network until it reaches the target indicated by the target IP number.
   The devices that read the IP address and forward packets to the targets
   are called routers. Target machines send and acknowledgment to the
   originator upon the arrival of the packet. In this way TCP guarantees
   the arrival of the packet without alteration, but the time to
   destination and path to destination is not fixed and can not be
   estimated. So TCP is designed for an error free communication which are
   not sensitive to the time delay and does not require synchronized
   operation.
   Even when path to destination is unique, each routers on the way to the
   target checks the packet for errors. If an error is detected the packet
   is discarded and the originator is informed to resent. Obviously the
   processing of the each packet. in routers takes lime, as the network
   becomes larger with increasing number of routers time delays add up to
   10 seconds. So using classical TCP/IP routing it is impossible to ensure
   quality of service between two points. But it is important to note that
   this is not: a bug, it is an intended feature of the TCP/IP routing.}},

Abstract = {{The standards for the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)
   are being developed by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standardisation
   Institute). UMTS is a set of standards aimed at the global market. It
   will be a real Third Generation Global System for Mobile Communications
   adding new features and introducing relevant technological innovations
   while evolving from both GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)
   and ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Networks). UMTS standardisation is
   a market driven process and UMT standards are based on the carefully
   selected market requirements developed in a close co-operation with the
   UMTS Forum and GSM MoU (GSM Memorandum of Understanding Association).
   UMTS belongs to the IMT-2000 family and whilst supporting existing
   services, will be capable of offering new and revolutionary services
   including multimedia and access to Internet offering a speed of 2Mbit/s
   for a single user at a radio access network.

Abstract = {{A number of tactical military and commercial applications require
   multimedia, self-organizing, high throughput, wireless networks that can
   operate independently of fixed or external infrastructures. These uses
   range from low echelon push-to-talk radio to higher echelon subscriber
   access to MSE, and include commercial applications such as wireless LANs
   and emergency communications. The Soldier Phone system addresses these
   needs with an innovative concept termed Orthogonal Domain Multiple
   Access (ODMA) to provide dynamic bandwidth management. It adjusts radio
   transmit and receive times, channels, and data rates to match the
   dynamic radio frequency (RF) environment and user traffic loading. ODMA
   is embedded in a larger suite of protocols that manage the peer-to-peer
   communications. These include ATM style switching for datagrams and
   virtual circuits; network management for routing, signaling, and address
   resolution; and user convergence for many traffic types. This protocol
   suite has been integrated with baseband digital signal processing (DSP)
   functions to yield a Wireless Networking Engine (WNE). Soldier Phone is
   the first instantiation of the WNE and has been successfully
   demonstrated in a laboratory testbed. It will be field tested in the
   near future.}},

   derive fast algorithms to compute orthogonal, near-optimal, and optimal

   The key innovation is that we decouple the weight vectors in the measure
   of channel capacity to 1) simplify the optimization problem to a search
   for the maxima of a smooth multidimensional function and 2) derive
   closed-form expressions for the orthogonal and near-optimal algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In response to increasing environmental management demands, and to
   preserve the U.S. Army's Yakima Training Center (YTC) in a trainable
   condition, the U.S. Army's Directorate of Environment and Natural
   Resources Directorate (DENR) has initiated projects to more effectively
   utilize advanced technology, including remote monitoring. A ten-year
   effort, conducted by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL),
   is developing and applying customized remote sensing and GIS techniques
   in support of environmental management activities at the YTC. This
   effort has emphasized the use of satellite imagery for operationally
   mapping and monitoring vegetation and land cover on the YTC, but has
   also utilized and evaluated a number of airborne remote sensing systems
   including AVIRIS(1), AMPS(2), and HYDICE3. This effort utilizes a
   ten-year database of satellite imagery, aerial photography, and
   high-resolution multispectral/hyperspectral imagery in combination with
   digital terrain elevation data, high-resolution lidar-derived elevation
   data, and ground truth data. This unique database provides landcover
   change information required for quantifying training-related
   environmental effects and is used for planning and determining the
   effectiveness of restoration efforts. This poster presentation will
   demonstrate the use of these databases for generating a variety of
   mapping products, including a vegetation map, fire and fire history
   maps, 1-, 5-, and 10 year change detection analyses, restoration
   planning and degradation maps. In addition, focused studies have been
   conducted to evaluate how high spatial and spectral data can be used for
   identifying and mapping noxious weed infestations, better quantification
   of training-related impacts on the environment, and technology transfer
   to other U.S. Army installations.}},

Abstract = {{A significant part of the power dissipation in CMOS digital circuits is
   due to the short-circuit currents. In this paper an accurate analytical
   model for the evaluation of the CMOS short-circuit power dissipation, on
   the basis of a CMOS inverter, is presented. The innovation of the
   proposed approach against previous works is due to the accurate,
   analytical expressions of the inverter output waveform which include for
   the first time the effects of both transistor currents and the
   gate-to-drain coupling capacitance. The cu-power law MOS model which
   considers the carriers' velocity saturation effects of short-channel
   devices is used. The results produced by the suggested model show very
   good agreement with SPICE simulations.}},

Title = {{Innovation in the `Baby Bell' companies: a comparative longitudinal
   analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6-7}},
Pages = {{761-780}},
Abstract = {{The worldwide trend of deregulating monopolistic service industries, and
   in particular established telecommunication companies, raises a major
   issue: how do the former protected and implementation-minded companies
   compete with the new entrepreneurial entrants? How are these companies
   building their innovation capabilities? This paper addresses the
   question: how is innovation associated with organizational strategy,
   change and structure within an industry, given the same past history,
   and similar environments and resources? It investigates the case of the
   seven `Baby Bells' that were set up by court order in 1984 after the
   divestiture of AT\&T. These companies had shared the same company
   history for almost a century, had similar resources and were subject to
   the same regulatory and market environments. Given this similarity of
   origins, regulatory and market environment and the original common R\&D
   base, the case of the `Baby Bells' provides a natural unique environment
   for studying the process of building innovation capabilities and the
   results of this process. Three dependent variables were selected to
   represent tangible results of innovation: number of patents, new
   services offered, and diversification as expressed by non-telephone,
   non-regulated revenues; and eleven independent variables, ranging from
   R\&D expenditures to the utilization of equipment with advanced
   technology such as digital switches and fibre-optic channels, plus
   organization measures, such as rate of technical and administrative
   change, professional intensity, inter-firm linkages and joint
   developments. The data were collected for a period of eleven years
   (1984-94) from a variety of sources, and analysed by Spearman
   correlation, multiple regression and canonical correlation. The
   principal results of this research show that, with other factors
   constant: (1) acquisition of parents is positively related to joint
   development, emphasizing product differentiation, and technical change,
   (2) acquisition of patents is negatively related to inter-firm linkages
   (inter-firm interactions excluding joint developments), (3) the
   introduction of new services is positively related to joint development,
   emphasizing core competencies, and administrative change, (4) promotion
   of non-regulated revenues is positively related to emphasizing core
   competencies, and (5) innovation is negatively related to management
   intensity. The paper concludes with implications for managers of
   telecommunication companies.}},

Abstract = {{Polaroid's SUNSPOT is a novel imaging system comprising a thermal
   imaging medium designed to produce a full-color, high-resolution
   transparent image in a single sheet, addressed by a set of three diode
   lasers, each emitting at a different wavelength between 750 and 950 nm.
   The medium contains three active layers, each of which can provide an
   image in one of the three subtractive primary colors. A digitized image
   is written onto the Sunspot medium by the lasers, one for each color.
   Absorption of the radiation leads to local heating of an imaging layer
   to an extremely high temperature, causing an irreversible thermal
   reaction in which a colored material is formed.
   Innovations in two types of dyes make the system practical:
   infrared-absorbing squaraine dyes exhibiting high specific absorbance in
   a narrow waveband as well as very low visible absorption, and thermal
   color-forming materials which are extremely stable at room temperature
   for many years, but undergo a rapid unimolecular thermal conversion to
   stable dyes under imaging conditions.
   The medium is conveniently imaged using diode lasers rated at 100 to 500
   milliwatts and provides full-color images with very high color
   saturation (density >3.0) and resolution las small as three microns).
   Imaging requires no pre- or post-processing, the medium can be handled
   in ambient light before and after imaging, and no by-products or waste
   are produced.
   In a typical application, the medium may be coated onto a plastic
   ``blank{''} which comprises the image area and the mount of a
   conventional 35 mm slide. This ``blank{''} may be inserted into a
   printer, imaged, and then used immediately in a slide projector with no
   further steps involved.}},

Abstract = {{It is especially important for libraries in rural and economically
   depressed areas to become involved in the economic development of their
   communities. In a situation where there is population decline and job
   loss, the library can offer experience with technological innovation as
   well as the traditional library skills of organizing and finding
   information. In Southwestern Nova Scotia, the regional library (Western
   Counties Regional Library) has been a leader in the introduction of
   public access Internet sites and has been involved with over 15
   successful Community Access Program applications. The library is a key
   partner in the Yarmouth Community Net and is helping in the formation of
   the Western Valley Community Net. It has encouraged the development of
   the technology sector by creating new jobs and by forming partnerships
   with other organizations. The library has partnered with the local
   health authority to develop the Western Health Information Project, a
   consumer health information site which was chosen as one of Industry
   Canada's Best Practices sites in 1997. It also formed a partnership with
   Universite Sainte Anne, the only francophone university in Nova Scotia,
   to digitize information about the Acadians of Nova Scotia. All these
   activities are grounded in the belief that the public library must step
   out from behind its walls in order to foster economic development and to
   maintain vibrant communities in rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{Flexure-based compliant mechanism design enables the development of
   revolute joint manipulators without the backlash or Coulomb friction
   that impede precision position and especially force control.
   Additionally, due to scaling effects, the adverse consequences of
   Coulomb friction are exacerbated at small scales. Conventional
   approaches to compliant mechanism design impose several limitations,
   however, such as severely limited ranges of motion, poor kinematic
   behavior, and significant deformation under multi-axis loading. The
   authors have developed a new type of compliant mechanism that enables
   the implementation of spatially-loaded revolute joint manipulators with
   well-behaved kinematic characteristics and without the backlash and
   stick-slip behavior that would otherwise impede precision control. The
   primary innovation in the design is the split-tube flexure, a unique
   small-scale revolute joint that exhibits a considerably larger range of
   motion and significantly better multi-axis revolute joint
   characteristics than a conventional flexure. Specifically, the compliant
   manipulator has an approximately spherical workspace two centimeters in
   diameter, yet is structurally rigid along non-actuated axes. Data from
   the small-scale manipulator demonstrates that positioning resolution is
   limited by digital quantization and sensor noise, and not by more
   fundamental physical limitations, such as backlash or Coulomb friction.}},

Abstract = {{ROBART III is intended as an advanced demonstration platform for
   non-lethal response measures, extending the concepts of reflexive
   teleoperation into the realm of coordinated weapons control (i.e.,
   sensor-aided control of mobility, camera, and weapon functions) in law
   enforcement and urban warfare scenarios. A rich mix of ultrasonic and
   optical proximity and range sensors facilitates remote operation in
   unstructured and unexplored buildings with minimal operator supervision.
   Autonomous navigation and mapping of interior spaces is significantly
   enhanced by an innovative algorithm which exploits the fact that the
   majority of man-made structures are characterized by (but not limited
   to) parallel and orthogonal walls.
   Extremely robust intruder detection and assessment capabilities are
   achieved through intelligent fusion of a multitude of inputs from
   various onboard motion sensors. Intruder detection is addressed by a
   360-degree staring array of passive-infrared motion detectors, augmented
   by a number of positionable head-mounted sensors (i.e., sonar,
   microwave, video). Automatic camera tracking of a moving target is
   accomplished using a video line digitizer. Non-lethal response systems
   include a six-barreled pneumatically-powered Gatling gun, high-powered
   strobe lights, and three ear-piercing 103-decibel sirens.
   This paper presents a comprehensive overview of ROBART Ill's supervised
   autonomous navigation, intruder tracking, and non-lethal weapon and
   control systems.}},

Abstract = {{Selected electronic, digital x-ray imaging systems and techniques were

   introduction of digital systems include the elimination of recurring
   costs of film, processing, and waste disposal, and the advantages of
   electronic data analysis, digital signal processing, and the ease of
   storage, retrieval, and transfer of digital data. Initial experimental
   evaluations included photostimulable storage phosphors,
   scintillator-camera systems, flat panel imagers and the reverse geometry
   method. The technical evaluations were conducted with a test object
   consisting of typical honeycomb structure containing various faults,
   line pair gages, and image quality indicators on 1/4-inch aluminum.
   Several electronic systems were capable of meeting most of the technical
   requirements for x-ray inspection, with system prices attractive for
   field locations with annual film costs in the range of \$15,000 or more.
   All the electronic methods eliminate processing chemicals and offer
   advantages in certain applications. However, the storage phosphor
   systems were particularly well suited for field implementation because
   of their similarity to film, but without most of the recurring costs and
   the environmental problems associated with the use of film. These
   evaluations were conducted under a Small Business Innovation Research
   (SBIR) Phase I program. More extensive system evaluations are planned as
   the program continues into an SBIR Phase II project.}},

   environment in which students are stimulated to develop skills used in
   solving real-world problems. We describe three main features of our
   model: the change of teaching strategies from ``page turning{''} to
   ``simulation-based{''}, the transition of teachers' role from
   repetitious work to individualized education, the use of communications
   as a complement to teachers' instruction. We also give a dynamic

Abstract = {{The KTeV fixed target experiment at Fermilab is using an innovative
   scheme for reading out its 3100 channel CsI electromagnetic calorimeter.
   This pipelined readout system digitizes photomultiplier tube (PMT)
   signals over a 16-bit dynamic range with 8-bits of resolution at 53 MHz.
   The crucial element of the system is a custom Bi-CMOS integrated circuit
   which, in conjunction with an g-bit Flash ADC, integrates and digitizes
   the PMT signal charge over each 18.9 nsec clock cycle (53 MHz) in a
   deadtimeless fashion. The digitizer circuit is local to the PMT base,
   and has an in-situ charge integration noise figure of 3 fC/sample. In
   this article, the readout system will be described and its performance
   including noise, cross-talk, linearity, stability and reliability will
   be discussed.}},

   across titles, regardless of publisher, that will allow for forward and
   backward chaining; therefore the article will allow for bidirectional
   information linking. The fourth innovation will be the use of either
   push or pull technology that will enable the researcher to define the
   information package that is desired from number of sources. The fifth
   significant change will be the ability of publishers to receive usage

Abstract = {{The MIRAGE (Multispectral Infrared Animation Generation Equipment)
   Dynamic Infrared Scene Projector, is a joint project developed by Santa
   Barbara Infrared, Inc. and Indigo Systems Corporation. MIRAGE is a
   complete infrared scene projector, accepting 3-D rendered analog or
   digital scene data at its input, and providing all other electronics,
   collimated optics, calibration and thermal support subsystems needed to
   stimulated a unit under test with high-fidelity, dynamic infrared
   scenes. At the heart of MIRAGE is a 512 x 512 emitter array, with key
   innovations that solve several problems of existing designs. The read-in
   integrated circuit (RIIC) features ``snapshot{''} updating of the entire
   512x512 resistive array, thus solving synchronization and latency
   problems inherent in ``rolling-update{''} type designs, where data is
   always changing somewhere on the emitter array at any given time. This
   custom mixed-signal RIIC also accepts digital scene information at its
   input, and uses on-board D/A converters and individual unit-cell buffer
   amplifiers to create analog scene levels, eliminating the complexity,
   noise, and limitations of speed and dynamic range associated with
   external generation of analog scene levels. The proprietary process used
   to create the advanced technology micro-membrane emitter elements allows
   a wide choice of resistor and structure materials while preserving the
   dissipation and providing a thermal time constant of the order of 5ms.
   These innovations, along with a compact electronics subsystem based on a
   standard desktop PC, greatly reduce the complexity of the required
   external support electronics, resulting in a smaller, higher performance
   dynamic scene simulator system.}},

Abstract = {{Major progress and breakthroughs had occurred during the last decade in
   the field of Superconductive Electronics. This is related both to the
   discovery of high temperature oxide superconductors shortly later
   applied to microwave passive devices and simple SQUID magnetometers, but
   the biggest progress has been made, during the same period, on the
   achievement of large scale integrated (LSI) circuits using conventional
   superconductive multilayers. Circuits made of niobium tunnel junctions
   are working at 4.2 K in a liquid helium cooling system, those made of
   niobium nitride (NbN) junctions, working at 9K, in double stage
   refrigerators are even more attractive.
   Applications of such superconductive circuits are covering various
   fields such as high speed electronics (BW similar to 50 GHz),
   submillimeter ``SIS{''} heterodyne receivers, digital devices made of
   RSFQ logic gates (ADC/DAC, autocorrelators, flash digitizers, switching
   circuit networks, arithmetic units for future Petaflops-scale
   computers,...), devices for Metrology and NDE, functional and
   topographic brain investigation using multichannel SQUIDs systems
   (MEG),...
   Superconductive Electronics do not require critical design rules or very
   narrow linewidth in the circuit fabrication but would surely benefit in
   the future in the development of silicon microelectronics, VLSI circuits
   Foundry services and innovative microchip or Microsystems designs.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Close-Range Photogrammetry has made tremendous improvements over
   the last years. Many of the elements contributing to those improvements
   were the advances in algorithms and their implementation into commercial
   systems. It has become customary that production personnel without
   photogrammetric know-how use systems. Another area of major change is
   the use of Digital Close-Range Photogrammety systems in machine control.
   These applications require totally automated systems without human
   supervision. While the algorithmic performance of such systems is a
   difficult task other issues, such as ultra high-resolution cameras
   suitable for the rough environment and their response time, are critical
   elements for the acceptance of such systems.
   Cameras with much higher resolutions and better performance have been
   appearing on the market over the last years. There are Cameras with
   CCD-sensors containing 4kx4k pixels are available. While these cameras
   offer a larger sensor their performance is not dramatically better than
   that of the widely used cameras using 3kx2k sensors. Actually the
   price/performance of these cameras is poorer. A new camera series
   offering both 3kx2k and 7kx4k sensors with a custom optics and a
   high-performance CCD-sensor read-out was designed to break current
   accuracy barriers.
   Innovations included in these cameras include custom optics. This allows
   the optics to be tuned to the application and not just general
   photography needs. They take advantage of the full dynamic range offered
   by the CCD-sensor, i.e. use of a 12 bit analog-to-digital converter and
   16 bit per pixel in order to take full advantage of the CCD-sensor. They
   have an optical/mechanical design to assure an extreme geometric
   stability of the camera. Finally they include an ``on-board{''}
   processor to perform all image computations within the camera.}},

   a new tool to create innovative and novel methods for solving problems

   may not be detectable by visual inspection or other detection techniques
   because of their inherent complexity. The algorithm presented in this

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional echocardiography plays a critical role in the care of
   patients with both acute and chronic cardiac diseases. Tremendous
   advances in this noninvasive imaging technology have occurred of the
   last 35 years and current and future innovations are progressing at a
   rapid pace. Advances in instrumentations, such as harmonic imaging, new
   applications of echocardiography in the operating room, and new
   developments in myocardial contrast: echocardiography are just a few
   examples of new developments that are currently available to enhance
   care. In addition, advances in computer processing speed and storage
   capability means that the vision of the ``digital echo lab{''} is close
   to reality. This new application, with its potential to speed the
   acquisition, interpretation, transmission and storage of
   echocardiograms, should enable this image modality to maintain in
   position of importance as we look to the future of medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Atheromatous aneurysms of the thoracic aorta are much less common than
   those of the abdominal aorta. Associated atherosclerosis of the
   coronary, cerebral and peripheral limb arteries is observed in 16, 10
   and 11 \% of cases, respectively. Ultrasonography, CT scanning, and
   mostly MRI and digitised angiography provide very accurate morphological
   data. The natural history is dominated by the risk of rupture with a 3
   year survival of 50 \% in aneurysms with a diameter superior to 5 cm.
   The surgical indication should be considered in cases of aneurysms with
   diameters over 5 cm after full carotid, coronary, respiratory and renal
   investigations. Surgery is simple in descending aortic aneurysms but
   more complicated in aneurysms of the transverse and descending aorta,
   especially in long lesions. Technical innovations have reduced the
   incidence of both cerebral complications after surgery of the aortic
   arch by improved cerebral protection and of medullary complications
   after surgery of the descending thoracic aorta, especially of
   thoraco-abdominal aneurysms, by better medullary protection against
   ischaemia during aortic clamping. The operative results have a mortality
   of : 3 \% for aneurysms of the ascending aorta; 10 \% for aneurysms of
   the aortic arch; 9 \%, with a 15 \% risk of paraplegia, for long
   aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray imaging originated with a discovery and experimental observations
   by a physicist, Professor Wilhelm Roentgen, over one hundred years ago.
   It quickly became a valuable medical diagnostic tool. During this
   century many technological innovations have contributed to improved
   image quality and an expansion in clinical applications. Even though
   there are now other methods, such as ultrasound, nuclear medicine, and
   magnetic resonance imaging, for producing medical images, x-ray imaging
   is the one that is most frequently used. The second century of x-ray
   imaging will be a transition from images recorded on film to digitized
   images which can be more effectively transferred from one location to
   another, processed to improve image quality, and analyzed for additional
   clinical information. Unfortunately, high-quality x-ray imaging is not
   available to a major segment of the world's population, especially in
   the developing countries. Medical physicists are in a unique position to
   address some of these problems and improve the global effectiveness of
   x-ray imaging diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{A vision-aided reverse engineering approach (VAREA) has been developed
   to reconstruct least-squares free-form surface models from physical
   models, with a coordinate measurement machine (CMM) equipped with a
   touch-triggered probe and a computer vision system. The VAREA integrates
   computer vision, surface data digitization and surface modelling into a
   single process. Two main steps are applied in this innovative approach.
   The initial vision-driven surface triangulation process (IVSTP)
   generates a triangular patch by using stereo image detection and a
   constrained Delaunay triangulation method. The adaptive model-based
   digitizing process is then used to refine the surface reconstruction and
   to control accuracy to within user-specified tolerances. As a result, a
   least-squares bi-cubic B-spline surface model with the controlled
   accuracy of digitization can be obtained for further application in
   product design and manufacturing processes. More than 85\% reduction has
   been achieved in the time required to construct free-form surface using
   this approach, as compared with traditional manual methods with CMM.
   Therefore, product design lead time can be significantly reduced. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper provides a technical overview of the smart transducer
   interface module (STIM), the key element of the proposed IEEE-P1451.2
   Draft Standard for Transducer to Microprocessor Communication Protocols
   and Transducer Electronic Data Sheets (TEDS) Formats. The draft standard
   was released for balloting in August, 1996. Comments have been addressed
   and the draft was submitted to IEEE for recirculation to balloters in
   June, 1997. Objectives and genealogy of this standard are summarized.
   Key technical innovations such as the TEDS, representation of physical
   units, general calibration model, triggering of sensors and actuators,
   variable transfer rate between a host and the STIM, and support for
   multivariable transducers are briefly discussed. Detailed descriptions
   of the STIM, TEDS, digital interface, and plug-and-play operation are
   also provided. The specifics of physical units encoding, an example of a
   TEDS, and an example of the digital interface timing requirements are
   also included to aid the overview. This paper is an updated version of

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the adoption patterns and implementation issues
   associated with the use of digital-imaging technology within the banking
   and insurance industries, Several research hypotheses are tested using
   data obtained from a survey of the 250 largest banks and 250 largest
   insurance companies in the United States, The results clearly indicate
   that the diffusion of imaging can be modeled by an S-curve, and that
   firm size is a good predictor of the adoption decision, Two well-known
   models of innovative behavior, the internal influence and Bass models,
   were not supported by this study, Positive, measurable benefits were
   associated with imaging adoption, Reengineering the work processes and
   piloting the technology were both found to be strongly related to the
   degree of implementation success, Based on the findings from this study,
   similarities and differences in innovative behavior between
   manufacturing and the banking and insurance industries are discussed.}},

   in the past few years, These developments have produced changes in the
   way they are applied from electromechanical (EM) relays and, further,

   Power Systems Protection Committee began examining the impact of these
   developments several years ago, This report documents the results and
   describes the nature of the changes and the new areas of application, It
   is presented acknowledging the fact that this is really an interim
   report, since static relay technology is a very dynamic technology with
   many more innovations yet to be developed.}},

Abstract = {{The delivery of dental education, in common with other forms of higher
   education, has altered considerably over the last decade. The
   introduction of the World Wide Web enabled resources for dental
   education to be delivered in a new and innovative manner. DERWeb was
   funded by HEFC-JISC. The primary resource consists of a library of 1600
   clinical dental images each with keywords and a description. Selected
   images were used to create teaching materials to demonstrate to dental
   educators world wide how the image library could be used by individual
   institutions. Hands-on courses were held to demonstrate the new resource
   and to evaluate computer skills in the dental community. Since the
   commencement of the project in September 1994 DERWeb has become one of
   the leading resources for dental education world wide. The site has been
   accessed by 79 countries with approximately 107 000 accesses in October
   1996. DERWeb also designs and maintains the British Dental Association
   pages together with other professional organisations. Its resources also
   include dental contact addresses and links to quality dental sites world
   wide. Further funding has enabled DERWeb to expand further and explore
   new technologies to develop interactivity on the Web. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An innovative approach to CORDIC(Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer)
   computing is presented. This method features unidirectional rotation,
   unlike most other more conventional methods, which are bidirectional. A
   specified angle z(0) is approached by this method so that the cosz(0)
   and sinz(0) are computed.
   Since no additional hardware components are required to decide the
   rotation direction for each iteration, the architecture is thus simple,
   and is expected to be reduced 20\% of the area compared with
   conventional CORDIC techniques. Latency time is also reduced. Although a
   variable scaling factor should be used, only the first two or three
   iterations are required because after that, the scaling factor, cos
   alpha(i), approaches 1 as alpha(i)<2(-8). This method guarantees rapid
   acceleration toward convergence in one direction during trigonometric
   function computation.}},

Abstract = {{Background. This article describes the testing behavior for human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody among an urban population of men
   who have sex with men (MSM) and the reasons given for not being tested
   for HIV.
   Methods. A random digit dialing telephone survey of men living in
   selected neighborhoods of Seattle, Washington, was conducted from June
   through August 1992.
   Results. Of 603 MSM interviewed, 82\% had ever been tested for HIV; 19\%
   of tested men were seropositive. MSM who were older, nonwhite, with
   lower income, or not currently sexually active were less likely to have
   been tested. Among nontesters, 57\% believed their risk of infection was
   too low to justify testing; 52\% said they had not tested due to fear of
   learning the result, Testers and nontesters had similar rates of
   unprotected sexual behavior,
   Conclusions. Most MSM who had not been tested for HPV believed they were
   not at risk of infection and/or were fearful of learning the result, To
   increase the proportion of MSM who test, public health agencies may need
   to emphasize that unexpected infection does occur and that new therapies
   are available for those testing positive. Innovative programs may be
   necessary to reach those who have not yet decided to be tested. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The Ohio State University (OSU) and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation
   (CCF) developed a 6 x 18 inch low velocity Rheologic Research Tunnel to
   do flow visualization and other experimental fluid studies, particularly
   on scaled-up models of cardiovascular devices, such as the CCF's
   Innovative Ventricular Assist System. The large test section (TS)
   permits detailed data to be obtained that would be inaccessible with a
   smaller test prototype. A particular feature of the OSU-CCF program is
   the use of a non-Newtonian blood analog (NNBA), so the effect of the
   shear-thinning behavior of blood on the local development of separation,
   stagnation, and now patterns can be studied. The TS can simulate a
   pressure driven slit flow of 6 x 18 in., or the external flow around a
   vane or blade having an aspect ratio of 1. Maximum pressure is 8.5 psig,
   while the maximum velocity is 21.7 in/sec. The fluid supply tank has a
   capacity of 500 gal of NNBA and, with its associated filtration and
   circulation systems, can be adapted to studies of large transparent
   models better studied outside the TS. Using 2 pumps, flow rates of
   98-610 gal/min can be provided. Instrumentation includes thermistors, a
   48 port pressure scanner with pressure transducers, a data acquisition
   system, and a digital video camera. Dye and hydrogen bubble systems have
   been developed. Development of such a facility presents problems not
   encountered in more typical water tables or wind tunnels. These include
   fundamental issues such as providing a uniform flowfield; practical
   issues with respect to priming, operating, and obtaining data from the
   system; and safety considerations. For the very large volume of NNBA, a
   xanthan gum solution is used, whose shear-thinning behavior depends not
   only on concentration, but also on age and prior shear history. The
   lessons learned are presented, permitting others to efficiently develop
   systems suitable to their testing needs.}},

Abstract = {{Challenging issues for processing queries specified over large-scale
   information spaces (for example, Digital Libraries or the World Wide
   Web) include the diversity of the information sources in terms of their
   structures, query interfaces and search capabilities, as well as the
   dynamics of sources continuously being added, removed or upgraded. In
   this paper, we give an innovative solution for query planning in such
   environments. The foundation of our solution is the Dynamic Information
   Integration Model (DIIM) which supports the specification of not only
   content but also capabilities of resources without requiring the
   establishment of a uniform integration schema. Besides the development
   of the DIIM model, contributions of this paper include:
   (1) the introduction of the notion of fully specified queries that are
   semantically equivalent to a loosely-specified query;
   (2) a translation algorithm of a loosely-specified query into a set of
   semantically equivalent feasible query plans that are consistent with
   the binding patterns of query templates of the individual sources
   (capability descriptions in DIIM) and with interrelationships between
   information sources (expressed as join constraints in DIIM); and
   (3) a search restriction algorithm for optimizing query processing by
   pruning the search space into the relevant subspace of a query. The
   plans obtained by the proposed query planning process which is composed
   of the search restriction and translation algorithms can be shown to
   correspond to query plans semantically equivalent to the initial
   loosely-specified input query.}},

Abstract = {{Technological leadership in an industry certainly seems like a ticket to
   ongoing success, However, overemphasis on existing technological
   capabilities may produce a form of myopia in product development. In
   other words, by focusing primarily on developing and improving their
   core technologies, organizations miss opportunities to exploit new
   technologies and thus create breakthrough products.
   Ken Kusunoki proposes that problem-solving approaches in a
   technologically leading firm paradoxically may impede radical product
   innovation. Suggesting that such firms are inherently oriented toward
   incremental innovation, he presents a conceptual framework of the
   dynamic interaction between technological and product development
   problem-solving in the context of product innovation. He then
   illustrates this conceptual framework by examining a case of radical
   innovation in the Japanese facsimile industry.
   For a technological lender, product innovation typically is driven by
   technology development. In other words, such a firm quite reasonably
   relies on the technological advantage it holds over competitors as the
   basis for its product developments. By refining and enhancing its
   industry-leading technological capabilities, the firm can successfully
   introduce incremental innovations in its products. Because of this
   strong emphasis on exploiting existing technological capabilities,
   however, the technological lender may fail to capitalize on new
   technologies that can produce radical innovations.
   In the race to develop high-speed, digital facsimile equipment during
   the early 1970s, for example, Matsushita held a decided technological
   advantage over competitors such as Ricoh. Notwithstanding Matsushita's
   technological edge, however, Ricoh brought this radical innovation to
   market two years before Matsushita introduced its first digital machine,
   causing a serious decline in Matsushita's market share.
   Ricoh's approach to technological and product problem-solving-an
   autonomous team structure, with a strong project manager and frequent
   transfers of engineers among interdependent units-contrasts dramatically
   with Matsushita's functional structure and strong emphasis on
   technological problem-solving. Interestingly, Matsushita regained its
   technological advantage by 1976, thanks to a rapid series of incremental
   innovations in its product technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the impact of digital technology diffusion on
   the productivity of firms making up the local operating sector of the
   U.S. telecommunications industry for the years 1991 to 1993. Diffusion
   of digital technology is measured as the extent of line digitalization
   that has taken place, with digitalization expected to enable firms to
   reap significant operating efficiencies. While the diffusion of this
   particular technology in the local operating company sector has been
   relatively low, it is found that, after controlling for the effects of a
   number of other covariates also likely to affect firm-level performance,
   the spread of digital technology within the U.S. local telephone network
   plays a significant and positive role in impacting productive efficiency
   of the firms making up the network. The investments that have been made
   in energizing the U.S. information superhighway, via the digitalization
   of telephone lines, are justified in productive efficiency terms. The
   article contributes to empirical literature in the technical change area
   which assesses the firm-level productive efficiency consequences of
   technology diffusion. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes in detail the design of a portable
   microcontroller-based K-factor meter, or transformer harmonic derating
   factor meter. This innovative instrument is based on the recently
   developed time-domain method for K-factor determination, K-factor is

   current; to the rms value of this same current, The meter employs the
   properties of an air-core current transformer, or Rogowski coil, to
   acquire the time derivative of a current and then numerical integration,
   of this digitized signal, to obtain the current waveform itself, This
   method avoids the noise of the numeric differentiation, characteristic
   of the time domain approach to K-factor measurement, as well as the
   computational effort of the fast Fourier transform in the frequency
   domain approach, In addition, the instrument incorporates thermal demand
   models for both It-factor and rms current to assess transformer harmonic
   heating over a user selected time interval, A prototype meter, using a
   MC68HC16 microcontroller, was built and tested with a variety of actual

Abstract = {{Many believe that CD-ROM's storage capacity and its full integration
   with desktop and notebook computers make it an attractive technology for
   developing countries. Its integration with microcomputers offers
   developing countries several bonuses. One innovative use of the
   technology in developing countries is to combine if with online
   networks. Although there have been projects that improve the awareness
   of the potential of CD-ROM in developing countries and a copious body of
   research work on the use of CD-ROM technology is also available, there
   is still a gap between expectation and realisation. Thus several
   questions arise which require further evaluation. For example, what are
   the benefits of merging CD-ROM technology with online networks in
   Africa? How can optical mass storage such as CD-ROM and DVD (digital
   versatile/video disc) effectively be utilised to reduce an information
   gap in Africa? This paper describes the potential use of hybrid
   CD-ROM/online technology in developing countries and provides partial
   answers to these questions as they relate to Africa.}},

Title = {{Operational strategy, R\&D and intra-metropolitan clustering in a
   polycentric structure: The advanced electronics industries of the Los
   Angeles basin}},
Journal = {{URBAN STUDIES}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1343-1380}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The multiple clustering of economic activities is one of the most
   distinctive characteristics of a polycentric metropolitan area. The
   relationship between intra-metropolitan location, research and
   development (R\&D), operational strategy and production is analysed, to
   determine whether spatial clusters are more supportive of R\&D than
   non-clustered locations. Two major operational strategies commonly
   utilised in advanced electronics production, outsourcing and the use of
   just-in-time (JIT) production methods, and their relationship with
   intra-metropolitan location and R\&D intensity are considered, to
   determine their effects on spatially clustered and non-clustered
   establishments. The intra-metropolitan distribution of clusters in the
   Los Angeles basin, their potential industrial district effects, and the
   role of externalities are also evaluated, to determine the relationship
   between polycentricity and high-technology production. Extensive
   statistical analyses are then undertaken with establishment-level data
   for seven 4-digit advanced electronics sectors, in the
   telecommunications, electromedical and advanced computer equipment
   manufacturing groups in the Los Angeles basin. Comparative statistical
   analyses on a sample of Silicon Valley establishments are also
   performed, in order to place the Los Angeles basin's findings in
   perspective. The results of this research contradict some of the most
   common assumptions on the benefits of spatial industrial clustering,
   that have been diffused in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The zona pellucida (zona) is a glycoprotein coat that envelopes the
   oocyte and embryo, binds sperm during fertilization and facilitates
   transfer of the embryo through the Fallopian tube. Before implantation
   can occur, the blastocyst must hatch from the zona. Several lines of
   evidence suggest that the zona is multilaminar. We hypothesized that the
   multilaminar structure of the zona filaments could be imaged
   nondestructively with the polarized light microscope. A recent
   modification of the polarized light microscope (pol-scope), which
   combines innovations in polarization optics with novel image processing
   software, allows measurement of birefringence at all points of the
   image. Hamster metaphase II oocytes were placed on glass coverslips
   which replaced the bottom of culture dishes, imaged under differential
   interference contrast (DIG) and pol-scope optics, then digitized and
   processed to measure birefringence magnitude and orientation. The
   pol-scope revealed the zona to be divided into outer and inner layers
   separated by a zone of low retardance. This finding is consistent with
   filaments in the outer layer oriented tangentially and in the inner
   layer oriented radially. The multilaminar structure of the mammalian
   zona suggested by differential lectin binding and by scanning electron
   microscopy could be imaged non-destructively with the pol-scope. Because
   the pol-scope provides a non-destructive method to identify
   macro-molecular organization of the zona, it may prove useful in
   developmental studies of hatching and to direct resection of the zona.}},

Abstract = {{Broadband networks are now being used in numerous trials throughout the
   world to provide interactive video services for residential customers.
   These trials and small-scale commercial deployments lack novel
   applications and services that make effective use of network
   capabilities and attract users to experiment with them. The rapid
   explosion of the Internet has also played a role in the current lack of
   interest and investment in broadband video networks. This article
   examines the lessons learned from the commercial deployment of a
   switched fiber-coax video dial tone network in Dover Township, New
   Jersey, USA. Future broadband networks will have to combine the
   capabilities of video dial tone networks and the Internet at an
   attractive price. Innovative end-to-end applications that go beyond
   cable TV and movies on demand are needed to renew commercial interest in
   residential broadband networks.}},

Abstract = {{Film radiography has long served the aerospace industry as a principal
   method for hardware flaw detection. Although excellent in performance,
   this method is extremely time consuming, labor intensive, costly, and is
   unsuitable for real time inspections. Modern digital radiographic
   systems overcome some of these difficulties but are also limited in
   terms of speed of operation due to persistence of the sensor and a
   problematic tradeoff between the X-ray detection efficiency and spatial
   resolution.
   We are developing an innovative X-ray imaging detector consisting of a
   novel microstructured CsI scintillator coupled to a fiberoptic
   taper-based CCD. Thin-film deposition techniques, previously developed
   to produce thin, structured CsI screens have been extended to fabricate
   CsI screens, up to 450 mg/cm(2) (1,000 mu m) in thickness. These sensors
   are suitable to provide high detection efficiency with high image
   quality for NDE applications. A prototype high energy imaging system was
   constructed by integrating these screens into a fiberoptic-based CCD
   camera. The performance was compared to that of the same system using a
   standard polycrystalline phosphor for NDE imaging applications. The
   experimental evaluations were carried out at Scientific Measurement
   Systems, Inc., Austin, TX.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of an analysis of instrumentation and control (I\&C)
   systems in nuclear power plants the need is outlined to design digital
   instr instrumentation and control systems with forward looking technical
   features to serve both for plant operations management under normal
   conditions and for safety related problems in reactor and safety I\&C.
   Siemens KWU not only took measures to safeguard the availability of
   existing permanently wired I\&C systems, but also advanced the
   development, evaluation by experts. and commercialization of the
   Teleperm XS and Teleperm XP digital I\&C systems. The working principle
   and the advantages of digital I\&C systems are outlined briefly. A
   report is presented of the status of the licensing procedure and
   commercialisation of the Teleperm XS safety I\&C system. A number of
   examples are cited to explain the various possible uses of the systems
   discussed for new plants and for backfitting purposes, both in nuclear
   power plants by KWU and in facilities by other vendors. Siemens KWU
   remains a partner for in-plant and safety related I\&C technology in
   nuclear power plants. This strategy is based on the principle of
   maintaining the availability of existing systems by adequate spare parts
   strategies as long as possible, and on the thorough innovation of I\&C
   technology by the use of the forward looking Teleperm XS and Teleperm XP
   digital I\&C systems. The Teleperm XS system is currently being
   introduced into the market and will be used on a broad basis in Germany
   and abroad in 1997/98.}},

Abstract = {{The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Standard
   specifies a non-proprietary data interchange protocol, digital image
   format, and file structure for biomedical images and image-related
   information. The fundamental concepts of the DICOM message protocol,
   services, and information objects are reviewed as background for a
   detailed discussion of the functionality of DICOM; the innovations and
   limitations of the Standard; and the impact of various DICOM features on
   information system users. DICOM addresses five general application
   areas: (1) network image management, (2) network image interpretation
   management, (3) network print management, (4) imaging procedure
   management, (5) off-line storage media management. DICOM is a complete
   specification of the elements required to achieve a practical level of
   automatic interoperability between biomedical imaging computer
   systems-from application layer to bit-stream encoding. The Standard is
   being extended and expanded in modular fashion to support new
   applications and incorporate new technology. An interface to other
   Information Systems provides for shared management of patient,
   procedure, and results information related to images. A Conformance
   Statement template enables a knowledgeable user to determine if
   interoperability between two implementations is possible. Knowledge of
   DICOM's benefits and realistic understanding of its limitations enable
   one to use the Standard effectively as the basis for a long term
   implementation strategy for image management and communications systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the IRIS architectural synthesis system for
   high-performance digital signal processing. This tool allows
   non-specialists to automatically derive VLSI circuit architectures from
   high-level, algorithmic representations, and provides a quick route to
   silicon implementation. By incorporating a novel synthesis methodology,
   called the Modular Design Procedure, within the IRIS system,
   parameterised models of complex and innovative DSP hardware can be
   derived and automatically assembled to create new DSP systems. The
   nature of this synthesis methodology is such that designers can explore
   a large range of architectural alternatives, whilst considering all the
   architectural implications of using specific hardware to realise the
   circuit. The applicability of IRIS is demonstrated using the design
   examples of a second order Infinite Impulse Response filter and a
   one-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Adenocarcinoma of the prostate (CaP) in the Western world has become the
   most common noncutaneous human tumor. Cap is also the second most
   important cause of cancer deaths among the male population in the United
   States. Major progress was made in the past decade in better
   understanding this disease process, as well as in improved diagnostic
   accuracy. This improved diagnostic accuracy was due to wide application
   of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), use of transrectal ultrasound
   (TRUS), and greater awareness among clinicians of CaP. The use of PSA in
   clinical practice has resulted in a sharp increase in the number of
   patients diagnosed with capsule-confined tumors. The optimal treatment
   for capsule-confined CaP is in the process of being defined. Radical
   prostatectomy in the United States is currently the most commonly
   applied treatment for younger patients. Excellent treatment results with
   a 10-year actuarial survival >80\% are readily obtainable in properly
   selected patients. Nerve-sparing procedures helped reduce the high
   incidence of impotence that occurs in patients after radical retropubic
   prostatectomy. Radiotherapy remains the other curative treatment method
   in the management of CaP patients, with long-term survival rates similar
   to those reported in surgical series. Due to the problem of frequent
   preoperative tumor understaging, a-routine use of postoperative
   irradiation to the prostatic fossa produces an excellent (>95\%)
   incidence of local tumor control. Management of patients with metastatic
   disease has undergone a considerable evolution with the development of
   modern hormonal management and treatment with strontium-89 to control
   intractable bone pain. Newer treatment methods such as hyperthermia are
   currently being investigated. Major efforts are directed toward the
   reduction of short- and long-term treatment toxicity associated with
   surgery, radiotherapy, and hormonal management, thus improving patient
   quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{The software system KAMEDIN (Kooperatives Arbeiten und MEdizinische
   Diagnostik auf Innovativen Netzen) is a multimedia telemedicine system
   for exchange, cooperative diagnostics, and remote analysis of digital
   medical image data. It provides components for visualisation,
   processing, and synchronised audio-visual discussion of medical images.
   Techniques of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) synchronise
   user interactions during a teleconference. Visibility of both local and
   remote cursor on the conference workstations facilitates telepointing
   and reinforces the conference partner's telepresence. Audio
   communication during teleconferences is supported by an integrated audio
   component. Furthermore, brain tissue segmentation with artificial neural
   networks can be performed on an external supercomputer as a remote image
   analysis procedure. KAMEDIN is designed as a low cost CSCW tool for ISDN
   based telecommunication. However it can be used on any TCP/IP supporting
   network. Tn a field test, KAMEDIN was installed in 15 clinics and
   medical departments to validate the systems' usability. The telemedicine
   system KAMEDIN has been developed, tested, and evaluated within a
   research project sponsored by German Telekom. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Conventional procedures for the determination of volume changes in
   triaxial tests are based on the amount of pore fluid changes into or out
   of the fully saturated cylindrical specimen. As a triaxial soil specimen
   shears, the total volume may increase or decrease depending on the soil
   density, current state of stress, and the stress history. The
   measurement of these changes in volume are of great importance in the
   characterization of the soil's mechanical properties. This paper
   presents an innovative or alternative technique that has been used for
   measuring the volumetric deformation that cylindrical specimens
   experience during the shearing stages of a triaxial test. This method
   incorporates digital imaging techniques and computer-aided analysis to
   assess the changes in volume throughout a test. A detailed description
   of the hardware and other equipment is provided along with the data
   analysis methodology used to simplify the operation. Comparisons are
   made between the observed results and those obtained from conventional
   measurement techniques.}},

   to solve some of the specific problems, in order to achieve a
   sustainable economic development. Designed to eliminate the
   time-delaying lack of infrastructure, FOMTA will embark on the
   simulation of the Integrated Service Digital Network infrastructure.
   FOMTA will adopt measures to increase the awareness and stimulate the
   participation of the DCs in the telemedicine and health care telematics
   projects through demonstrations, pilot projects, workshops, training and
   exchange activities. This will demonstrate the feasibility of
   telemedicine services in the DCs, including trial of services in
   real-life circumstances, and will provide training possibilities for
   researchers in the use of methods and tools for advanced communication
   technologies and telematics. Undoubtedly, telediagnosis,
   teleconsultation and other areas of telemedicine would thrive in Africa
   both as remote testing grounds and fields of practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Multiply-Accumulate is an important and expensive operation. It is
   frequently used in Digital Signal Processing and video/graphics
   applications. As a result, any improvement in the delay for performing
   this operation could have a positive impact an clock speed, instruction
   time, and processor performance. In this paper we show how by extending
   our view of a parallel multiplier we can apply recent innovations in
   parallel multiplier design to multiply-accumulators. This application
   results in multiply-accumulators that are as fast as multipliers of the
   same size. (These multipliers have been shown to result in provably
   optimal delays faster than current designs.) This allows a single
   (optimal multiply-accumulate) circuit to be used for both operations
   without delay penalty. As a result multiply-accumulate can be
   efficiently and effectively implemented as an instruction in RISC CPUs.
   Additionally, the circuit design reduces the number of devices needed
   over current fast multiplier designs, so that real estate and power
   savings also result.}},

Abstract = {{Film radiography has long served the aerospace industry as a principal
   method for hardware flaw detection. Although excellent in performance,
   this method is extremely lime consuming, labor intensive, costly, and is
   unsuitable for real time inspections. Modern digital radiographic
   systems overcome some of these difficulties but are also limited in
   terms of speed of operation due to persistence of the sensor and a
   problematic tradeoff between the X-ray defection efficiency and spatial
   resolution.
   We are developing an innovative X-ray imaging detector consisting of a
   novel microstructured CsI scintillator coupled to a fiberoptic
   taper-based CCD. Thin-film deposition techniques, previously developed
   to produce thin, structured CsI screens have been extended to fabricate
   CsI screens, up to 450 mg/cm(2) (1,000 mu m) in thickness. These sensors
   are suitable to provide high detection efficiency with high image
   quality for NDE applications. A prototype high energy imaging system was
   constructed by integrating these screens into a fiberoptic-based CCD
   camera. The performance tvas compared to that of the same system using a
   standard polycrystalline phosphor for NDE imaging applications. The
   experimental evaluations were carried out at Scientific Measurement
   Systems, Inc., Austin, TX.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the pairing of a CMOS step motor control IC and an
   innovative Power Multi-Chip Module (PMCM) to realize versatile, low-cost
   PWM operation that integrates microstepping.
   This combination of circuitry simplifies the PWM operation of many
   2-phase, unipolar step motors; offers the essential benefits of fluid,
   quiet motor operation; and (essentially) eliminates step motor resonance
   issues. Additionally, the microstepping drive increases positional
   resolution (especially if mated to step motors produced for
   microstepping applications); achieves final positioning with less
   ringing and overshoot; and attains these outcomes with shorter elapsed
   times for the movements.
   This combination of a parallel-to-serial CMOS control IC with multi-chip
   module provides both digital and analog control of phase current ratios
   (8 logic levels of control plus linear regulation), and can continuously
   supply 1.2 A to both motor phase windings. This 1.2 A output rating
   equates to its maximum limitation (i.e. 100\% in the ratio table), and
   46 V is the motor supply restriction.
   PWM control is realized via separate 3-bit D/A converters, and further,
   linear regulation of the output current is achieved by varying the
   voltage level applied to each of two individual reference inputs. The
   CMOS controller IC accepts inputs from a microcontroller (or mu P) and
   performs the parallel-to-serial conversion which provides the required
   serial data format for interfacing to the power multi-chip module. Five
   distinctive modes of motor control and operation are supported.}},

Abstract = {{The development of an advanced instrument for real-time radiometric
   imaging of high-speed events is described. The Intensified
   Digitally-Controlled Gated (IDG) camera is a microprocessor-controlled
   instrument based on an intensified CCD that is specifically designed to
   provide radiometric optical data. The IDG supports a variety of
   camera-synchronous and camera-asynchronous imaging tasks in both passive
   imaging and active laser range-gated applications. It features both
   automatic and manual modes of operation, digital precision and
   repeatability, and ease of use,
   The IDG produces radiometric imagery by digitally controlling the
   instrument's optical gain and exposure duration, and by encoding and
   annotating the parameters necessary for radiometric analysis onto the
   resultant video signal. Additional inputs, such as date, time, GPS,
   IRIG-B timing, and other data can also be encoded and annotated. The IDG
   optical sensitivity can be readily calibrated, with calibration data
   tables stored in the camera's nonvolatile flash memory. The
   microprocessor then uses this data to provide a linear, calibrated
   output.
   The IDG possesses both synchronous and asynchronous imaging modes in
   order to allow internal or external control of exposure, timing, and
   direct interface to external equipment such as event triggers and frame
   grabbers. Support for laser range-gating is implemented by providing
   precise asynchronous CCD operation and nanosecond resolution of the
   intensifier photocathode gate duration and timing. Innovative methods
   used to control the CCD for asynchronous image capture, as well as other
   sensor and system considerations relevant to high-speed imaging are
   discussed in this paper.}},

   opportunities for new and established competitors. All network sectors
   are searching for methods to increase performance, reliability and
   functional density while cost reducing the manufacturing process.
   Achieving this goal requires innovation in system architecture and
   software, semiconductors, optoelectronics and interconnect technologies.
   This paper focuses on the link between future network trends and the
   semiconductor packaging technology needed to serve the future telecom
   industry.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on innovative in-field data capture techniques that
   have solved real problems facing utilities, These techniques have been
   developed and refined by way of experience gained in a number of large

   face numerous challenges, including scope, methodology, cost and quality
   control. These challenges are discussed, along with options available
   which conform to a number of practical and user-defined principles,
   Global positioning systems (GPS), geo-referenced imagery and data entry
   are discussed, as they pertain to in-field capture, with an emphasis on
   using this technology in different and innovative ways. The paper uses a
   case study to expand on the principles and options discussed. The
   project cited is the largest data capture project undertaken in New
   Zealand and involves positioning and attribute capture of over 100,000
   power poles, This project has been especially challenging because of
   factors such as difficult and remote terrain, tight budgetary
   constraints and very challenging timelines. Data capture for this
   particular project is discussed, covering methodology, digital
   topographic landbase use, digital geo-referenced imagery capture and
   quality control procedures.}},

   information services for many years. References of publications,

Abstract = {{The conventional approach to military vetronics design uses military
   components which typically lag their commercial counterparts by a couple
   of years and are generally limited in functional integration. A new
   paradigm is now emerging in the US military to leverage the commercial
   technology investment and technical innovations in PC based hardware and
   software developments. This paradigm has instigated major semiconductor
   vendors such as Motorola and Intel to exit the military market and
   henceforth accentuate the need to be innovative in repackaging
   commercial components to operate over extended temperatures.
   The concept presented in this paper consists of a militarized Pentium
   based general purpose Single Board Computer (SEC) using commercial
   components. This design incorporates an open architecture (PCI high
   speed bus, VMEbus) and expansion through the IEEE P1386.1(1) PCI
   Mezzanine Card (PMC) connector for peripherals such as Multimedia,
   Discrete I/O, MIL-STD-1553B(2), Global Positioning Satellite System
   (GPS), etc. These features will contribute to the realization of the
   `'Tactical Internet'' which is an integral part of the US army digitized

   a general presentation of ANVAR;
   ANVAR's example as regards needs for information and ways and means to
   obtain and exploit it;
   the needs of `'Small and Medium Enterprises'' (SMEs) and French public
   action to enable SMEs to benefit from better information.
   In this framework, I shall endeavour to derive some lessons from
   experience (for example. despite their success in some fields, like
   scientific research, international databases have drawbacks as regards
   their practical use for many innovative agents and particularly SMEs;
   specific internal tools, such as `'electronic document management'', can
   be very useful, even for small and medium companies and institutions;
   every aspect of an `'information system'' must be studied and all
   aspects must be coherent; an `'information system'' may have a great
   impact on the organization principles of the institution that implements
   it; an adequate mix of human and material means has to be defined; an
   important role is played by various services (such as `'videotex''
   services) and telecommunications infrastructures (such as the ordinary
   telecommunications network, the `'Integrated Services Digital Network''
   or the emerging `'information superhighways'' and `'teleports''); public
   authorities can make efforts to facilitate the recourse to information
   by creating, for instance, specialized institutions that constitute a
   link between SMEs and national or international information sources;
   financial support can be provided for innovative companies needing
   information; the role of private specialized consultants must be
   enhanced, etc.).}},

   Managing new projects in a traditional, well-established commercial

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new technique in identifying classes in Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) sea ice imagery using correlated texture. First, we
   employ dynamic local thresholding to generate a histogram of thresholds.
   Then, we use a multi-resolution peak-detection method, a strategy used
   in digital image quantization field, to extract significant intensity
   thresholds from the histogram and provide an initial segmentation. Next,
   we compute correlated texture of the result and create a matrix of
   spatial, probabilistic relationships among the classes. Given the
   texture, we cluster the classes into different groups. The clustering
   concept is based on an innovative `solidification' model that strives to
   obtain similar auto-correlated textural values for all groups. This
   process produces a second segmentation with the correct number of
   classes. We have tested out technique in more than 200 SAR sea ice
   imagery successfully. The entire process is fully automated and fast.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative fuzzy-based adaptive approach to the
   metering of power and RMS voltage and current employing the genetic
   algorithm. The fuzzy-based adaptive metering engine adjusts the number
   of points per cycle to be processed and the location of these points
   based on the optimal fuzzy rules constructed by the genetic algorithm to
   satisfy overall metering error criteria under different operating
   environment while minimizing the number of points actually employed in
   the metering computation. This results in a reduction in the metering
   computation effort which frees up the processor for other tasks such as
   communication or power quality measurements. The fuzzy-based adaptive
   metering algorithm has been implemented on a microcontroller-based power
   metering system which operates under a multi-tasking operating system
   which exploits the efficiencies achieved by the reduced metering rate.
   The fuzzy-based adaptive metering algorithm has been tested with a
   variety of actual and synthesized power system waveforms and the
   experimental evaluations have demonstrated excellent accuracy in the
   metered power system quantities.}},

Abstract = {{The dissipation factor (tg delta) measurement of electrical power
   generator insulated bars allows to monitor the quality of the production
   process. In case of anomalous tg delta values detection a problem
   arises: fast and reliable procedures to identify the defects and the
   `'causes of non-conformity'' are needed to drive a prompt correcting
   action on the production line. This work presents an innovative
   measuring procedure to solve such problems: the localisation sources of
   partial discharges (PD) by means of the simultaneous detection (through
   an electric method) of the PD signals and of the related sound waves
   (through an acoustic method). While a `'new'' acoustic measuring method
   employing two ultrasonic sensors was devised, a classic PD digital
   detection was adopted. The delay time between the two signals was the
   base to measure, under given sensitivity conditions and through a
   zeroing technique, the location of PD sites (defects), with an error of
   2-3 cm on 2400x18x54 mm insulated bars. The longitudinal and the
   transversal velocities of the sound waves for each defect in each tested
   bar. Such a measuring procedure was then successfully validated testing
   three insulated bars (one of them contained an artificial void).}},

Abstract = {{A benchmark structural testing facility has been established at the NASA
   Lewis Research Center (NASA/LeRC). The primary function of this facility
   is to verify structural analysis methods under prototypical loading
   conditions. Further, the facility allows the structural integrity of
   advanced monolithic and composite materials to be evaluated in
   subelement form. The intent is to bridge the gap that frequently exists
   between coupon level response and full-scale component response by
   conducting tests on subscale structures that have relatively simple
   geometries (that is, plates, beams, etc.). Unlike actual components,
   these subelement structures can be mechanically loaded and heated in a
   controlled and precise manner leading to reliable data. As a first step
   in this research, two in-plane biaxial plate test systems were recently
   installed at NASA/LeRC. This paper describes one of these test systems
   that consists of a 500-kN load frame with four hydraulic actuators, a
   state-of-the-art digital controller and innovative control software, an
   advanced quartz lamp radiant furnace, a large environmental chamber, and
   an automated in-situ crack measurement system.}},

   Programme is making extensive use of multimedia and broadband ATM access
   technologies to deploy new advanced telemedicine applications for small
   health care customers in the field of medical imaging. This paper
   presents the different stages followed in the project to define and
   develop the interactive, fully integrated advanced services and
   high-usability BONAPARTE telemedicine applications: 1) the user
   requirements analysis of user needs; 2) the enhancement and further
   development of an existing Telemedicine ATM Multimedia Platform,
   developed by the authors' research team in previous research projects;
   3), the BONAPARTE telemedicine terminal, comprising the platform and the
   specific telemedicine applications specified in the project, and a
   presentation of the applications user interfaces is also shown; and
   finally 4) the continuous usability design and evaluation methodology is
   briefly presented here in, to assure the final fulfilment of the users'
   needs by these innovative broadband applications and services. The
   generic hardware/software platform comprises a set of telemedicine
   services that have been structured to develop the required highly
   interactive and integrated telemedicine applications. These services
   are: syncronous cooperative work, high-quality videconference,
   multimedia mail, medical image digitizing, processsing, storing and
   printing, and local and remote transparent database access. The medical
   information handled by the platform conforms to the DICOM 3.0 (ACR-NEMA)
   and MEDICOM (CEN) standards. The BONAPARTE telemedicine applications
   provide the functions required to support four generic scenarios: 1)
   teleconsultation/teleradiology; 2) real-time medical imaging cooperative
   diagnosis between two geographically separated physicians; 3)
   telepresence in a clinical session; and 4) remote access to long-archive

Abstract = {{In the final scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark, a crate containing the
   object of Indiana Jones' quest is wheeled into an immense warehouse for
   indefinite storage and questionable research access. Unfortunately, this
   fate is not all that far from reality. Collections of archaeological and
   ethnographic materials ranging from stone axes, broken potsherds, and
   carved monuments to baskets, ceremonial masks, and skin canoes have been
   held by museums collections since the Renaissance. However, their
   inestimable value and unique conservation and curatorial requirements
   often conspire to remove them from the reach of all but the most
   diligent scholars. The potential of the Web to enhance the quality of
   research on archaeological and ethnographic collections is enormous.
   This paper will examine ways that one can. use the Web to enhance
   research and improve access to a variety of materials; while there are
   many other resources for archaeology available on the Web, this paper
   focuses on museum-related sites. It will also explore the potential of
   the Web for innovative research strategies. Digitization of catalogs,
   associated documents, and images to help a researcher locate and study
   collections and specific artifacts are just one approach. Others include
   the connection of devices to the Web (for example, cameras and
   microscopes), the creation of virtual reference collections, and the
   establishment of research networks to enhance the identification and
   analysis of material culture. This paper will also consider the role the
   Web could play in issues of cultural property, contributing to and in
   many ways intensifying ongoing debates of ownership, curation,
   conservation, and repatriation of sensitive materials.}},

Abstract = {{A crystal oscillator is described that uses various unusual techniques
   to achieve double-oven class temperature stability with a single oven.
   Stability of better than 1 part in 10(11) over a temperature range of
   -40 degrees to +85 degrees C has been demonstrated. The use of the
   single stage oven allows for a form factor with a relatively low height
   (19 mm. or 3/4 inch) for an oscillator of this performance class. The
   low profile facilitates card-based designs. In timekeeping applications
   such as wireless and telecom synchronization, the temperature
   coefficient of frequency (tempco) is more important than ever. The
   temperature extremes involved in wireless base stations increase the
   error due to temperature while the use of GPS timing receivers to
   discipline quartz oscillators greatly reduces the error due to aging,
   leaving tempco as the major component. Numerous design innovations are
   described such as a hermetic oven mass assembly and a non-ovenized
   digital temperature controller. This controller permits automated
   optimization of the oven set point and thermal gain. An overview of a
   novel zero-gradient oven technique used to achieve the double-oven
   performance is given, with more details in a related paper. Frequency
   pulling due to the oscillator circuit components is greatly reduced by a
   novel balanced-bridge controlled oscillator circuit that is described
   briefly here and in more detail in another related paper.}},

Abstract = {{Challenging issues for processing queries specified over large-scale
   information spaces (e.g., Digital Libraries or the World Wide Web)
   include the diversity of the Information Sources (ISs) in terms of their
   structures, query interfaces, as well as the dynamics of ISs
   continuously being added, removed or upgraded. Typically user queries
   are loosely-specified expressing what the user wants but not how and
   from where the information is to be retrieved. In this paper we give an
   innovative solution for semantical query planning in such environments.
   The key idea underlying our solution is the notion of connected query
   rules defined to be precisely specified, executable queries that are
   semantically equivalent to a user query. For query planning in such a
   large-scale space, we introduce DIIM - the Dynamic Information
   Integration Model which supports the description of not only content but
   also capabilities of ISs, e.g., query templates of and
   interrelationships between ISs. This then lays the foundation for the
   translation algorithm that based on the connected query rule principle
   maps a loosely-specified query into the set of semantically equivalent
   queries.}},

Abstract = {{The successful design of computational systems is often predicated on
   the realization of fast multiplication in digital or analog hardware. A
   key design issue is the tradeoff between speed, complexity, and chip
   area. With this in mind, an innovative fast neural network-based digital
   multiplier has been designed, trained, and implemented in VLSI using 1
   micron double polysilicon CMOS technology. The design is constructed of
   modules consisting of three basic neural network components: a 2x2
   adder, a 2x2 multiplier, and a 3x2 -bit adder. The modular approach
   allows scalability of the multiplier circuit. The neural network
   circuitry is based on neuMOS transistors. A neuMOS transistor is a metal
   oxide semiconductor device with several fixed gates(inputs) and a
   floating gate. The capacitances between the fixed gates and the floating
   gate constitute the neural network weights.
   A comparison of speed in terms of gate delays and neuron delays, shows
   that the neural network-based multiplier was 2 to 3 orders of
   magnititude faster than the Wallace Tree and ROM-based digital
   multipliers.}},

   Methods: Our existing software for medical image processing and 3D
   reconstruction was extended to provide images, film sequences, and
   complex 3D models in an Internet-compatible data format.
   Results: The multimedia results of the image processing were integrated
   into Internet documents. Specialized programs are no longer necessary
   for visualization. The Internet software allows for user-friendly
   handling and interactive presentation of the 2D and 3D data.
   Conclusions: The Internet offers public-domain software for display of

Abstract = {{MeDoc is a German digital library project bringing together 7 developing
   institutions and 24 pilot user institutions as well as 12 international
   publishing houses. MeDoc provides uniform access to a variety of
   information sources and an information broker service. MeDoc offers a
   range of billable digital books and journals contributed by the
   participating publishing houses.
   Operating a digital library has not only many technical but also
   important economical aspects. The contents of a digital library can be
   regarded as information merchandise just like paper books or journals
   bought in a book store. In order to encourage publishing houses to
   contribute their books and journals to digital libraries, suitable
   business models must be defined. New innovative cost models, like
   floating licenses or fine grained pay per view, become both necessary
   and feasible in network based digital libraries.
   This paper introduces the MeDoc business model and discusses various
   cost models and their applicability to the services of a digital
   library. It gives an overview of the MeDoc license and pricing policy
   and the applied cost models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a compression chain for digital images is described that
   achieves high compression ratios and stable quality over long periods
   without the need of frequent generation of reference frames. The
   compression algorithm described thus proposes an innovative solution to
   the transmission of these refresh information which are usual causes of
   bit rate peaks and/or decoding delays if smoothing is applied to these
   peaks. Experimental results show that for at least 100 frames, the
   quality is constant enough not to request any generation of intra-coded
   frames. The technique is quite general as it doesn't make any assumption
   on the image type, nonetheless, best results are obtained for sequences
   with medium-to-low motion such as those encountered in video phone and
   video conference applications or remote surveillance systems.}},

Abstract = {{Observation and interaction are fundamental aspects of empirical
   scientific research. While individual requirements for observation and
   interaction vary across disciplines, there are important common
   elements. These `'common elements'' are the basis of the \$15 billion
   dollar laboratory automation industry. The United States presently leads
   the world in this industry, providing products for sample manipulation,
   sensing (e.g. microscopic and macroscopic imaging devices), data
   analysis (e.g. image processing, 3D modeling, exploratory data
   analysis), and human-computer interfaces (e.g. computer graphics,
   visualization).
   This paper outlines the preliminary design of a unique and innovative
   system for conducting experiments at a distance, the `'Remote
   Scientist''. The Remote Scientist extends laboratory automation
   capability to the microgravity environment. While the Remote Scientist
   conceptually encompasses a broad spectrum of elements and
   functionalities, the development approach taken is to:
   establish a baseline capability that is both flexible and versatile
   incrementally augment the baseline with additional functionalities over
   time.
   The baseline capability that we have identified as having the most
   significant impact across multiple research disciplines is the ability
   to observe on-going experiments during exposure to the microgravity
   environment. This capability is achievable with technology available
   today and, additionally, will be able to take advantage of the rapid
   advances in the underlying technologies that are taking place in the
   commercial sector.
   The Remote Scientist will support a wide range of experiments through
   customizable components for: data collection (observation and
   measurement) manipulation (automated and semi-automated experiment
   control) investigator interaction (communication between experiment and
   researcher independent of location)
   By designing for multiple levels of automation, from fully automatic
   action through remote control and telemanipulation, investigator
   interaction can be incorporated into experiments at any desired level.
   The Remote Scientist is designed to offer a full range of digital
   imaging on both microscopic and macroscopic scales. The system will
   support spatial and spectral analysis for on-board extraction of
   important features, thus reducing bandwidth requirements for
   communications to ground-based investigators. Confocal imaging (optical
   sectioning), hyperspectral imaging, interferometry, laser scattering,
   and fluorescence can also be considered as value-added instrumentation
   within the proposed framework without significant redesign.
   The system is designed to operate within the constraints of a
   microgravity environment while offering innovative functionality to
   enhance ground-based experiments as well. The Remote Scientist is
   initially focused on applications currently being pursued in
   microgravity such as tissue culture, protein crystal growth and zeolite
   crystal growth. The real-world requirements of these biomedical and
   materials applications provide important insight in establishing
   design-criteria for the system. However, the longer-term applications
   are envisioned to be much broader.}},

Abstract = {{A vision-driven automatic digitisation process for free-form surface
   reconstruction has been developed, with a coordinate measurement machine
   (CMM) equipped with a touch-triggered probe and a CCD camera, in reverse
   engineering physical models. The process integrates 3D stereo detection,
   data filtering, Delaunay Triangulation, adaptive surface digitisation
   into a single process of surface reconstruction. By using this
   innovative approach, surface reconstruction can be implemented
   automatically and accurately. Least-squares B-spline surface models with
   the controlled accuracy of digitisation can be generated for further
   application in product design and manufacturing processes. One
   industrial application indicates that this approach is feasible, and the
   processing time required in reverse engineering process can be
   significantly reduced up to more than 85\%.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main problems facing users of high speed imagers is the
   difficulty of storing the large volume of generated data. Silicon
   Mountain Design (SMD) has designed a 1000 frame per second digital
   camera, the Mach-1, which alleviates this problem by storing 1000 frames
   in its on board memory. SMD's software then allows the user to view the
   data set, or a subset and save the desired information to the storage
   media of choice. The unique design and interline transfer architecture
   of SMD's imager gives this camera high sensitivity, excellent red
   response, and eliminates the image smearing common in other high speed
   cameras. The Mach-1's output has 10 bits of dynamic range and uses
   innovative electronics to achieve less than 1 bit of RMS noise, all
   without the need for active cooling. The frame rate is adjustable from
   1000 FPS down to 62.5 FPS by factors of 2 and electronic shuttering is
   offered down to 10 microseconds. Electronic shuttering results in crisp
   images of rapidly moving objects without the need for inefficient LCD
   shutters. The Mach-1 also has the capability of synchronizing multiple
   cameras which allows for stereo imaging and other multiple viewpoint
   applications. The Mach-1 has been used to enhance the performance of
   weapons delivery systems and also for 3 dimensional medical imaging. A
   brief technical overview of the camera and its performance are presented
   in this paper.}},

Title = {{Intellectual property rights in data?}},
Journal = {{VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-\&}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Authors trace the evolution of hybrid intellectual property rights
   protecting the contents of noncopyrightable databases from early
   European Commission proposals sounding in unfair competition law to the
   strong and potentially perpetual exclusive property right embodied in
   the final E.C. Directive on Databases adopted in March 1996. Also
   examined are parallel legislative proposals pending before Congress and
   the draft international treaty on the legal protection of databases to
   be considered at a Diplomatic Conference hosted by the World
   Intellectual Property Organization in December 1996.
   The Authors endorse the need to provide some ancillary legal relief for
   investors in the generation and distribution of digitized data over
   telecommunications networks, lest free-riders appropriate the fruits of
   these investments. They deplore, however, the creation of strong legal
   barriers to entry in a field of endeavor already characterized by a
   pronounced lack of competition and by the preponderance of sole-source
   database providers. They show that, under both the existing and proposed
   sui generis regimes, most commercially valuable compilations of data
   will never enter the public domain, despite the `'Limited Times'' Clause
   of the U.S. Constitution; that the dependence of the scientific and
   educational communities on plentiful and affordable supplies of data has
   been virtually ignored, despite the constitutional mandate `'to promote
   the progress of science and {[}the] useful arts;'' and that the very
   existence of value-adding use industries in this sector would be
   jeopardized, notwithstanding the Supreme Court's procompetitive mandate
   in Foist and Bonito Boats. For these and other reasons, the proposed
   regimes to protect investments in databases-though requiring no creative
   achievement as a precondition of eligibility-have paradoxically applied
   one of the strongest and most anti-competitive intellectual property
   rights ever conceived to the elementary particles and building blocks of
   knowledge.
   The Authors re-examine the economic and legal justifications for
   providing investors in information goods with a measure of artificial
   lead time that would enable them to recuperate their investments and
   turn a! profit in a digitized environment. They conclude that a weak
   intellectual property right-consistent with first amendment values and
   with other constitutional constraints-could overcome the risk of market
   failure without creating legal barriers to entry. To this end, they
   propose two alternative models, one based on simple unfair competition
   principles, and the other on a more refined set of default liability
   principles. Either model could increase the level of investment in the
   production and distribution of databases, while stimulating, rather than
   discouraging, the formation of more competitive market segments. The
   Article ends with a detailed analysis of the exceptions and other
   measures favoring science and education that will become indispensable
   under any sui generis regime protecting the contents of databases if the
   United States is not to jeopardize it pre-eminent role in basic science
   and the downstream technological innovation to which it gives rise.}},

Abstract = {{The rapidly escalating DMS diminishing Manufacturing Sources) problem
   for digital electronic components is seriously impacting the ability of
   avionics equipment suppliers to provide affordable equipment to new
   aircraft. Sustainment of this equipment in the field is a major cost
   driver irt the O\&S (Operation \& Support) cost equation due to the same
   problem. The development of (FI)-I-3 (Form-Fit-Function-lnterface)
   printed circuit assembly (PCA) level replacements for obsolete digital
   electronics provides the opportunity to solve both of these problems at
   minimum cost. The Wright Laboratories sponsored VDELE (VHDL Design
   Environment for Legacy Electronics) project has developed innovative
   methodologies for the development of (FI)-I-3 `'clones'' for PCAs that
   have became obsolete due to DMS problems. The VDELE process extracts
   VHDL model and test vector information from the customer digital depot
   database and then applies commercially available tools to refine and
   validate the model in a virtual development environment, The refined
   VHDL simulation model is then provided to a qualified supplier in the
   form of a technology independent executable specification for synthesis
   into a `'clone'' PCA replacement. We present a brief description of the
   VDELE process and the application of the VDELE methodologies to the
   development of a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based (FI)-I-3
   prototype for an F-16 PCA seriously impacted by the DMS problem.}},

Abstract = {{A low power consumption 16-bit fixed point Digital Signal Processor
   (DSP) has been developed to realize a half-rate CODEC for the Personal
   Digital Cellular (PDC) system. Dual datapath architecture has been
   employed to execute multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations with a high
   degree of efficiency. With this architecture, 86.3\% of total MAC
   operations in the Pitch Synchronous Innovation Code Excited Linear
   Prediction (PSI-CELP) program are executed in parallel, so that total
   instruction cycles are reduced by 23.1\%. The area overhead for the dual
   datapath architecture is only 3.0\% of the total area. Furthermore, in
   order to reduce power consumption, circuit design techniques are also
   extensively applied to RAMs, ROMs, and crock circuits, which consume the
   great majority of power. By reducing the number of precharging bit
   lines, a power reduction of 49.8\% is achieved in RAMs, and above 40\%
   in ROMs. By applying gated clock to clock lines, a power reduction of
   5.0\% is achieved in the DSP that performs the PSI-CELP algorithm. The
   DSP is fabricated in 0.5 mu m single-poly, double-metal CMOS technology.
   The PSI-CELP algorithm for the PDC half-rate CODEC can operate at 22.5
   MHz instruction frequency and 1.6 V supply voltage, resulting in a
   low-power consumption of 28 mW.}},

   Unfortunately, legal limits, not technological ones, have hindered the

   revisions have been made or have been proposed that will further hinder
   libraries and their technological efforts. Cooperative efforts between

Abstract = {{The paper describes the general characteristics of a newly developed
   nonconstant-flow generator for automatic ventilation of the lungs, It is
   known that the application of very high pressure to high internal
   resistance leads to a very stable flow; in that the flow itself is
   unaffected by external load (patient) variations. The stability of the
   how means that the inspiratory process can be controlled by means of the
   ventilated volume, thus extending DIGIT utilization to high resistance
   patients, The modulation of the flow is implemented via a digital
   electromechanical system, which allows the ventilator functions to be
   accurately programmed, The desired how waveform is obtained by means of
   a series of pneumatic valves, the apertures of which are digitally
   controlled. The design is innovative in that it allows the flow waveform
   in each of the ten digitalized time steps into which each inspiratory
   phase is divided to be both programmed and controlled. Other ventilators
   commercially available and currently in use do not have this functional
   capability, as they are all designed to model the integral flow of the
   inspiratory waveform without being able to modify the subunit time steps
   of a single inspiratory phase. The paper also discusses the results of
   fundamental tests concerning the performance characteristics of the
   ventilator.}},

Abstract = {{Error performance of maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) of
   digital signals transmitted over Rayleigh fading channels is studied in
   this paper, The application of the innovations approach provides us not
   only with a general MLSE receiver structure, but also with a tool for
   analyzing the performance of the receiver. We show that the sequence
   pairwise error probability of the MLSE receiver is determined by the
   eigenvalues of a matrix generated from the autocorrelation function of
   the received signal, For any practical applications, the MLSE for
   Rayleigh fading channels exhibits an irreducible error door that depends
   on the channel characteristics such as the Doppler frequency bandwidth
   and frequency selectivity, An upper bound on bit error probability can
   be calculated by using the sequence pairwise error probability. Also, it
   is shown that diversity reception can significantly improve the MLSE
   error performance.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in computer technology continue to bring new innovations to
   departments of anatomic pathology. This article briefly reviews the
   present status of digital optical imaging, and explores the directions
   that this technology may lead over the next several years.
   Technical requirements for digital microscopic and gross imaging, and
   the available options for image archival and retrieval are summarized.
   The advantages of digital images over conventional photography in the
   conference room, and the usefulness of digital imaging in the frozen
   section suite and gross room, as an adjunct to surgical signout and as a
   resource for training and education, are discussed. An approach to the
   future construction of digital histologic sections and the computer as
   microscope is described. The digital technologic applications that are
   now available as components of the surgical pathologist's workstation
   are enumerated. These include laboratory information systems,
   computerized voice recognition, and on-line or CD-based literature
   searching, texts and atlases and, in some departments, on-line image
   databases. The authors suggest that, in addition to these resources that
   are already available, tomorrow's surgical pathology workstation will
   include network-linked digital histologic databases, on-line software
   for image analysis and 3-D image enhancement, expert systems, and
   ultimately, advanced pattern recognition capabilities.
   In conclusion, the authors submit that digital optical imaging is likely
   to have a significant and positive impact on the future development of
   anatomic pathology.}},

Abstract = {{A controversial debate is going on about the steps necessary to ensure
   sustainable economic development in the Federal Republic of Germany. The
   Social Democratic Parry (SPD) demands a national environmental plan with
   binding data for the consumption of resources and land as well as for
   pollutant loads. However this would mean going the way of an economy
   managed by ecology. A decision along these lines would hardly be able to
   make Germany, as a location of industrial production, fit for the
   increasingly tougher international competition.
   The federal government assigns priority to a concept of small steps in
   climate protection. At the Environmental Summit in Berlin in the spring
   of 1995, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised a 25\% decrease of
   German carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between 1990 and 2005. By
   international comparison with initiatives for CO2 reduction this is an
   ambitious target On the one hand, it contains a binding quantitative
   promise where most countries avoid such verifiable statements; on the
   other hand the reduction rate promised is relatively high. Worldwide, a
   major success is seen in the possibility for the industrialized
   countries merely to stabilize their CO2 emissions.
   Even though considerable progress has been made in this country since
   the early nineties, the CO2 reduction level envisaged for political
   reasons remains threatened Compared to 1990 as the base line year, CO2
   emissions in the Federal Republic by the middle of this decade have been
   reduced by more than 130 million tons, i. e. 13\%. However, this
   decrease is due to the drastic decline in particularly CO2-intensive
   production processes in the new German federal states. In Eastern
   Germany, especially the use of lignite, with its relatively high carbon
   dioxide fractions, has been reduced.
   A number of aspects need to be taken into account. The reductions
   promised in voluntary agreements for cooperation between industry and
   the federal government are an important step in the right direction.
   Energy tares based on emissions should be introduced only on the basis
   of a calculable schedule, in small steps and, if possible, in an
   internationally harmonized approach in order to protect long-term
   investments. In this way, longer-term incentives could be offered in the
   interest of environmentally benign innovations and investments already
   at the stage of industrial planning.
   Should nuclear power, which produces no CO2 emissions, be abandoned on
   political grounds, the national costs of such a switch would be likely
   to reach amounts in the double or three-digit billions. The operation of
   German nuclear power plants at present allows some 150 million tons of
   CO2 to be avoided annually. If new reactors could be built in the future
   without ally political obstacles, additional CO2 savings potentials
   could be mobilized.}},

Abstract = {{The transport part of the information industry-information networks-is
   emerging as the critical infrastructure for commerce in the twenty-first
   century, similar to the role of ships and railroads in the 1800s and

   The realization of a next-generation information network will have
   far-reaching effects on the lifestyle and livelihoods of millions of

Abstract = {{The present debate concerning the National Information Infrastructure
   (NII) has focused primarily on competition. Although competition will be
   an important component of the NII, and one which we welcome, we argue
   that it is inappropriate to frame the debate entirely in terms of
   competition. Competition can be seen as a consequence of a fundamental
   development driving innovation within the information industries;
   namely, the adoption of the digital paradigm. However, digitization
   offers opportunities for innovation that go beyond competition. We
   hypothesize that the second wave of the digital revolution will be the
   virtualization of the infrastructure; that is, the adoption of a
   software perspective on information and on the devices and channels with
   which it is processed and distributed.
   In this paper, we offer a vision of what it would mean for the NII to be
   a Virtual Infrastructure (VI) that takes full advantage of the digital
   paradigm. We present a taxonomy for describing alternative
   infrastructure scenarios and show how the key properties of digital
   information favor a competitive, generic, and decoupled (CGD)
   infrastructure. We explore several technical issues, including
   information appliances and software; the mosaic of overlapping
   distribution networks; and the brokerage functions that match up
   suppliers, distributors, and customers. In our treatment of the
   technical issues, we identify heterogeneity as a key challenge facing
   computer scientists and offer suggestions for areas of investigation
   that might prove fruitful.
   We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications of this work.
   We are particularly concerned with policies that foster innovation by
   reducing barriers to the insertion of new technology. Topics addressed
   include decoupling the regulation of information services from the
   regulation of distribution, dealing with monopolies and vertical
   integration, and the publication of interface specifications.}},

Abstract = {{This pager develops a dynamic model of labor hoarding to explain two

   the dynamic correlations of sectoral productivity with aggregate
   variables. The model features convex costs of adjusting the labor force,
   which induce firms to vary the intensity of labor utilization over the
   cycle. In particular, cyclical variations in labor `effort' take place
   as a response to expected future changes in industry conditions. I test
   the restrictions imposed by the model for several two-digit
   manufacturing industries under different assumptions about market
   structure and returns to scale. Then, using the assumption that
   aggregate variables carry information about future changes in industry
   conditions, I simulate the model's dynamic response of hours and
   productivity to aggregate innovations and compare them to those

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of the digitally controlled acceleration schedule for
   the Pratt \& Whitney, Canada PT6B-36B turboshaft engine (as installed in
   the Sikorsky S-76B helicopter) has been significantly improved through
   the use of innovative improvements in flight test methodology. These
   innovations have allowed the test team to optimize the engine
   acceleration schedule in order to maximize the response capability of
   the engine while retaining adequate installed surge margin, These
   innovations included (1) the replacement of the production engine
   control microprocessor with a programmable unit which provided the
   capability for immediate, on-site adjustment of flight critical
   software, (2) in-flight adjustment of critical control path gains and
   schedules in order to facilitate design optimization, and (3) the use of
   dissimilar engine software in the twin FADEC channels to preserve
   aircraft safety during test operations. Test results indicated that an
   optimum balance between engine responsiveness and mandated surge margin
   had been achieved for all flight and engine operating conditions without
   resorting to costly engine re-design.}},

Abstract = {{Although Canadian Breast Screening Guidelines have been in place since
   1988, participation rates have been suboptimal. The study objective was
   to describe changes in breast screening knowledge, attitudes, and
   practices among women aged 50 to 69 years since initiation of a regional
   mass screening program in Ottawa-Carleton in 1991.
   A random-digit-dialling telephone survey was conducted with 384 women
   aged 50 to 69 years residing in Ottawa-Carleton and compared to a 1991
   survey.
   Between 1991 and 1994 there were significant increases in the percentage
   over having had a mammogram (from 60\% to 83\%) and monthly breast
   self-examination (from 46\% to 54\%). Professional breast examination
   rates were unchanged as were overall attitudes and concerns about
   screening. There were significant improvements in knowledge and
   encouragement to have a mammogram.
   As the focus on primary health care within our health care system grows,
   and as service delivery changes, we must continue to search for, and
   continually evaluate, innovative strategies to align practices with
   Canadian breast screening recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{Modern technology has resulted in significant innovations in Electronic
   Warfare. The Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuit (MMIC) program has
   resulted in Electronic Warfare RF receivers that are orders of magnitude
   smaller, lighter and cheaper than receivers produced only a few years
   ago. Computer processing technology is so small and fast that Electronic
   Warfare can digitize threat signals for identification precise enough
   that platforms can be identified by serial number in real-time.
   Analog-to-Digital Converters have improved in speed and quality to
   permit the realization of a broadband (Gigahertz) digital receiver that
   preserves a quality reproduction of signals that might otherwise be lost
   by an analog receiver. Broadband RF components continue to progress such
   that subsystems and systems progress by orders of magnitude.
   Interferometer antenna systems that previously yielded 1.0 to 1.5
   degrees direction of arrival accuracy over 2:1 RF range can be
   demonstrated now with 0.05 degrees accuracy over a 10:1 RF range.
   These and many other technologies permit the demonstration of Electronic
   Warfare capabilities that are finding their way into Electronic Warfare
   systems through engineering upgrades or entirely new systems. This paper
   is a synopsis of the above systems and their demonstrated performance.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{In flow cytometry, the typical use of front-end analog processing limits
   the pulse waveform features that can be measured to pulse integral,
   height, and width. Direct digitizing of the waveforms provides a means
   for the extraction of additional features, for example, pulse skewness
   and kurtosis, and Fourier properties. In this work, we have first
   demonstrated that the Fourier properties of the pulse can be employed
   usefully for discrimination between different types of cells that
   otherwise cannot be classified by using only time-domain features of the
   pulse. We then implemented and evaluated automatic procedures for cell
   classification based on neural networks. We established that neural
   networks could provide an efficient means of classification of cell
   types without the need for user interaction. The neural networks were
   also employed in an innovative manner for analysis of the digital flow
   cytometric data without feature extraction. The performance of the
   neural networks was compared with that of a more conventional means of
   classification, the K-means clustering algorithm. Neural networks can be
   realized in hardware, and this, in addition to their highly parallel
   architecture, makes them an important potential part of real-time
   analysis systems. These results are discussed in terms of the design of
   a real-time digital data acquisition system for flow cytometry. (C) 1996

Volume = {{98}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional measurement and characterization of facial surface
   anatomy are fundamental to the objective analysis of facial deformity.
   However, existing clinical tools are inadequate. Recent innovations in
   laser scanning technology provide a potentially useful technique for
   accurate three-dimensional documentation of the face. The purpose of
   this study is to evaluate the reliability of interactive anthropometric
   landmark localization based on digitized three-dimensional facial images
   and to identify sources of error associated with the technique.
   Three-dimensional surface data were acquired using a commercially
   available laser scanning device (Cyberware 3030RGB digitizer), and all
   subsequent anthropometric analyses were performed interactively on the
   computer monitor. Four experimental conditions were studied, with 10
   observations for each condition. A stable anthropomorphic model with
   prelabeled anatomic landmarks was scanned repeatedly under varying
   conditions of head inclination and position within the scanning gantry
   to determine the effect of these variables on the reliability of the
   technique. The scanning protocol was then repeated with the labels
   removed to evaluate the reliability of interactive localization of
   anthropometric landmarks on a digitized three-dimensional image.
   Optimal results were obtained dth the head positioned in the center of
   the scanning gantry and with the Frankfort plane elevated 10 degrees
   from the horizontal. Under these circumstances, all 22 labeled landmarks
   were visualized and the variance in landmark localization was less than
   0.6 mm in the x (horizontal), y (vertical), and z (depth) dimensions.
   Varying head position or inclination caused significant degradation of
   the digitized image.
   The variance of interactive landmark localization was analyzed in three
   dimensions. The reliability and the spatial orientation of variability
   were determined for each anthropometric paint. These findings have
   direct implications for the clinical adaptation of this diagnostic tool
   for quantitative evaluation of facial surface anatomy.}},

Abstract = {{The paper has applied a conventional framework of analysis of implicit
   markets to determine the characteristics of demand for housing
   attributes of quantity and quality in the urban areas of a large,
   low-income developing country like Pakistan. Income elasticities
   generally appear to be low, although somewhat higher for indicators of
   quality, Own-price elasticities are high while the cross-price effects
   with respect to different attribute prices reveal the high degree of
   substitutibility among these attributes, Methodological innovations in
   the paper include the use of a weighted factor score for the measurement
   of housing quality and incorporation of the effect of changes in
   non-housing prices on demand for housing attributes, Given the large

   methodology created at Digital during the Alpha AXP program, which
   involved more than 2,000 engineers across many disciplines. The author
   died just after the original article was published; it has since reached

   Each project event was used to propel, progress, and gain momentum.
   Digital delivered the Alpha AXP program on schedule with significant

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To expand the use of magnetoencephalography (MEG) functional
   mapping in the operating room as well as preoperatively, a method of
   integrating the MEG sensorimotor mapping information into a stereotactic
   database, using computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance imaging
   scans, and digital angiography, was developed. The combination of
   functional mapping and the stereotactic technique allows simultaneous
   viewing of the spatial relationship between the MEG-derived functional
   mapping, the radiological/structural anatomic characteristics, and the
   pathological abnormality.
   METHODS: MEG data were collected using a MAGNES II Biomagnetometer and
   were incorporated into the COMPASS frame-based and REGULUS frameless
   stereotactic systems. The transformation process, by calculating a
   translational vector and a rotation matrix, integrates functional and
   anatomic information that is then directly available intraoperatively in
   the stereotactic database. This procedure was employed in 10 patients
   undergoing computer-assisted stereotactic volumetric resections for
   lesions involving the sensorimotor cortex. The principles of
   coregistration and coordinate transformation are reviewed in the context
   of preoperative functional mapping. We introduce innovations to apply
   these techniques to intraoperative stereotactic systems.
   RESULTS: Tests of the accuracy of the intraoperative integration of
   functional information in patients and calibration phantoms indicated
   close agreement with earlier preoperative methods. The intraoperative
   availability of functional information was a significant aid to the
   surgeon because it provided more accurate information on the location of
   functional tissue than could be derived solely by radiological criteria.
   CONCLUSION: The real-time availability of functional mapping information
   in an interactive fashion can reduce surgical risk and minimize
   functional morbidity. Within the ever-expanding realm of functional
   mapping and image-guided neurosurgery, further progress and integration
   of these methods is critical for resection of lesions involving eloquent
   cortex.}},

Abstract = {{A hierarchical finite difference method to match analogous contours is
   presented. Our approach has been inspired by the method due to Duncan,
   who proposed a scheme for matching two contours based on the
   minimization of a quadratic fitting criterion. This criterion consists
   of a curvature dependent bending energy term and a smoothness term.
   Cohen improved this method by ensuring that the resulting displacement
   vectors actually map points belonging to the two contours. Building on
   this method, the innovation of our work is in the introduction of a
   number of modifications and extensions, which promise to considerably
   improve its already proven performance. First, a new smoothness term in
   the matching cost function has been derived, supported by a revealing
   analysis of the discretization process. As a result, the computational
   complexity is reduced and the equation corresponding to the minimization
   of the fitting criterion has a simple interpretation. To solve the
   resulting nonlinear system of equations, a new method is derived based
   on a two-step predictor-corrector scheme, for which we present a
   detailed analytical convergence analysis. Unlike previous algorithms,
   which relied on (semi-) implicit problem formulations, this explicit
   scheme has a clear advantage in terms of convergence rate. Finally, the
   algorithm is extended with a new multi-smoothing scheme which not only
   increases the convergence speed, but even more importantly, makes the
   method more robust and less dependent on a good initialization value to
   guarantee convergence to a global optimum. Experimental validation is
   carried out on three medical applications: (i) Matching of left
   ventricular contours in successive images of a time sequence of spin
   echo cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images; (ii) matching of brain
   object contours in consecutive slices of a digital brain atlas; (iii)
   matching of brain object contours in segmented MR images to the outlines
   of the corresponding brain objects in a digital anatomical atlas.}},

Abstract = {{Using floating gate MOSFET's, we have designed a 2 x 2 analog memory,
   which is expandable to any size array. The reduced programming voltage
   due to the innovative floating gate MOSFET's enables us to construct the
   analog memory with a standard double poly n-well process. In addition, a
   novel programming algorithm is presented, This method will contribute
   not only to a reduced total programming time, but also to a prolonged
   lifetime of the memory. The high voltage program/erase poises are
   arranged to minimize the disturbance of nonselected cells. The
   resolution of a memory cell has been found to be 10 mV over a range of
   1.25 V to 2 V which is equivalent to the information content of 6
   digital cells.}},

   maximizing contrast resolution and dynamic range. The SYRMEP detector is
   a silicon microstrip device used in an innovative configuration in which
   radiation impinges on the side rather than on the surface of the chip
   and is therefore totally absorbed within the detector active volume. The
   high contrast resolution and spatial resolution (<100 microns) of the

   of Congress has become the largest library in the world. Its extensive
   and varied publishing programs reflect the growing demands of its many

   the institution's efforts, especially in the last decade, to reach
   broader and more general audiences. Recent projects include the first
   steps in digitizing and making available selected portions of the
   Library's historical collections; the first sustained effort to develop
   cooperative endeavors with trade publishers; and the launching of
   Civilization: The Magazine of the Library of Congress. This brief
   history outlines the evolution of publishing at the Library of Congress,

   discussed followed by the features of two head-worn instruments with

   The concept of `real' binaural interactive signal processing is
   described next. This strategy offers innovative possibilities to improve
   the communication abilities of hearing-impaired persons in noisy
   environments. This type of hearing instrument presently evaluated by
   research groups and hearing aid manufacturers will be introduced on the
   market in a couple of years. Digital processing in hearing instruments
   will open a new dimension in hearing aid technology provided the benefit
   for the hearing aid user can be increased significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Once hailed as the salvation of U.S. manufacturing competitiveness,
   concurrent engineering (CE) offers the potential for faster development
   of higher quality, more producible products. Unlike traditional, serial
   approaches to new product development (NPD), CE emphasizes
   cross-functional integration and concurrent development of a product and
   its associated processes.
   As Morgan L. Swink, J. Christopher Sandvig, and Vincent A. Mabert
   explain, however, CE is not a plug-and-play process. Successful CE
   implementation approaches differ depending on such factors as product
   characteristics, customer needs, and technology requirements. We can
   better understand those differences by examining CE implementation in
   the five NPD programs discussed here: the Boeing 777 aircraft, the heavy
   duty diesel engine at Cummins Engine Co., the thermoplastic olefin
   automotive coating at Red Spot Paint and Varnish Co., the airborne
   vehicle forward-looking infrared night vision system at Texas
   Instruments, and the digital satellite system at Thomson Consumer
   Electronics.
   Teams provide the primary integration mechanism in CE programs, and
   three types of teams appeared frequently in these projects: a program
   management team, a technical team, and numerous design-build teams.
   Depending on the project's complexity, an integration team may be needed
   to consolidate the efforts of various design-build teams. Task forces
   also may be formed to address specific problems, such as investigating
   an emerging technology.
   Some projects emphasized collocation and face-to-face communication.
   Others relied on phone conversations, documents, and electronic mail.
   Projects focusing on design quality relied on formal presentations and
   periodic review meetings. projects emphasizing development speed
   required frequent, informal communications. Programs addressing design
   quality required extended product definition and performance testing,
   with input from design engineering, marketing, and customers. Efforts to
   reduce development time involved small, informal teams led by design
   engineers and managers. Aggressive product cost goals necessitated
   intensive interaction between product designers and manufacturing
   personnel. Highly innovative products required early supplier
   involvement and joint engineering problem solving. Formal design reviews
   and shaved design data systems aided information shaving between
   internal and external design groups.}},

Pages = {{2083-2095}},

Abstract = {{Two continuous-wave (CW) focused CO2 Doppler lidars (9.1 and 10.6 mu m)
   were developed for airborne in situ aerosol backscatter measurements.
   The complex path of reliably calibrating these systems, with different
   signal processors, for accurate derivation of atmospheric backscatter
   coefficients is documented. Lidar calibration for absolute backscatter
   measurement for both lidars is based on range response over the lidar
   sample volume, not solely at focus. Both lidars were calibrated with a
   new technique using well-characterized aerosols as radiometric standard
   targets and related to conventional hard-target calibration. A digital
   signal processor (DSP), a surface acoustic wave spectrum analyzer, and
   manually tuned spectrum analyzer signal analyzers were used. The DSP
   signals were analyzed with an innovative method or correcting for
   systematic noise fluctuation; the noise statistics exhibit the
   chi-square distribution predicted by theory. System parametric studies
   and detailed calibration improved the accuracy of conversion from the
   measured signal-to-noise ratio to absolute backscatter. The minimum
   backscatter sensitivity is similar to 3 x 10(-12) m(-1) sr(-1) at 9.1 mu
   m and similar to 9 x 10(-12) m(-1) sr(-1) at 10.6 mu m. Sample
   measurements are shown for a flight over the remote Pacific Ocean in
   1990 as part of the NASA Global Backscatter Experiment (GLOBE) survey
   missions, the first time to our knowledge that 9.1-10.6-mu m lidar
   intercomparisons were made. Measurements at 9.1 mu m, a potential
   wavelength for space-based lidar remote-sensing applications, are to our
   knowledge the first based on the rare isotope C-12 O-18(2) gas. (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Software standards simplify communication and cooperation between
   applications provided by different software vendors. However, adherence
   to a rigid standard can stifle innovation. Open standards, which are not
   proprietary to any particular vendor, are particularly useful. Many
   standard-setting organizations have provided useful tools for laboratory
   informatics, including the American Society for Testing and Materials
   (ASTM), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, National
   Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, and the College of American
   Pathologists. Data communication standards, such as ASTM 1238, HL7, and
   Digital Image Communication of Medicine, have reduced the cost and
   improved the timeliness of interfaces. Nomenclatures, particularly the
   Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), have facilitated the
   structuring of medical information, and decision rules can be
   communicated with ASTM E1460. Laboratory Observation Identifier Names
   and Codes has eased the problem of identifying tests during interchange
   of laboratory data. Implementation standards are useful references for
   those deploying information systems. Standards have provided multiple
   benefits to laboratories and to the health care organizations of which

Abstract = {{Asphalt concrete is a composite material which consists of asphalt
   cement, voids, fine particles, sand, and coarse aggregates. Previous
   investigations of asphalt concrete mixtures have mainly concentrated on
   the macroscopic properties of the composite materials based on the
   assumption that the mixtures are homogeneous and isotropic. This paper
   applies an innovative digital image processing technique to quantify the
   orientations of coarse aggregate particles (greater than or equal to 2
   mm) in asphalt concrete mixtures such as hot mix asphalt, stone matrix
   asphalt, and large stone asphalt compacted in the laboratory or field.
   The results indicate quantitatively that asphalt concrete specimens
   compacted in the field or in the laboratory with gyratory compactor have
   an oriented structure of aggregate particle distribution where the major
   cross sections of aggregate particles have the tendency to lie
   horizontally, and that aggregate particles are more randomly oriented in
   the asphalt concrete specimens compacted in the laboratory with the
   Marshall compactor.}},

Abstract = {{SGML, or Standard Generalised Markup Language, is an international

   This article does not discuss the actual standard, but rather proposes a

   (Belgium) are discussed. VUBIS-Antwerpen has adopted SGML as a key
   standard for the exploitation of its bibliographical data (union
   catalogues, document ordering, online contents, current awareness,
   publishing on the World Wide Web). With the move towards electronic
   publication and distribution of documents, SGML tends to become a
   crucial standard for digital libraries. Projects such as TEI, ELSA,
   DECOMATE and ELVYN now focus on access to and delivery of full-text
   electronic documents, using SGML to manipulate, process and transform
   the document for the purposes of full-text searching or hypertext

Abstract = {{Digital commerce does not yet exist in a widely available, commercially
   viable form. Substantial amounts of innovation will be required to
   improve and customize existing technology and to create necessary new
   technologies of the digital marketplace. Recent months have witnessed
   the establishment of a broad array of new enterprises, joint ventures
   and business alliances aimed at preparing for a digital future. Driven
   by consumer demand, this trend will accelerate over the coming years.
   The author points out that a number of factors will be critical,
   however, in order for electronically harnessed information to become an
   established norm. For the software industry, the most important factor
   is strong protection of intellectual property rights. This is essential
   to the promotion and development of new applications and services. The
   author views the emergence of a digital marketplace as dependent on the
   combined advancements in technological safeguards and encryption
   techniques, and strong national and international legal safeguards for

Abstract = {{In this paper first it is summarized the architecture {[}1] {[}2] of a
   VLSI fuzzy processor that will be fabricated in 0.7 mu m digital CMOS
   technology at the ES2 foundry this September. This processor will be
   able to process a four 7-bit input data set every 320 ns. This rate
   increases up to 100 ns if only two inputs are processed. The innovative
   feature of this design is the independence of the processing rate from
   the fuzzy system. The fuzzy chip architecture is pipelined and each step
   takes 20 ns. We describe in this paper the fuzzification process: in our
   solution the Membership Functions (MFs) have a triangular shape,
   therefore there is a memory where are stored the related points
   necessary to define the shape. In one pipeline step the MF shape is
   generated and in the following step the grade of truth, alpha, is
   computed. In this paper we describe in details this circuits.}},

Abstract = {{The MARC project (Methodolgy of Art Reproduction in Colour), funded by
   the EC and involving eight European partners, had the aim to improve the
   quality of reproduction in art catalogues and books. Those who are
   familiar with the nature of the problem will be pleased to hear this,
   because the colour of reproductions often bears little resemblance to
   that of the original paintings. For the general public, as well as for
   the scholar, this has been an annoying, but nevertheless unavoidable
   characteristic of conventional photographic and printing techniques.
   With the advent of digital technology, came about the promise of
   revolutionary innovations which we regarded as a great challenge.
   Besides the numerous improvements and simplifications offered by digital
   techniques, we hope to be able to make use of the MARC digital image
   acquisition technology in order to replace the repeated photographing of
   paintings, thereby significantly reducing the burdon placed upon then
   Besides this, the digital image will be useful for many other purposes.
   As no camera was available with the resolution equivalent to a 24cm by
   18cm Ektachrome film, the format usually used for high quality
   reproduction of paintings, one of the tasks of the project was to
   develop an electronic camera with 20 000 x 20 000 pixels and a colour
   depth of 3 x 12 bits. In lack of Charge Coupled Device (CCD) sensors
   which come even close to such a high resolution, a novel imaging
   technology combining micro- and macro-scanning with a CCD area sensor
   was developed. To avoid revolving colour filters, this sensor is
   equipped with a colour mosaic mask with filter characteristics closely
   matched to a linear combination of the XYZ spectral response-curves
   defined by CIE 1931. The features of this camera are covered in great
   detail.
   The second step was to characterize the colorimetric response of the
   printing press. As the final result, a book `'Flamish Baroque Painting,
   Masterpieces of the Alte Pinakothek Munchen'', with over 50 paintings
   and digitally magnified details, was printed and will be shown at the
   conference.}},

   faculty member sir down and think about how they will reach a graduate
   course? Is mentorship from a senior faculty member desirable, especially

   to describe the approach used and possible solutions to these questions.}},

Abstract = {{Few conditions are absolutely necessary to improve the accuracy of
   quantitative measurements of displacements in an interferometer: the
   accurate calibration of the phase-shifter, the control and the
   suppression of the interferometers drift. Calibration consists in
   measuring phase shifts generated by piezoelectric transducers (PZT). We
   have developed an original in-line PZT calibration based on speckles
   intensity modulation. A new method to measure the phase drift versus
   time in the whole interferometer (reference and object arm) is presented
   Two innovative methods to compensate phase drift in real time allow
   accurate displacements measurements. Both compensation methods do not
   use a feedback loop active control during DSPI measurements. So it
   allows to avoid overshoot or oscillation problems linked to the feedback
   loop. All presented methods allow inexpensive data processing and were
   successfully applied to an out-of-plane sensitive interferometer. PZT
   calibration, drift measurements and real time compensation are
   automated.}},

   number of vulnerabilities in its design and the corresponding threats.
   We then present a set of proposed modifications to the protocol which
   minimize or eliminate the most significant threats. The innovation we
   introduce is the protection of the second-to-last information contained
   in the AS-PATH attributes by digital signatures, and the use of
   techniques developed for detecting loops in path-finding protocols to
   verify the selected route's path information. With these techniques we
   are able to secure full path information in near constant space, and
   avoid the recursive protection mechanisms previously assumed necessary.}},

Abstract = {{With reliable audio, video, and data transfers using the digital
   technologies such as ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), high
   technology applications such as: teleconferencing, tele-training,
   tele-medicine, tele-commuting, and tele-education etc. are becoming very
   popular.
   Also, innovations in the interactive audio, video, and data transfers
   have given rise to multitude of new applications such as Screen sharing,
   Multi media, and Distributed processing. In the industrial circles,
   already concurrent engineering is being practiced with different
   operations taking place at different locations, but integrated through
   appropriate communication networks. In addition to ISDN, INTERNET
   connectivity with proper sequencing of the packets can have a tremendous
   impact on the multi media transfers.
   At Florida International University Electrical \& Computer Engineering
   Laboratories, work has been in progress to define and develop a multi
   point and multi media teleconferencing scheme, which will blend itself
   to the other applications as mentioned above. Such a scheme is very
   cost-effective and expandable to several locations readily. In this
   article, the authors would describe the essentials of the multi point
   teleconferencing scheme and present results based on the actual case
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Shipboard watchslanders often provide the first source of machinery
   operability information as well as insight relating to overall
   assessment of the condition of the equipment space. They also provide
   critical knowledge in determining chains of events and reconstructing
   the occurrences leading to deteriorated machine performance. Intelligent
   ships of the future will have smaller crew sizes. This will result in
   unmanned spaces and increased unattended operation of machines.
   Recent advances in traditional and innovative sensors and commercial
   computer technology can enable on-line monitoring and diagnostic systems
   to perform additional functions relating to machinery room oversight and
   equipment space surveillance. Combining video cameras with Fourier
   imaging processing techniques can extend a shipboard monitoring system
   to provide rapid and automatic assessment of equipment spaces and
   machinery rooms scenes to efficiently detect changes. Once acquired and
   digitized, visual information processing is analogous to techniques for
   vibration information. In a similar way, microphones can be used to
   assess the acoustic signature of a machinery space. Pattern recognition
   techniques can help screen normal variations from abnormal. This paper
   summarizes several data acquisition and processing techniques that can
   be used to incorporate vision and acoustic monitoring into on-line
   machinery surveillance systems.}},

Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how digital signal
   processor (DSP) technology can be applied to servo motor control in
   order to generate closed-position-loop servo drives that can be applied
   in advanced manufacturing technology applications such as robotics, CNC
   and other machine positioning systems.
   Neither the DSP nov intelligent servo controls are new technologies in
   their own right. However, it is the combination of the two which has
   been innovatively applied at the Swinburne University of Technology
   (Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia) in order to generate a system which has
   considerable potential in terms of redesigning computer controlled
   production equipment through a distributed control architecture. The
   resulting technology has been entitled CIM-Drive and has been
   commercialised by the Softronics company in Australia.
   The critical factor in designing an intelligent servo system is the
   provision of a real-time focal area network that can be used for
   infer-servo communication and for supervisory control. A relatively
   simple networking scheme (entitled `'Softnet'') war developed during the
   course of the research and is documented herein. A number of newer,
   commercially available alternatives such ar the CAN-Bus, Field-Bus and
   LON bus are abo highlighted in this paper to show the current
   development path being pursued at the CIM Centre.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines data on the turnover of the five top ranked firms in
   54 three-digit manufacturing industries in the UK over the period
   1979-86. Two benchmarks are developed to help to decide whether observed
   turnover rates are `'high'' or `'low''. As it turns out, actual turnover
   rates are considerably lower than those generated by both of them,
   suggesting that market structures in the UK are relatively rigid. A
   model of firm growth rates is estimated to cast some light on why
   turnover rates are relatively low, and the results suggest that high
   advertising and innovation rates amongst top ranked firms help to
   preserve their place in the top five ranking, despite the fact that firm
   size displays a weak tendency to regress towards the mean.}},

Abstract = {{In a 1994 visit to the University of Utrecht Library, I was introduced
   to treasures which are the grist of classical studies-- such as the
   Utrecht Psalter and the Nuremberg Chronicle, rich collections of
   manuscripts and incunabula. It is the same sort of experience one may
   have at the Bodleian in Oxford or the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris.
   These irreplaceable antiquities serve to highlight the transition
   through which we are passing. At Utrecht they receive the care one would
   expect, and while they are treasured, they are part of a long tradition
   of providing information needed by scholars which goes back to the
   beginning of the 16th century in the Utrecht Library. To that extent
   they are taken for granted as part of a continuous accretion of
   information which collectively supports current scholarly activity. In a
   library which is at the same time digitizing 17th century masters and
   current scientific technical reports, there is a longer perspective on
   the management of information than those of us working in libraries with
   principally modern collections may have. What is striking, however, is
   that at Utrecht staff are grappling with precisely those problems we all
   are--how to maintain the information `'legacy'' of the past, build the
   infrastructure to support electronic information in the future, and
   serve current needs at the same time. The answers are not immediately
   obvious, but Natalia Grygierczyk presents the case for international
   dialog and benchmarking that may help find those answers, and the
   current thinking at Utrecht on the plan for a digital library.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative method of wave-absorbing control is presented for
   vibration suppression of flexible space structures. The method needs no
   digital computation process programmed under the control law that is
   usually necessary in realistic systems, A torque motor is used not only
   as an actuator but also a sensor that detects the angular velocity of
   the motor shaft, and the control loop is closed without digital
   computation, The control, approach is to treat the vibration as
   superposed wave modes traveling in positive and negative directions and
   to suppress the outgoing wave modes at the actuator position. The motor
   is connected to the electric circuit that has a frequency-dependent
   impedance and constitutes a compensator, The back electromotive force of
   the motor is generated by the rotation of the motor shaft and is put
   into the electric circuit to generate electric current, The torque of
   the motor that is generated by the current is adapted to the
   wave-absorbing controller, The performance of the present method is
   verified through both numerical simulation and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{ITALSAT is the Italian domestic communication satellite system designed
   to provide digital communication capacity over Italy.
   The first ITALSAT spacecraft (FI) was successfully launched in January
   `91. Its primary objective was the in orbit evaluation of the advanced
   technologies and the architecture suitable for a domestic digital
   communication system. The purpose of the second spacecraft (F2) is to
   make the communication system fully operational. The ITALSAT digital
   communication system for fixed services is based on an innovative
   Regenerative Multibeam payload and on a more conventional Transparent
   Payload. Both operate at Ka band (20/30 GHz). F1 has, also, a
   propagation package on-board which allows experiments at 20 GHz (mainly
   for correlation with the existing data) and at 40 and 50 GHz which are
   the next frequency bands still to be explored for future communication
   systems.
   F2 will be launched in the second quarter of `96. Its initial orbital
   position will be at 10.2 degrees East. F2 will be commissioned in this
   orbital position. When F1 will reach the end of its operational
   lifetime, expected by the end of `97, if inclined orbit control strategy
   will not be used, F2 will be moved to 13.2 degrees East to take over the
   Multibeam payload operations.
   In addition to the Regenerative Multibeam and the Transparent 20/30 GHz
   payloads, ITALSAT F2 includes on L-band payload for mobile
   communications developed by Alenia Spazio under a contract with the
   European Space Agency (ESA).
   The need for a regional European satellite service able to provide both
   voice and data services has been growing during the last few years and
   has been rapidly taken on a new dimension with the opening of the
   borders with Eastern Europe.
   In the late eighties and early nineties ESA conducted studies with the
   purpose of defining the architecture of mobile communications payloads
   to be embarked on geostationary satellites. At the same time initial
   development for the technology to be used was carried out, and potential
   host spacecraft for an eventual flight demonstration payload were
   identified. These activities resulted in the definition of the European
   Mobile Services (EMS) payload which, under an agreement between ESA and
   the Italian Space Agency (ASI), has been embarked on ITALSAT-F2
   This paper presents the ITALSAT program including a brief description of
   the two satellite systems, the Ka band communication system architecture
   and services. Special emphasis is given to the development and
   implementation of the EMS payload including the main technological
   challenges that have been met during the design phase of the project.
   EMS will be used to establish up to 500 voice and data communication
   links between Fixed Earth Stations (FES) and Mobile Earth Stations (MES)
   over Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa and Turkey. The link
   between FES and Satellite (Forward link) will be performed in Ku-band
   while the link between Satellite and MES will be performed at L-band
   frequencies.
   The paper provides a description of the main Mission parameters. A
   review of the requirements that ESA specified for the EMS Payload,
   including the frequency plan and the Service areas is given.
   A functional description of the payload architecture is presented
   together with the main tradeoffs that have lead to the specific design.
   The main aspects of the technology which warranted particular attention
   during the development phase of the system are addressed.}},

Abstract = {{MPEG4 is a natural extension of audiovisual coding, and yet from many
   perspectives breaks new ground as a standard. New coding techniques are
   being introduced, of course, but they will work on new data structures.
   The standard itself has a new architecture, and will use a new
   operational model when implemented on equipment that is likely to have
   innovative system architecture. The author introduces the background
   developments in technology and applications that are driving or enabling
   the standard, introduces the focus of MPEG4, and enumerates the new
   functionalities to be supported. Key applications in interactive TV and
   heterogeneous environments are discussed. The architecture of MPEG4 is
   described, followed by a discussion of the multiphase MPEG4
   communication scenarios, and issues of practical implementation of MPEG4
   terminals. The paper concludes with a description of the MPEG4 workplan.
   In summary, MPEG4 has two fundamental attributes. First, it is the
   coding of audiovisual objects, which may be natural or synthetic data in
   two or three dimensions. Second, the heart of MPEG4 is its syntax: the
   MPEG4 Syntactic Descriptive Language - MSDL.}},

Abstract = {{Modern power and digital mobile communication reworks require precise
   time for efficient operation. The Global Positioning System (GPS)
   provides a highly precise time reference and is becoming the preeminent
   time source for many applications. However, significant problems occur
   when GPS operation is attempted in a high Electro Magnetic Interference
   (EMI) environment that affects the reliability and performance of the
   GPS reference.
   NAVSYS Corporation has developed the TIDGET-T time reference which
   combines low cost commercial GPS technology with a robust and reliable
   architecture to provide precision timing performance in challenging,
   high EMI environments for a GPS signal.
   The innovative SmartClock algorithm implemented in this system is
   designed to optimally calibrate the reference clock error during periods
   when GPS satellites are in view, and maintain precise time when GPS is
   not available. This significantly improves the reliability and
   performance of the timing receiver.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines;he widely shared belief that a flexible system of
   transactions is faster in adapting to major technological change than an
   inflexible system. Borrowing some ideas from Elster (Ulysses and the
   sirens, 1979; Explaining technical change, 1983; Nuts and bolts for
   social sciences, 1989, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge), this
   paper contends that the flexible system may lead to a myopic selection
   of technology, because it delays the technological turning point if the
   important part of the technological evolution is generated by the
   aggregation of the choice patterns of firms. This paper investigates the
   case history of technological choice in the U.S. and Japanese digital
   watch industries in the 1970s. The paper's conclusions beg a
   reconsideration of current and previous thinking on industrial policy

Abstract = {{Digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen and transrectal
   sonography (TRS) are the main diagnostic tools for evaluating men at
   risk for carcinoma of the prostate (PCa). PCa has a hypoechoic echo
   pattern via TRS in 60-85\% of cases. Hypoechoic areas are observed,
   however, in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as well. For this reason,
   TRS yields a low specificity and sensitivity in detecting PCa in
   screening programs. Additional data, independent of the grey scale
   information available via TRS, can be obtained by using the innovative
   technology of color Doppler sonography. This imaging modality allows
   simultaneous real-time sonographic visualization and evaluation of
   vascular structures. The present study analyzes to what extent the
   analysis of blood flow perfusion of prostatic parenchyma can provide
   further information concerning the pathologic alterations occurring in
   abnormal prostate tissue. Blood flow phenomena were reproducibly
   demonstrated in the prostate and in the periprostatic tissue with the
   color-coded Doppler sonography (CD-TRS). 31 patients with the diagnosis
   of BPH could be separated into two different groups according to the
   findings with TRS and CD-TRS. In contrast, patients with histologically
   proven PCa (n = 16) had subjectively increased perfusion rates. Blood
   flow phenomena were analyzed using computer-calculated resistive index
   and pulsatility index as evaluations of flow and frequency. A
   preliminary analysis of the wave-form characteristics shows that flow in
   the prostate gland is associated with a high resistive index in both PCa
   and BPH. The mean frequency demonstrated in the pulsatility index
   appears to be high in PCa, but low in BPH cases. Further studies are
   needed to verify the described factors' abilities to differentiate
   prostate tissue as either PCa or BPH.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of radiological examination methods, technical
   innovations and creative and critical radiological research have
   dramatically changed the diagnostic approach with new indications and
   changed timing in the examination of patients with acute neurological
   lesions, The role of CT as the primary radiological examination method
   in these patients is well established, and is routinely used before the
   start of suitable treatment to detect or exclude intracranial
   haemorrhage, either traumatic or nontraumatic, or to detect other causes
   of acute onset of neurological disease, such as intracerebral tumours or
   subdural haematoma, The role of MRI still needs further confirmation,
   The sensitivity of MRI is superior to that of CT, especially in
   examination of the spinal cord, The main drawbacks of MRI are the
   problems in monitoring acutely ill patients, the unfamiliarity with the
   method, and capacity problems, Today, MRI is mainly used as a complement
   to CT, with the exception of spine injuries where MRI is the method of
   first choice, Also, the role of digital subtraction angiography is
   changing from diagnostic examinations towards endovascular therapeutic
   procedures, An experienced neuroradiologist has the key position in
   choosing and performing the most suitable examination method for each
   specific indication.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a system for storing, transmitting, and presenting digital
   movies in a computer network. The hardware used in the system is
   standard hardware, as found in typical workstations today; no special
   hardware is required, but if available it can be used to provide better
   performance. The XMovie system has several innovative features. First,
   it Contains a new algorithm for the gradual adaptation of the color
   lookup table during the presentation of the movie to ensure optimal
   color quality on low-end workstations. Second, it is a multistandard
   system supporting the compression techniques MPEG, Motion JPEG, and a
   newly developed extension to the well-known Color Cell Compression
   method. Third, it contains AdFEC, a new adaptable forward error
   correction method for our movie transmission protocol.}},

   possible to design for operation with field vector control on the motor
   side and unity displacement factor on the supply side. Laboratory
   experimental and digital simulation results are presented to
   substantiate the theory. The matrix converter used in the test is based
   on three modules of voltage-source SPWM converters {[}1] to implement
   the nine switches and it has the innovative feature that the SVC
   voltages (for displacement factor improvement) can be derived from the
   zero-sequence voltages.}},

Abstract = {{The key result of this paper is that following a change in a parameter
   of AR (p), an autoregressive process of order p, the innovations
   sequence of the Kalman filter parameters will follow an autoregressive
   moving-average model in addition to a transient function. Furthermore,
   it is also shown that the first p values of the innovations' sample
   autocorrelation can be used to form a sufficient statistic to detect if
   at least one of the parameters in the AR (p) model did change at an
   unknown point in time. Following a parameter change detection process,
   improved estimates and noise statistics can be determined and
   implemented to modify the Kalman filter. The revised model will thus be
   more consistent with the most recent process behaviour. To motivate the
   reader, a simulation exercise was conducted to validate the on-line
   change detector and adaptive estimation algorithm. The proposed
   algorithm was used to predict hurricane movements with real data
   provided by the National Hurricane Center.}},

Abstract = {{Active magnetic bearings provide revolutionary advantages for gas
   turbine engine rotor support. These advantages include tremendously
   improved vibration and stability characteristics, reduced power loss,
   improved reliability, fault tolerance, and greatly extended bearing
   service life. The marriage of these advantages with innovative
   structural network design and advanced materials utilization will permit
   major increases in thrust-to-weight performance and structural
   efficiency for future gas turbine engines. However, obtaining the
   maximum payoff requires two key ingredients. The first is the use of
   modern magnetic bearing technologies such as innovative digital control
   techniques, high-density power electronics, high-density magnetic
   actuators, fault-tolerant system architecture, and electronic
   (sensorless) position estimation. This paper describes these
   technologies and the test hardware currently in place for verifying the
   performance of advanced magnetic actuators, power electronics, and
   digital controls. The second key ingredient is to go beyond the simple
   replacement of rolling element bearings with magnetic bearings by
   incorporating magnetic bearings as an integral part of the overall
   engine design. This is analogous to the proper approach to designing
   with composites, whereby the designer tailors the geometry and
   load-carrying function of the structural system or component for the
   composite instead of simply substituting composites in a design
   originally intended for metal material. This paper describes
   methodologies for the design integration of magnetic bearings in gas
   turbine engines.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative four-credit junior-level semester course is described,
   which combines measurement theory, instrumentation, analog and digital
   electronics, sensors and actuators, and computer control topics with a
   laboratory experience. The course, entitled Mechatronics and Measurement
   Systems, is a core course for mechanical engineering students at
   Colorado State University which has evolved over the last 12 years. In
   the future it will be offered as a joint course for mechanical and
   electrical engineering students. Topics covered by the paper include:
   course objective, description, and current syllabus
   laboratory exercises designed to complement and supplement the lecture
   material
   term projects used in previous years including a 3-D surface laser
   digitizer, a cylindrical robot with optical tracking capabilities, and
   an acoustic mapping system
   textbook and laboratory manuals developed to support the course:
   `'Mechatronics and Measurement Systems'', `'Mechatronics and Measurement
   Systems Laboratory Exercises'', and `'Mechatronics and Measurement
   Systems Examination and Homework Manual'', all by M. Histand and D.
   Alciatore.
   This course is an integral part of our recently reorganized curriculum
   which emphasizes engineering design in each year of study. Mechatronics
   and Measurement Systems is the focal experience that students have in
   making the transition from the fundamentals of engineering to the
   application of those principles in `'real world'' engineering design
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative concept for decentralized processing of the signals of
   multiple sensors is presented. The basic idea is to connect every sensor
   via an analog-to-digital converter with a high-performance
   microprocessor, a transputer, that exclusively collects and processes
   its signal. The transputers are linked to a powerful network.
   Exemplarily, a measuring system based on this concept was used for the
   determination of local parameters of liquid-gas two-phase flows (e.g.,
   local void fraction and bubble frequency). Up to six fiber-optical
   probes were utilized simultaneously to demonstrate the efficiency of the
   system. The signal processing under that special application may include
   on-line evaluation of flow parameters and on-line correction of errors
   of measurement due to sensor-induced effects. The concept of the new
   system, however, is basically independent of the number and type of
   sensors, as well as of the method of signal processing. The
   transputer-based measuring system thus provides a flexible, efficient
   tool for applications in which great amounts of data have to be
   evaluated or manipulated quickly. (C) 1995 American Institute of
   Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical signal processing plays a crucial role in the design of many
   modem engineering systems. The availability of high performance, high
   speed DSP (digital signal processing) devices has seen this role
   increase by leaps and bounds. This paper takes up an overview study of
   the developments in this field with special reference to the last two
   decades as well as currently emerging trends. After a quick review of
   the Wiener and Kalman filtering theories, which served as major
   precursors to modern statistical signal processing, we address the
   important developments in adaptive filtering and modelling- a subject
   which has received a lot of attention in the eighties, and which
   continues to make strides to this day. Another area of considerable
   interest in the recent literature is concerned with the problems of
   harmonic retrieval and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of plane
   waves from sensor array data. Finally, the recent emergence of `'higher
   order statistics'' (HOS) like cumulants and polyspectra as important
   tools in signal processing is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{At first glance, engineers and librarians would seem to be worlds apart
   in their interests. A revolution in information technology, however is
   generating a convergence in interests and an environment for interesting
   and necessary collaborations. Increasingly traditional analog library
   tools and mechanisms are being replaced by digital counterparts, some of
   which call for expertise beyond the domain of library science. The
   National Science Foundation (NSF) together with the National Aeronautics
   and Space Administration (NASA) and the Advanced Research Projects
   Agency (ARPA) have funded six digital library projects that are being
   carried out by multidisciplinary teams made up of librarians, engineers,
   computer scientists, and professionals from several other disciplines.
   This paper begins with a review of the technological innovations that
   have allowed the emergence of digital libraries and fostered new
   multidisciplinary collaborations. The paper identifies a few key areas
   where collaborations are occurring among librarians and engineers, and
   illustrates these with examples from digital spatial library projects at
   the University of California, Santa Barbara (Project Alexandria) and the
   University of Maine (the BASIN Project). Particular emphasis is placed
   on digital spatial libraries, which have more unusual requirements for
   information processing. Collaborations in support of digital spatial
   libraries involve librarians, map librarians, and professionals in a
   stew field of engineering referred to as spatial information
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The regional atlas is an important educational resource that needs to be
   updated on a periodic basis to remain current and valuable. Contemporary
   advances in digital cartography and digital information dissemination
   are offering opportunities to rethink the traditional hard-bound paper
   atlas when working towards a new edition. It is argued in this paper
   that innovative atlas work ought not be undertaken without market
   research, including user consultation. This paper presents the results
   of a user survey conducted in British Columbia, Canada, to solicit
   educators' attitudes towards regional atlas content and design,
   including educators' reactions to digital atlases. Where appropriate,
   results are compared to a previously conducted user survey of the
   general public and other interest groups including grade 10 high school
   pupils. We learned that high school teachers in British Columbia are not
   ready for a digital atlas unless it also is published in paper format.
   Any digital initiative must also be hardware independent. We learned
   further that teachers emphasize simplicity and that they value high
   quality and up-to-date information presented in a clear and concise
   manner.}},

Abstract = {{Automated, real-time localization of the dicrotic notch, a component of
   the arterial pressure waveform, represents a deceptively complex problem
   in computerized biomedical signal processing. The high-frequency nature
   of the notch can make it difficult to distinguish from artifactual noise
   or from other high-frequency physiological components of the waveform.
   In addition, the contour of the notch varies with vascular status and
   with propagation through arterial beds, requiring any detection
   algorithm to recognize various possible notch conformations. Finally,
   location of the notch along the waveform may vary widely depending on
   other hemodynamic variables, further complicating detection algorithms.
   We have reviewed various published algorithms and have implemented a
   number of them to determine the strengths and shortcomings of each. We
   then developed a reliable and accurate hybrid algorithm which utilizes
   the strengths of the various algorithmic approaches reviewed; after
   analyzing the waveform, the algorithm selects the most appropriate
   method for accurate notch localization based on a series of waveform
   features. The application of rule-based logic represents a relatively
   unique approach to digital signal processing. (C) 1995 Academic Press,

Abstract = {{Aim: To evaluate angioscopy in this Unit with respect to its application
   in lower limb vascular reconstructions. By providing magnified colour
   images of the luminal surfaces of vein grafts, anastomoses and native
   arteries, angioscopy allows direct visualisation of imperfections and is
   sensitive in diagnosing technical problems. However, assessment is
   qualitative and magnification of the image can distort the operator's
   impression of true size. Angioscopy would be move versatile if it were
   possible to quantify the observed images.
   Method: A new technique has been developed to measure intra-luminal
   diameter from the angioscopic images. A linear displacement transducer
   is attached to the angioscope and accurately monitors its axial shift.
   Signals from the transducer are received by a personal computer equipped
   with a video frame grabber and analogue digital converter, together with
   appropriate software. The computer generates calculated dimensions based
   on geometrical principles, once each angioscope has been appropriately
   calibrated at the outset.
   Results: Laboratory studies examining tubes of known dimensions have
   confirmed the reproducibility and accuracy of the technique.
   Simultaneous angioscopic and Duplex ultrasound measurements of the
   internal diameters of segments of vein suspended in a water bath were
   then carried our. Using the Duplex results as the `gold standard: there
   was a strong correlation between the measurements obtained with the two
   techniques (R(s) = 0.92).
   Conclusions: In the clinical context this system has the capability to
   generate accurate endoluminal measurements during angioscopy. This has
   application for quality control in the selection of veins and inspection
   of run-off vessels during bypass grafting and in completion studies,
   following both operative and percutaneous procedures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new, 50 MHz auroral radar system, named SAPPHIRE,
   which observes at two locations in Canada: SAPPHIRE SOUTH, in the
   auroral zone and SAPPHIRE NORTH at nominal cusp latitudes in the
   vicinity of;the polar cap - auroral zone boundary. SAPPHIRE was designed
   to offer superior time and frequency resolution for studies of the
   geophysical phenomena in the observing regions and to provide a better
   insight into the plasma processes responsible for the radio scattering.
   The radars are continuous-wave, dual bistatic systems with two
   transmitters and two receivers (both at a common receiver location) in
   each radar system. This configuration provides two-dimensional estimates
   of the phase velocities in the region of the scatterers. The systems
   were designed for unattended operation at remote sites and are
   controlled via modems using conventional telephone service. There are a
   number of innovative parts to the design of this radar. All frequencies
   used in the transmitter and receivers are generated using direct digital
   synthesis which gives independent and accurate control of both frequency
   and phase. The data collection system uses extensive parallel processing
   via a custom design of INMOS `'transputers'' in order to handle the
   large amount of data received per day. This data collection system only
   stores data for those times when the observed echoes fulfill some
   minimum threshold conditions. The most interesting aspects of the
   electronic design are described and some representative data from
   SAPPHIRE SOUTH are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few years improvements to synchrotron sources and X-ray
   optics have allowed sophisticated EXAFS techniques such as QEXAFS and
   Ultra Dilute EXAFS to be developed. Many of these techniques require
   very high detector counting rates with good resolution and this has
   resulted in the development of high performance 13 element germanium
   detector systems used presently on the SRS at Daresbury (Cramer et al.,
   1988). However, these systems are still the limiting factor in such
   techniques largely due to intrinsic rate limitations in the analogue
   shaping amplifiers used to process the signal from the detector. This
   limitation is due to amplifier dead time which causes an effect known as
   pulse pile-up. The length of this dead time is dictated by the shaping
   time which in turn is set by the energy resolution required to separate
   the fluorescence and scatter peaks. At present, this processing dead
   time limits us to around 30 KHz per channel with an energy resolution of
   around 250 eV at 5.9 KeV. Above this limit, both the EXAFS amplitudes
   and the edge height become compressed. The outcome of this is that
   QEXAFS is limited in speed and Ultra Dilute EXAFS is limited in
   concentration.
   In order to overcome these limits a completely new detector system has
   been developed for the new Wiggler II ultra dilute spectroscopy station
   16.5 at the SRS. This detector system combines state-of-the-art
   germanium array detector technology with innovative digital signal
   processing electronics. The detector has been developed through a
   collaborative agreement with EG\&G ORTEC and packs 30 low-energy
   germanium crystals into an extremely small area yet still achieves
   energy resolution figures at least as good as smaller arrays. The small
   area allows the detector to be placed extremely close to the sample thus
   maximising the fluorescence detected. The electronics has been developed
   at Daresbury and utilises advanced adaptive digital filtering techniques
   based in VME hardware to minimise the processing dead time, thus giving
   unprecedented throughput linearity and rate/resolution performance. This
   combination of detector and electronics has allowed EXAFS data to be
   successfully collected at count rates an order of magnitude per channel
   greater than existing systems whilst still retaining the resolution
   required for EXAFS. This will eventually yield a count rate improvement
   of at least two orders of magnitude for the whole detector system.}},

   A communication channel is said to be experiencing some form of stress

   transmitter and receiver equipment errors, ionospheric effects,
   tropospheric effects, and jamming. A new monitor, the DEGRAD (Digital
   Eye Gridded Receiver with Arbitrary Degradation) monitor, is developed
   that is better able to detect and identify channel degradations before a

Abstract = {{Despite the dramatically increased application of knowledge-based
   systems (KBS) technology, most of the enormous potential to leverage
   expert knowledge remains unrealized.  The vast majority of KBS
   initiatives in industry and commerce have ended with unsatisfactory
   results.  These failures can be primarily attributed to strategic
   mismanagement rather than technological shortcomings.  Inspirational
   leadership and a needs-driven organizational vision are crucial for the
   effective assimilation of a new or emerging technology.  KBS are no
   exception.  A roads metaphor is identified as a basis for crafting and
   communicating such an organizational vision.  Three alternative
   approaches for achieving a strategic impact with a technology are
   identified and described:  the user-driven low road, the
   technostructure-driven high road and the team-based road network.  The
   relative merits of these strategic roads, and their suitability to
   different organizational and knowledge structures are considered using a
   case-based methodology.  Based on their research of the KBS technology
   assimilation processes at DuPont, Digital Equipment, and Xerox, the
   authors offer management advice to practitioners and recommend future
   areas for study.}},

Abstract = {{We have used two digital imaging systems: digital fluorography and the
   phosphor plates system. The respective indications for each technique in
   pediatric practice are presented hereafter. Digital fluorography is
   highly recommended for dynamic examinations, and phosphor plates are
   highly recommended for conventional studies, if the spatial resolution
   is mandatory. Either digital fluorography or phosphor plates can be used
   for contrast studies. In pediatric radiology, if the spatial resolution
   is not mandatory, digital fluorography is suggested to reduce the
   radiation dose, and if using a small fields of view is possible, digital
   fluorography may be carefully discussed. Digital radiography is
   supported neither to be better than classical radiology nor to
   compensate for technician's mistakes. It is aimed to improve the
   department's functioning and, above all, to accommodate future
   innovations. Images can be transferred or archived through networks.
   This is a main prospect in the coming years. Copyright (C) 1995 by W.B.

Abstract = {{Digital television, using digital video and audio compression as well as
   encryption, access control, packetization, multiplexing and digital
   transmission techniques, is creating a coalescence of computer,
   television and consumer electronics technologies and equipment in an
   unprecedented way. It is also opening up new markets such as interactive
   multimedia and HDTV. This coalescence of previously disparate
   technologies, products and markets is causing ``interoperability{''} of
   equipment from multiple suppliers to become a critical issue. Indeed,
   interoperability has become one of the hallmarks of the digital
   revolution. General Instrument (GI) has developed an MPEG-2 compatible
   digital television communications system, called DigiCiphero(R) II,
   which has been adopted by many programmers and network operators
   throughout the world. GI is in the process of broadly licensing the
   DigiCipher II technology to various equipment suppliers, allowing
   customers to have multiple sources of interoperable DigiCipher II
   equipment; This ongoing licensing process has placed GI, together with
   its customers and licensees, in the rather critical position of
   determining the appropriate balance between providing customers with
   multiple sources of interoperable equipment, while still allowing the
   equipment suppliers adequate room for product innovation and
   differentiation.}},

Journal = {{ACTA RADIOLOGICA}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{399}},
Pages = {{100-104}},
Abstract = {{Since the first animal coronary arteriogram in 1933 there have been many
   innovations in techniques and contrast media. From 1933 through the late
   1950s the procedures used involved nonselective aortic injections and
   the use of acetylcholine to slow the heart. The first selective coronary
   arteriogram in animals was performed by WEST, KOBAYASHI \& GUZMAN in
   1958 (45) and in 1959 GUMAN \& WEST (7) observed ventricular
   fibrillation with some media but not others. In 1967 JUDKINS (14)
   described the catheter designs for right and left coronary
   catheterizations that we still use today. In the 1970s and 80s many
   authors observed that ionic monomeric contrast media reduced plasma
   calcium causing fibrillation and myocardial depression. Supplementation
   of ionic media with calcium was shown to moderate these adverse effects.
   ALMEN'S vision of low osmolality contrast media and the creation of
   metrizamide (1) stimulated the rapid development of monomeric and
   dimeric nonionic contrast media. The ionic dimeric medium ioxaglate also
   provided low osmolality. Digital frame grabbers and computers lead to
   the development of digital subtraction angiography and new applications
   of arteriography, frequently using dilute media. Unexpectedly, during
   prolonged light coronary arteriography in animals, dilute nonionic media
   were found to produce increased fibrillation as compared to dilute ionic
   media. The addition of sodium to nonionic media significantly reduced
   the incidence of fibrillation. Animal studies with the nonionic medium
   iodixanol supplemented with sodium and calcium (Visipaque) have
   demonstrated minimal incidences of fibrillation and myocardial
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of a computational procedure for the automatic selection
   of the optimal knot distributions of spline functions for smoothing of
   noisy data has been investigated. The procedure is based on the use of
   cubic truncated power bases as linear estimators of the smoothing spline
   functions, and on the Kalman filter algorithm for computing the best
   least-squares values of the power basis coefficients. The optimal
   placement of the knots is selected by examination of the innovations
   sequence and through a strategy suitable for testing the model validity
   for each set of incoming data. The theory of the method is described,
   and its application to smoothing of both synthetic and experimental
   signals is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{An overview of the present industrial scenario with regard to the
   application of neural network approaches is reported. A brief summary of
   practical applications is presented. Neural network architectures
   capable of resolving various types of industrial problems are also
   illustrated.
   The first application presented deals with the problem of digit
   recognition. The proposed architecture is composed of different
   multilayer networks trained by back-propagation, organized in a
   hierarchical structure. Such a structure, as opposed to a single network
   structure, allows the avoidance of typical errors occurring on
   comparison of certain couples of digits.
   The second application deals with a texture-based segmentation of an
   image. In order to solve this problem, a structure composed of two
   different networks is proposed. The first network, a simplified BCS
   model, is a `'feature extractor''; the second network, Learning Vector
   Quantization model, is able to classify different textures on the basis
   of the parameters extracted by BCS.
   The third application deals with a fault-diagnosis system for the
   process state monitoring of complex industrial plants. An innovative
   approach is presented. The proposed model analyzes process parameters
   and predicts possible malfunctions on the basis of self-organizing
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Forest inventory procedures are likely to change or evolve at a more
   rapid rate over the next 15 years. Changes will be brought by changing
   forest management practices and priorities, increasing importance of
   environmental and multiple use issues, new technologies, increasing
   participation of industry, new market forces, and budgetary
   considerations.
   Map production is a major and costly component of forest inventory and
   one which will be much affected by these changes. This paper focuses on
   the map production component of forest inventory in Canada, but places
   it in the context of overall management inventory production. Inventory
   mapping procedures from provincial inventory cycles are summarized. The
   costs, time, and resources expended on each component of map production
   (photo acquisition, interpretation, transfer and drafting, and
   digitizing) are outlined. They are summarized in the context of the cost
   and resources needed for the total inventory process including volume
   sampling. Recent innovations, forces causing changes and rethinking of
   inventory philosophies, and future trends are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Hydra is a set of methods and software tools for carrying out digital
   circuit design using Haskell. It has been used successfully for three
   years in the third-year course on Computer Architecture at the
   University of Glasgow, with plans to extend its use to the advanced
   fourth-year course. Some of its innovative features are: Signal type
   classes; support for CMOS and NMOS design; a large family of higher
   order combining forms; a set of tools for simulation; a language for
   expressing control algorithms; and automated tools for deriving control
   circuits from control algorithms. The system contains a rich library of
   circuits, ranging from low level implementations of logic gates using
   pass transistors to complete processor designs. The chief benefit of
   using functional circuit specification to teach computer architecture is
   that a complete computer system design can be presented, at all levels
   of abstraction, with no details omitted, giving students a genuine
   understanding of how computers work.}},

Abstract = {{A low glitch 10-bit 75-MHz CMOS current-output video digital-to-analog
   converter (DAC) for high-definition television (HDTV) applications is
   described. In order to achieve monotonicity and low glitch, a special
   segmented antisymmetric switching sequence and an innovative
   asymmetrical switching buffer have been used. The video DAC has been
   fabricated by using 0.8 mu m single-poly double-metal CMOS technology.
   Experimental results indicated that the conversion rate is above 75 MHz,
   and nearly 50\% of samples have differential and integral linearity
   errors less than 0.24 LSB and 0.6 LSB, respectively. The glitch has been
   reduced to be less than 3.9 pV.s and the settling time within +/- 0.1\%
   of the final value is less than 13 ns. The video DAC is operated by a
   single 5 V power supply and dissipates 170 mW at 75 MHz conversion rate
   (140 mW in the DAC portion). The chip size of video DAC is 1.75 mm x 1.2
   mm (1.75 mm x 0.7 mm for the DAC portion).}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design of a speech coder called pitch
   synchronous innovation CELP (PSI-CELP) for low bit-rate mobile
   communications. PSI-CELP is based on CELP, but has more adaptive
   excitation structures. In voiced frames, instead of conventional random
   excitation vectors, PSI-CELP converts even the random excitation vectors
   to have pitch periodicity by repeating stored random vectors as well as
   by using an adaptive codebook. In silent, unvoiced, and transient
   frames, the coder stops using the adaptive codebook and switches to
   fixed random codebooks. The PSI-CELP coder also implements novel
   structures and techniques: an FIR-type perceptual weighting filter using
   unquantized LPC parameters, a random codebook with a conjugate structure
   trained to be robust against channel errors, codebook search with
   delayed decision, a gain quantization with sloped amplitude, and a
   moving average prediction coding of LSP parameters. Our speech coder is
   implemented by DSP chips. Its coded speech quality at 3.6 kb/s with 2.0
   kb/s redundancy is comparable to that of the Japanese full-rate VSELP
   coder at 6.7 kb/s with 4.5 kb/s redundancy. The basic structure of this
   PSI-CELP coder has been chosen as the Japanese half-rate speech codec
   for digital cellular telecommunications.}},

Abstract = {{Sunderland University runs a range of engineering degrees including
   Electrical, Civil, Mechanical Engineering and Digital Systems. The
   degrees were re-validated several years ago and the opportunity was
   taken to include work on computer algebra packages as part of the first
   year curricula. The paper will trace the history of both this innovation
   and others which have used the computer as a basis for the teaching and
   learning of mathematics and discuss the lessons to be learned from the
   experience at Sunderland to date. The engineering degrees at Sunderland
   are due to enter the CATS System operated at the University in September
   1994 and the consequences of this for the mathematical education of
   engineers will be discussed in the paper. The staff teaching mathematics
   at Sunderland now have considerable experience of teaching mathematics
   using the computer and it is intended that this experience will be used
   in devising the mathematics curricula to be incorporated in the
   engineering courses at Sunderland from 1994 onwards. The paper will
   outline the teaching and learning philosophy behind the changes proposed
   at Sunderland. It is hoped that the experience of the Sunderland staff
   will be of use to university staff in general.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new speech coding method pitch synchronous
   innovation code excited linear predictor (PSI-CELP). This method is
   based on CELP but adds pitch synchronous innovation. This results in
   even random codevectors being adaptively converted to have pitch
   periodicity for voiced frames. This scheme can improve the synthesized
   speech quality of voiced frames in the low bit-rate CELP without
   increasing either computational complexity or bit rate.
   In addition to pitch synchronous innovation, this paper also proposes
   four other methods in which the quality of synthesized speech is
   effectively improved or the computational complexity is reduced for low
   bit-rate CELP: (1) the perceptual weighting filter is an MA-type and
   uses nonquantized LPC parameters; (2) the fixed codebook is prepared as
   part of the adaptive codebook for nonperiodic frames; (3) the random
   codebook consists of two-channel conjugate sub-codebooks; and (4)
   codebook searches are made using delayed decision. In a speech coding
   system with pitch synchronization of random codevectors, improvements in
   ratio SNR, segmental SNR, and opinion equivalent Q value are
   respectively 1.6 dB, 1.0 dB, and 0.5 dB. These basic methods were
   adopted in the standard codec for Japanese half-rate digital mobile
   telephone service.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative technique for obtaining automatic three-dimensional shape
   information of a diffuse surface is presented. The technique is based on
   a new approach of phase measuring from a fringe pattern. The target to
   be studied is first modulated by projecting a linear grating onto its
   surface. The linear fringes are deformed according to the surface shape.
   Demodulation is carried out by determining the phase of these deformed
   fringes using a novel digital phase locked loop demodulation algorithm.
   The technique has the main advantage that the traditional phase
   unwrapping process is not required. The phase is determined continuously
   as the algorithm scans the two-dimensional fringe pattern. Owing to its
   sequential nature, this phase detection technique can be implemented
   using a special purpose video processor for phase determination at video
   rates, making it a very fast algorithm. The algorithm along with
   experimental results of real surface profiles are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy diagnosed in
   American men, and in 1994 it will pass lung cancer as the most common
   cancer diagnosed in the United States, with an estimated 200,000 new
   cases. The molecular biology of prostate carcinogenesis is rapidly
   advancing, and it is clear that, to a degree, prostate cancer is a
   heritable disease. The use of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a
   screening tool has been widely accepted by the medical community,
   although the evidence to support the efficacy of screening is not yet
   available. The curative approaches to organ-confined clinically
   localized prostate cancer include radiation therapy, radical
   prostatectomy, and close observation in selected patients. The absence
   of wed-designed clinical trials contributes to the confusion surrounding
   which curative treatment is the best option in individual patients. The
   standard approach to patients with evidence of extracapsular spread
   without distant metastases has been external-beam radiotherapy, although
   the results with radiation therapy alone in these patients has left
   considerable room for improvement. Innovative combined-modality
   approaches are currently being investigated at a number of institutions
   for these poor-prognosis patients. Three-dimensional conformal radiation
   therapy is currently being investigated at multiple institutions and
   offers some hope for improved results. The treatment of metastatic
   disease remains hormonal manipulation, although the exact nature of
   optimal androgen deprivation is currently a matter of considerable
   debate. In patients with hormone-refractory disease newer regimens using
   novel chemotherapy regimens offer some promise.}},

Abstract = {{Three recent developments made at Rensselaer in sheet material forming
   processes are briefly reviewed in this paper.  These innovations
   represent three broad disciplines of Process Simulation, Forming
   Processes, and Computer-Aided Measurement Methods.  The first
   development deals with simple and quick computer simulation of 2D sheet
   forming process without depending on popular finite element analysis
   methods.  An analytical method based on a thin shell theory accounts for
   bending and unbending effects, and is capable of simulating practical
   sheet metal forming processes under the plane strain condition.  The
   second area is concerned with innovative methods to improve formability
   of sheet materials by temperature gradient forming.  The drawing limit
   is increased by such an improved temperature gradient forming process. 
   The third and final area deals witha totally new experimental technique
   to capture 3D geometry data and measure strain distributions of sheet
   metal parts using a digital 35 mm SLR camera.}},

   about Computer-Aided Engineering software simulation tools which offer
   the opportunity to gain confidence in the performance of sophisticated
   digital, analog, and hybrid electronic system designs before making a
   commitment to hardware.  This approach should be considered in today's
   environment, where it is important to find innovative ways to control
   development and operational costs.  With the concern for the loss of our
   defense industrial base, and when the original design team may no longer

   operates at half the bit-rate but still has almost the same quality as
   the full bit-rate system. This new method is called PSI-CELP (pitch

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that help or
   hinder the adoption of new procedures and practices by Canadian
   radiologists. Canadian radiologists were asked, by means of a mail
   survey, for information about innovations in practice adopted during the
   previous 2 years or planned for the next 2 years. Surveys mere sent to
   the 1077 practising radiologists registered in the Canadian Association
   of Radiologists as of Sept. 30, 1991; 325 responded (30.2\%). The
   responses were correlated with demographic information obtained in the
   same survey and through the Maintenance of Competence Program of the
   Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) was more likely to be adopted in larger communities (those
   with a population of more than 500 000), computed tomography in
   medium-sized and larger communities (more than 100 000), mammography in
   medium-sized and smaller communities (500 000 or less) and
   ultrasonography (US) in smaller communities (100 000 or less).
   Radiologists with a faculty appointment at a university were more likely
   to adopt MRI and digital imaging, whereas those with no faculty status
   were more likely to adopt US and structural changes to a practice. The
   authors conclude that the size of the community in which a practice is
   located and the practitioner's faculty status both play a role in the
   adoption of innovations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To measure blood flow in the retinal circulation and optic
   nerve head capillaries with an innovative fluorescent vesicle system.
   Methods: Carboxyfluorescein was encapsulated into liposomes; the
   vesicles ranged from 0.1 to 2 mu m in diameter. After intravenous
   injection of the liposome suspension, the fundus was viewed using a
   scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Images of the fundus showing circulating
   liposomes were stored on videotape. An image analyzing system was used
   to digitize the captured video frames and transfer them to a computer's
   hard disk for permanent storage. Software developed in the authors'
   laboratory allowed them to overlay multiple video frames to create a
   single image that provided a visible record of the path taken by a
   particular vesicle in a given time period. The information on this image
   was used to calculate the velocity of the vesicle, and hence the
   velocity of the blood flow in the vessel.
   Results: With this system, individual liposomes as small as 100 nm were
   visible in all retinal vessels (arteries, capillaries, and veins).
   Quantitative analysis of vesicle movement in the major retinal vessels
   of the cynomolgus monkey yielded an average velocity of 9.33 +/- 1.67
   mm/second in a large vein (diameter, 130 mu m) and 16.10 +/- 5.7
   mm/second in a large retinal artery (diameter, 64 mu m). The average
   velocity in the macular capillaries was 0.76 mm/second (range, 0.45-1.33
   mm/second), whereas the average velocity in the optic nerve head
   capillaries was 1.39 mm/second (range, 0.96-2.25 mml second).
   Conclusion: The fluorescent vesicle system can be used for simultaneous
   measurement of blood flow in the retinal arteries, veins, and
   capillaries of the macula and optic nerve.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography has rapidly evolved over the past
   few years to become a technique that is commonly used in clinical
   practice as part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected
   neurologic disease. In this review, the author provides a brief overview
   of the relevant biophysical principles and some fundamentals of flow
   imaging by using MR as a baseline for understanding and implementing MR
   angiography in these patients. A historical perspective is given as a
   way of emphasizing the need for a healthy degree of skepticism rather
   than enthusiasm alone when reading MR angiographic literature. The
   rationale and clinical needs for MR angiography are summarized. The
   available data from blinded reader studies are summarized for two major
   clinical entities in which MR angiography is often used in neurologic
   practice: atherosclerotic disease of the extracranial carotid
   bifurcation and int acranial aneurysms. Recent refinements and technical
   innovations are also noted.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound offers several options extending
   conventional two-dimensional scanning. Various imaging modes are
   available. Three perpendicular planes displayed simultaneously can be
   rotated and translated in order to obtain accurate sections and suitable
   views needed for diagnosis and geometric measurements. 3D ultrasound
   tomography combines the advantages of ultrasound, e.g. safety,
   simplicity of application and inexpensiveness, with the advantages of
   sequentially depictable sections in numerous rotatable and translatable
   sections. Surface rendering gives detailed plastic images if there are
   surrounding layers of different echogenicity allowing for the definition
   of a certain threshold. Transparent modes provide an imaging of
   structures with a higher echogenicity in the interior of the object. A
   combination of the two modes sequentially definable by the sonographer
   allows for the optimal viewing of structures. These imaging modes are
   innovative features which have to be evaluated for clinical
   applicability and usefulness. Digital documentation of whole volumes
   enables full evaluation without loss of information at a later point. 3D
   technology provides an enormous number of technical options which have
   to be evaluated for their diagnostic significance and limitations in
   obstetrics and gynaecology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an approach for estimating the motion of arteries in
   digital angiographic image sequences is proposed. Binary skeleton images
   are registered using an elastic registration algorithm in order to
   estimate the motion of the corresponding arteries. This algorithm
   operates recursively on the skeleton images by considering an
   autoregressive (AR) model of the deformation in conjunction with a
   dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The AR model is used at the pixel
   level and provides a suitable cost function to DP through the innovation
   process. In addition, a moving average (MA) model for the motion of the
   entire skeleton is used in combination with the local AR model for
   improved registration results. The performance of this motion estimation
   method is demonstrated on simulated and real digital angiographic image
   sequences. It is shown that motion estimation using elastic registration
   of skeletons is very successful especially with low contrast and noisy
   angiographic images.}},

Abstract = {{The GE Corporate Research and Development Center in Schenectady, NY, has
   developed an innovative multichip module (MCM) technology-high-density

   low-cost solution for MCMs has to be found.  This paper presents an
   approach to reduce the IC pretest cost to a minimum in the absence of
   industry accepted `'known good die.'' The IC pretest method presented is
   based on the assumption that adequate testing is being performed by the
   component manufacturer and that a relevant subset of tests can screen
   for component defects occurring after wafer test. This approach
   differentiates between device complexities, their quantity, and function
   in the digital MCM. Using this methodology, in the absence of a fully
   developed KGD enviromment, IC pretest is a requirement for MCM prototype
   quantities and small production runs. Validation data for the test
   methodology is presented together with a discussion of the respective
   limitations and drawbacks.}},

Abstract = {{Following a successful technology R\&D programme, the European High
   Definition Television (HDTV) system was the only one available. Despite
   this, it will never reach the market. In June 1993 the great strategy of
   the EC to conquer the world with its own transmission system was
   officially abandoned. This article examines the strategy and the
   policy-making process that aspired to promote the European model of HDTV
   but failed. It argues that divergent and conflicting national and
   industrial interests, as well as divergent policy approaches, are in
   part to blame for this failure. Mismanagement of time in the policy
   process due to these conflicting approaches and interests was fatal as
   concurrently swift technological innovations led to the development of
   the competing digital HDTV model. It further argues that policy making
   was not flexible enough - and therefore not incremental - and that it
   ignored factors such as consumer demand. The HDTV strategy and policy
   goals were unrealistic and incongruent with available means as, for
   example, those who sought subsidies for the production of HD-MAC were
   concurrently developing the antagonistic digital model.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes the use of a DSP56001 digital signal processor in
   a multi-axis controller for stepper motors. Traditionally, these
   controllers have been based on microprocessors or special purpose
   integrated circuits. The proposed technique was implemented using the
   DSP56001 board from Motorola, and 32 stepper motors of various types.
   There are three innovative aspects of this work. First, the proposed
   controller was implemented using a single-chip digital signal processor
   (DSP). Second, the number of power driver integrated circuits was
   drastically reduced. This improvement reduced the cost and power
   consumption of the controller, and also improved its reliability.
   Finally, this concept can be expanded to simultaneously and
   independently control hundreds of motion devices such as stepper motors,
   D.C. motors, relays and solenoids.}},

Abstract = {{A major innovation in the delivery of the veterinary curriculum is being
   implemented at The University of Melbourne using the subject of
   systematic bacteriology and mycology as a pilot project. Students
   receive course information as interactive, multimedia databases. These
   consist of text and an associated library of catalogued digital images,
   movies and sounds. The databases employ a hypermedia information system
   to achieve efficient integration within and between subjects.
   The new delivery method encourages greater autonomy and more active
   learning roles for students than occurs in traditionally taught courses.
   Students will use their databases as the principal resource of
   information for undergraduate studies. A unique feature of this system
   for delivering the curriculum is that students will modify and expand
   their databases during the course. The ultimate aim is for students at
   graduation to receive, on disc, a copy of their own databases, adapted
   by themselves to their particular future professional needs. As graduate
   veterinarians they will continue to use their databases as a major
   resource for information and learning, thus providing continuity from
   undergraduate to continuing postgraduate education.}},

Abstract = {{Digital mammography is one of the most promising novel technologies for
   further improvement of early detection of breast cancer, offering
   important potential advantages: 1) improved image quality; 2) digital
   image processing for improved lesion contrast; 3) computer-aided
   diagnosis for enhanced radiologic interpretation; and 4) teleradiology
   for facilitated radiologic consultation. The Diagnostic Imaging Research
   Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) recently funded an
   international, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional Digital
   Mammography Development Group for collaborations between NCI, the
   academic community, and industry to facilitate the integrated
   development and implementation of digital mammographic systems.
   Currently, however, digital mammography faces a number of fundamental
   technological roadblocks: 1) cost-effective digital detectors and
   displays for imaging systems; 2) the need for novel algorithms for image
   processing and computer-aided diagnosis; and 3) high performance, low
   cost digital networks to provide an `'information superhighway'' for
   teleradiology. To solve some of these technological problems, the
   Diagnostic Imaging Research Branch of NCI joined efforts with the
   Technology Transfer Division of the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration to pursue a federal technology transfer program in
   digital mammography. The authors discuss the findings and
   recommendations of the workshop entitled `'Technology Transfer in
   Digital Mammography,'' which was organized and held jointly by the NCI
   and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in May, 1993.
   Numerous innovative technologies of varying degree of promise for
   digital mammography were presented at the conference. In this article,
   specific technologies presented at the workshop by the federal and
   federally-supported laboratories are described, and critiques of these
   technologies by the leaders of the medical imaging community are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Governmental digital cartographic data distribution policies can benefit
   environmental efforts and global change research. Currently, there are
   two main approaches towards data dissemination. The UK represents the
   cost-recovery approach where the data users help cover the costs of data
   creation and data are copyrighted. Alternately, the U.S. federal
   government distributes data on the basis of the marginal dissemination
   costs and does not copyright data that have been generated using public
   funds. The UK approach, which is typical of most of Europe, is more
   responsive to Its data users and can engage in partnerships with private
   companies in data development efforts, but the cost of data may limit
   basic research as its cost goes beyond the reach of many users and the
   copyright restrictions prevent open data sharing between scientists.
   This can have a significant impact in the area of basic environmental
   research, which is data intensive, and often requires many data sets
   from different time periods. In the United States, data are freely
   available at minimal cost and unrestricted by copyrights. This has
   allowed wide dissemination and supports greater innovation and public
   participation in environmental research. Interestingly, both of these
   policies find supporters in the business community. Government policy
   can also benefit environmental efforts by leading in standardization and
   cooperation on issues of scale, geodetic datum, terminology definition,
   and measurement consistency; both within country by coordinating local
   and national data, and as a part of a larger regional and global realm.
   As data dissemination becomes a global issue, and as the demand for
   digital map and other data to support environmental problem-solving
   becomes of critical importance, governments will increasingly have to
   choose a pathway between these dissemination strategies. This paper
   discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and offers
   some results and case studies to highlight the problems for those
   nations that are only now becoming involved with digital maps for
   decision-making and information management.}},

Abstract = {{A new blind equalization algorithm based on a suboptimum Bayesian
   symbol-by-symbol detector is presented. It is first shown that the
   maximum a postertori (MAP) sequence probabilities can be approximated
   using the innovations likelihoods generated by a parallel bank of Kalman
   filters. These filters generate a set of channel estimates conditioned
   on the possible symbol subsequences contributing to the intersymbol
   interference. The conditional estimates and MAP symbol metrics are then
   combined using a sub-optimum Bayesian formula. Two methods are
   considered to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm.
   First, the technique of reduced-state sequence estimation is adopted to
   reduce the number of symbol subsequences considered in the channel
   estimation process and hence the number of parallel filters required.
   Second, it is shown that the Kalman filters can be replaced by simpler
   least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filters. A computational complexity
   analysis of the LMS Bayesian equalizer demonstrates that its
   implementation in parallel programmable digital signal processing
   devices is feasible at 16 kbps. The performance of the resulting
   algorithms is evaluated through bit-error-rate simulations, which are
   compared to the performance bounds of the maximum-likelihood sequence
   estimator. It is shown that the Kalman filter and LMS-based algorithms
   achieve blind start-up and rapid convergence (typically within 200
   iterations) for both BPSK and QPSK modulation formats.}},

Abstract = {{The power of a modern digital controller allows innovative control

   two-valve pressure-reducing valve header pressure control, recovery
   boiler black liquor flow control using a variable-speed pump and valve,
   furnace draft control using a variable-speed fan with a damper, and
   forced-draft fan pressure control using a variable-speed fan with inlet
   vanes. Many other applications are candidates for this strategy, such as
   bypass control on the headbox and consistency control for high-density
   storage. The strategy provides good control resolution and immediate
   response to large demand changes. This strategy and its applications
   illustrate how advanced control may be implemented to provide

Abstract = {{The mobile telecommunications system is expected to run out of radio
   channels if the demand continues to grow at the current rate. One of the
   most feasible ways to relieve this problem is to reduce the bit rate
   used for speech signal transmission without degrading the quality. As a
   result of extensive research, NTT group has developed Pitch Synchronous
   Innovation CELP (PSI-CELP) speech coding method and has achieved quality
   comparabLe to the current standard, while using half the bit rate.
   PSI-CELP has been adopted to the half-rate CODEC standard for digital
   cellular telecommunication system in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{As VLSI technology is inching forward to the ultimate limits of physical
   dimensions, memory manufacturers are striving to integrate more memory
   cells in a chip by employing innovative three-dimensional cell
   topographies. Most of the current-generation multimegabit dynamic
   random-access memory (DRAM) chips use three-dimensional storage
   capacitors where the charge is stored on a vertically integrated
   trench-type structure. It has been experimentally verified that these
   memory cells have poor reliability, because they are highly vulnerable
   to alpha particles, which frequently create plasma shorts between two
   adjoining trench capacitors on the same word line, resulting in
   uncorrectable double-bit soft errors. The conventional on-chip
   error-correcting codes (ECCs) cannot correct such double-bit/word-line
   soft errors. The paper presents a systematic study of soft-error related
   problems and it discusses the methodologies to correct single-bit and
   double-bit memory-cell upsets by using on-chip ECC circuits.
   Conventional double-error-correcting (DEC) codes used in digital
   communications are known to be inadequate for this application. By
   modifying the product code, an effective coding scheme has been designed
   in this paper that can be integrated within a DRAM chip to correct
   double-bit errors. The paper demonstrates that the reliability of a
   memory chip can be improved by several million times by integrating the
   proposed circuit. The area and timing overhead have been calculated and
   compared with the memory chips without any ECC and chips with
   single-error-correcting (SEC) codes. The ability of the circuit to
   correct soft errors in the presence of multiple-bit errors has also been
   analyzed by combinatorial enumeration.}},

Abstract = {{The new mobile communication systems as GSM, PCN and DECT allow
   economical use of frequency allocation, digital radio quality and
   roaming in the entire European area. The demands posed by these
   innovative cellular systems are fuelling progress in SAW technology. The
   main filter requirements are high selectivity for suppression of
   spurious signals, low insertion loss for reduced power consumption and
   miniaturized SMD packages for small handheld units. SAW filters with
   these features are key components in most of the existing mobile
   telephone systems. To reduce the inherently high insertion loss of
   conventional SAW devices a variety of special low-loss techniques has
   been developed each optimized for a specific application. In this paper
   we will present the characteristics of some typical low-loss SAW filters
   for IF and RF filtering in the systems EAMPS, NMT900, GSM, CT-2, PCN and
   DECT. Customer requirements and the filter performance will be
   discussed. Finally the trends of future SAW applications for mobile
   communication systems will be pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{Edward R. McCracken can make a boast that few other CEOs of computer
   companies can make these days: his company, Silicon Graphics, Inc., is
   not only coping with rapid change and chaos, it is thriving. The company
   earned a record \$95.2 million on revenues of \$1.09 billion in the past
   fiscal year, and revenues continue to grow at a heady 30\% or more a
   year. What's more, Silicon Graphics seems to be having fun in the
   process. james H. Clark, who founded the company in 1982, brought
   three-dimensional, moving images to the previously two-dimensional world
   of computer graphics. From that innovation, Silicon Graphics has added
   digital audio and video capabilities to its array of machines. The quest
   to make its graphics run ever-faster has led the company from
   workstations into supercomputers with its Power Challenge series,
   introduced last January. At the same time, Silicon Graphics is expanding
   into the other end of the computing market with the Indy, its first
   machine priced below \$5,000. And alliances with Time Warner in
   interactive TV and Nintendo in home video games will push the company's
   technology squarely into the mass market.
   While many believe that high-tech products are becoming commodities,
   McCracken believes in designing products to meet the needs of his best
   and brightest customers. While many companies in the high-tech industry
   are reacting to market chaos by trying to keep up with or stay just
   ahead of the pack, McCracken thinks the key to competitive advantage is
   to be the one producing the chaos. And the key to being a chaos producer
   is being an innovation leader.}},

Abstract = {{Remarkable technological progress has been made In the development of
   Optical Transport Networks during the past decade. An optical transport
   network is a digital signal transport platform which provides flexible
   and powerful signal transmission capabilities needed to create

   technologies required for the development of optical transport networks,
   optical fiber transmission, and digital transport which includes
   transmission signal multiplexing, transport nodes, and network operation
   functions. The trends in transport technology evolution, the impact of
   SDH and ATM, the role of TMN (Telecommunications Management Networks),
   and network integrity enhancement techniques are elucidated. It is
   demonstrated that these technologies have brought about a dramatic
   change in transport network design and performance. Further innovations
   are required to fully realize a high-performance computer communication
   network, a cost-effective nation-wide BISDN, and local networks for
   video distribution. These include the realization of an optical access
   transport network, and the extension of trunk network capabilities which
   will be possible with optical path layer technologies.}},

   set of issues not yet deeply covered in the available literature. Our
   overall conclusions indicate that the full advantages promised by
   statistical multiplexing in the context of ATM networks cannot be
   obtained without careful discrimination and new and innovative
   approaches to access and congestion control. In particular, our results
   suggest using statistical multiplexing closer to the edges of the
   network, when many lower speed sources can be multiplexed; offering
   separated treatment to widely different types of traffic; and
   considering alternative methods of access control for particular
   services, such as long file transfers.}},

Abstract = {{Project Envision aims to build a `'user-centered database from the
   computer science literature,'' initially using the publications of the
   Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Accordingly, we have
   interviewed potential users, as well as experts in library, information,
   and computer science-to understand their needs, to become aware of their
   perception of existing information systems, and to collect their
   recommendations. Design and formative usability evaluation of our
   interface have been based on those interviews, leading to innovative
   query formulation and search results screens that work well according to
   our usability testing. Our development of the Envision database, system
   software, and protocol for client-server communication builds upon work
   to identify and represent `'objects'' that will facilitate reuse and
   high-level communication of information from author to reader (user).
   All these efforts are leading not only to a usable prototype digital
   library but also to a set of nine principles for digital libraries,
   which we have tried to follow, covering issues of representation,
   architecture, and interfacing.}},

Abstract = {{Large deployable space antennas are needed to accommodate a number of
   applications that include mobile communications, earth observation
   radiometry, active microwave sensing, space-orbiting very long baseline
   interferometry, and Department of Defense (DoD) space-based radar. The
   criteria for evaluating candidate structural concepts for essentially
   all the applications is the same; high deployment reliability, low cost,
   low weight, low launch volume, and high aperture precision. A new class
   of space structures, called inflatable deployable structures, have
   tremendous potential for completely satisfying the first four criteria
   and good potential for accommodating the longer wavelength applications.
   An inflatable deployable antenna under development by L'Garde Inc. of
   Tustin, California, represents such a concept. Its level of technology
   is mature enough to support a meaningful orbital technology experiment.
   The NASA Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology initiated the
   In-Space Technology Experiments Program (IN-STEP) specifically to
   sponsor the verification and/or validation of unique and innovative
   space technologies in the space environment. The potential of the
   L'Garde concept has been recognized and resulted in its selection for an
   IN-STEP experiment.
   The objective of the experiment is to (a) validate the deployment of a
   14-meter, inflatable parabolic reflector structure, (b) measure the
   reflector surface accuracy, and (c) investigate structural damping
   characteristics under operational conditions.
   The experiment approach will be to use the NASA Spartan Spacecraft to
   carry the experiment on orbit. Reflector deployment will be monitored by
   two high-resolution video cameras.         Reflector surface quality
   will be measured with a digital imaging radiometer. Structural damping
   will be based on measuring the decay of reflector structure amplitude.
   The experiment is being managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The
   experiment definition phase (Phase B) will be completed by the end of
   fiscal year (FY) 1992; hardware development (Phase C/D) is expected to
   start by early FY 1993; and launch is scheduled for 1995.
   The paper describes the accomplishments to date and the approach for the
   remainder of the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{This study attempted to answer two questions:  (1) How did companies in
   different competitive environments vary in their corporate
   entrepreneurship activities?; and (2) Which corporate entrepreneurship
   activities were associated with superior financial performance within
   different environmental settings?  Data from 102 strategic business
   units (SBUs), in six 4-digit standard industrial classification (SIC)
   groups, were used to address these two questions. As a first step,
   cluster analysis separated four different environmental settings, and
   then multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) helped in identifying profiles of corporate entrepreneurship
   within each.  The results suggested that each environment had a distinct
   combination of corporate entrepreneurship.  Furthermore, these
   environments exhibited different associations between entrepreneurship
   activities and measures of financial performance.  Overall, the data
   suggested that corporate entrepreneurship was associated with company
   growth and profitability.}},

Abstract = {{Spectacular advances in the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization
   (FISH) for the visualisation of specific DNA sequences in metaphase
   chromosomes and interphase cells have been made over the last few years
   making the technique a useful tool in clinical research. One of the
   biggest impacts has been in the field of detection and diagnosis of
   human malignancies. Chromosomal translocations, deletions, amplification
   of specific genes and changes in chromosome number can all be detected
   in the non-dividing interphase nucleus using probes ranging from whole
   chromosome `paints' to individual gene specific probes. Gene mapping has
   also benefited from advances in FISH technology. Target sequences
   ranging from one to several hundred kilobases can be visualised on
   metaphase chromosomes and spatial resolution in interphase cells permits
   the ordering of two probes over a distance as small as 1000 base pairs.
   The potential uses of FISH continue to increase with each new technical
   innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Historically the initial onset of periodontal disease in an individual
   was considered slow but continuously progressive over time. It was
   inferred that an individual would experience progressive destruction of
   the attachment structures until edentulous. However, several studies in
   the early 1970s contested the traditional concept of continuous disease
   progression. These studies suggested that periodontal disease progressed
   by recurrent acute episodes. In specific individuals, the loss of
   attachment was faster than the concept of slowly progressing disease.
   There were also sites in patients that progressed slower (or not at all)
   than anticipated on the basis of radiographic and clinical history of
   previous disease progression. These findings clearly indicated the need
   to explore the nature of periodontal disease progression and to
   institute a major effort into innovative methods to diagnose periodontal
   diseases. Dentists and researchers could more effectively prevent and
   treat periodontal disease and relate pertinent research findings to
   specific disease initiation and progression.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a morphological study of the dodo Raphus cucullatus
   and solitaire Pezophaps solitaria-extinct, flightless Columbiformes of
   the Mascarene Islands, Indian Ocean--based on mensural data from 387
   skeletal elements, comparative data from four flighted species of
   Columbidae, ancillary mensural data from other Columbiformes, and the
   literature.
   Raphus cucullatus and P. solitaria are characterized by great body size
   and substantially reduced pectoral limbs. Sexual size dimorphism is
   unusually great in both R. cucullatus and P. solitaria, and sexual
   dimorphism of P. solitaria may be the greatest of any carinate bird.
   Estimates of body mass (kg), based on femur lengths of flighted
   columbids and adjusted for flightlessness and seasonal deposition of
   fat, were: 21 and 17 for male and female R. cucullatus. and 28 and 17
   for male and female P. solitaria, respectively. Pectoral reduction is
   greater in R. cucullatus than in P. solitaria, but both species are
   characterized by differential shortening of wing elements, changes in
   the sternum and scapulocoracoidal angle. R. cucullatus has
   disproportionately long femora, short tarsometatarsi and long digits,
   whereas P. solitaria has disproportionately long tibiotarsi, short
   tarsometatarsi and short digits; relative shaft widths of leg elements
   are substantially greater in both R. cucullatus and P. solitaria than in
   flighted columbids.
   As is typical of other birds, giantism of R. cucullatus and P. solitaria
   probably was associated with physiological changes, increased longevity,
   enhanced thermodynamic efficiency and improved capacity for fasting.
   Evidently both R. cucullatus and P. solitaria were primarily
   frugivorous, and foraging-related morphological peculiarities include an
   enlarged crop and the retention of `gizzard stones'. Both species had
   clutch sizes of one, and egg masses of the flightless species
   approximated that predicted for a flighted columbid of equal size.
   Extreme sexual dimorphism and territoriality of P. solitaria suggest
   that the species may have been polygynous and perhaps lek-breeding. The
   description of `gigantic immaturity' in R. cucullatus by Strickland \&
   Melville (1848) probably represents the first recognition of
   paedomorphosis in any species of bird. Pectoral underdevelopment and (in
   at least R. Cucullatus) comparatively `juvenile' plumage in adults
   substantiate the role of paedomorphosis in the ontogeny of
   flightlessness in R. cucullatus and P. solitaria; both species also were
   characterized by peramorphic skulls, trunks and pelvic appendages. The
   common assumption of monophyly of the flightless species (i.e. Raphidae)
   lacks rigorous analytical support. In spite of the anthropogenous
   extinction of both species, both R. cucullatus and P. solitaria were
   evolutionarily innovative in ontogeny, morphological characters and
   life-history strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The fifth M.R.M. Conference in Perugia presents an opportunity to
   analyse the market situation of magnetic recording media, the trend in
   future recording systems and the potential of present contenders for
   flexible media to meet future requirements. The main products in
   quantity and value are either in their zenith of product cycle or near
   to it. Highly innovative systems are needed in order to stimulate new
   applications or markets. The most challenging application is digital
   recording of HDTV for which particle in polymer binder technology is not
   yet fully ruled out by thin film ME technology. Improvements are
   expected from magnetic particles and binder, dispersion as well as
   coating technology.}},

Abstract = {{A long tradition of quality and reliability has characterized submarine

   The article describes the correlative evolution of the submarine cables
   technology and especially justifies the choices made by
   Alcatel-Submarcom to conciliate the respect of tradition and the
   innovative character connected with the introduction of optical fibres.
   The submarine cable used at present in Alcatel S.560 systems with
   regenerators {[}1], will have to evolute in the next years to take into
   account a better adaptation to repeaterless links in a market in full
   expansion and to long-haul links with optical amplification {[}2], the
   first applications of which are planned in 1995 and will constitute more

Abstract = {{Engineering has been loosely defined as the application of science and
   mathematics through which the properties of matter and the sources of
   energy in nature are made useful to people in structures, machines,
   products, systems, and processes. Clearly, the definition stresses on
   two fundamental aspects-the utilization of science and mathematics and
   their application to address important problems. The first aspect has
   been widely accepted in the engineering discipline throughout the world.
   The second aspect of engineering has gained significant momentum in
   recent times, particularly through the actions of the Accreditation
   Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Recently, ABET has heavily
   emphasized the `'design component'' in engineering courses, where design
   loosely refers to incompletely specified problems and issues.1 In this
   paper, the author presumes that one of the principle reasons for the
   emphasis on design is to foster creativity and to encourage engineering
   students to seek out and solve problems at the boundaries of the
   engineering disciplines. Evidently, students thus trained, will be adept
   in solving the complex interdisciplinary problems of the future. This
   paper hypothesizes that the use of challenging examinations including
   open-ended design problems, across a student population will initially
   force them to think creatively and ultimately foster in them an
   appreciation for developing creative solutions. It reports an ongoing
   exercise within the division of engineering at Brown University that
   spans from 1989 to 1991. The paper describes the examination questions,
   reasons the nature of the questions, and reports the students'
   performance and perceptions. This study is limited to six
   semester-courses taught by the author-i) freshmen computing, ii)
   senior-level course in digital systems design, iii) senior-level course
   in computer systems organization, of which the latter two courses have
   each been taught twice in two academic years. Observations indicate that
   while 1.5-5\% of the students demonstrate outstanding creative ability,
   a solid 45\% of the class demonstrate innovative thinking processes that
   may be rated between good to very good. The lower 40\% of the class
   demonstrates neither capability nor interest in the problems and they
   usually perceive them as too difficult, unfair, and unrelated. The top
   40-50\% of the class, based on informal interviews, describe the
   examinations as very comprehensive, challenging, thought provoking, and
   difficult but fair.}},

Abstract = {{The use of global positioning systems (GPS) as a survey tool can bring
   rapid solutions for transportation management. GPS can be an efficient
   cost-effective, and accurate method of obtaining positional data, as
   reported by Henderson and Quirion in 1988. Field conditions can limit
   the use of GPS. To use GPS effectively requires innovation, expertise,
   and experience on the part of surveyors, as noted by Craymer et al. in
   1990. GPS data combined with a total station data were used to provide
   control along a 27.5 km (17.1 mi) section of the Santa Monica Freeway,
   in California. A total of 54 primary stations were positioned with GPS
   and 203 secondary stations were positioned with a total station. The
   static method was used in lieu of the kinematic method to position
   primary stations. For reasons explained in the paper, it would have been
   difficult if not impossible to maintain lock on the satellites during
   the progress of the survey and collect valid data for positional
   computation, as reported in Coad, in 1988. The survey control was
   completed in order to digitize the traveled edges of the freeway. The
   digitizing and compilation of maps was completed directly from the
   photos and not by a stereo compilation.}},

Abstract = {{In search of new business opportunities with residential subscribers,
   network operators are proposing a new range of services on the analog
   public switching telephone network (PSTN). To ensure the success of

   Business Systems has specifically developed a new generation of
   `intuitive' telephones, where the device's operation is learnt quickly
   in a natural and progressive manner, providing easy access to these new
   services. Innovative solutions have been developed, notably an onboard
   digital signal processor (DSP) and a cost effective liquid crystal
   display, to satisfy consumer market pricing objectives.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative method for creating a digital elevation model (DEM) from a
   small-format stereopair was developed for a digital monoplotter. The

   digitizing tablet and software based upon space resection solutions.
   DEMs created from (1) control points, (2) a topographic map, (3)
   large-format stereomodels, and (4) a 35-mm oblique stereopair were
   compared to determine the influence of DEM data upon monoscopic
   measurements. A DEM created from a 35-mm oblique stereopair provided
   relative point location accuracy of about 3 m for monoscopic
   measurements from a 1:37,000-scale oblique photograph. Plan-dev/scale
   ratio for a single 35-mm oblique was 0.10 mm, compared to 0.03 mm for a
   large-format stereomodel of the same area. Applications for the
   monoscopic measurement system are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Magazine print publishing is currently undergoing rapid technical change
   with the digitization of the printed word. This paper examines the
   implications of the new information and communication technologies for
   the geography of this sector within Britain. The established economic
   and spatial dynamics of magazine publishing are examined, and an
   assessment is made of the extent to which innovations in desktop
   publishing and advanced telecommunications are leading to new patterns
   of spatial structure in the industry. We argue that the new
   communication technologies are not leading to a general decentralization
   of magazine print publishing within Britain. For a variety of tangible
   and intangible reasons, the locational attractions of London remain
   dominant for the magazine publishers, while the geography of magazine
   markets make any further decentralization of magazine printing unlikely.
   Within an international context, however, new technologies may have
   significant implications for the geography of magazine printing although
   in this process the established centres of publishing are likely to
   extend their influence over dispersed markets.}},

   Kbaud over a distribution power line to the 120V network and back with a
   symbol error rate of about 2\% using less than about 10 W of average
   transmitted power, which is considerably superior to the present
   state-of-the-art PLC modems. Full-duplex operation over 120/240V
   intra-building wiring has also been field tested at 9.6 Kbaud over
   distances of 3000 ft. using 1W of average transmitted power.}},

Abstract = {{In January 1989 the Faroe Islands, a group of 16 inhabited islands in
   the northern Atlantic with a population of 48 000, opened new ``NMT
   450{''} system. We have obtained a coverage very close to 100\% of the
   land area, and 100- 120 km out to sea. To reach this goal, we have used
   an innovative approach to the study of propagation properties in the
   hilly variations of the mountains in the islands covering a maximum
   height of nearly 900 m and an average height of more than 300 m.
   This research has enabled us to verify the fact that the reflections
   from the hillsides are diffuse, and result in Rayleigh distributed
   signals, which can be applied constructively for obtaining coverage in
   shadow areas. This has been of great importance for the Faroese system
   making it possible to cover any spot of the country with only 15 base
   stations in spite of the mountainous countryside with deep valleys and
   firths. The system is thus extremely important for the fishing fleet,
   cargo ships, ferries, and land-based industry and vehicles, resulting in
   a penetration of about 25 per 1000 inhabitants after only three years
   with a busy hour traffic of about 20 millierlangs per subscriber.
   The system is served by a digital mobile telephone exchange situated in
   the capital, Thorshavn. It is now ready to expand penetration by some
   8\%. The system is connected by satellite, and submarine cable to the
   general NMT 450 system, making it possible for Faroese vehicles and
   vessels to travel throughout the Nordic countries including Denmark,
   Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and for mobile telephones from
   those countries to roam in the Faroe Islands.
   In its conclusion, this article gives details on the method used for
   obtaining full coverage in rough areas for a reasonable level of
   investment and the importance of a mobile telephone system for our small
   society.}},

Abstract = {{Modern telecommunications constitute a major segment of the wider
   information and communications technology sector, a hybrid sector
   created by the convergence of telecommunications, computing and office
   systems. The new telecommunications era has been spawned by three major
   forces: a radical technological shift associated with the `digital
   revolution', the quickening pace of deregulation and the growth of
   global markets. This paper examines the contention that
   telecommunications will redefine the parameters of competitive
   advantage, for cities and regions on the one hand and for industries and
   firms on the other. A key conclusion of this paper is that, while
   telecommunications does have the potential to deliver certain
   competitive advantages, the realisation of this potential is dependent
   upon a series of contingent factors. At the corporate level, the growing
   concentration and integration of communication networks within and
   between large firms betoken new threats for smaller and less powerful
   firms. At the city and regional level, while telecommunications offers
   hitherto unavailable opportunities for overcoming major developmental
   barriers, the technical possibilities will count for nought unless they
   are integrated into a regional innovation strategy which is attuned to
   local circumstance and alive to the social and organisational structures
   through which technology is deployed.}},

Abstract = {{The surveying and mapping industry has experienced significant advances
   in the last decade due to the application of rapidly evolving modern
   technology. One of the most important advances has been the deployment
   of the Global Positioning System (GPS), which enables rapid and accurate
   positioning in both static and kinematic applications. The use of GPS in
   conjunction with various types of remotely sensed data, such as
   videography, aerial photography, satellite imagery, and scanner data,
   has advanced the application and utility of geographic information
   systems (GIS). Advances in these and related technologies poses a
   challenge to the modern surveyor to create and utilize integrated
   systems that address current data-collection and dissemination
   requirements. To this end an innovative approach to application-specific
   mapping and data collection for GIS using the integrated airborne

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this review was to address the
   following question: based on the best available evidence, what should be
   the current medical management of congestive heart failure (CHF)? DATA
   SOURCES: The major sources for this review were from searches of the
   English language literature, including computer and bibliography
   reviews, of all randomized, controlled clinical trials and overview
   analyses of positive inotropic agents, preload/afterload reduction
   agents and beta-blocker medications in CHF. STUDY SELECTION: The number
   of studies reviewed was approximately 40. The major criterion for
   selection was that the studies be of CHF patients in randomized
   controlled clinical trials, particularly with a mortality/survival
   endpoint. Additional clinical trials of nonmortality endpoints in CHF
   patients and mortality trials in non-CHF patients were also selected to
   support possible pathophysiological insights for future CHF trials. DATA
   ExTRACTION: The data, particularly for the accompanying tables, were
   initially extracted by a single reviewer using common qualitative
   guidelines as far as was possible within the different temporal,
   etiological and geographic frameworks of the original component studies.
   Conclusions are drawn from this data synthesis and from published
   overviews. DATA SYNTHESIS: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
   inhibition therapy is effective in reducing mortality and morbidity in
   severe left ventricular dysfunction and CHF. Other systemic vasodilators
   may also be beneficial. The effects of digitalis on survival and
   morbidity in CHF are presently uncertain, but should be resolved in the
   near future. Other inotropic agents, at least in the long term, are
   clinically detrimental. Diuretics decrease morbidity, but their effect
   on mortality in CHF remains unknown. Beta-blocker and magnesium therapy
   offer promise in CHF, but await definitive clinical trials evaluation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The current medical therapy of CHF should definitely
   include ACE inhibitors, probably diuretics and possibly other
   vasodilators. Further viable trials of promising new, and older
   heretofore under-evaluated, CHF therapies are needed. Additionally,
   innovative strategies are needed to deal with this disease which has an
   increasing prevalence. Two strategies, primary prevention of CHF and a
   `Heart Function Clinic', are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{America's reliance on voluntary solutions to vexing social problems is a
   theme that runs through its history. Private foundations are public
   trusts that society, in its search for voluntary solutions, turns to for
   social experimentation and innovation. Sometimes foundations achieve
   success in their pursuits; often they do not. But whatever the outcome,
   most foundations do not evaluate their program efforts with the same
   energy and expenditure that was allocated for their design.
   Occasionally, though, foundations do put forth the extra effort, as this
   paper by Catherine McLaughlin and Wendy Zellers indicates. Along with
   colleague Lawrence D. Brown, the authors were enlisted by The Robert
   Wood Johnson Foundation to evaluate the results of its Health Care for
   the Uninsured Program. In this paper, they underscore the challenge of
   structuring a set of incentives that encourage people to change their
   behavior voluntarily-in this case, to buy health insurance. As a part of
   their effort, they collected survey data in four of the nine program
   sites on the small businesses that offered health insurance to their
   employees and those that did not. The data showed that useful projects
   that reduced the number of working uninsured people were created in the
   four sites, but the evaluators also found that the market penetration
   ranged from 2 to 17 percent, with only one project in the double digits.
   Their conclusion: Larger efforts are required to make significant
   reductions in the number of people who lack health insurance. The Robert
   Wood Johnson Foundation retained McLaughlin and Brown several years ago
   to evaluate another of its efforts-the Community Programs for Affordable
   Health Care-and their findings were published in Health Affairs (Winter
   1990). McLaughlin holds a doctorate in economics from the University of
   Wisconsin-Madison. Zellers received a master's degree in public health
   from the University of California, Berkeley.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a new digital signal processing technique applicable
   to power spectrum estimation designated as the minimum free energy
   method.  With no a priori model assumption and no attempt to extract
   special features such as sinusoids, we are able to obtain high
   resolution even with high noise contamination of the measured signal. 
   In this study we have chosen to demonstrate the minimum free energy
   technique by modification of the Burg recursive method of spectral
   analysis.  Burg's method borrows the efficient Levinson algorithm of the
   maximum entropy method but avoids the difficulty of estimating the
   autocorrelation sequence.  Burg chooses the reflection coefficient to
   minimize the sum of forward and backward prediction error energies.  We
   propose a recursive minimum free energy method in which we choose the
   reflection coefficient at each step to minimize the free energy (the
   Burg energy measure minus the product of a temperature and an
   information entropy).  Our novel innovation produces a spectral
   estimator more impervious to high noise contamination than the Burg
   method and diminishes the Burg tendency to produce spurious peaks.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1990s, manufacturing companies face the challenge of globally
   integrating their operations.  Multinationals can no longer rely on
   sheer size and geographic reach to dominate the volatile global arena. 
   But by integrating far-flung plants into tightly connected, distributed
   production systems, companies can seize the opportunity for a new
   manufacturing scale advantage.
   Michael E. McGrath and Richard W. Hoole provide examples of
   global-integration strategies from Xerox Corporation, Digital Equipment
   Corporation, and other companies of all sizes.  Their work emphasizes
   that global integration begins at the top, filters down through the
   organization, and includes innovations across all functions, especially
   in those they call the ``five basics{''}:  product development,
   purchasing, production, demand management, and order fulfillment.  To
   set the stage for global integration, McGrath and Hoole suggest that
   companies (1) affirm a global manufacturing mission publicly; (2)
   develop a profile of company capabilities; and (3) identify options,
   pick a plan of action, and target specific results.
   Of course, there are no easy solutions to the need for change on such a
   large scale.  Some manufacturers have created international teams for
   different functions; others have emphasized doing a critical activity
   only once.  With a network of flexible plants all over the world,
   manufacturers can achieve new economies of scale and cut costs by
   eliminating redundant processes.  But in becoming globally integrated,
   these same companies must balance the tension between a monolithic
   central authority and the need to integrate independent units.  And they
   must focus specific changes in functions and at individual sites by
   articulating a vision shared by the entire organization.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1875, there have been radical innovations in our ways to deal with
   sound. Sounds could be recorded and converted into electrical vibrations
   and vice-versa. Electronics made radio and sound recording practical. A
   new era came about with the advent of digital recording, synthesis and
   processing of sound, pioneered in 1957 by Mathews. Sounds can now be
   coded arbitrarily and elaborated with unprecedented precision and
   flexibility, which seems to free acoustics from the constraints of
   mechanics. This has opened new applications in speech, music, noise
   absorption, room acoustics; as demonstrated by acoustic illusions, it
   has also greatly improved our understanding of auditory perception,
   specially in the field of timbre. The limitations of digital acoustics
   depend upon the differential capacities of perception rather than upon
   the constraints of mechanics. Yet our auditory perception is geared to a
   world of mechanically-produced sounds, and mechanics should not be given
   a cavalier dismissal, as the work of Gibson and Cadoz has suggested: the
   specifics of mechanical vibrations shed light on the the perceptual
   organization in the hearing process. In particular,
   digitally-implemented mechanical models may - at least in certain cases
   -turn out to be more valuable for the creation of musical sounds than
   signal-processing models. However the ultimate criterion for endeavours
   related to hearing remains perceptual.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm for the correction of errors arising from between-sample
   variations in the pseudo-first-order rate constant for kinetic methods
   is described.  The algorithm is based on the linear Kalman filter and
   uses a set of models (typically 40 or more) in parallel.  The best model
   for a given set of data is selected by examination of the innovation
   sequences.  Limitations of this approach with respect to data range,
   number of data points and measurement noise were investigated with
   simulated data.  Experimental data from the molybdenum blue method for
   the determination of phosphate were used to demonstrate the
   insensitivity of the algorithm to variations in the rate constant. 
   Principal advantages of the new method over other error-compensation
   methods are its simplicity, adaptability, stability, fixed cycle time
   and memory requirements, and its ability to provide results in only one
   pass through the data.  The method can be used in real time and is well
   suited for digital signal processors and parallel computing
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Proximal limb lead positions are currently used for activity-compatible
   electrocardiographic monitoring of myocardial ischemia.  Two previously
   described systems for alternate limb lead placement were studied in
   patients with and without QRS evidence of healed anterior or inferior
   myocardial infarction.  An innovative method was used to simultaneously
   record 6 standard and 6 modified limb leads, and 3 standard and 3
   modified precordial leads on a standard digital electrocardiograph. 
   Both alternate lead placement systems showed rightward frontal plane
   axis shift and diminished Q-wave durations in lead aVF compared with
   those of their simultaneous standard controls.  Furthermore, potential
   differences between the standard distal limb lead sites and 5 more
   proximal sites were explored along each limb.  Differences along the
   left arm were accentuated relative to those along the right arm owing to
   differences in proximity of the arms to the myocardium.  Along the lower
   limb, an anterior site showed less deviation from standard than did a
   more lateral site.  It is imperative that recordings from alternate
   sites be labeled accordingly so that their output cannot be confused
   with that obtained from standard sites.}},

Abstract = {{Formerly, ophthalmic ultrasonography was leading in view of
   high-performance apparatuses and transducer probes: e.g., the first
   array-scanner in the world was built for ophthalmic use. Within the past
   2 decades, however, high-tech innovations were merely developed for
   other medical specialities. These were studied in view of their use for
   ultrasonography of eye and orbit. The combination of B-scan and Doppler
   techniques facilitates detection of orbital vessels. The resolution of
   ophthalmic digital B-scan video images proved poorer than crt-B-scans. A
   digital memory, however, is advantageous. But one high-resolution
   crt-type B-scan needs more than one disc storage capacity. >>Frontline
   digitalization<< could help to reduce the amount of data. - Array
   transducers are now available in small sizes and could better show
   structure movements, but they were not yet adapted to ophthalmic use.
   This applies as well to annular arrays and dynamic focusring. -
   Different methods of 3-dimensional scanning and (Pseudo-) 3-dimensional
   imaging might renew Baum's and Coleman's early work.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 1950s the UK emerged as a world leader in the design and
   construction of electronic digital computers, a fact illustrated by
   Ferranti Ltd., the Manchester electronics firm.  Ferranti achieved its
   dominant position with a blend of innovative technology and government
   support, but eventually found the computer business unprofitable. 
   Marketing failures were partly responsible, particularly an obsession
   with technology and a failure to target the most profitable sectors of
   the industry.  But paramount in the factors leading to Ferranti's sale
   of its computer interests were:  firstly, the greater resources and
   market opportunities of the Americans; and secondly, the conservatism of
   the Ferranti family, who found the manufacture of defence computers a
   safer and more profitable alternative than the highly competitive
   data-processing market.}},

Abstract = {{Automation technology, including digital computer and communication
   techniques, is being applied in an ever-increasing range of private and
   public spheres, and reaching third world cultures not previously exposed
   to such technology.  It is engineers' responsibility to consider the
   direct and indirect effects of this technology.  To be able to fulfill
   this responsibility and make proper design decisions, engineers must
   both understand ``appropriateness{''} within a given boundary, and have
   decision authority, together with other parties participating in the
   design.  Whereas sound methodologies for user-centered design are
   appearing, anticipating and considering the cultural effects of
   automation are concerns that go far beyond traditional engineering. 
   Nevertheless, engineers should be more deeply involved in comprehensive
   technology assessment.  Encouraging experiences show how innovative
   design approaches and consideration of comprehensive sets of
   requirements can lead to better overall system performance.  However,
   much research on open questions remains to be done.}},

Abstract = {{This paper gives an overview of the progress that has been made in the
   evolution of technology to provide DS1 rate telephone access in a
   restricted segment of the loop plant without intermediate repeaters,
   loop conditioning, or pair selection in assignment. This technology has
   come to be called the high bit rate digital subscriber line (HDSL).
   Discussed are background information on electronics in the loop plant
   and characterization of the transmission environment in the relevant
   frequency band. The progress of the HDSL study project in the T1
   subcommittee of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),
   accredited Committee T1, Working Group T1E1.4 is outlined. Analytical
   and theoretical studies to determine the limits on the transmission
   capabilities of the loop plant, motivated by the need to determine the
   feasibility limits of HDSL's, are reviewed. Also reported on is progress
   in technical work on suitable transmission formats, including several
   innovative transmission architectures and work in the areas of timing,
   equalization, echo cancellation, and sundry other issues. Finally, the
   possibility of an asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL),
   transmitting at the DS1 rate from the central office to a remote
   distribution point, through the entire nonloaded loop plant is
   discussed, as is duplex transmission at rates in excess of 10 Mb/s over
   shorter distances.}},

   progressed to the point that designers of signal and data processors can
   discern the system applications for which GaAs is best suited.  Basic

Abstract = {{Increasingly popular electronic loads typically induce harmonic current
   in the ac line and have lagging power factor.  The power line
   conditioner (PLC) minimizes harmonic current in the ac line and improves
   power factor to unity.  A six-switch current source inverter (CSI) is
   implemented for power-line conditioning.  A 5-kVA test model of the CSI
   has been built using insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT's)
   controlled by a digital signal processor (DSP).  To determine system
   performance, experimental results are compared with computer simulations
   of an innovative adaptive frequency domain control for pulse width
   modulated (PWM) switching of the CSI.}},

Abstract = {{A virtual revolution in computer capability has occurred in the last few
   years, largely based on rapidly decreasing costs and increasing
   reliability of digital memory and mass-storage capability.  These
   developments have now made it possible to consider the application of
   both computer and display technologies to a much broader range of
   problems in radiation therapy, including planning of treatment, dose
   computation, and treatment verification.  Several methods of
   three-dimensional dose computations in heterogeneous media capable of
   3\% accuracy are likely to be available, but significant work still
   remains, particularly for high energy x-rays where electron transport,
   and possibly pair production, need to be considered.  Innovative display
   and planning techniques, as well as plan evaluation schemes, are
   emerging and show great promise for the future.  No doubt these advances
   will lead to substantially improved treatment planning systems in the
   next few years.  However, it must be emphasized that for many of these
   applications a tremendous software and hardware development effort is
   required.}},

Abstract = {{This study responds to a Centers for Disease Control request to develop
   innovative case-finding methods and asks two questions:  1) Will men
   participate in an anonymous telephone interview containing detailed
   questions about their sexual practices to enable screening for
   HIV-related risk?  2) Will individuals told they are at increased risk
   follow up by calling a toll-free number for additional AIDS information,
   counseling, or medical evaluation?  Random-digit-dialed interviews were
   completed with 1610 adult men in Los Angeles County; the completion rate
   among eligible men was 68.3\%.  Nearly 43\% of men were assessed at
   increased risk, half of whom described behaviours that placed them only
   at moderate risk and half of whom reported behaviours placing them at
   higher risk.  Although the study found men were willing to provide
   personal risk-assessment information, only 14 of 343 men were willing to
   initiate a follow-up telephone call to the project counselors as the
   next step in case-finding.}},

Abstract = {{Great progress has been made in digital imaging of the chest.  Most
   studies are dealing with computed radiography.  Chest radiography in the
   intensive care unit may, in most cases, be performed using computed
   radiography.  However, subtle pulmonary interstitial disease can be
   demonstrated less confidently using computed radiography.  Significantly
   better detection of calcified lung nodules can be obtained by using
   simplified single-exposure dual-energy technique that uses storage
   phosphor.  The wide latitude of computed radiography permits images of
   high quality in areas other than chest radiography.  Encouraging results
   are presented especially in the diagnostic evaluation of scoliosis and
   other musculoskeletal abnormalities.  An important technical innovation
   in digital radiography is an improved method for single-exposure
   dual-energy digital imaging using prefiltration with gadolinium, a
   cassette consisting of four photostimulable phosphor plates, spatially
   dependent scatter and beam hardening corrections, and noise reduction
   algorithm.  Other groups tested algorithms for enhancement of digital
   images that allowed significant data compression.  The implementation of
   picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) is inevitable; the
   question concerning PACS implementation is not why, but when.  A
   comparison of the cost-effectiveness of PACS with conventional film
   archiving and communication systems shows that PACS should provide
   indirect savings when regarding the hidden costs of conventional
   systems.  Much more experience will be needed before there is general
   agreement on the best design for the radiologist's workstation. 
   Teleradiology should contribute to radiologic consultation for remote
   locations, because it improves the efficacy of management of patients in
   such locations.}},

Abstract = {{The paper traces the development of terrestrial digital radio relay
   systems from the beginning in the early 1970s with special emphasis on
   work done in the United States.  Parallel to the growth of digital
   services in the telephone network microwave radio systems were developed
   that are able to carry these new signals efficiently, reliably and at
   competitive cost.  Much work has been done to increase spectrum
   efficiency, the capability to transmit more and more information bits
   per hertz of bandwidth.  Dramatic improvements were also obtained over
   the years in the ability of these systems to withstand the effects of
   multipath fading.  As a result modern digital radio systems can meet
   international standards for error performance with margins to spare. 
   These advances have been made possible by a long list of technological
   innovations such as:  error correction, errorless protection switching,
   robust receiver techniques, digital transversal equalizers, adaptive
   digital linearizers and methods to counteract external interference. 
   Also very helpful has been a better understanding of the physical

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid state-space self-tuning control scheme
   using dual-rate sampling for suboptimal digital adaptive control of
   linear time-invariant continuous-time multivariable stochastic systems

   regional-pole assignment method developed in the continuous-time domain,
   the constructed fast-rate discrete-time model is converted into an
   equivalent continuous-time model for the development of a state-feedback
   optimal control law with pole placement in a specific region.  The
   developed analogue optimal control law is then converted into an
   equivalent pseudo-slow-rate digital control law via the proposed digital
   redesign technique, which can be realised via slow-rate digital
