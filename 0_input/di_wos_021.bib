Abstract = {{The Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) testing complex
   includes more than 50 wind tunnels, test cells, arc heaters, and other
   specialized test facilities. Of these, 27 units have capabilities that
   are unmatched in the United States, and 14 are unmatched in the world.
   These unique facilities pose equally unique testing challenges,
   including several related to test preparation.
   A dynamic strain measurement system feasibility demonstrator for turbine
   engine ground testing applications was developed as the product of a
   Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) phase I contract. System
   specifications include 40 kHz minimum bandwidth, 0-65 degrees C
   operating temperature, IEEE-1451 ({''}smart sensor plug and play{''})
   compliance, and synchronized sampling per IEEE-1588. The transducer
   interface for each channel features hardware-configurable bridge
   completion, an instrumentation amplifier, a remotely configurable
   antialiasing filter, and a combined A-D/microcontroller on a 5 square
   inch circuit board. The A-D/microcontroller stores essential transducer
   information locally and converts the amplified analog signal into
   digital data. The network interface from 12 transducer channels to the
   host computer comprises an FPGA and a microprocessor with integral
   IEEE-1588. Data systems of this type will reduce engine test cell wiring
   to control room, improve noise immunity, reduce engine installation
   time, enable faster calibration, and reduce per channel instrumentation
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Cultivating the innovative abilities of postgraduates is the key for
   promoting the quality education comprehensively, and also is the main
   content in the postgraduate education in China. By listing and
   explaining the disadvantages of the innovation capacity of postgraduate
   in China, this paper points out that the information literacy education
   is one of the most important measures in advancing their innovative
   abilities. The postgraduates should possess these information
   competences during their innovative ability cultivation, such as
   acquiring the needed information effectively and efficiently,
   incorporating selected information into knowledge base, using
   information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose, and having
   good information ethics. After analyzing the states of the information
   literacy education of postgraduates in China, such as lack of
   information literacy courses, outdated teaching methods and content,
   lack of information education resources in universities, and lack of the
   competent teachers for the postgraduate information education, some
   measures are put forward to improve the postgraduate information
   literacy, such as constructing a digitized learning environment by
   building the digital campus and digital library, speeding up the reform
   of the courses, making use of the information sources to improve the
   information literacy education and media literacy education, teaching
   on-line, directing the postgraduates in developing the information

   Constructivism and technology represent an important combination to

   technology-based communication methodology for learning, so as to let
   children discover about drawing, one of the most ancient communication
   techniques. Starting from texts and stories, selected based on their
   age, children learn how to interpret and translate into images the
   content they wish to communicate, building the storyboard of their
   digital tale, and using their creativity on texts, images and other

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
   based modulation feature extraction method applied in digital modulation
   identification. In modulation identification, important information may
   be contained in the high-order relationship among sampling points. ICA
   is sensitive to high-order statistic in the data and finds
   not-necessarily orthogonal bases, so it may better identify and
   reconstruct high-dimensional communication signal data than traditional
   time and frequency domain features. ICA algorithms are time-consuming
   and sometimes converge difficultly. So a modified FastICA algorithm is
   developed in this paper, which only need to computer Jacobian Matrix
   once time in one iteration and achieves the correspondent effect of
   FastICA. After obtaining all independent components, a generic algorithm
   is introduced to select optimal independent components (ICs). The
   experiment results show that modified FastICA algorithm fast convergence
   speed and genetic algorithm optimize recognition performance. ICA based
   features extraction method is innovative and promising for digital
   modulation identification.}},

Abstract = {{In response to escalation of community violence, the U.S. Department of
   Commerce funded Home Health VNA (HHVNA), serving the Merrimack River
   valley communities in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, for a project
   demonstrating innovative use of technology in screening for abuse and
   neglect.
   All health care providers in the HHVNA were trained in screening through
   tools loaded on their personal digital assistants.
   The sample was comprised of patients served by HHVNA during the study
   period.
   When a patient screened positive, the health care provider mobilized
   resources, including social workers, the office of elder services, or
   the local department of social services office for same-day follow-up.
   Screening for abuse and neglect was mainstreamed into routine care.
   Health care providers noted significant reduction in redundant domestic
   abuse data collection. The close communication networks created enabled
   health care providers to mobilize resources, initiating same-day
   in-depth social work assessment and referrals to appropriate community
   agencies. Health care providers now transmit selected encrypted health
   information and mandated reports to official agencies.
   Wedding technology with health care professionals' skills and knowledge
   can move prevention of and early intervention for domestic abuse and
   neglect to a new level of efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{The media scene has endured continuous changes ever since we saw the
   light of the motion picture in 1888 into our present digital age The
   changes, innovations and expansions have generated a significant media
   value chain constituting a vast worldwide economy The D-Cinema business
   is about creating a digital media asset (the film, the feature or motion
   picture) and screening this on as many screens as possible Hence
   enabling the studios, owning the asset, optimizing their profit and
   making sure the exhibitors sell more tickets For more than 100 years
   this has been managed by a value chain consisting of the studios, the
   distributors and the exhibitors (cinema owners) Digitization has the
   potential of dramatically changing the industry and opens for new
   business models driven by the innovation and governed by change and the
   handling of change}},

Abstract = {{Despite the huge technical progress in the cardiological diagnosis,
   heart auscultation is still an essential element of the physical study
   in cardiology. The possibility of hearing the acoustic phenomena
   produced by the contracting heart and the blood flowing through, enables
   the initial diagnosis of cardio-vascular pathology, especially cardiac
   valve defects. Replacing the traditional stethoscope with the electronic
   device (phonocardiograph) enables filtering noises, strengthening
   selected frequencies and referring them to the heart cycle. The
   development of phonocardiography had been suddenly stopped by
   introducing ultrasonic investigation into the cardiological diagnosis.
   The application of an innovative transducer (accelerometer) and the
   possibility of the digital processing of the acoustic signal, allowed to
   expand the acoustic analysis for the new frequencies (infrasounds). In
   the signal frequency analysis of the healthy heart, the largest spectrum
   strength is recorded among the frequencies between 6 to 12 Hz. In the
   case of damages in the left heart ventricle, the recorded spectrum is
   changed (the decrease of amplitude and higher frequencies appear).}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing complexity and world-wide distribution of digital
   objects, identification and enforcement of digital rights have become
   too complex to be carried out manually. It is necessary to take into
   account the case-specific applicable laws, the complete creation history
   of a work and the existing licenses. However, no formal generic model
   has been presented so far integrating these aspects. This paper presents
   an innovative domain ontology of the Intellectual Property Rights. It
   distinguishes four levels of abstraction or control: (1) the legal
   framework, (2) the individual rights people hold, (3) the individual
   usage agreements right holders and others may issue, and (4) the
   particular actions that are restricted by IPR regulations or bring
   particular rights into existence. The ontology has the potential to
   enable wide semantic interoperability of digital repositories for
   identifying existing rights on digital objects and tracing the impact of
   particular actions on rights and regulations.}},

Abstract = {{The process of training pre-service social Studies and history teachers
   to effectively infuse technology into their practice is complex. In most
   cases, we are not only asking teachers to increase their knowledge and
   proficiency ill using classroom technologies, we are also asking them to
   make conceptual changes in their overall perceptions of teaching.
   Schools and colleges of education sometime have only months to produce
   desired changes in perceptions and practice; therefore, we must
   carefully consider what types of experiences we should give pre-service
   teachers to accelerate the change process. We open this chapter by
   closely examining the literature concerned with the conceptual change
   and diffusion of innovation processes that social studies teachers are
   likely to take part in on their path toward becoming a ``digital{''}
   history teacher. We then introduce and explain the use of Web Inquiry
   Projects as a strategy we used in pre-service teaching methods courses
   as a way to give future teachers the experiences they need to understand
   and see the viability of historical inquiry as a preferred method for
   teaching and learning, and to effectively leverage technology for this
   purpose. We close the chapter by introducing a conceptual change model
   centered on the concerns teachers have as they become effective digital
   history teachers. The four reflexive and recursive stages to this model
   are orientation, understanding, feasibility, and progression.}},

Abstract = {{The Folk Music Archives at the Institute for Musicology (ZTI) preserves
   circa 18,000 hours sound recordings of folk music and audiovisual
   recordings of folk dance, including the phonograph cylinders of the
   Museum of Ethnography, the majority about 70\% (12,000 hours) -
   digitized. One of the most important tasks beside the proper storage and
   retrievability - is to enter the data about field collections and sound
   recordings into a computerized database. This work began in the early
   nineties with the data processing of the closed and the so-called
   historical systems separated from the rest of the material, then after
   the unification of the earlier data input methods, in 1999 we created an
   interactive and dynamic Internet website-system that provides a database
   in which the main types of old Hungarian folksongs are searchable by
   their musical attributes and acquisitional and geographical details. The
   database system developed especially for folklore archives (Folklore
   Archiving System) is integrated with a thesaurus, a hierarchical
   structure of keywords which is maintained by the cataloguists
   themselves. The metadata system uses innovative features to allow high
   level, realistic cataloguing. As a result of recent developments, there
   are several interfaces to provide access to different subcollections of
   the database through the Internet or provide access points to external
   systems such as ethnoArc. The uploading of different part-units and

Abstract = {{Technological innovations in the generation and circulation of images
   have altered both the way death looks to contemporary audiences and the
   access publics have to representations of death and dying. While Western
   mainstream news providers conceal the corpse from public view,
   entertainment media renders death and the dead body in increasingly
   spectacular fashion, and documentary imagery of death proliferates
   online. I interrogate the historical relationship between imagery of
   death within newsmaking and the emergence of Hollywood's ultraviolent
   aesthetic, and explore the recent technological advances which enable
   novel regimes of post-mortem representation and their dissemination.
   Contemplating the traffic between fictional and documentary images, I
   develop my analysis around imagery of the dead produced during the
   current conflict in Iraq. I frame this analysis around footage of
   fatalities within recent documentary films and digital images posted
   online by coalition soldiers. These regimes of representation present
   unique issues regarding the ethics of representing the dead, the way in
   which `the real' is signified, and the proximity of viewing publics to
   horrific imagery.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, some innovative wireless sensing systems have been
   proposed. However, more exploration and research on wireless sensing
   systems are required before wireless systems can substitute for the
   traditional wire-based systems. In this paper, a new type of intelligent
   wireless sensing network is proposed for the heath monitoring of
   large-size structures. Hardware design of the new wireless sensing units
   is first studied. The wireless sensing unit mainly consists of
   functional modules of: sensing interface, signal conditioning, signal
   digitization, computational core, wireless communication and battery
   management. Then, software architecture of the unit is introduced. The
   sensing network has a two-level cluster-tree architecture with Zigbee
   communication protocol. Important issues such as power saving and fault
   tolerance are considered in the designs of the new wireless sensing
   units and sensing network. Each cluster head in the network is
   characterized by its computational capabilities that can be used to
   implement the computational methodologies of structural health
   monitoring; making the wireless sensing units and sensing network have
   ``intelligent{''} characteristics. Primary tests on the measurement data
   collected by the wireless system are performed. The distributed
   computational capacity of the intelligent sensing network is also
   demonstrated. It is shown that the new type of intelligent wireless
   sensing network provides an efficient tool for structural health
   monitoring of large-size structures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an innovative architecture that enables the
   digital representation of original works and derivatives while
   implementing Digital Rights Management (DRM) with the aim of focusing on
   promoting trust within the multimedia content value networks rather than
   solely on content access and protection control. The system combines
   different features common in DRM systems such as licensing, content
   protection, authorisation and reporting together with innovative
   concepts, such as the linkage of original and derived content and the
   definition of potential rights. The transmission of reporting requests
   across the content value network combined with the possibility for
   authors to exercise rights over derivative works enables the system to
   determine automatically the percentage of income corresponding to each
   of the actors involved in different steps of the creation and
   distribution chain. The implementation consists of a web application
   which interacts with different external services plus a user application
   used to render protected content. It is currently publicly accessible
   for evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation in textiles and clothing has embodied various combinations of
   new and existing materials to meet conventional needs of comfort and
   fashion. Interactive and intelligent textiles are emerging as many new
   textile materials are being used to form sensors in garments to
   intimately interact with the human form. Interactive textiles typically
   contain sensors located within a garment to detect physiological
   functions that are wirelessly connected to digital infrastructure and
   application specific software. These devices can be realised in
   conventional garments and have scope for application in diverse fields
   including entertainment, education, sport, military and medicine.
   Position and Motion Sensing devices will be discussed for each
   application, in terms of the value proposition, performance
   requirements, regulations, and existing technology. A case study of an
   entertainment device that uses limb motion to achieve an imaginary
   instrument, the Wearable Instrument Shirt (WIS) will be discussed in
   this context. The WIS combines a wearable sensor interface with software
   to map gestures and audio data files to form an easy-to-use gesture
   driven instrument that allows real-time interactive musical performances
   without any need for significant instrument or computer skills.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of Lunar Exploration Initiative goals will require
   deployment of science packages at sites with the appropriate vantage
   point for obtaining the desired measurements and remote from potential
   (human) sources of contamination, thus requiring stand alone operation.
   Chief instruments/instrument package candidates include those which
   could provide long-term monitoring of the surface and subsurface
   environments for fundamental lunar science and crew safety. The major
   challenge such packages face will be operating during long periods of
   darkness in extreme cold potentially without the Pu238 based power and
   thermal systems available to Apollo era packages (ALSEP). The initial
   attempt to design a 10 instrument environmental monitoring package with
   a solar/battery based power system led to a package with a unacceptably
   large mass (500 kg) of which over half was battery mass. We achieved
   considerable reduction in this mass, first through the introduction of
   high performance electronics capable of operating at far lower
   temperature, reducing the initial mass estimate by a factor of 2, and
   then through the use of innovative thermal balance strategies involving
   the use of multi-layer thin materials and gravity-assisted heat pipes,
   reducing the initial mass estimate by a factor of 5. Yet to be
   implemented are strategies involving the universal incorporation of
   ULT/ULP (Ultra Low Temperature/Ultra Low Power) digital and analog
   electronics, distributed or non-conventionally packaged power systems,
   and state of the art solar power technology. These strategies will be
   required to meet the far more challenging thermal requirements of
   operating through a normal 28 day diurnal cycle. Limited battery
   survival temperature range remains the largest obstacle.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the effect of clock jitter on the performance
   of OFDM-based systems applying digital IF architecture. A bandpass Sigma
   Delta ADC is used for the analog to digital conversion process. An
   accurate and realistic model of the clock jitter in bandpass Sigma Delta
   ADC is implemented. Results from this paper show that clock jitter
   severely degrades OFDM system performance by introducing both phase and
   waveform noise. It is shown that for the case of sampling at IF stage,
   the effect of waveform noise is quite small and negligible compared to
   the phase noise effect. Therefore, an estimation and compensation method
   based on the existing phase noise compensation method is proposed for
   alleviating the effect of clock jitter. Simulation results are
   presented, showing the significant performance gain of our proposed
   algorithm, providing a new and innovative way of dealing with the clock
   jitter problem of bandpass A/D conversion in OFDM systems.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic health monitoring and maintenance of civil infrastructure
   systems is a challenging area of research. Nondestructive evaluation
   techniques, such as digital image processing, are innovative approaches
   for structural health monitoring. Current structure inspection standards
   require an inspector to travel to the structure site and visually assess
   the structure conditions. A less time consuming and inexpensive
   alternative to current monitoring methods is to use a robotic system
   that could inspect structures more frequently. Among several possible
   techniques is the use of optical instrumentation (e. g. digital cameras)
   that relies on image processing. The feasibility of using image
   processing techniques to detect deterioration in structures has been
   acknowledged by leading experts in the field. A survey and evaluation of
   relevant studies that appear promising and practical for this purpose is
   presented in this study. Several image processing techniques, including
   enhancement, noise removal, registration, edge detection, line
   detection, morphological functions, colour analysis, texture detection,
   wavelet transform, segmentation, clustering and pattern recognition, are
   key pieces that could be merged to solve this problem. Missing or
   deformed structural members, cracks and corrosion are main deterioration
   measures that are found in structures, and they are the main examples of
   structural deterioration considered here. This paper provides a survey
   and an evaluation of some of the promising vision-based approaches for
   automatic detection of missing (deformed) structural members, cracks and
   corrosion in civil infrastructure systems. Several examples (based on
   laboratory studies by the authors) are presented in the paper to
   illustrate the utility, as well as the limitations, of the leading
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports how a teacher-researcher partnership examined a
   biology teacher's existing pedagogical practices and attempted, through
   a task design innovation, to create the circumstances under which more
   interactive and emergent assessment for learning practices could
   flourish in her classroom. This work involved the use of digital video
   playback technology as the trigger or catalyst for reflection on
   concrete experiences by the teacher and her students to occur. Results
   suggest that the digital video innovation brought about changes in
   student-teacher interactions in science practical work and assisted the
   teacher in reflecting on her professional learning. The educative
   effects produced by the catalyst were dependent on the teacher noticing
   changes in her Students and moving in tandem with them along a parallel
   path of experiential and practitioner-based learning. Overall, the Value
   of the study undertaken is located in sharing an authentic, lived
   science assessment experience with the intention of assisting colleagues
   notice aspects of their own pedagogic practices that may be hidden at
   present. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TEACHING OF PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{65-69}},
Abstract = {{John Mitterer earned his PhD in cognitive psychology from McMaster
   University. Like many teaching professors, his career took an unexpected
   turn early on when he was hired to teach introductory psychology at
   Brock University, near Niagara Falls, in Ontario, Canada. It was love at
   first lecture. He never left the course and now, as a full professor
   some 25 years later, has taught well over 20,000 students. Along the way
   he has participated in the development of a wide variety of learning
   materials, including textbooks, videodiscs of support materials,
   student-learning CD-ROMs, online learning objects, Web sites, test
   banks, PowerPoint slides, study guides, and instructor's manuals.
   Mitterer now thinks of himself as a scholar of teaching and learning
   with a special interest in the educational potential of digital
   technology. He is a frequent presenter at conferences devoted to
   teaching and learning and currently holds a Brock University
   Chancellor's Chair for Teaching Excellence. He is the recipient of the
   2003 Brock University Distinguished Teaching Award, a 2003 Ontario
   Confederation of University Faculty Associations (OCUFA) Teaching Award,
   a 2004 3M Teaching Fellowship, and the 2005 Canadian Psychological
   Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to Education and
   Training in Psychology. David B. Daniel is involved with forging
   reciprocal links between cognitive-developmental psychology and teaching
   practices and pedagogy. He is the coordinator of the Society for
   Research in Child Development's (SRCD) Teaching of Developmental Science
   Institute as well as chair of the SRCD Teaching Committee, and the
   managing editor of Mind, Brain, and Education. He chaired the Society
   for the Teaching of Psychology's task force on pedagogical innovations.
   His interest in the development of effective teaching has informed his
   current efforts to develop effective pedagogical techniques that
   positively impact both student learning and teacher performance.}},

   starting point of the fundamental educational aims that unite the
   academic community. We argue that interactive and cooperative digital

   transmission but the use of digital technologies to enhance intellectual
   expressiveness and creativity: helping the students in their
   appropriation of the world with a special emphasis on their intellectual
   development, it is essential for the education system to incorporate new
   digital media as tools for intellectual expression and production. We
   outline the main issues relevant to the implementation of
   technology-enhanced learning (TEL) - the link to overall educational
   aims, the relationship between innovation and practice, the importance
   of user engagement, the nature of TEL research, and the characteristics
   of the local context, and the nature of TEL as a catalyst for change.
   The chapter concludes with some of the key lessons learned in recent
   research and development projects that will help to develop more
   successful ways of ensuring that the technology achieves its potential
   to enhance learning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the experiences of a group of teacher
   educators during the 2006-2007 academic year, when they participated in
   a project to try out and implement digital individual development
   planning (which in Swedish is digital `Individuella Utvecklings-Planer'
   or IUP) in a teacher education faculty at a Swedish university. The
   project group consisted of seven female teacher educators and three
   colleague mentors. They shared their experiences of the project and how
   they viewed their roles in the implementation process through individual
   narrative interviews. In order to illuminate how the attributes of
   digital IUP were perceived and how these attributes were communicated
   within the faculty, the data were analysed in the light of Rogers'
   (2003) diffusion of innovation theory. Furthermore, concepts of symbolic
   capital from Bourdieu (1984) were used in analysing the teacher
   educators' positions as change agents. The article presents a discussion
   of the circumstances in which digital IUP promotes reflective dialogue.
   Furthermore, it illuminates the change process and the participants as
   change agents from a power relations perspective, highlighting
   communication and shared pedagogical visions.}},

Abstract = {{Student teachers often complain about the lack of relevance of the
   theoretical courses in teacher education, and they repeatedly stress the
   importance of the practicum as the most significant component in
   preparation for teaching. However, most teacher educators, as well as
   students themselves, recognise the importance of being well informed
   about educational theory which provides them with a better understanding
   of the professional responsibilities as teachers. Moreover, a sound
   theoretical knowledge base combined with the mastery of practical
   teaching skills determines teachers' actions when professional decisions
   are made. The challenge for teacher educators is to support students in
   making relevant links between practice and theory so they see the
   relevance of both for full exploration of their teacher education, and
   seek support and understanding in the theory when engaging in teaching
   as fully qualified practitioners. In an attempt to narrow the notorious
   gap between theory and practice in teacher education, videopapers were
   introduced in the curriculum of the one-year post-graduate teaching
   certificate course at the University of Bergen, Norway. This small case
   study (n = 6) reports preliminary findings from the innovative approach.}},

Abstract = {{Relations between innovation and regulation are all but fluid and
   simple. When innovation, beyond just developing new techniques, means
   redefining the very framework for implementing and operating
   technologies, it often means breaking the rules, challenging them. In
   the digital economy, the way it overturns the regulation and rule
   setting system is particularly radical. Innovation is key to create
   competitive advantage in a highly dynamic sector such as information and
   communications technologies. Firms invest heavily in productive
   resources and take steps to protect their competitive advantage.
   Productive resources are either network and connection infrastructure or
   consumer control which is rarely seen as such. It could be consumer's
   attention or visits which requires massive investments in content, for
   example. It does include intermediation platform like search engine,
   programs, knowledge, entertainment and other immaterial products of the
   digital age. There is a need to rethink regulation on the basis of
   innovation and mobilization of these productive resources. The digital
   economy calls for a more holistic consideration of the link between
   innovation and mobilization of value on the one hand, and regulation on
   the other.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of the knowledge society, building on the pervasive
   influence of modern information and communication technologies, is
   bringing about a fundamental reshaping of the global economy. Knowledge
   has always been a factor of production, and a driver of economic and
   social development. However, the capacity to manipulate, store and
   transmit large quantities of information cheaply has increased at a
   staggering rate over recent years. The digitisation of information and
   the associated pervasiveness of the Internet are facilitating a new
   intensity in the application of knowledge to economic activity, to the
   extent that it has become the predominant factor in the creation of
   wealth. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are also
   facilitating a rapid globalisation of economic activity. In an
   increasingly global economy, where knowledge about how to excel
   competitively and information about who excels are both more readily
   available, the effective creation, use and dissemination of knowledge is
   increasingly the key to success, and thus to sustainable economic and
   social development that benefits us all. Innovation, which fuels new job
   creation and economic growth, is quickly becoming the key factor in
   global corn petitiveness.}},

Abstract = {{In modern times, the rapid growth of the Internet has made copyright
   protection of digital contents a critical issue. A Digital Rights
   Management (DRM) system is aimed at protecting the high-value digital
   assets and controlling the distribution and utilization of those digital
   assets. Watermarking technologies are being regarded as a vital mean to
   proffer copyright protection of digital images. Digital watermarking
   hides, in digital images, the information necessary for ownership
   identity to offer copyright protection. This paper proposes an
   innovative invisible and blind watermarking scheme for copyright
   protection of digital images with the purpose of defending against
   digital piracy. In the proposed watermarking scheme, a binary watermark
   image is invisibly embedded into the host image for achieving copyright
   protection. In watermark embedding, every pixel of the watermark image
   is embedded into the individual blocks of the host image sized 2x2. In
   the proposed watermarking scheme, the process of watermark extraction
   necessitates only the watermarked image and it doesn't require the
   original image or any of its characteristics, and hence, the proposed
   watermarking scheme is blind. The efficiency of the proposed
   watermarking scheme has been demonstrated via the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Today, there is an opportunity to bring together creative design
   activities to exploit the responsive and adaptive `smart' materials that
   are a result of rapid development in electro, photo active polymers or
   OFEDs (organic thin film electronic devices), bio-responsive hydrogels,
   integrated into MEMS/NEMS devices and systems respectively. Some of
   these integrated systems are summarised in this paper, highlighting
   their use to create enhanced functionality in textiles, fabrics and
   non-woven large area thin films. By understanding the characteristics
   and properties of OFEDs and bio polymers and how they can be transformed
   into implementable physical forms, innovative products and services can
   be developed, with wide implications. The paper outlines some of these
   opportunities and applications, in particular, an Ambient Living
   platform, dealing with human centred needs, of people at work, people at
   home and people at play. The innovative design affords the accelerated
   development of intelligent materials (interactive, responsive and
   adaptive) for a new product \& service design landscape, encompassing
   assistive healthcare (smart bandages and digital theranostics), ambient
   living, renewable energy (organic PV and solar textiles), interactive
   consumer products, interactive personal \& beauty care (e-Scent) and a
   more intelligent built environment.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges of the Brazilian Government for the next 10
   years will be the banking inclusion of the poorest portion of the
   population, which has a monthly family income of less than \$200
   Dollars. Only 25\% of the economically active population have a bank
   account and 15\% are digitally included. On the other hand more than
   90\% of Brazilian people have a TV, and only 12\% are connected to the
   internet. These aspects have lead to the use of digital television as an
   innovative and effective way for banking inclusion, thus significantly
   improving statistics related to digital and social inclusion, allowing
   many people to be able to get micro credit programs and enjoy more
   benefits of been citizens. The Brazilian Digital Television System
   recently developed and established in some cities, would offer
   interactivity capabilities, thus promoting a progressive alteration of
   paradigm in the relationship involved between the user and the
   television system. For an adequate implantation of interactive
   applications, the use of several options available as last mile
   technologies for the return channel needs to be evaluated. Emphasizing
   the needs and specific characteristics of T-banking for people not
   connected to the internet, this article aims at discussing several
   possibilities of access technologies, involving power line
   communications, cellular networks, xDSL and others, for the sake of
   adequate communication when using the return channel of digital
   television system.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, media objects have been restrained to specific media
   containers (e.g. media players, libraries, and technological platforms).
   In this paper we argue that this is due to a tradition of treating media
   as content separated from, but physically aligned to a certain form.
   However, due to the digital character of modern media, and due to
   current developments towards file sharing communities, media convergence
   and cross-media interaction design we argue that there are several good
   reasons now for exploring the design space beyond a container view of
   media. In our exploration of this design space we take a point of
   departure in media objects where form and content is integrated, instead
   of separated and we take contemporary theories of liquidity and an
   innovation-oriented focus group study as two sources of inspiration for
   exploring the design space of truly liquid media. The exploration is
   then summarized into a vision of midget design, i.e. design of small,
   lightweight, interactive and integrated media objects that can live
   across heterogeneous media platforms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel circuit concepts for integrated rectifiers and
   voltage converting interfaces for energy harvesting micro-generators. In
   addition, novel design approaches and innovations regarding ultra
   low-power digital circuit design as well as designs of efficient RF
   transceiver circuits are given. The supply voltage amplitude depends not
   only on the volume and level of excitation of the generator, but is also
   strongly related to the inductive, electrostatic or piezoelectric
   conversion principle used. Therefore, rectification with minimum voltage
   losses and low reverse currents is an important issue. Load adaptation
   for maximized generator power as well as efficient storage of the
   harvested energy are further issues which are also addressed in this
   paper. This paper gives an overview and shows concrete design
   implementations from printed circuit board level towards modern
   integrated circuit design and new processes, which lead to low power,
   low voltage, and high integration levels.}},

Abstract = {{GaAs-based two-dimensional photonic crystal (2DPC) slab waveguides (WGs)
   and InAs quantum dots (QDs) were developed for key photonic device
   structures in the future. An ultrasmall and ultrafast symmetrical
   Mach-Zehnder (SMZ)-type all-optical switch (PC-SMZ) and an optical
   flip-flop device (PC-FF) have been developed based on these nanophotonic
   structures for an ultrafast digital photonic network. To realize these
   devices, two important techniques were developed. One is a new
   simulation method, i.e., topology optimization method of 2DPC WGs with
   wide/flat bandwidth, high transmittance and low reflectivity. Another is
   a new selective-area-growth method, i.e., metal-mask molecular beam
   epitaxy method of InAs QDs. This technique contributes to achieving
   high-density and highly uniform InAs QDs in a desired area such as an
   optical nonlinearity-induced phase shift arm in the PC-FF. Furthermore,
   as a unique site-controlled QD technique, a nano-jet probe method is
   also developed for positioning QDs at the centre of the optical
   nonlinearity-induced phase shift arm.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusive design has traditionally dealt with physical design and
   differences in age and ability. However, as information technology
   becomes more pervasive, the new barriers to inclusivity are increasingly
   digital. Centring design around people can increase competitiveness and
   value, especially in fast-moving technology markets, but
   technology-specific, people-centred strategies need to be developed that
   build on existing inclusive design processes and go beyond the
   `technology-push needs-pull' approach to accommodate the social
   complexity that surrounds the everyday use of technology. This paper
   focuses on the challenges of implementing inclusive design in an
   technology context, illustrating this with examples drawn from the Royal
   College of Art Helen Hamlyn Centre (HHC). It outlines work done with
   Students within an educational context and projects completed by design
   graduates working with industry. The case studies aim to demonstrate an
   approach that brings together the user's voice and the designer's
   creativity to enable a more inclusive approach.}},

Abstract = {{Today, the consumer market calls for high-performance power supply
   systems. Existing sources and technologies are not abreast of portable
   electronics trends, thus pressing both the academic and industrial
   research to focus on innovative technologies. Customers' requirements
   lead to a growing interest in longer-lasting power, fast transient
   response power supply systems and a minimization of system weight,
   volume and cost. In this paper, a fuel cell supercapacitor hybrid power
   supply for a Digital Camera is proposed, although the control algorithm
   can be efficiently applied to any portable device. The power management
   system also provides the load levelling function, optimizing the
   hydrogen consumption. The stack current is directly controlled and a
   multiple-steady-state control technique is implemented, optimizing the
   hybrid source performances. The hybrid power supply is neither affected
   by the fuel cell transient response nor by the supercapacitor hank
   runtime. Experimental results on a laboratory prototype, powering a
   Fujifilm S5500 digital camera, are shown.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents innovative architectures of hybrid
   Continuous-Time/Discrete-Time (CT/DT) cascade Sigma Delta Modulators
   (Sigma Delta Ms) made up of a front-end CT stage and a back-end DT
   stage. In addition to increasing the digitized signal bandwidth as
   compared to conventional Sigma Delta Ms, the proposed topologies take
   advantage of the CT nature of the front-end Sigma Delta M stage, by
   embedding anti-aliasing filtering as well as their suitability to
   operate up to the GHz range. Moreover, the presented modulators include
   multi-bit quantization and Unity Signal Transfer Function (USTF) in both
   stages to reduce the integrator output swings, and programmable
   resonation to optimally distribute the zeroes of the overall Noise
   Transfer Function (NTF), such that the in-band quantization noise is
   minimized for each operation mode. Both local and inter-stage (global)
   based resonation architectures are synthesized and compared in terms of
   their circuit complexity, resolution-bandwidth programmability and
   robustness with respect to circuit non-ideal effects. The combination of
   all mentioned characteristics results in novel hybrid Sigma Delta Ms,
   very suited for the implementation of adaptive/reconfigurable
   Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) intended for the 4th Generation (4G)
   of wireless telecom systems.}},

Abstract = {{E-learning that integrates digital knowledge content, network and
   information technology has become an emerging learning method.
   E-learning is a knowledge intensive process, it is therefore necessary
   to manage the acquisition, storage, sharing, and innovation of knowledge
   to enhance the effectiveness of learning. As knowledge is the core of
   e-learning, knowledge identification, analysis, and modeling become the
   primary tasks in implementing e-learning. This paper presents a
   systematic approach for modeling teachers' knowledge for an e-learning
   platform based on the theory and technology of system engineering,
   knowledge management and knowledge engineering. This paper focuses on
   modeling knowledge of mathematics teaching for students with
   mathematical learning difficulties to support a KM-based e-learning

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe an innovative multimedia system that has been
   installed in the Spanish cities of Ubeda and Baeza whose Renaissance
   monumental ensembles has been declared World Heritage by UNESCO. The
   system offers an advanced information service and tourist guide to the
   visitors, and ensures that every tourist, just carrying an appropriate
   commercial mobile phone, gets the right information to enjoy and make
   the most of his visit in town in a personal manner. The service offered
   by the system to the user is proactive and personalized, taking into
   account the specific circumstances affecting each user: exact location,
   track followed, time and date, mobile terminal employed, etc. The user
   carries a personal device that becomes a new interface between him or
   her and the surroundings. The platform detects the presence of the user
   when he or she gets close to specifically determined location points. As
   a function of the users' context (location, time, track, etc.), the
   system sends them personalized relevant information. This project has
   been funded by the ``Ciudades Digitales{''} Program of the Ministry of
   Industry, Junta de Andalucia, Diputacion de Jaen and the City Councils

Abstract = {{The promise of Virtual Reality in design environments is to facilitate
   the interaction with digital models and to enhance the results of design
   activity. Design education is one of the most recent and interesting

   interfaces, Virtual Reality represents a new way to stimulate design
   students and to develop innovative teaching methods.
   The paper explores the impact of Virtual Reality technologies on design
   learning, with particular attention to mechanical product design. It is
   focused on the analysis of cognitive and technical aspects of learning
   processes and the definition of a proper evaluation protocol. The
   protocol is based on the classification of the most meaningful
   activities in mechanical engineering teaching and the identification of
   a set of metrics that enable to objectively evaluate the learning
   process. Assessing how VR supports design education, an experimental
   study is proposed. It is based on the comparison of three different
   approaches performed by two-dimensional drawings, by 3D CAD models and,
   finally, by virtual reality technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative solution that allows a multimedia
   session to be distributed over multiple devices that are in close
   proximity to a user This would typically be useful when a user engaged
   in an audio/video conference enters a meeting room. Upon entering, all
   media session components are transferred from the personal digital
   assistant (PDA) to the projector, Hi-Fi set, and webcam present in the
   meeting room. When the user leaves the room, all media session
   components are transferred back to the PDA. Transferring parts of a
   multimedia session between different devices is defined as partial
   session mobility (PSM). Numerous methods exist for PSM. None of these
   methods is directly suitable for initiating PSM from a dedicated network
   node such as an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) application server, but
   they do provide a starting point. Because of a number of advantages in
   the invite-based method, this method is taken as a basis for
   network-initiated PSM. This paper compares the existing methods,
   describes the proposed network-initiated method to support PSM, and
   investigates how to combine it with terminal-initiated PSM. It also
   describes how PSM could be supported in IMS. (C) 2008 Alcatel-Lucent.}},

Abstract = {{Digital services interfaced with mobile phone lines are gradually being
   regarded as a core product in this modem age due to the high
   transmission speed of mobile technology. The research in this paper is
   based on the concept of product inter-dependence and actively explores
   the different consumptive motivations between the consumers' behavior of
   phone-call users and those who use digital services. This study also
   attempts to use a modified diffusion model to estimate the consumers'
   collective behavior with a longitudinal approach. In this study, it can
   be inferred that psychological consumer motivations should dominate
   marketing policies. Thus, it was found that digital service users have
   more self-motivation and autonomy when adopting a new product because
   they have significantly higher innovative attributes than the segment of
   phone-call users. With these findings, we claim that we have discovered
   an unprecedented concept for marketing managers who welcome the
   challenges of mobile digital services in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Postcolonial and indigenous scholars suggest that creating alternative
   histories is a necessary activity for Native peoples in their recovery
   from the destructive emotional, behavioral, and political effects of
   colonial domination. The literature on history-making as a restorative
   process has focused on mental health, reversing negative representations
   of indigenous people in mainstream histories, and using Native histories
   to reclaim land and rights. In 2004, the Tule River Indian Tribe of
   Central California initiated an innovative history project to engage
   tribal elders in contributing historical information about themselves
   and their families for preservation by the Tribe. Theories and methods
   from postcolonial scholarship, anthropology, and occupational therapy
   (and its academic discipline occupational science) focused the Tule
   River Tribal History Project on providing meaningful and enjoyable
   activities-creating family trees, a tribal photo archive, interviews
   with elders, social gatherings and community discussions, and a website.
   The products were made available to participants in digital and printed
   formats. Copies have since been archived by the Tribal Council and also
   made available for tribal use at the Towanits Education Center on the
   Tule River Reservation. Pre-test and post-test survey data indicate: (1)
   the tribal elders' high valuation of the history-making activities; and
   (2) the positive impact of the program on social integration and
   spiritual well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive infinite impulse response (IIR) filters provide significant
   advantages over equivalent finite impulse response (FIR) implementations
   because they are able to more accurately model physical plants that have
   pole-zero structures. Additionally, they are typically capable of
   meeting performance specifications using fewer filter parameters. This
   savings in parameters, which can be as much as 5-10 times, leads to the
   use of fewer multiplier blocks and therefore, lower power consumption.
   Despite these advantages, adaptive IIR filters have not found widespread
   use because the associated mean squared error (MSE) cost function is
   multimodal and therefore, significantly difficult to minimize.
   Additionally, the filter can become unstable during adaptation. These
   two properties pose several problems for adaptive algorithms, causing
   them to be sensitive to initial conditions, produce biased solutions,
   unstable filter configurations or converge to local minima. These
   problems prevent the widespread use of adaptive IIR filters in practice
   and if such filter structures are to become more practical, new,
   innovative solutions are required. This paper proposes a new algorithm
   for minimizing the MSE cost function of adaptive IIR filters aimed at
   addressing some of the aforementioned issues. We adopt the approach of
   using a Branch-and-Bound algorithm, which is an exhaustive search
   method, and employ interval arithmetic for all computations. Simulation
   results show that the resulting algorithm is viable and competitive and,
   when compared with a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms,
   outperforms them in terms of the MSE of the final point.}},

Abstract = {{e-Governance is an emerging platform for improving digital access to
   cultural heritage. For residents, tourists, service providers and other
   users, e-governance can facilitate inclusion in destination promotion
   through user-relevant e-services. However, practice has yet to meet the
   challenge existing theory poses: traditional top-down approaches to
   decision-making and e-service development in urban cultural tourism are
   failing to ICT-enabled participatory approaches. This paper addresses
   this gap by adopt presenting an innovative e-governance model for the
   city of Genoa, Italy, which enables a user-relevant web-based promotion
   of local cultural heritage through inclusive management and
   participative e-services. A novel bottom-up Methodological approach is
   applied, combining action research with focus group activities involving
   multiple stakeholders. The outcome is increased digital access as a
   function of user inclusion and integrated e-services, available at all
   times, anywhere, and is made available by both providers and users.}},

Abstract = {{Web-based programming has become a popular and vital issue in recent
   years. The rapid growth of various applications not only demonstrates
   the importance of web-based programming, but also reveals the difficulty
   of training relevant skills. The difficulty is owing to the lack of
   facilities such as online coding, debugging and peer help to assist the
   students in promoting their cognitive development in web-based
   programming. To cope with these problems, in this paper. a web-based
   programming assisted system, ``WPAS{''}. is proposed, which is able to
   support five programming activities with various difficulty levels of
   cognition based on Bloom's cognitive taxonomy. WPAS provides online
   coding, debugging and annotation tools to conduct the training and peer
   assessment for web-based programming. Experimental results of 47
   undergraduate students show that the innovative approach is helpful to
   the students in improving their cognitive development in Web-based
   programming. In addition, according to the results of the questionnaire,
   most of the participants perceived the ease of use and usefulness of the
   proposed system. Therefore, this study suggests that teachers could
   design Web-based programming activities supported by the WPAS system to
   improve students' cognitive development in web-based programming. (C)

Abstract = {{Ronald Coase based his 1959 call for spectrum markets on theoretical
   conjecture. Today abundant evidence supports his case. Targeted
   liberalization in cellular markets, as contrasted with regulatory
   planning of the digital TV transition and other traditional policies,
   suggest enormous efficiency gains are available from wider use of ``the
   price system.{''} With exclusive frequency rights assigned to owners,
   markets widely reconfigure spectrum use, coordinating complex spectrum
   sharing. Resulting social gains include increased consumer surplus from
   enhanced technological innovation and wireless service competition. A
   social bonus arrives in the benefits associated with wider scope for
   free speech. Yet, the administrative allocation system continues to
   distribute rents and garner political support. Liberal reforms, in
   contrast, produce large but broadly dispersed efficiency gains and are
   undersupplied. This paper proposes an incremental extension of property
   rights in spectrum to move beyond the current rent-seeking equilibrium,
   eliminating the Federal Communications Commission's centralized spectrum
   allocation process and, with it, an ``attractive nuisance{''} generating
   anticonsumer outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Although the adoption of mobile phones has been skyrocketing globally
   during the current decade, present adoption levels are quite uneven
   across countries. Such disparities are also found over a range of other
   information and communications technologies and have been characterized
   as a ``digital divide.{''} Although the adoption of mobile phones has
   been the focus of numerous studies, relatively few have systematically
   and comprehensively investigated the adoption of this technological
   innovation at the country level of analysis and over a broad range of
   nations. This study addresses this research gap by examining the effects
   of three country-level socioeconomic factors paralleling the
   individual-level demographic traits that in past studies have
   predominantly predicted early adoption of innovations. We rely on
   secondary data obtained from several reputable sources to examine this
   phenomenon across 170 nations. Theoretical, managerial, and policy
   implications based on our empirical findings, along with directions for
   future research, are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A major problem for firms making information technology investment
   decisions is predicting and understanding the effects of future
   technological developments on the value of present technologies. Failure
   to adequately address this problem can result in wasted organization
   resources in acquiring, developing, managing, and training employees in
   the use of technologies that are short-lived and fail to produce
   adequate return on investment. The sheer number of available
   technologies and the complex set of relationships among them make IT
   landscape analysis extremely challenging. Most IT-consuming firms rely
   on third parties and suppliers for strategic recommendations on IT
   investments, which can lead to biased and generic advice. We address
   this problem by defining a new set of constructs and methodologies upon
   which we develop an IT ecosystem model. The objective of these artifacts
   is to provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis
   of information technology development trends and to reduce the
   complexity of the IT landscape for practitioners making IT investment
   decisions. We adopt a process theory perspective and use a combination
   of visual mapping and quantification strategies to develop our artifacts
   and a state diagram-based technique to represent evolutionary
   transitions over time. We illustrate our approach using two exemplars:
   digital music technologies and wireless networking technologies. We
   evaluate the utility of our approach by conducting in-depth interviews
   with IT industry experts and demonstrate the contribution of our
   approach relative to existing techniques for technology forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to launch a new platform for advocating
   three functions of paddies including economics, society and environment
   through the cross-field integration of the agricultural hydrology,
   information technology and children's picture book, which is novel. We
   translate literatures of paddy agriculture to popular content.
   Scientific visualization is applied to develop digital value-added
   content for enhancing effects according to computer graphics
   technologies. For developing the Internet channel, we take web-based
   architecture coupled with Java3D and Flash visualization as the main
   solution for engaging attention of virtual communities. With a web
   browser, we present paddy knowledge that is based on the above-mentioned
   popular content related to three functions of rice paddies. Furthermore,
   for the general public, the tiled display wall is employed to build up a
   fixed-site channel. In this paper, the demonstration of promoting
   interest in paddy fields has been established. Through exploring this
   digital paddy, not only children could be encouraged to learn, but also
   the public could accumulate the knowledge related to paddy agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{E-governance comprises the use of information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) to support public services, government
   administration, democratic processes, and relationships among citizens,
   civil society, the private sector, and the state. Developed over more
   than two decades of technology innovation and policy response, the
   evolution of e-governance is examined in terms of five interrelated
   objectives: a policy framework, enhanced public services, high-quality
   and cost-effective government operations, citizen engagement in
   democratic processes, and administrative and institutional reform. This
   summary assessment of e-governance in U.S. states and local governments
   shows that the greatest investment and progress have been made in
   enhanced public services and improved government operations. Policy
   development has moved forward on several fronts, but new policy issues
   continually add to an increasingly complex set of concerns. The least
   progress appears to have occurred in enhancing democracy and exploring
   the implications of e-governance for administrative and institutional
   reform. ICT-enabled governance will continue to evolve for the
   foreseeable future providing a dynamic environment for ongoing learning
   and action.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of telenursing within home healthcare of leg wounds
   is an innovative development initiative that focuses on patients and to
   some extent next-of-kin in collaboration with nurses. Eleven patients
   and nine nurses participated in the study. The methods for data
   collection were surveys, field-notes descriptions, and care charts, as
   well as digital photos of leg wounds and videotaped observations. The
   results show that the utility of virtual concept is that continual
   learning takes place for both patients and nurses. The patients felt
   positively about being able to via videophone see the staff caring for
   them, and seeing a face inspired a sense of security, which had a
   calming effect. The learning for nurses lay in the everyday work with
   leg wounds and their care as experiences were taken advantage of with
   the assistance of the interactive technique. The nurses felt that their
   time at work was better utilized and that the virtual communication
   between patients and nurses constituted a humane complement in home
   healthcare.}},

Abstract = {{The appearance of hair is one of the main evolutionary innovations in
   the amniote lineage leading to mammals. The main components of mammalian
   hair are cysteine-rich type I and type II keratins, also known as hard
   alpha-keratins or ``hair keratins.{''} To determine the evolutionary
   history of these important structural proteins, we compared the genomic
   loci of the human hair keratin genes with the homologous loci of the
   chicken and of the green anole lizard Anolis carolinenis. The genome of
   the chicken contained one type II hair keratin-like gene, and the lizard
   genome contained two type I and four type II hair keratin-like genes.
   Orthology of the latter genes and mammalian hair keratins was supported
   by gene locus synteny, conserved exon-intron organization, and amino
   acid sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. The lizard hair
   keratin-like genes were expressed most strongly in the digits,
   indicating a role in claw formation. In addition, we identified a novel
   group of reptilian cysteine-rich type I keratins that lack homologues in
   mammals. Our data show that cysteine-rich alpha-keratins are not
   restricted to mammals and suggest that the evolution of mammalian hair
   involved the co-option of pre-existing structural proteins.}},

Abstract = {{The author has previously reported on principles of diffusion of
   innovations, the processes by which new technologies become popularly
   adopted, specifically in relation to anatomy and education. In
   presentations on adopting handheld computers {[}personal digital
   assistants (PDAs)] and personal media players for health sciences
   education, particular attention has been directed to the anticipated
   integration of PDA functions into popular cellular telephones. However,
   limited distribution of early ``smartphones{''} (e. g., Palm Treo and
   Blackberry) has provided few potential users for anatomical learning
   resources. In contrast, iPod media players have been self-adopted by
   millions of students, and ``podcasting{''} has become a popular medium
   for distributing educational media content. The recently introduced
   Apple iPhone has combined smartphone and higher resolution media player
   capabilities. The author successfully tested the iPhone and the ``work
   alike{''} iPod touch wireless media player with text-based
   ``flashcard{''} resources, existing PDF educational documents, 3D
   clinical imaging data, lecture ``podcasts,{''} and clinical procedure
   video. These touch-interfaced, mobile computing devices represent just
   the first of a new generation providing practical, scalable wireless Web
   access with enhanced multimedia capabilities. With widespread student
   self-adoption of such new personal technology, educators can look
   forward to increasing portability of well-designed, multiplatform
   ``learn anywhere{''} resources. Anat Sci Ed 1:233-239, 2008. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{The flip chip, a type of chip mounting used in semiconductor devices,
   has become one of the most popular innovations in the semiconductor
   packaging industry. The height of flip-chip solder bumps ranges from 20
   to 140 mu m with a required measurement accuracy of 2 mu m.
   Three-dimensional (3-D) measurement of flip-chip solder bumps is crucial
   to flip-chip manufacturing quality and process control. Currently, 3-D
   measurement systems for flip-chip solder bumps are mainly based on laser
   scanning techniques. However, they require a high implementation cost,
   and suffer from low inspection speed due to the physical line-scanning
   process. In this paper, a fast and cost-effective 3-D measurement system
   for flip-chip solder bumps is proposed. The proposed system is based on
   a phase shift technique, in which the phase is accurately shifted by a
   software-controlled grating using a digital light processing (DLP) unit
   that allows full-field measurement of a projected flip chip. The DLP
   unit can provide a higher fringe-contrast pattern at a faster changing
   time than a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel. Phase shift-based
   measurement systems require a calibrated system parameter, which is
   generally considered a fixed value in currently available methods. In
   this paper, adaptive parameter values, instead of a fixed value, are
   used to improve measurement accuracy. The proposed system also adopts a
   fringe-contrast thresholding to solve the pseudo-surface height problem
   for high reflective solder bumps and low reflective substrate in a flip
   chip. Experiments have shown that the 3-D measurement of flip-chip
   solder bumps is very efficient and effective with the proposed system.
   Computation time of the proposed 3-D measurement system for a 640 x 480
   image that contains almost 500 solder bumps is less than 1 s, and
   measurement accuracy meets the required specification of 2 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{Piecewise constant (PWC) waveforms consisting of amplitude-modulated
   edges (AMEs) are an important signal family in optical communication
   technology. The sampling of PWC signals by an analog-to-digital
   converter (ADC) requires an extremely high sampling rate. In this paper,
   we show that PWC signals can be measured and reconstructed using a
   parallel capacitor-resistor network (PCRN). The reconstruction of the
   amplitudes and arrival times of p AMEs occurring during one sampling
   period is possible using 2p parallel CR-filters whose outputs are
   simultaneously sampled. The PCRN significantly reduces the sampling rate
   of the ADC, and the reconstruction algorithm is manageable on
   microprocessor and very large scale integration circuits. We describe
   several variations and applications of the PCRN sampling scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a monolithic complimentary metaloxide-semiconductor
   (CMOS) autocompensated sensor transducer for capacitive measuring
   systems is newly presented. The proposed converter is compact and robust
   to integrate in capacitive measuring systems. The proposed
   autocompensated sensor transducer is attractive due to the fact that a
   digitized signal is produced without realizing the analog-to-digital
   converter. Hence, the hardware cost could be reduced. Furthermore, the
   output signal of the proposed transducer is a pulse stream; it could be
   easily sent over a wide range of transmission media, such as package
   switch networks (PSNs), radios, and optical, infrared (IR), and
   ultrasonic media. Another innovation is that the proposed automatic
   compensation circuits enhance and compensate the linear relation between
   the variable capacitance of the detected sensor and the output digital
   frequency over a wide dynamic frequency range. Measurement results have
   successfully verified the functions and the performance of the proposed
   autocompensated sensor transducer and confirmed that it is possible to
   apply it to the air pressure sensor. The area of this chip is 940 x 1080
   mu m(2) and the power consumption is 6.4 mW. The proposed transducer is
   not only suitable for capacitive measuring systems but also practical
   for application in the front-end systems of the wireless sensor network.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile games have emerged as the most innovative entertainment
   technology, adding new revenue streams, taking advantage of the
   potential of wireless consumer applications and service offerings.
   Mobile games, like any other types of computer game, offer a unique
   value for users in providing an exciting digital experience in virtual
   worlds. Players can become empowered through the development of new
   characters and strategies within games to achieve rewarding successes
   against the computers and other players. In this paper, we attempt to
   investigate the factors influencing the usage and acceptance of the
   mobile games in Korea, based on the extended version of the Technology
   Acceptance Model(TAM).
   Based on data collected from on-line survey, we show that perceived ease
   of use and perceived enjoyment motivates mobile game users to play
   mobile games, and that these two factors are empirically shown to
   determine perceived usefulness, implying that perceived ease of use and
   perceived enjoyment ate the direct and indirect determinant of intention
   to use. In addition, se (expressiveness and subjective norms have been
   showed to significantly and directly affect perceived usefulness. It was
   also confirmed that self-efficacy and operational quality of device are
   the antecedents of perceived ease of use. The contents of mobile games
   as well as perceived enjoyment was used as a determinant of perceived
   ease of use, and the statistical results confirm that they played a
   critical role in determining perceptions of enjoyment, and indirectly
   affecting perceived usefulness.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors propose that the canonical customer-toolkit
   dyad in mass customization (MC) should be complemented with user
   communities. Many companies in various industries have begun to offer
   their customers the opportunity to design their own products online. The
   companies provide Web-based MC toolkits that allow customers who prefer
   individualized products to tailor items such as sneakers, personal
   computers (PCs), cars, kitchens, cereals, or skis to their specific
   preferences. Most existing MC toolkits are based on the underlying
   concept of an isolated, dyadic interaction process between the
   individual customer and the MC toolkit. Information from external
   sources is not provided. As a result, most academic research on MC
   toolkits has focused on this dyadic perspective. The main premise of
   this paper is that novice MC toolkit users in particular might largely
   benefit from information given by other customers. Pioneering research
   shows that customers in the computer gaming and digital music
   instruments industries are willing to support each other for the sake of
   efficient toolkit use (e.g., how certain toolkit functions work).
   Expanding on their work, the present paper provides evidence that peer
   assistance appears also extremely useful in the two other major phases
   of the customer's individual self-design process, namely, the
   development of an initial idea and the evaluation of a preliminary
   design solution. Two controlled experiments were conducted in which 191
   subjects used an MC toolkit to design their own individual skis. The
   authors found that during the phase of developing an initial idea,
   having access to other users' designs as potential starting points
   stimulates the integration of existing solution chunks into the
   problem-solving process, which indicates more systematic problem-solving
   behavior. Peer customer input also turned out to have positive effects
   on the evaluation of preliminary design solutions. Providing other
   customers' opinions on interim design solutions stimulated favorable
   problem-solving behavior, namely, the integration of external feedback.
   The use of these two problem-solving heuristics in turn leads to an
   improved process outcome-that is, self-designed products that meet the
   preferences of the customers more effectively (measured in terms of
   perceived preference fit, purchase intention, and willingness to pay).
   These findings have important theoretical and managerial implications.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, a major policy and regulatory problem for
   governments in Australia and elsewhere has been the implementation of
   strategies to switch from analogue to digital television broadcasting
   systems. Despite extensive debate, the transition to digital
   broadcasting remains fraught. What seems to be a technical matter
   conceals a range of intractable social, economic and cultural policy
   decisions. This article explores son ne of the challenges of digital
   television through the prism of an earlier; and often overlooked,
   transformation of television, namely the consumer-driven uptake of what
   can be called the `new television technologies' of the 1970s and 1980s.
   These earlier forms of new television help to highlight several
   arguments: that television was not a stable object prior to digital
   broadcasting; that the connections between television and broadcasting
   have been contingent and provisional; and that a remarkable degree of
   innovation, disruption and adaptation has occurred at the fringes of the
   broadcasting system, leading to the creation of new audiovisual
   economies on the boundaries of the household and the market. The article
   then considers some examples of the ways in which this `household
   sector' is developing as a new policy problem.}},

Abstract = {{Porosity is a key feature of a thermally sprayed coating microstructure.
   Within ceramic coatings, porosity is made of pores and cracks of various
   shapes, dimensions, and orientations. Cracks can be intralamellar or
   interlamellar due to the buildup of the coating, which leads to piled-up
   lamellae from impinging and the additional rapid solidification of
   liquid droplets. Pores are interconnected with cracks, which results in
   a three-dimensional (3-D) porosity network. Direct observation of this
   network is an intricate task and current attempts remain somewhat
   limited. A 3-D simulation of this network was, therefore, developed in
   this work, based on a stochastic approach to the building up of
   simulated lamellae in the sprayed microstructure. A library of
   mathematical objects was achieved from morphological measurements, using
   confocal microscopy of actual isolated flattened lamellae, i.e.,
   ``splats{''} and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This stochastic
   approach to the simulation of hundreds of lamellae also involves the
   random distribution of cracks and pores. Simulation fit parameters were
   selected according to the overall characteristics of porosity (i.e.,
   content, orientation, size, etc.) that were determined from the thorough
   quantitative image analysis (QIA) of cross-sectioned plasma-sprayed
   alumina coatings. Two plasma modes that varied the atmosphere in a
   controlled-atmosphere plasma spraying (CAPS) chamber were applied, to
   produce the microstructures of two different alumina coatings. The 3-D
   random modeling tool allowed the processing of a volume of digital
   material through a 3-D simulated binary image of a two-phased composite
   material. Using one 3-D image result of the simulation, finite element
   (FE) calculations were performed, in order to study the overall
   dielectric properties of a plasma-sprayed alumina as a function of
   porosity. The influence of anisotropy is discussed, in particular, and
   both analytical and numerical predicted values were compared to
   experimental ones. The presence of the defects related to both digital
   coatings is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To analyze image artifact types and occurrence frequency when
   using a phosphor storage plate (PSP) digital radiographic system.
   Study design. A total of 15,912 scanned digital images were evaluated by
   3 observers, and image artifacts were classified into: 1) operator
   errors; 2) scanning errors; 3) PSP plate defects. To avoid damage to the
   sensor plate, a modification technique innovated by Roberts and Mol was
   used where needed and 2 double-sided pieces of tape were placed around
   the sensor plate covering.
   Results. A total of 643 image artifacts were identified. The main image
   artifact cause was operator error (n = 554), followed by defects of
   plate (n = 60) and scanning (n = 29). Scanning errors could generally be
   corrected by rescanning, but most other artifacts required image
   retaking. The use of a modified clinical technique greatly reduced
   artifacts caused by wearing of the sensor plate (20\%).
   Conclusions. Modified methods to decrease the occurrence of image
   artifacts using PSP digital radiographic system are encouraged. (Oral

Abstract = {{Recent excavations and high-precision radiocarbon dating from the
   largest Iron Age (IA, ca. 1200-500 BCE) copper production center in the
   southern Levant demonstrate major smelting activities in the region of
   biblical Edom (southern Jordan) during the loth and 9th centuries BCE.
   Stratified radiocarbon samples and artifacts were recorded with precise
   digital surveying tools linked to a geographic information system
   developed to control on-site spatial analyses of archaeological finds
   and model data with innovative visualization tools. The new radiocarbon
   dates push back by 2 centuries the accepted IA chronology of Edom. Data
   from Khirbat en-Nahas, and the nearby site of Rujm Hamra Ifdan,
   demonstrate the centrality of industrial-scale metal production during
   those centuries traditionally linked closely to political events in
   Edom's loth century BCE neighbor ancient Israel. Consequently, the rise
   of IA Edom is linked to the power vacuum created by the collapse of Late
   Bronze Age (LB, ca. 1300 BCE) civilizations and the disintegration of
   the LB Cypriot copper monopoly that dominated the eastern Mediterranean.
   The methodologies applied to the historical IA archaeology of the Levant
   have implications for other parts of the world where sacred and
   historical texts interface with the material record.}},

Title = {{Telemedicine in interdisciplinary work practices: On an IT system that
   met the criteria for success set out by its sponsors, yet failed to
   become part of every-day clinical routines}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Information systems can play a key role in care innovations
   including task redesign and shared care. Many demonstration projects
   have presented evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness and high
   levels of patient satisfaction. Yet these same projects often fail to
   become part of everyday clinical routines. The aim of the paper is to
   gain insight into a common paradox that a technology can meet the
   criteria for success set out at the start of the project yet fail to
   become part of everyday clinical routines.
   Methods: We evaluated a telecare service set up to reduce the workload
   of ophthalmologists. In this project, optometrists in 10 optical shops
   made digital images to detect patients with glaucoma which were further
   assessed by trained technicians in the hospital. Over a period of three
   years, we conducted interviews with the project team and the users about
   the workability of the system and its integration in practice. Beside
   the interviews, we analyzed record data to measure the quality of the
   images. We compared the qualitative accounts with these measurements.
   Results: According to our measurements, the quality of the images was at
   least satisfactory in 90\% of the cases, i. e. the images could be used
   to screen the patients-reducing the workload of the ophthalmologist
   considerably. However, both the ophthalmologist and the optometrists
   became increasingly dissatisfied respectively with the perceived quality
   of the pictures and the perceived workload.
   Through a detailed analysis of how the professionals discussed the
   quality of the pictures, we reconstructed how the notion of quality of
   the images and being a good professional were constructed and linked.
   The IT system transformed into a quality system and, at the same time,
   transformed the notions of being a good professional. While a continuous
   dialogue about the quality of the pictures became an emblem for the
   quality of care, this dialogue was hindered by the system and the way
   the care process was structured.
   Conclusion: To conceptualize what telemedicine does in interdisciplinary
   work practices, a fine-tuned analysis is needed to assess how IT systems
   re-shape the social relations between professional groups. Such
   transformations should not be exclusively attributed to the technology
   itself or to the professionals working with it. Instead we need to
   assess these technologies through an empirically grounded study of the
   sociotechnical functioning of telemedicine.}},

Title = {{The effect of genetic robustness on evolvability in digital organisms}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recent work has revealed that many biological systems keep
   functioning in the face of mutations and therefore can be considered
   genetically robust. However, several issues related to robustness remain
   poorly understood, such as its implications for evolvability (the
   ability to produce adaptive evolutionary innovations).
   Results: Here, we use the Avida digital evolution platform to explore
   the effects of genetic robustness on evolvability. First, we obtained
   digital organisms with varying levels of robustness by evolving them
   under combinations of mutation rates and population sizes previously
   shown to select for different levels of robustness. Then, we assessed
   the ability of these organisms to adapt to novel environments in a
   variety of experimental conditions. The data consistently support that,
   for simple environments, genetic robustness fosters long-term
   evolvability, whereas, in the short-term, robustness is not beneficial
   for evolvability but may even be a counterproductive trait. For more
   complex environments, however, results are less conclusive.
   Conclusion: The finding that the effect of robustness on evolvability is
   time-dependent is compatible with previous results obtained using RNA
   folding algorithms and transcriptional regulation models. A likely
   scenario is that, in the short-term, genetic robustness hampers
   evolvability because it reduces the intensity of selection, but that, in
   the long-term, relaxed selection facilitates the accumulation of genetic
   diversity and thus, promotes evolutionary innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Since both the parents need to work and look after their babies/infants
   simultaneously, the families bear more workload. Thus, this paper
   presents an innovative infant monitoring system consisting of an
   embedded system platform with a Linux kernel embedded operation system
   using the TCP/IP protocol, a CMOS image sensor, and peripheral control
   systems. The key feature of the system is that it can be used to monitor
   the living environment and the activities of the babies and/or infants
   through a web browser at any time from any place in the world. In order
   to increase the accuracy of the temperature sensor, the measured values
   from the digital temperature sensor were calibrated using regression
   analysis methods, resulting in an accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees C, a
   correlation coefficient of 0.996, and a standard deviation of 0.124. The
   experimental results show that the proposed concept and the resulting
   system are feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Geoarchaeology is the application of geological and geomorphological
   techniques to archaeology and the study of the interactions of hominins
   with the natural environment at a variety of temporal and spatial
   scales. Geoarchaeology in the UK over the last twenty years has
   flourished largely because it has gone beyond technological and
   scientific applications. Over the same period our ability to reconstruct
   the 3-dimensional stratigraphy of fluvial deposits and the matrix of
   fluvial sites has increased dramatically because of a number of
   technological advances. These have included the use of LiDAR (laser
   imaging) and radar to produce high-resolution digital surface models,
   the use of geophysics, particularly ground penetrating radar and
   electrical resistivity. to produce sediment depth models, and the use of
   GIS and data visualisation techniques to manipulate and display the
   data. These techniques along with more systematic and detailed
   sedimentological recording of exposed sections have allowed the
   construction of more precise 3-dimensional (volumetric) models of the
   matrix of artefacts within fluvial deposits. Additionally a revolution
   in dating techniques, particularly direct sediment dating by
   luminescence methods, has enabled the creation of 4-dimensional models
   of the creation and preservation of these sites.
   These 4-dimensional models have the ability to provide far more
   information about the processes of site creation, preservation and even
   destruction, and also allow the integration of these processes with
   independent data sources concerning cultural evolution and climatic
   change. All improvements in the precision of dating fluvial deposits
   have archaeological importance in our need to translate events from a
   sequential or geological timeframe to human timescales. This allows
   geoarchaeology to make a more direct contribution to cultural history
   through the recognition of agency at the individual or group level. This
   data can then form a component of biocomplexity or agent-based modelling
   which is becoming increasingly used in the natural sciences,
   particularly ecology and geomorphology and which can be used to test
   scenarios including the impact on, and response of, hominins to abrupt
   or catastrophic environmental change. Whilst catastrophic events clearly
   represent the atypical they can be illuminating in revealing cognitive
   processes resulting in abandonment. coping. mitigation and innovation.
   These points are exemplified using two in-depth case studies: one from
   the Holocene geoarchaeological record of the River Trent in Central
   England and the other from the Palaeolithic record from rivers in South
   West Britain. In the former the interaction between climate change and
   human activity is illustrated at the year to century timescale whilst in
   the other the timescale is millennial. These case studies have
   deliberately been chosen to be as different as possible in temporal and
   spatial scale with the aim of examining the applicability of
   methodological and theoretical aspects of geoarchaeology. Lastly the
   paper considers the problem of scale in geoarchaeology, and concludes it
   is process-dependency, which ultimately affects the questions we can
   ask, and that questions of human response to climate change are
   fundamentally a product of materiality and cognitive processes. This
   demands an in-depth contextual approach to such questions rather than
   database-driven assertions of causality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{As an example of the recently introduced concept of rate of innovation,
   signals that are linear combinations of a finite number of Diracs per
   unit time can be acquired by linear filtering followed by uniform
   sampling. However, in reality, samples are rarely noiseless. In this
   paper, we introduce a novel stochastic algorithm to reconstruct a signal
   with finite rate of innovation from its noisy samples. Even though
   variants of this problem have been approached previously, satisfactory
   solutions are only available for certain classes of sampling kernels,
   for example, kernels that satisfy the Strang-Fix condition. In this
   paper, we consider the infinite-support Gaussian kernel, which does not
   satisfy the Strang-Fix condition. Other classes of kernels can be
   employed. Our algorithm is based on Gibbs sampling, a Markov chain Monte
   Carlo method. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the accuracy
   and robustness of our algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A new method to estimate the vertical crustal motion from satellite
   altimetry over land was developed. The method was tested around Hudson
   Bay, where the observed vertical motion is largely caused by the
   incomplete glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) as a result of the
   Laurentide ice sheet deglaciation since the last glacial maximum (LGM).
   Decadal (1992-2003) TOPEX/POSEIDON radar altimetry data over land
   surfaces were used. The results presented here are improved compared to
   a previous study (Lee, H., Shum, CX, Kuo, C.Y., Yi, Y., Braun, A., 2008.
   Application of TOPEX altimetry for solid Earth deformation studies. Tern
   Atmos. Ocean. Sci. 19, 37-46. doi: 10.3319/TAO.2008.19.1-2.37(SA).)
   which estimated vertical motion only over relatively flat land surfaces
   (standard deviation of the height variation <40 cm). In this study, we
   extended the concept of traditional 1-Hz (one-per-frame) radar altimeter
   ocean stackfiles to build 10-Hz (10-per-frame) land stackfiles over
   Hudson Bay land regions, and succeeded in obtaining vertical motion
   estimates over much rougher surfaces (standard deviation of the height
   variation < 2 m). 90-m C-band Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)
   Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is used as a reference surface to select
   an optimal waveform retracker, to correct surface gradient errors, and
   to calculate land surface anomalies. Here, we developed an alternative
   retracker, called the modified threshold retracker, resulting in decadal
   vertical motion time series over a 1500 km by 1000 km region covering
   northern Ontario, northeastern Manitoba, and the Great Lakes region
   which is at the margin of the former Laurentide ice sheet. The average
   of the estimated uncertainties for the vertical motion is 2.9 mm/year
   which is comparable to 2.1 mm/year of recent GPS solutions. The
   estimated vertical motion is compared with other geodetic observations
   from GPS, tide gauge/altimetry, GRACE, and several GIA models. The data
   agree best with the laterally varying 3D GIA model, RF3S20 (beta = 0.4)
   whereas the combination of land altimetry solution with other
   measurements match best with the models RF3S20 (beta = 0.0) or RF3S20
   (beta =0.2) in terms of mean and standard deviation of the differences.
   It is anticipated that this innovative technique could potentially be
   used to provide additional constraints for GIA model improvement, and be
   applied to other geodynamics studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Endovenous chemical ablation is a technique for treatment of
   great saphenous vein insufficiency. However, echogenic phenomena in the
   right heart and high intensity transient signals detected by
   transcranial Doppler have been described subsequent to foam
   sclerotherapy. An ischemic event after foam sclerotherapy of the great
   saphenous vein was reported recently in a patient with all Occult patent
   foramen ovale. Another concern is the effects of sclerosant foam oil the
   pulmonary microvasculature.
   Objective: This study is a retrospective report comparing the utility of
   three commonly used techniques for reducing sclerosant foam migration
   during ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein.
   Methods: Group I consisted of 20 patients treated with ultrasound-guided
   foam sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein while lying supine, with
   digital pressure used to occlude the saphenofemoral junction. In group
   2, 19 patients underwent injection while the leg was elevated 30
   degrees, with digital pressure at the saphenofemoral junction. Group 3
   comprised 19 patients injected while the leg was elevated but without
   manual compression at the saphenofemoral junction. All patients were
   monitored with subcostal echocardiography during the injection and for 3
   to 5 minutes after.
   Results. Echogenic phenomena were demonstrated in the right heart in all
   20 patients in group 1, in 16 of 19 in group 2, and in nine of 19 in
   group 3. There was a statistically significant difference in the
   incidence of echogenic phenomena between groups I and 3 using the Fisher
   exact test (P <.001). A significant difference in incidence was also
   present when groups 2 and 3 were compared (P <.038). In groups I and 2,
   a concentrated bolus of bubbles was frequently observed after release of
   digital pressure; however, less intense echogenic phenomena were seen in
   group 3 where injection was performed with the leg elevated but without
   manual pressure at the saphenofemoral junction. No echogenic phenomena
   were observed in the left heart, and no complications occurred.
   Short-term treatment results were equivalent among the three groups.
   Conclusions. Ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein
   using foam sclerosants is best performed with the leg elevated and no
   occlusive pressure at the saphenofemoral junction in order to reduce the
   risk of gas embolization to the central nervous system. Further study is
   needed to assess the midterm success of this technique and to confirm
   the effect of rising foam produced from physiologic gases.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the influence of culture on digital libraries of the
   first wave. The local cultures of innovation of five European national
   libraries (Biblioteca nacional de Portugal, Bibliotheque nationale de

   with policy makers and developers of institutional digital libraries.
   The theories of culture and organizational rationality, social-choice
   systems, and strategies of organizational behavior helped articulate the
   framework for analysis. The study provides a historical foundation for
   understanding the processes of innovation in the earliest digital
   projects and digital libraries that resulted in an initial mass of
   digitized heritage material. Theory, methodology, institutional
   histories, and a summary of findings are presented here. Part II will

Abstract = {{The main scope of this work is the development of a robot controller for
   the manipulation of fabrics lying on a work table towards the sewing
   process. A fuzzy visual servoing manipulator controller is developed to
   guide the fabric along the sewing line. The paper focuses on handling
   fabrics with curved edges by locally approximating the curve section
   with straight-line segments. An innovative algorithm based on the
   dominant point detection method and the genetic-based method is
   incorporated in the robot visual servoing system to achieve sewing of
   the curved edges. Simulation and experimental tests are conducted to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results
   demonstrate that this approach is efficient and effective for the
   polygonal approximation, and the proposed robotic system is proved to be
   robust and efficient, achieving acceptable seam accuracy in the minimum
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Since the late 1990s, the music industry has been undergoing a period of
   significant and crisis-ridden changes, which was initiated and forced by
   a new set of technologies: digitalization, data compression and the
   internet. This paper analyzes the repercussions of this new
   technological constellation on the socioeconomic structures and
   institutions of this sector. The reconstruction of this technology-based
   sectoral transformation shows that the constitutive impulses for
   restructuring came from the fringes of the sector and from external
   actors. The established companies in the music business were hesitant in
   accepting the new technological challenges. They initially reacted with
   blockades and containment strategies and only defined a strategical
   repositioning upon massive and indisputable pressure to change. The
   paper argues that the low ability to anticipate and adapt to these
   technological, organizational and institutional challenges is due to the
   interplay of several factors. Among these are (L) general difficulties
   to anticipate the socioeconomic impact of fundamentally new
   technological opportunities, (2.) complex and time-consuming processes
   of establishing a new techno-institutional match, (3.) the technological
   conservatism and (4.) the oligopolistic structure of the sector as well
   as (5.) the hierarchically structured core companies. Together these
   factors obstructed a controlled sectoral transformation led by the
   established core players.}},

Abstract = {{There is an alarming increase in the number of cybercrime incidents
   through anonymous e-mails. The problem of e-mail authorship attribution
   is to identify the most plausible author of an anonymous e-mail from a
   group of potential suspects. Most previous contributions employed a
   traditional classification approach, such as decision tree and Support
   Vector Machine (SVM), to identify the author and studied the effects of
   different writing style features on the classification accuracy.
   However, little attention has been given on ensuring the quality of the
   evidence. In this paper, we introduce an innovative data mining method
   to capture the write-print of every suspect and model it as combinations
   of features that occurred frequently in the suspect's e-mails. This
   notion is called frequent pattern, which has proven to be effective in
   many data mining applications, but it is the first time to be applied to
   the problem of authorship attribution. Unlike the traditional approach,
   the extracted write-print by our method is unique among the suspects
   and, therefore, provides convincing and credible evidence for presenting
   it in a court of law. Experiments on real-life e-mails suggest that the
   proposed method can effectively identify the author and the results are
   supported by a strong evidence. (c) 2008 Digital Forensic Research

Abstract = {{Inductor current sensing is becoming widely used in current programmed
   controllers for microprocessor applications. This method exploits a
   low-pass filter in parallel with the inductor to provide lossless
   current sense. A major drawback of inductor current sensing is that
   accurate sense the dc and ac components of the current signal requires
   precise matching between the low-pass filter time constant and the
   inductor time constant (L/R(L)). However, matching accuracy depends on
   the tolerance of the components and on the operating conditions;
   therefore it can hardly be guaranteed. To overcome this problem, a novel
   digital autotuning system is proposed that automatically compensates any
   time constant mismatch. This autotuning system has been developed for
   voltage regulator module (VRM) current programmed controllers. It makes
   it possible to meet the adaptive voltage positioning requirements using
   conventional and low cost components, and to solve problems such as
   aging effects, temperature variations, and process tolerances as well. A
   prototype of the autotuning system based on a field-programmable gate
   array and a commercial dc/dc controller has been designed and tested.
   The experimental results fully confirmed the effectiveness of the
   proposed method, showing an improvement of the current sense precision
   from about 30\% up to 4\%. This innovative solution is suitable to
   fulfill the challenging accuracy specifications required by the future
   VRM applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a combined Proportional-Integral (PI) and state feedback
   linear discrete control scheme is proposed for non-linear stochastic
   systems. The state-dependent optimal linear model of the original
   non-linear plant is first constructed from system state feedback at each
   sampling period, then the discrete linear quadratic regulator approach
   with pole placement is applied to issue and update controller settings.
   If the system is under stochastic process noise, the innovation form of
   Kalman gain can be employed for optimal states estimation without
   requiring prior knowledge of noise properties. Stability conditions for
   sampled-data non-linear systems are addressed in discrete-time analysis.
   The effectiveness of the proposed method will be demonstrated by the
   simulation examples of both single-input single-output and multi-input
   multi-output non-linear processes.}},

Abstract = {{A survey on status and trends of information and communication
   technologies (ICT) use for knowledge sharing in agriculture was
   attempted. Among asian countries, India comes under the second next
   category after the advanced used category comprising Japan, South Korea
   and Taiwan. Both profit-motive and business augmentation on one hand and
   community services and rural welfare on the other have been the
   objectives of ICT-based models in agriculture in India. Major ICTs
   endeavours for agriculture and rural concerns include multifaceted
   projects and services of National Informatics Centre, `Bhoomi' of
   Karnataka, Village Information Centres of Government of India, ITC's
   e-Choupal, TARAhaat, iKisan.com, i-Villages of Ruducherry (formerly
   Pondicherry) of Swaminathan Research Foundation, i-Community of
   Hewlett-Packard, Warana Wired Village Project, n-Logue, `Gyandoot' of
   Government of Madhya Pradesh, Knowledge Network for Grass Root
   Innovations of the Society for Research and Initiatives for Sustainable
   Technologies and Institution, Traditional Knowledge Digital Library and
   several others. The ICT endeavours for agriculture belong to a wide
   array of agencies, viz private sector, public sector, self-help groups
   and NGOs, and also include combined endeavours. e-Learning is being
   increasingly resorted to both in (i) in campus or `presence' mode, and
   (ii) `distance' mode. Its use is gradually easing-out the stakeholders
   from the stranglehold of the inter-deterrence of the 3 arms of the `Iron
   Triangle', viz (i) quality, (ii) access, and (iii) cost. The social
   groups having less mobility are poised to benefit more from this mode of
   education. This Could also be one of the potent tools to bring about
   gender mainstreaming. e-Learning is being integrated into the existing
   organizational and educational structure as a hybrid system that can be
   called `ICT-supported learning'. Connectivity, content development,
   infrastructure development, faculty development, need assessment on a
   continuum, linking the nodes and formation of consortia etc. are the
   areas identified that need to be supported and developed.}},

Abstract = {{Re-evolution of complex biological features following the extinction of
   taxa bearing them remains one of evolution's most interesting phenomena,
   but is not amenable to study in fossil taxa. We used communities of
   digital organisms (computer programs that self-replicate, mutate and
   evolve), subjected to periods of low resource availability, to study the
   evolution, loss and re-evolution of a complex computational trait, the
   function EQU (bit-wise logical equals). We focused our analysis on cases
   where the pre-extinction EQU clade had surviving descendents at the end
   of the extinction episode. To see if these clades retained the capacity
   to re-evolve EQU, we seeded one set of multiple subreplicate `replay'
   populations using the most abundant survivor of the pre-extinction EQU
   clade, and another set with the actual end-extinction ancestor of the
   organism in which EQU re-evolved following the extinction episode. Our
   results demonstrate that stochastic, historical, genomic and ecological
   factors can lead to constraints on further adaptation, and facilitate or
   hinder re-evolution of a complex feature.}},

Abstract = {{The competitive market environment has evolved from a physical market
   environment (PME) to an Internet-enabled market environment (IME)
   encompassing the physical and electronic marketplaces. At the same time,
   an increasing number of information products are available in both
   analog and digital forms. For information products in digital form, the
   IME also serves as a distribution channel. Such developments raise
   questions concerning the extent to which extant perspectives on
   first-mover advantage developed in the context of the PME hold in the
   IME, generally, and for information products specifically. We address
   this issue by developing a conceptual framework that focuses on selected
   sources of first-mover advantage delineated in the extant literature and
   advance propositions concerning sources that will have a greater or
   lower effect in the IME relative to the PME. A central message for
   first-movers in the IME that emerges from our conceptual analysis is to
   focus on achieving superior positions in resources that would enable
   them to get close to the customers fast, create switching costs, and
   retain them though ongoing investments in multi-faceted innovations. A
   second message that emerges for first-movers in the IME is they must
   take note of and make strategic adjustments for the potentially
   diminished significance of some traditional sources of first-mover
   advantage. These sources include spatial preemption, preemptive
   investment in capacity, and consumers' choice behavior under conditions
   of uncertainty about product quality. We discuss the implications for
   further conceptual and empirical work in this area of increasing
   significance.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless communications technologies have undergone rapid changes over
   the last 30 years from analog approaches to digital-based systems. These
   technologies have improved on many fronts including bandwidth, range,
   and power requirements. Development of new telecommunications
   technologies is critical. It requires many years of efforts. In order to
   be competitive, it is critical to establish a roadmap of future
   technologies. This paper presents a framework to characterize, assess
   and forecast the wireless communication technologies. A DEA-based
   methodology was used for predicting the state-of-the-art in future

Abstract = {{This study analyses the cost of a low-volume basket of mobile services
   across a sample of Latin American countries, and contrasts these results
   with standard income and poverty indicators. The main goal is to
   establish how affordable mobile services are for the poor. Three general
   findings emerge. First, the poor generally pay a cost premium for using
   prepaid subscriptions that allow better expenditure control, though in
   many cases this premium is much lower than expected. Second,
   affordability is an important predictor of mobile penetration. Overall,
   while affordable handsets and the calling-party-pays system allow a
   significant number of low-income Latin Americans to become mobile
   subscribers, the results reveal that the current tariff structure has an
   inhibiting effect on service consumption by the poor. Third, since
   affordability is the most significant barrier to extending the reach of
   mobile services, as well as the range of services used by the poor,
   priority should be placed on policies aimed at reducing tariffs and
   stimulating the introduction of commercial innovations for low-income
   groups. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When policy issues involve complex technical questions, demonstrations
   are more likely to marshal charts, graphs, models, and simulations than
   to mobilize popular movements in the streets. In this paper we analyze
   PowerPoint demonstrations, the most ubiquitous form of digital
   demonstrations. Our first set of demonstrations are the PowerPoint
   presentations made in December 2002 by the seven finalist architectural
   teams in the Innovative Design competition for rebuilding the World
   Trade Center. Our second case occurred some blocks away, several months
   later: Colin Powell's PowerPoint demonstration at the United Nations. We
   argue that Edward Tufte's denunciation of PowerPoint does not capture
   the cognitive style made possible by the affordances of this pervasive
   new technology. On the basis of our case materials, we demonstrate the
   distinctive morphology of PowerPoint. Its digital character provides
   affordances (1) that allow heterogeneous materials to be seamlessly
   re-presented in a single format that (2) can morph easily from live
   demonstration to circulating digital documents that (3) can be utilized
   in counter-demonstrations. A careful examination of this widely used
   technology is critical for understanding public discourse in a
   democratic society.}},

Abstract = {{Wound measurement is essential in assessing the progress of wound
   healing. The most commonly used tools include wound tracings, width and
   length measurements, and digital photography. These methods have been
   useful in clinical practice but have some limitations, such as lack of
   accuracy, difficulty of use, and often entail wound contact. More
   advanced equipment tends to be bulky, heavy, and expensive. The
   following reviews the authors' experience with a new wound measurement
   and documentation system, the ARANZ Medical Silhouette Mobile (TM)
   (ARANZ Medical, Christchurch, New Zealand). This innovative device
   combines a digital camera and structured lighting in the form of 2 laser
   beams to automatically correct for image scale and skin curvature,
   allowing rapid and accurate measurements of the wound surface area and
   depth. The scanner unit plugs into a standard personal digital assistant
   to form a portable device that can be easily held and operated using I
   hand. The scanner has been used in clinical practice trials in patients
   with venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and in the community
   setting. The scanner was found to be accurate and reliable, easy to
   learn and use, portable, and compact. The results presented suggest that
   this device may be a viable choice in the management of different types
   of chronic wounds.}},

Title = {{Precision agriculture on grassland: Applications, perspectives and

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2-3}},
Pages = {{59-71}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Precision agriculture (PA) is an innovative, integrated and
   internationally standardized approach aiming to increase the efficiency
   of resource use and to reduce the uncertainty of decisions required to
   control variation on farms. Worldwide, investments in research and
   technology on PA have considerably increased during the past decades.
   Advances in agricultural research, combined with application of PA on
   grasslands, could provide major economic and environmental benefits.
   However, most of the available technology is currently being applied on
   arable land but not on grassland although the latter contributes
   substantially to agricultural land use as well as to capital and income.
   The authors hypothesise that heterogeneity of grassland among and within
   fields is a major constraint to PA application and that understanding
   such heterogeneity would enable to implement PA where competitive and
   cost efficient.
   In this paper, current developments and future perspectives of digital
   image processing, remote sensing, yield measurement, and site-specific
   management on grassland are discussed. At fine scales, on-board sensors
   can provide information on sward properties that application techniques
   could respond to. At larger scales, remotely sensed information can
   provide digital maps of type and status of vegetation that allow a
   precise management, although the mix of spatial coverage and spatial
   resolution is not yet ideal. The site-specific management on arable
   land, however, has not yet proven its applicability in different
   environments. On grassland, some of these technologies are either
   already implemented as prototypes into research projects or under
   development with a short-term perspective to be introduced into
   practice.
   Grassland scientists can significantly contribute to the current
   development and, in return, benefit from latest sensor technology and so
   enable rapid data acquisition and improvement of experimentation and
   knowledge. Also existing computer simulation models can contribute to
   make PA on grassland a success. Animal husbandry is strongly linked to
   grassland utilization and can also benefit from present PA technology
   through animal production and health control and animal guidance with
   appropriate electronic stimuli. Considerable interdisciplinary research
   is required to link existing knowledge on PA technology with grassland
   science and with animal science. This could mainly be accomplished by
   the interpretation of signal-object interaction that is needed to set up
   suitable configurations on grassland. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The widespread use of digital slides has only recently come to the fore
   with the development of high-throughput scanners and high performance
   viewing software. This development, along with the optimisation of
   compression standards and image transfer techniques, has allowed the
   technology to be used in wide reaching applications including
   integration of images into hospital information systems and
   histopathological training, as well as the development of automated
   image analysis algorithms for prediction of histological aberrations and
   quantification of immunohistochemical stains. Here, the use of this
   technology in the creation of a comprehensive library of images of
   preclinical toxicological relevance is demonstrated. The images,
   acquired using the Aperio ScanScope (R) CS and XT slide acquisition
   systems, form part of the ongoing EU FP6 Integrated Project, Innovative
   Medicines for Europe (InnoMed). In more detail, PredTox (abbreviation
   for Predictive Toxicology) is a subproject of InnoMed and comprises a
   consortium of 15 industrial (13 large pharma, 1 technology provider and
   1 SME) and three academic partners. The primary aim of this consortium
   is to assess the value of combining data generated from `omics
   technologies (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) with the
   results from more conventional toxicology methods, to facilitate further
   informed decision making in preclinical safety evaluation. A library of
   1709 scanned images was created of full-face sections of liver and
   kidney tissue specimens from male Wistar rats treated with 16
   proprietary and reference compounds of known toxicity; additional
   biological materials from these treated animals were separately used to
   create `omics data, that will ultimately be used to populate an
   integrated toxicological database. In respect to assessment of the
   digital slides, a web-enabled digital slide management system, Digital
   SlideServer (TM) (DSS), was employed to enable integration of the
   digital slide content into the `omics database and to facilitate remote
   viewing by pathologists connected with the project. DSS also facilitated
   manual annotation of digital slides by the pathologists, specifically in
   relation to marking particular lesions of interest. Tissue microarrays
   (TMAs) were constructed from the specimens for the purpose of creating a
   repository of tissue from animals used in the study with a view to
   later-stage biomarker assessment. As the PredTox consortium itself aims
   to identify new biomarkers of toxicity, these TMAs will be a valuable
   means of validation. In summary, a large repository of histological
   images was created enabling the subsequent pathological analysis of
   samples through remote viewing and, along with the utilisation of TMA
   technology, will allow the validation of biomarkers identified by the
   PredTox consortium. The population of the PredTox database with these
   digitised images represents the creation of the first toxicological
   database integrating `omics and preclinical data with histological
   images. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, institutions are setting up digital repositories to support
   the sharing of resources for teaching and learning. The educational
   rationale is that a single set of resources can be restructured to
   support different pedagogical approaches and to achieve economies of
   scale. A key problem is that these learning object repositories (LORs),
   like many other learning technology innovations, are often designed to
   exploit the capabilities of technology rather than to meet learners'
   needs. The premise of this study is that the nature and organization of
   a community is likely to impact the way an LOR is used. Key dimensions
   of repositories and communities are discussed. Three repository systems
   are analysed to identify how communities use repositories. Guided by
   Activity Theory, the LORs and user communities are analysed as activity
   systems. These activity systems are compared and contradictions between
   them are identified. From the analysis, barriers and enablers for the
   use of LORs to support learning are discussed and a framework for
   addressing the key issues in the repository development stage is
   proposed.}},

   is to discuss the statistical properties of growth rates in light of a
   `mushroom vision' of growth. In our analysis, we focus on the growth of
   value added in NACE five-digit sectors in France, Germany, Italy and the
   United Kingdom between 1995 and 2003. We find that the volatility of
   sectoral growth rates is negatively correlated with sectoral size,
   according to a power law, but with steeper slopes than for firms and
   U.S. sectors. Rescaled sectoral growth rates are well-described by a
   Laplace distribution in most years. The outcomes of this statistical
   analysis provide a further empirical foundation to a view of sectoral
   growth, wherein inter-firm correlations, market concentration, and
   inter-sectoral feedbacks play a major role.}},

Abstract = {{Educational policy aims are very ambitious: from pre-school to lifelong
   learning they demand improvements in both quantity and quality, which
   are multiplicative in their effects on teaching workload. It is
   difficult, therefore, to achieve these aims effectively without
   rethinking our approach to teaching and learning. Our essentially 19th
   century model of educational institutions does not scale up to the
   requirements of a 21st century society. Despite their potential to
   contribute to a rethink, digital technologies have usually been used in
   a technology-driven way to upgrade our existing educational models. The
   paper proposes, therefore, that only lecturers should be responsible for
   the nature of the pedagogic innovation that is needed if the sector is
   to be able to adapt to its changing environment. The argument here is
   for an education-driven approach to the use of digital technologies to
   achieve our ambitions for education.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel software defined approach for designing and
   implementing common baseband processing tasks. Our focus is on exploring
   the algorithmic and architectural design spaces of 3G and 4G systems to
   identify the computational and geometric structures shared by diverse
   coding schemes, services and hardware platforms, and the efficient and
   flexible integration of these structures on innovative extensible
   hardware. With an existing protocol processor design framework as our
   starting point, we add flexibility to the physical layer of the radio
   application domain by defining a methodology and a hardware platform for
   designing programmable open wireless architecture-enabled device
   instances. The proposed methodology executes in two phases: (a) initial
   design, which is done to a single standard using our design principles
   and methods, and (b) extension phase where the system upgrade is done
   component by component. The approach standardizes control structures,
   component abstractions, implementation of the architecture itself as
   well as methods for interactive optimization. Thus, in both design
   phases there is only a need to consider changes in component
   functionality and connectivity. We demonstrate the approach by initially
   targeting digital television, and then extending the system with minimal
   effort to support GSM. The costs of the GSM extension in the system were
   an area increase of 2.4\%, a power increase of 2.7\% and four days in
   hardware design and verification. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This article is a summary of a longer study entitled Educating for the
   Creative Workforce: Rethinking Arts and Education, commissioned by the
   Australia Council as part of its research partnership with the Institute

   for the role of the arts in education, concentrating on empirical
   research studies that looked at arts education programs and sought to
   explore whether and how, they can contribute to contemporary approaches
   to education for the `creative workforce'. In line with the focus of
   this special issue, this paper seeks to draw parallels between this
   debate and that on digital literacy. In both cases, we look at how these
   areas are said to contribute to the skills and competencies required for
   the contemporary workforce, the differences between formal and informal
   approaches to skill acquisition, and the degree to which both areas are
   often surrounded by notions of empowerment.}},

   system}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{MT21-MT26}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Errors in the transfusion process are common. These errors
   encompass a spectrum of events ranging from incorrect transfusion to
   administration of infected blood products. To overcome these
   complications, we developed a new blood management software system - the
   BT-Online system - to decrease erroneous transfusions that are mostly
   human based.
   Material/Methods: Like previously developed transfusion safety systems,
   this program uses handheld devices to improve the safety of bedside
   practices. The BT-online system consists of 3 main structures: (1) the
   personal digital assistant, (2) the equipment and software (user
   interface), and (3) the relational database and a web service providing
   communication of a security-layered database with other personal digital
   assistants.
   Results: This system has many features including the ability at the
   bedside to check the complete patient history and requested tests and
   blood products, the ability to conduct simulataneous multiple
   procedures, the ability to transmit results to the database, the ability
   to gather restrictions and warnings regarding the transfusion and
   request sections, the ability to provide constant and secure data
   transfer, a user-friendly design, the ability to gather warmings during
   measurements that alert the user to potential errors, the ability to
   enter complications and symptoms and retrieve relevant information and
   suggestions, the ability to enter transfusion complications, and the
   ability to check test results and create statistical data for future
   use.
   Conclusions: This system can contribute to blood banks and health care
   facilities via the above-mentioned specifications. We recommend this
   system to health care facilities with a significant patient turnover.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion of innovation theorizes on how human beings adopt new
   communication technology, but it fails to take into account the
   institutional factors involved in the process. In this study involving
   new communicational technology use in a small Greek rural village, it is
   determined that the village cafe, as the central socializing element in
   the community, plays a powerful role in dissemination of new
   communicational devices, or what this article conceptualizes as
   `mediating commons'. Such mediating commons social institutions as the
   village cafe play a significant role in encouraging the adoption of new
   communication products; without such a mediating commons in a community,
   adoption rates may reduce significantly and lead to a spreading digital
   divide.}},

Abstract = {{Recently launched in a limited number of countries, digital multimedia
   broadcasting (DMB) is a brand new mobile service that uses the most
   advanced IT technology. Analyzing data collected from Korea, Japan, and
   Germany, this study investigates the relationship between attitudes, and
   their antecedents, toward using a DMB service and the intention of using
   it. Results of the study indicate that permanent access, entertainment,
   and social interaction have a positive influence on attitudes toward
   using DMB, and that those attitudes positively influence consumers'
   intention to do so, as do self-efficacy and consumer perceptions of DMB
   as an innovation. Some differences in consumer behavior toward DMB
   service were also found among the three countries. From these findings,
   practical implications are drawn. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals,'Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Telemedical networks that apply innovative mobile
   information technologies (IT) are an innovative approach to improve
   stroke care in community settings. Within the German Stroke Angel
   initiative and the research project PerCoMed (Pervasive Computing in
   Medical Care, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research,
   http://www.percomed.de) the effects of such a solution were assessed by
   an interdisciplinary research approach. The main goal of the team of
   researchers and practitioners was to provide clear evidence of
   improvements in intersectional processes of the stroke chain survival,
   namely in the acute stroke processes between prehospital rescue services
   and hospital stroke units.
   Material and methods. Between October 2005 and October 2007 the
   paramedical staff of five rescue service transporters in a rural area of
   northern Bavaria was included in a network with the stroke unit of the
   Neurological Clinic Bad Neustach. Telemedical support by the Stroke
   Angel computing system -a software running on a personal digital
   assistant (PDA) to transmit patient data from the rescue team to the
   hospital during patient transporting time - was established. As
   procedural guidance, the Stroke Angel system suggests a predefined path
   through the necessary emergency procedures according to the structure of
   the mandatory protocol and the implemented Los Angeles Prehospital
   Stroke Screen (LAPSS).
   Results. In the empirical study the authors obtained a complete data set
   of 226 consecutively admitted patients for analysis in Bad Neustadt and
   LAPSS data of 217 patients from a second scenario in Dusseldorf.
   Medical, economic and technical analyses were applied. The technological
   robustness of the Stroke Angel system could be proven and information
   entered was transmitted fully and correctly. Concerning medical research
   questions, for both scenario locations LAPSS with a sensitivity of
   68.3\% and a specificity of 85.1\% has to be deemed insufficient. Hence,
   alternative algorithms will have to be used in the next steps of
   evaluation. The system significantly influenced the clinical process of
   acute stroke management more than the preclinical ones
   (door-to-CT:32min. before and 16 min. at the end of the project). Lysis
   treatment rose from 6.12\% (2005) to 11.17\% (2007) of patients with
   acute stroke.
   Conclusions. From the set of perspectives taken, the study illustrates
   that mobile computing technologies offer new and innovative approaches
   to improve intersectional acute stroke care. It also teaches the
   participants that interdisciplinary research can significantly deepen
   the understanding of such technologies and projects, which can lead to
   better decision making concerning solution implementation, management
   and improvements. The approach will be brought into daily practice in
   Bad Neustadt/Saale within the next months.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses open innovation in the telecommunications industry
   and the relationship between technological convergence and open
   innovation. Specifically, the study focuses on the increasingly
   widespread trend of mobile companies to engage in external capabilities
   and knowledge sources as a way to extend their knowledge boundaries.
   Collaboration efforts have strongly impacted open innovation strategies
   as the external environment is constantly changing, particularly in
   digital convergence and standards networks. The authors confirm that
   exploitation-oriented alliances play a key role in the paradigm shift by
   using the number of U.S. co-patents to prove the strong, collaborative
   research of leading mobile firms (Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and LG). They
   also confirm that current industry leaders have relatively high
   cross-country patents, indicating international research and development
   (R\&D) efforts with increasing strategic alliance activity. Foreign
   inventors and strategic alliances are therefore increasing.}},

Abstract = {{Today's product designer is being asked to develop high quality,
   innovative products at an ever increasing pace. To nice( this need, ail
   intensive search is underway for advanced design methodologies that
   facilitate the acquisition of design knowledge and creative ideas for
   later reuse. Additionally. designers are embracing a wide range of 3D
   digital design applications, Such as 3D digitization. 3D CAD and CAID,
   reverse design methodology called engineering (RE). CAE analysis and
   rapid prototyping (RP). In this paper, we propose a reverse engineering
   innovative (I Reverse Innovative Design (RID). The RID methodologgy
   facilitates design and knowledge reuse 1)), leveraging 3D digital design
   applications. The core of our RID methodology is the definition and
   construction of feature-based parametric solid models from scanned data.
   The solid model is constructed with feature data to allow for design
   modification and iteration. Such a Construction is Well Suited for
   downstream analysis and rapid prototyping. In this paper. we will review
   the Commercial availability and technological developments of some
   relevant 3D digital design applications. We will then introduce till-CC
   RE modelling strategies: all autosurfacing strategy for organic shapes:
   it solid modelling strategy with feature recognition and Surface fitting
   for analytical models: and a curve-based modelling strategy for accurate
   reverse modelling. Freeform shapes are appearing with more frequency in
   product development. Since their ``natural{''} parameters are hard to
   define and extract. c propose construction of a feature skeleton based
   upon industrial or regional standards or by user interaction. Global and
   local product definition parameters are then linked to the feature
   skeleton. Design modification is performed by solving a constrained
   optimization problem. A RID platform has been developed and the main RE
   strategies and core algorithms have been integrated into SolidWorks as
   ail add-ill product called ScanTo3D. We will use this system to
   demonstrate our RID methodology on a collection of innovative consumer
   product design examples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of a common reference position when defining foot postures may
   underestimate the ability to differentiate foot function in subjects
   with pathology. The effect of using the subtalar neutral (STN) position
   as an offset for both rearfoot and forefoot through comparison of the
   kinematic walking patterns of subjects classified as normal (n = 7) and
   abnormally pronated (it = 14) foot postures was completed. An
   Optotrak(TM) Motion Analysis System (Northern Digital, Inc.) integrated
   with Motion Monitor Software(TM) (Innovative Sports, Inc.) was used to
   track three-dimensional movement of the leg, rearfoot and first
   metatarsal segments. Intrarater reliability of positioning the foot into
   STN using clinical guidelines was determined for a single rater for 21
   subjects. Walking data were subsequently compared before and after an
   offset was applied to the rearfoot and first metatarsal segments.
   Repeated measures of foot positioning found the STN position to be
   highly repeatable (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.9), with peak
   errors ranging from 1.9 degrees to 4.3 degrees. Utilizing STN as the
   offset resulted in a significant increase in rearfoot eversion (p =
   0.019) during early stance, and greater first metatarsal dorsillexion (p
   < 0.007) across stance in the pronated foot groups that was not observed
   prior to applying the offset. When applied to subjects with differing
   foot postures, the selection of a common reference position that is both
   clinically appropriate and reliable may distinguish kinematic patterns
   during walking that are consistent with theories of abnormal pronation.

Abstract = {{Investments in certain technologies do confer a competitive edge - one
   that has to be constantly renewed, as rivals don't merely match your
   moves but use technology to develop more potent ones and leapfrog over
   you.
   That's the conclusion of a comprehensive analysis that Harvard Business
   School professor McAfee and MIT professor Brynjolfsson conducted of all
   publicly traded U.S. companies in all industries over the past few
   decades. They found a clear correlation between levels of IT spending
   and a new competitive dynamic: Since the mid-1990s, when the rate of
   spending on IT began to rise sharply, the spread between the leaders and
   laggards in an industry has widened. There are more winner-take-all
   markets. But the increased concentration has ramped up, rather than
   dampened, churn among the remaining players. And these dynamics are
   greatest in those industries that are more IT intensive.
   This pattern is already familiar to the makers of digital products, but
   it has now spread to traditional industries, the authors contend, not
   because more products are becoming digital but because more processes
   are. Enterprise software like ERP and CRM systems, coupled with cheap
   networks, is allowing companies to replicate their unique business
   processes quickly, widely, and faithfully, in the same way that a
   digital photo can be endlessly reproduced.
   In this new environment, top managers must pay careful attention to
   which processes to make consistent and which to vary locally. And while
   standardizing some ways of working, they must also encourage employees
   to come up with creative process improvements to outdo competitors'
   innovations.
   Competing at such high speeds isn't easy, and not everyone will be able
   to keep up - but the companies that do may realize vastly improved
   business processes as well as higher market share and increased market
   value.}},

Abstract = {{As the world becomes digital, we are in ever greater danger of losing
   business, scientific, artistic, cultural. and personal assets. The
   threat of such a digital dark age stems from the fact that - unlike
   physical records that may survive decades, centuries, or even longer
   without advanced planning-digital records will not survive without
   planning and diligence. Everything needed to keep digital records viable
   will become obsolete, including hardware, software, processes, and
   formats. Consequently, digital preservation environments are needed to
   ensure the ability to access valuable digital records decades from now
   and, more significantly, to ensure the interpretability of the records
   once accessed. We describe Preservation DataStores, an innovative
   storage architecture that facilitates robust and optimized preservation
   environments. It is a layered architecture that builds upon open
   standards, including Open Archival Information System, XAM (Extensible
   Access Method), and Object-based Storage Device. We also describe the
   integration of Preservation DataStores with existing file systems and
   archives and discuss some design and implementation issues. We are
   developing Preservation DataStores as an infrastructure component of the
   European Union CASPAR (Cultural, Artistic and Scientific knowledge for
   Preservation, Access and Retrieval) project, where it will be used to
   preserve scientific, cultural, and artistic data.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between the tire and the road is crucial for determining
   the dynamic behavior of a road vehicle, and the road-tire contact forces
   are key variables in the design of traction, braking, and stability
   control systems. Traditionally, road-tire contact forces are indirectly
   estimated from vehicle-dynamics measurements (chassis accelerations,
   yaw-roll rates, suspension deflections, etc.). The emerging of the
   ``smart-tire{''} concept (tire with embedded sensors and
   digital-computing capability) has made possible, in principle, a more
   direct estimation of contact forces. In this field-still in its
   infancy-the main open problems are the choice of the sensor(s) and the
   choice of the regressor(s) to be used for force estimation. The
   objective of this work is to present a new sensor-regressor choice, and
   to provide some preliminary experimental results, which confirm the
   validity of this choice. The idea is to use a wheel encoder and an
   accelerometer mounted directly in the tire. The measurement of the
   in-tire acceleration is transmitted through a wireless channel. The key
   innovative concept is to use the phase shift between the wheel encoder
   and the pulse-like signals provided by. the accelerometer as the main
   regressor for force estimation.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the issue of copyright protection for intellectual
   properties such as computer software, music CDs, and videos has become
   increasingly important. It is often claimed that illegal copying of
   intellectual property costs companies billions of dollars in lost
   revenues and reduces firms' incentives to innovate. Some researchers
   have shown that copying can be beneficial to firms when there are strong
   network effects and copying expands the market. In this paper, we first
   examine the impact of illegal copying of software and other similar
   intellectual properties on firms' prices, profits, and quality choices,
   even when there are no network effects and the market is saturated. We
   show that contrary to the claims of manufacturers, there are conditions
   under which copying can increase firms' profits, lead to better quality
   products, and increase social welfare. This is because weaker copyright
   protection enables firms to reduce price competition by allowing
   price-sensitive consumers to copy. Thus, weaker copyright protection can
   serve as a coordination device to reduce price competition. We also
   examine how equilibrium copyright enforcement is affected by network
   externalities. In contrast to previous research, we show that strong
   network effects can sometimes lead to a firm choosing higher levels of
   copyright protection. Our results show that in the presence of strong
   network effects, stronger copyright enforcement by one firm can serve as
   a coordinating device to reduce price competition.}},

   the perceptions of EFL student teachers on e-portfolios as a learning
   tool. Results of analysis of student teachers' interviews identified
   several themes, indicating that e-portfolios helped student teachers
   keep current with innovations in the digital world; a fancy tool that
   serves them in the job search; and a collection of materials that showed
   their best work; an opportunity to work collaboratively which in turn
   support their ongoing professional development. However, the student
   teachers in this study did not believe that electronic portfolios can be
   an important tool to develop reflective thinking.}},

Abstract = {{Conceptual innovation in mechanical engineering design has been
   extremely challenging compared to the wide applications of automated
   design systems in digital circuits. This paper presents an automated
   methodology for open-ended synthesis of mechanical vibration absorbers
   based on genetic programming and bond graphs. It is shown that our
   automated design system can automatically evolve passive vibration
   absorbers that have performance equal to or better than the standard
   passive vibration absorbers invented in 1911. A variety of other
   vibration absorbers with competitive performance are also evolved
   automatically using a desktop PC in less than 10 h.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a digitally controlled on-chip monotonic Reference
   Current Generator (RCG) with 8-bit resolution and a LSB (Least
   Significant Bit) current as low as 100 nA. It was designed as a building
   block of a generic DC-coupled Burst Mode Laser Diode Driver (BM-LDD) for
   GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) applications and acts as an
   on-chip RCG with a settling time of 18 ns for fast and accurate optical
   level monitoring with guaranteed monotony. The proposed architecture of
   the on-chip RCG is based on an 8-bit segmented current-steering
   Digital-to-Analog Converter (IDAC) and a bandgap voltage reference. The
   (3 + 5) segmented architecture of the 8-bit IDAC is an optimum
   combination of a 3-bit MSBs (Most Significant Bits) unit-element sub-DAC
   and a 5-bit LSBs binary-weighted sub-DAC offering good DNL (Differential
   Nonlinearity) performance. The bandgap voltage reference deviates only
   0.6\% of the nominal value over temperature and power supply variations.
   A cascade current mirror with a super beta helper circuit is used to
   guarantee monotony and high accuracy. The linearity errors caused by
   systematic influences and random variations are reduced by the proposed
   2-D double centroid symmetrical architecture. Experiments confirm a DNL
   of +/- 0.5 LSB for the proposed RCG. The tested performance of optical
   level monitoring and APC (Automatic Power Control) algorithm is
   compliant to ITU-T GPON standards. The design was realized in a 0.35 mu
   m SiGe BiCMOS technology with 3.3 V power supply. The technology choice
   was made by heavy requirements of the innovative DC-coupled 1.25 Gbit/s
   BM-LDD chip. Although the proposed structure was designed as a building
   block for a BM-LDD chip, the design concept can be applied for
   developing other high linearity on-chip RCG for a wide junction
   temperature range (-40 to 110 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{Improvements in airway imaging technology provide the potential for an
   improved understanding of airway pathology and upper airway mechanics.
   We present here a preliminary report on the applicability of cone beam
   computed tomography technology in conjunction with multidimensional
   digital analysis for the purposes of clinical airway management. The use
   of this technology for airway imaging in anesthesiology has not been
   reported. Traditional skeletal and soft tissue images as well as
   distance and volume measurements were obtained without difficulty.
   Three-dimensional image reconstructions as well as ``virtual
   laryngoscopy{''} were `achieved with resulting excellent image quality,
   suggesting a broad range of possibilities for upper airway examination
   and analysis. A modified Muller test with volumetric rendering of the
   airway passages under baseline and negative pressure conditions was also
   performed., made possible as a result of the system's short (9 s)
   scanning times. We believe that cone beam computed tomography technology
   offers an additional dimension to airway evaluation that has
   considerable potential.}},

Abstract = {{Digitized information and network have made an enormous impact on the
   music and movie industries. Internet piracy is popular and has greatly
   threatened the companies in these industries. This study tests
   Hunt-Vitell's ethical decision model and attempts to understand why and
   how people share unauthorized music files with others in the
   peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The norm of anti-piracy, the ideology of
   free software, the norm of reciprocity, and the ideology of consumer
   rights are proposed as four deontological norms related to using P2P
   systems. The model is tested using a scenario survey with four
   alternatives; the results indicate that the deontological norm of
   anti-piracy is not a main factor in affecting P2P users' ethical
   considerations regarding sharing files with others. This finding
   suggests that to protect their property rights, record companies should
   try to realize the consumer benefits brought via new digital and network
   technology, instead of simply declaring their intellectual property and
   resisting the innovations resulting from new technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This article takes as its starting point the ongoing downturn in student
   interest in, and engagement with, the enabling sciences. We make a case
   that embedding of creative pedagogies in science education has
   significant potential to arrest the flight from modern science. Five
   propositions are explored in order to argue the case: that young people
   are more engaged by active tasks than with a passive consumption
   approach to transfer of core knowledge; that it is boredom, not rigour,
   that disengages them - the difference is between static and dynamic
   sources of knowledge; that creativity is not the antithesis of
   scientific rigour but the core business of scientific thinking; that we
   now have new understandings of creative pedagogies that make teaching
   strategies visible and effective; and, that these strategies can build
   academic, digital and social capacity simultaneously and this is the new
   core business of the science educator. We conclude by flagging
   implications for leading such pedagogical change in science faculties.}},

Title = {{Transformational technologies and the creation of new work practices:
   Making implicit knowledge explicit in task-based offshoring}},
Journal = {{MIS QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{411-436}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Studies have shown the knowledge transfer problems that arise when
   communication and storage technologies are employed to accomplish work
   across time and space. Much less is known about knowledge transfer
   problems associated with transformational technologies, which afford the
   creation, modification, and manipulation of digital artifacts. Yet,
   these technologies play a critical role in offshoring by allo wing the
   distribution of work at the task level, what we call task-based
   offshoring For example, computer aided engineering applications
   transform input like physical dimensions, location coordinates, and
   material properties into computational models that can be shared
   electronically among engineers around the world as they work together on
   analysis tasks. Digital artifacts created via transformational
   technologies often embody implicit knowledge that must be correctly
   interpreted to successfully act upon the artifacts. To explore what
   problems might arise in interpreting this implicit knowledge across time
   and space, and how individuals might remedy these problems, we studied a
   firm that sent engineering tasks from home sites in Mexico and the
   United States to an offshore site in India. Despite having proper formal
   education and ample tool skills, the Indian engineers bad dfficulty
   interpreting the implicit knowledge embodied in artifacts sent to them
   from Mexico and the United States. To resolve and prevent the problems
   that subsequently arose, individuals from the home sites developed five
   new work practices to transfer occupational knowledge to the offshore
   site. The live practices were defining requirements, monitoring
   progress, fixing returns, routing tasks strategically, and filtering
   quality. The extent to which sending engineers in our study were free
   from having to enact these new work practices because on-site
   coordinators acted on their behalf predicted their perceptions of the
   effectiveness of the offshoring arrangement, but Indian engineers
   preferred learning from sending engineers, not on-site coordinators. Our
   study contributes to theories of knowledge transfer and has practical
   implications for managing task-based offshoring arrangements.}},

Abstract = {{In areas subject to social and economic disadvantage where resources are
   scarce, the physical environment of the public realm is often identified
   as a place for investment by governments - a place where
   infra-structural improvements to the built environment, funded through
   government, may reap wider social rewards. In addition, specific social
   policy ambitions in Australia, within both state government and other
   welfare agencies, focus on social capital building and community
   strengthening initiatives. Yet the relationship between these crucial
   areas of government action - social welfare and community development,
   and the design of the built environment -is often disconnected.
   This article describes an experimental pilot study for a prototype
   community engagement tool aimed at fore-grounding the user in design for
   the public realm. The project, which will devise an innovative
   methodology for community consultation in areas of neighbourhood renewal
   and change, operates within the structure of a design studio at RMIT
   University School of Architecture + Design. The outcome - the Digital
   Map - is an interactive map website which acts as a mechanism for
   engaging people in the design of the built environment and the public
   realm, simultaneously providing a platform for social connected-ness and
   networking within the community Embedded links to a repository of
   one-person film narratives, means that the map is an ongoing device for
   community participation: a transparent and open-ended alternative to the
   limitations of consultation through questionnaire, and a mechanism for
   building sustainable communities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the role of relationships in the emergence of a
   network's value creation structure. The strategic navigation from
   creative exploration to global exploitation through the use of so-called
   transformation networks is particularly highlighted. The creativity
   phase requires a creator with visionary leadership. The
   commercialisation phase, on the other hand, requires technology
   integration and global marketing excellence. Realising that this
   requires more than a bright inventor, the creator of Anoto brought in
   the right complementary assets at distinct phases of the
   commercialisation process. Our case illustrates how integrator and
   marketeer profiles were brought into a networked act of entrepreneurship
   for joint navigation across an ocean of relationships that gave birth to
   a global standard for digital writing. By combining theories on open
   innovation and networking, a theoretical framework is developed to
   analyse the different nature of the networks (or the value creation
   structure) in which complementary assets can be accessed, transferred
   and transformed into commercialised innovation. The analysis suggests
   that the value of complementary assets are embedded in and unlocked by
   three distinct types of networks: creativity networks, transformation
   networks and process networks. It also suggests that the ideal approach
   to accessing complementary assets shifts over the research and
   development management process, and happens through these three
   different types and levels of networks, requiring fundamentally
   different approaches to leadership and relationship management. Current
   literature describes open and networked innovation as a continuous - not
   dynamic - process of exploration and exploitation without any
   distinction of how types and structures of networks evolve and interact
   in the process.}},

Title = {{System for measuring the coordinates of tire surfaces in transient

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a system for measuring surface
   coordinates (commonly known as ``shape measurements{''}) which is able
   to give the temporal evolution of the position of the tire sidewall in
   transient conditions (such as during braking, when there are potholes or
   when the road surface is uneven) which may or may not be reproducible.
   The system is based on the well-known technique of projecting and
   observing structured light using a digital camera with an optical axis
   which is slanted with respect to the axis of the projector. The
   transient nature of the phenomenon has led to the development of
   specific innovative solutions as regards image processing algorithms.
   This paper briefly describes the components which make up the measuring
   system and presents the results of the measurements carried out on the
   drum bench. It then analyses the performance of the measuring system and
   the sources of uncertainty which led to the development of the system
   for a specific dynamic application: impact with an obstacle (cleat
   test). The measuring system guaranteed a measurement uncertainty of 0.28
   mm along the Z axis (the axial direction of the tire) with a measurement
   range of 250(X)x80(Y)x25(Z) mm(3), with the tire rolling at a speed of
   up to 30 km/h. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.}},

Title = {{Laws' masks descriptors applied to bone texture analysis: an innovative
   and discriminant tool in osteoporosis}},
Journal = {{SKELETAL RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},

Abstract = {{Objective The objective of this study was to explore Laws' masks
   analysis to describe structural variations of trabecular bone due to
   osteoporosis on high-resolution digital radiographs and to check its
   dependence on the spatial resolution. Laws' masks are well established
   as one of the best methods for texture analysis in image processing and
   are used in various applications, but not in bone tissue
   characterisation. This method is based on masks that aim to filter the
   images. From each mask, five classical statistical parameters can be
   calculated.
   Materials and methods The study was performed on 182 healthy
   postmenopausal women with no fractures and 114 age-matched women with
   fractures {[}26 hip fractures (HFs), 29 vertebrae fractures (VFs), 29
   wrist fractures (WFs) and 30 other fractures (OFs)]. For all subjects
   radiographs were obtained of the calcaneus with a new high-resolution
   X-ray device with direct digitisation (BMA, D3A, France). The lumbar
   spine, femoral neck, and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) were
   assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
   Results In terms of reproducibility, the best results were obtained with
   the TRE5E5 mask, especially for three parameters: ``mean{''}, ``standard
   deviation{''} and ``entropy{''} with, respectively, in vivo mid-term
   root mean square average coefficient of variation (RMSCV)\% = 1.79, 4.24
   and 2.05. The ``mean{''} and ``entropy{''} parameters had a better
   reproducibility but ``standard deviation{''} showed a better
   discriminant power. Thus, for univariate analysis, the difference
   between subjects with fractures and controls was significant (P <
   10(-3)) and significant for each fracture group independently (P <
   10(-4) for HF, P = 0.025 for VF and P < 10-3 for OF). After multivariate
   analysis with adjustment for age and total hip BMD, the difference
   concerning the ``standard deviation{''} parameter remained statistically
   significant between the control group and the HF and VF groups (P < 5 x
   10(-5), and P = 0.04, respectively). No significant correlation between
   these Laws' masks parameters and BMD was obtained. In addition, this
   study showed the dependence of Laws' masks parameters on image
   resolution, which confirms the necessity to perform Laws' textural
   measurement on high-resolution images.
   Conclusion The reproducibility and discriminant power of the Laws' masks
   analysis has been demonstrated on bone images; thus, this method
   constitutes a promising routine technique for the determination of
   osteoporosis fracture risk from radiographs.}},

Abstract = {{Korea has been leading the world in broadband Internet access services
   since 1999. Based on an in-depth case analysis of the penetration of
   asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) in Korea, the present study
   explores the patterns of decision making and interactions among key
   innovation actors, such as the government, Internet service providers,
   equipment providers, and content providers, using a conceptual framework
   wherein models of innovation systems and decision making under
   uncertainty are combined. The results revealed that the Korean
   government played a pivotal role in the creation of the ADSL-based
   Internet service market by providing a strong vision for this emerging
   service, building a coalition among various key actors, and stimulating
   initial market needs and supply of necessary equipment during the early
   period of higher uncertainty. As the level of uncertainty decreased with
   market evolution, however, the role of industrial actors and their
   market competition became more important to the rapid growth of the ADSL
   market. Based on these findings, policy and managerial implications are
   proposed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Satisfactory assessment of the musculoskeletal disorders in patients by
   health professionals, followed by diagnosis, treatment, and referral
   require a good understanding of spatial and three-dimensional (S\&3D)
   anatomy of musculature. Meanwhile, the importance and impact of S\&3D
   learning has been underscored. A novel method to promote S\&3D skills in
   the learning of the musculature of the upper and lower limb was
   developed, and subsequently evaluated among 120 first-year Physiotherapy
   and Occupational Therapy undergraduate students at the University of
   Cape Town. Outlines of human muscles were mapped onto A4 papers,
   digitalized into a 22-paged electronic document, labeled with anatomical
   details, and printed out. Each student was given a copy to cut out the
   diagrams and paste them correctly onto adult skeletons using Prestik
   (R), in what was called the muscle cut-out exercise (MCOE), just prior
   to each dissection practical. A questionnaire evaluating the MCOE was
   developed and 56 students responded. The students ``strongly agreed{''}
   that the MCOE was useful in teaching them the spatial perspective of the
   human musculature. Forty-nine percent of the students felt that the size
   of the diagrams did not always match the skeletons due to variable sizes
   of the skeletons and 27\% suggested the use of color as a means of
   enhancing the diagrams. The MCOE is a low-cost, enjoyable,
   time-efficient, easily reproducible, and hands-on practical learning
   experience.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-state, digital radiography (DR) detectors, designed specifically
   for standard projection radiography, emerged just before the turn of the
   millennium. This new generation of digital image detector comprises a
   thin layer of x-ray absorptive material combined with an electronic
   active matrix array fabricated in a thin film of hydrogenated amorphous
   silicon (a-Si:H). DR detectors can offer both efficient (Low-dose) x-ray
   image acquisition plus on-line read-out of the Latent image as
   electronic data. To date, solid-state, flat-panel, DR detectors have
   come in two principal designs, the indirect-conversion (x-ray
   scintillator-based) and the direct-conversion (x-ray
   photoconductor-based) types. This review describes the underlying
   principles and enabling technologies exploited by these designs of
   detector, and evaluates their physical imaging characteristics,
   comparing performance both against each other and computed radiography
   (CR). In standard projection radiography indirect conversion DR
   detectors currently offer superior physical image quality and dose
   efficiency compared with direct conversion DR and modern point-scan CR.
   These conclusions have been confirmed in the findings of clinical
   evaluations of DR detectors. Future trends in solid-state DR detector
   technologies are also briefly considered. Salient innovations include
   WiFi-enabled, portable DR detectors, improvements in x-ray absorber
   layers and developments in alternative electronic media to a-Si:H. (C)

Abstract = {{Multivariate statistical methods (MSMs) applied to ground water
   chemistry provide valuable insight into the main hydrochemical species,
   hydrochemical processes, and water flowpaths important to ground water
   evolution. The MSMs of principal component factor analysis (FA) and
   k-means cluster analysis (CA) were sequentially applied to major ion
   chemistry from 211 different ground water-sampling locations in the
   Amargosa Desert. The FA reduces the number of variables describing the
   system and finds relationships between major ions. The CA of the reduced
   system produced objective hydrochemical facies, which are independent
   of, but in good agreement with, lithological data. The derived factors
   and hydrochemical facies are innovatively presented on biplots,
   revealing composition of hydrochemical processes and facies, and
   overlaid on a digital elevation model, displaying flowpaths and
   interactions with geologic and topographic features in the region. In
   particular, a distinct ground water chemical signature is observed
   beneath and surrounding the extended flowpath of Fortymile Wash,
   presenting some contradiction to contemporary water levels along with
   potential interaction with a fault line. The signature surrounding the
   ephemeral Fortymile Wash is believed to represent the relic of water
   that infiltrated during past pluvial periods when the amount of runoff
   in the wash was significantly larger than during the current drier
   period. This hypothesis and aforementioned analyses are supported by the
   examination of available chloride, oxygen-18, hydrogen-2, and carbon-14
   data from the region.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of digital devices with innovative features has changed the
   world of home video entertainment. Nowadays we have access to devices
   that store several hours of video material, skip commercials, and even
   pause the play out of a live event. Despite these innovative features,
   modern digital devices access to recorded material in a way very similar
   to old analog VCRs. In this paper we propose Fast Play, a mechanism that
   uses simple low-level audio and video analysis to provide a novel
   feature in digital video devices. This novel feature is a hybrid between
   the classic Play service and the Fast-Forward service, and aims at
   playing out videos in a time-reduced manner, by maintaining the time
   evolving nature of the original video, and by providing videos with
   completely intelligible audio. An experimental assessment shows that
   Fast Play produces videos that are informative, enjoyable, largely
   reduced, and also shows that users really appreciate the Fast Play
   feature as it produces a pleasant surrogate of the original video.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a content delivery system using a partially reconfigurable
   FPGA to securely distribute digital content on the Internet. With
   partial reconfigurability of a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA, the system
   provides an innovative single-chip solution for protecting digital
   content. In the system, a partial circuit must be downloaded from a
   server to the client terminal to play content. Content will be played
   only when the downloaded circuit is correctly combined (= interlocked)
   with the circuit built in the terminal. Since each circuit has a unique
   I/O configuration, the downloaded circuit interlocks with the
   corresponding built-in circuit designed for a particular terminal. Thus,
   the interface of the circuit itself provides a novel authentication
   mechanism. This paper describes the detailed architecture of the system
   and clarify the feasibility and effectiveness of the system. In
   addition, we discuss a fail-safe mechanism and future work necessary for
   the practical application of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, laboratory technicians tediously read sputum smears for
   tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis. We demonstrate proof of principle of an
   innovative computational algorithm that successfully recognizes
   Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in digital images.
   Automated, multi-stage, color-based Bayesian segmentation identified
   possible `TB objects', removed artifacts by shape comparison and
   color-labeled objects as `definite', `possible' or `non-TB', bypassing
   photomicrographic calibration. Superimposed AFB clusters, extreme stain
   variation and low depth of field were challenges. Our novel method
   facilitates electronic diagnosis of TB, permitting wider application in
   developing countries where fluorescent microscopy is currently
   inaccessible and unaffordable. We plan refinement and validation in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the approach the Faculty of Dentistry at the
   University of Toronto employed to modernize its methods of instruction
   by using online technologies. A small team of faculty, students, and
   content developers was assembled to work with individual faculty members
   to brainstorm and research ideas for innovative teaching practices in
   dental studies. The team was not content to simply post digital versions
   of the ubiquitous PowerPoint lectures in Blackboard, selected in 2006 by
   the University of Toronto as its sole platform for online course
   delivery, but rather set out to introduce interactivity with the course
   material. Consequently, a series of interactive applications was
   created, such as the virtual microscope in Oral Pathology, the 3D cavity
   preparations in Restorative Dentistry, and the Master Media Repository.
   During the summer of 2006, the Faculty of Dentistry made progress toward
   becoming one of the university's front-runners in online course
   innovation. The result of this collaboration between faculty members and
   the team was ten courses with interactive online presence, representing
   approximately 20 percent of the undergraduate curriculum. Since the
   summer of 2006, the Faculty of Dentistry has continued to pursue its
   goal of providing meaningful online instruction in all of its courses.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial laser scanning, or lidar, is a recent innovation in spatial
   information data acquisition, which allows geological outcrops to be
   digitally captured with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. With
   point precisions and spacing of the order of a few centimetres, an
   enhanced quantitative element can now be added to geological fieldwork
   and analysis, opening up new lines of investigation at a variety of
   scales in all areas of field-based geology. Integration with metric
   imagery allows 31) photorealistic models to be created for
   interpretation, visualization and education. However, gaining meaningful
   results from lidar scans requires more than simply acquiring raw point
   data. Surveys require planning and, typically, a large amount of
   post-processing time. The contribution of this paper is to provide a
   more detailed insight into the technology, data collection and
   utilization techniques than is currently available. The paper focuses on
   the workflow for using lidar data, from the choice of field area and
   survey planning, to acquiring and processing data and, finally,
   extracting geologically useful data. Because manufacturer specifications
   for point precision are often optimistic when applied to real-world
   outcrops, the error sources associated with lidar data, and the
   implications of them propagating through the processing chain, are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Academic libraries are facing a range of new challenges in the 21st
   century. Models of scholarly communication are experiencing a revolution
   with the advent of open access, with libraries adopting a lead role in
   self-archiving their institutional outputs in digital repositories. In
   addition, researchers are taking advantage of the computational power at
   their disposal, conducting research in innovative and collaborative ways
   that use and produce vast amounts of data. Such research-generated data
   underpins intellectual ideas, which in turn propagates new
   methodologies, analysis and ultimately knowledge. It is crucial that we
   preserve such mechanisms and output for future generations. With the
   experience gained from traditional cataloguing, indexing and
   organisational skills coupled to those acquired in developing,
   establishing and maintaining institutional repositories, the time is
   ripe for academic librarians to explore a new role. Research data need
   to be looked after from the moment of creation through their life cycle.
   The concept of data curation refers to activities like digital
   preservation but also those geared towards adding value to the data so
   that they can be discovered and reused. This article introduces
   e-Research and the likely function of academic libraries in this I
   domain. After this, data curation is described and several initiatives
   of interest for information professionals in this field are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Examining the rankings of American states in one fast-growing policy
   area, e-government, states with the most sophisticated and comprehensive
   policies varied over a five-year period. What factors account for change
   in digital government policy innovation over time? Using time-series
   analysis and 50-state data, the authors find that state institutional
   capacity is important for continued innovation. They also find an
   association between reinvention in state governments and the
   institutionalization of information technology, suggesting a more
   general orientation toward government reform and modernization. Although
   state wealth and education were not significant in previous studies,
   they emerge as predictors of later innovation. The theoretical
   contribution of this study is to better understand the dynamic character
   of innovation over time and the role of institutions. The link between
   reinvention and e-government raises the possibility that the
   modernization of state institutions generally facilitates innovation.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of software and hardware systems have been developed to inject
   controlled electrical conductances into excitable cells, to investigate
   the physiological mechanisms of action potential generation. These
   systems face several challenges: the need to model complex conductances,
   including voltage-gated ion channels, synaptic conductances controlled
   by electrical models of entire cells or even networks of cells, to do so
   rapidly and stably, with precisely controlled update intervals of 20 mu
   s or less, and to present an easy and flexible interface to the user,
   allowing new experiments to be designed and executed easily. In this
   paper I describe a new software system (SM-2) which is designed to meet
   these requirements, and which runs on the current generation of
   digital-signal-processing (DSP) analog input-output I/O boards, hosted
   in Windows PCs. Its key innovation is its configurability by simple
   user-written text scripts, or ``scriptability{''}, which gives it a high
   flexibility of purpose, and allows non-programmers the capacity to
   rapidly design and use new Hodgkin-Huxley-type active conductances,
   conductances with arbitrary current-voltage relationships, Markov
   process conductance mechanisms with user-specified rate matrices, and
   hybrid networks of virtual cells. At the same time, the hardware
   platform allows this to be achieved with a fast and accurately timed
   input-computation-output cycle. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The ``Revista de Obras Publicas, founded in 1853 and published
   practically without interruption ever since, was the idea of a group of
   young civil engineers. From this time on the journal has served as a
   constant reference of the science and technique behind Spanish public
   works.
   The Asociacion de Ingenieros de Caminos was responsible for editing the
   journal up to 1923 when it was transferred to the Escuela Especial de
   Ingenieros de Caminos, and, since 1992 the journal has come under the
   auspices of the Colegio de Ingenieros de Caminos Canales y Puertos with
   the support of both of these institutions. The journal comes out every
   month in traditional paper format together with a digital version and
   covers the civil engineering world with constant focus on the
   innovations appearing in the sector. The following study may be seen as
   a synopsis of the main articles published throughout the nineteen and
   twenty centuries, complete with subject grouped opinions and
   descriptions of the advances in Spanish infrastructures over these two
   periods.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies of scholarly communication are based on a
   socio-technical perspective that has its root in science and technology
   studies (STS). Despite this close connection, the relationship between
   scholarly communication and STS is not well understood. Given this gap,
   this article aims to identify a conceptual link between the two fields,
   beginning with a review of each field and then examining areas of
   overlap. Findings reflect the fact that one domain of STS is concerned
   with the content of scientific knowledge; this is known as the sociology
   of scientific knowledge (SSK). This domain is closely related to the
   Processes of scholarly communication including publishing, searching,
   collaborating, citing, and writing. The other domain of STS, which
   focuses on institutions, norms, evaluations, and innovations, is known
   as sociology of science (or institutional sociology of science). This
   area is related to scholarly communication structures. Studies of
   bibliometric evaluation, relationships among disciplines, and innovation
   and productivity are examples of this connection.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative and simple microfabrication method for digital
   microfluidics is presented. In this method, devices are formed from
   copper substrates or gold compact disks using rapid marker masking to
   replace photolithography. The new method is capable of forming devices
   with inter-electrode gaps as small as 50 mu m. Saran (TM) wrap
   (polyethylene film) and commercial water repellants were used as
   dielectric and hydrophobic coatings, respectively, to replace commonly
   used and more expensive materials such as parylene-C and Teflon-AF.
   Devices formed by the new method enabled single- and two-plate actuation
   of droplets with volumes of 1-12 mu L. Fabricated devices were
   successfully tested for droplet manipulation, merging and splitting. We
   anticipate that this fabrication method will bring digital microfluidics
   within the reach of any laboratory with minimal facilities.}},

Abstract = {{In this work the development and optimization of the main components for
   a multisensing flexible Tag with RFID communication capabilities and
   integrated physical and chemical sensors for logistic datalogging
   applications will be reported. For this specific scenario, several
   constraints must be considered: power consumption must be limited for
   long-term operation, reliable ISO compliant RFID communication must be
   implemented, and special encapsulation issues must be faced for reliable
   sensor integration. In this work, the developments on application
   specific electronic interfaces and on ultra-low-power Metal OXdide
   semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors will be reported. The electronics for
   sensor control and readout as well as for RFID communication are based
   on an ultra-low-power MSP430 microcontroller from Texas Instruments
   together with a custom RFID front-end based on analog circuitry and a
   CPLD digital device, and are designed to guarantee a passive ISO15693
   compliant RFID communication in a range up to 6 cm. A thin film battery
   for sensor operation is included, thus data acquisition and storage can
   be accomplished when no reader field is present. This design allows the
   user to access both the traceability and sensor information even when
   the on-board battery is exhausted. The physical sensors for light,
   temperature and humidity are commercially available devices, while for
   chemical gas sensing innovative MOX sensors are developed, based on
   ultra-low-power micromachined hotplate arrays specifically designed for
   flexible Tag integration purposes. A single MOX sensor requires only 8.9
   mW for continuous operation, while temperature modulation and
   discontinuous sensor operation modes are implemented to further reduce
   the overall power consumption. The development of the custom control and
   RFID front-end electronics, together with innovative ultra-low-power MOX
   sensor arrays with flexible circuit encapsulation techniques will be
   described.}},

Abstract = {{We present a structure-finding algorithm designed to identify galaxy
   groups in photometric-redshift data sets: the probability
   friends-of-friends (pFoF) algorithm. This algorithm is derived by
   combining the FoF algorithm in the transverse direction and the
   photometric-redshift probability densities in the radial dimension. The
   innovative characteristic of our group-finding algorithm is the
   improvement of redshift estimation via the constraints given by the
   transversely connected galaxies in a group, based on the assumption that
   all galaxies in a group have the same redshift. Tests using the Virgo
   Consortium Millennium Simulation mock catalogs allow us to show that the
   recovery rate of the pFoF algorithm is larger than 80\% for mock groups
   of at least 2 x 10(13) M-circle dot, while the false detection rate is
   about 10\% for pFoF groups containing around at least eight net members.
   Applying the algorithm to the Canadian Network for Observational
   Cosmology Survey group catalogs gives results which are consistent with
   the mock catalog tests. From all these results, we conclude that our
   group-finding algorithm offers an effective yet simple way to identify
   galaxy groups in photometric-redshift catalogs.}},

Abstract = {{Safety I\&C plays an important part in safety and availability of
   nuclear power plants. AREVA NP, the nuclear technology enterprise,
   recently began delivery of the second generation TELEPERM XS digital
   safety I\&C technology. Qinshan 1, the first Chinese-built reactor, had
   its reactor protection system replaced. The plant has been back on the
   grid since January 12, 2008. Moreover, the Swedish Ringhals I nuclear
   generating unit has operated a neutron flux measuring system of the
   second-generation TELEPERM XS since October 2007. Both systems are
   running to their users' full satisfaction.
   TELEPERM XS has meanwhile been employed in 49 plants in twelve
   countries. This safety I\&C system by AREVA NP can be used with nearly
   all reactor lines, for both new reactor designs and upgrading nuclear
   power plants in operation. Here are some examples of successful
   installations of reactor protection, reactor control and limiting,
   neutron flux measurement and Diesel power control systems with TELEPERM
   XS: the Tianwan I and 2 units in China (VVER plants), Oskarsham 2 in
   Sweden (boiling water reactor), and Neckar-westheim I and 2 in Germany
   (pressurized water reactors). TELEPERM XS systems are being planned for
   the new plants of olkiluoto 3 in Finland (EPR), Flamanville 3 in France
   (EPR), Taishan I and 2 in China (EPR), and Ling Ao 3 and 4 in China (CPR
   1000).
   For quick and unproblematic implementation of TELEPERM XS in a plant,
   the system with all subassemblies, functions, and input/output signals
   is fully tested in a testing station.
   For this purpose, AREVA NP built one of the largest testing stations in
   the world for I\&C cabinets, the ``TELEPERM XS Integration Center,{''}
   at its German location in Erlangen. More than 200 I\&C cabinets can be
   tested simultaneously in these installations. The ``I\&C and Electrical
   Systems{''} Forum is attached to the testing station. This is where the
   company presents to its customers and partner firms realistic solutions,
   in combination with a control rod model, for electrical and I\&C systems
   in nuclear power plants on the basis of TELEPERM XS and RodPilot, an
   efficient and innovative control system for control rods in pressurized
   water reactors.}},

Title = {{Evidence of self-correcting spiral flows in swimming boxfishes}},
Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The marine boxfishes have rigid keeled exteriors (carapaces) unlike most
   fishes, yet exhibit high stability, high maneuverability and relatively
   low drag given their large cross-sectional area. These characteristics
   lend themselves well to bioinspired design. Based on previous
   stereolithographic boxfish model experiments, it was determined that
   vortical flows develop around the carapace keels, producing
   self-correcting forces that facilitate swimming in smooth trajectories.
   To determine if similar self-correcting flows occur in live, actively
   swimming boxfishes, two species of boxfishes (Ostracion meleagris and
   Lactophrys triqueter) were induced to swim against currents in a water
   tunnel, while flows around the fishes were quantified using digital
   particle image velocimetry. Significant pitch events were rare and short
   lived in the fishes examined. When these events were observed, spiral
   flows around the keels qualitatively similar to those observed around
   models were always present, with greater vortex circulation occurring as
   pitch angles deviated from 0 degrees. Vortex circulation was higher in
   live fishes than models presumably because of pectoral fin interaction
   with the keel-induced flows. The ability of boxfishes to modify their
   underlying self-correcting system with powered fin control is important
   for achieving high levels of both stability and maneuverability.
   Although the challenges of performing stability and maneuverability
   research on fishes are significant, the results of this study together
   with future studies employing innovative new approaches promise to
   provide valuable inspiration for the designers of bioinspired aquatic
   vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Assumptions about the pace of life speeding up abound in contemporary
   social theory. While many factors are contributing to this phenomenon,
   information and communication technologies are seen as the main drivers.
   This article considers the way social theorists analyse the concepts of
   time and speed and then examines how these claims might be assessed in
   the light of empirical research. Such research shows that time
   compression has multiple dimensions, and that the effect of digital
   devices like the mobile phone is not simply one of acceleration. In
   particular, I suggest that the social studies of technology offers a
   richer analysis of the reciprocal relationship between technological
   innovation and changing time practices. My argument is that while the
   hitherto neglected temporal dimension in sociological theory is now
   being addressed, there is an urgent need for increased dialogue to
   connect social theory with detailed empirical studies. Without this, we
   will continue to have difficulty distinguishing social science from
   science fiction.}},

Abstract = {{With the developments of software radio technique, it not only
   revolutionizes the technique in modern communication field, but also
   brings about technical innovation on the beam instrumentation for
   accelerators. The digital BPM based on software radio and digital
   receiver, has gained first successful application in accelerator at SLS.
   The company of Instrumentation Technologies made many efforts to update
   this device and finally the family devices-Libera were formed. It
   integrates the analog RF front end electronics, A/D converter, digital
   signal processing and synchrony trigger into an all in one measurement
   system with wideband. The Libera can be used at different types of
   accelerators and it has the functions of first turn, turn by turn and
   COD measurement. It plays an important role in the BEPCH early
   commissioning, especially in the beam circulating and stacking of BER
   and BPR, and also in the residual orbit oscillation measurement. In this
   paper, we introduce some measurement results by using the multifarious
   function of Libera, such as first turn, tune, residual orbit oscillation
   and optimum delay time of injection kicker.}},

Abstract = {{While existing research on peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing services has
   increased our understanding in many respects, it has not yet supplied a
   comprehensive theoretical framework that explains business failures of
   P2P file-sharing network service models. We develop such an analytical
   model and base it on seven specific market constraints - technical,
   economic, structural, legal, political, cognitive, and cultural - that
   are specifically relevant for P2P services. We show how our model can be
   used as a tool for strategic analysis of P2P business model performance
   using Napster as a particular case of study. We show also how P2P
   file-sharing networks have migrated through a series of system
   typologies by incorporating technological innovations in response to
   market constraints. Finally, we offer a new theoretical
   conceptualization that views P2P file-sharing networks as electronic
   markets. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High level combining is a practical way to upgrade existing FM
   transmitters to IBOC. Very well understood, with readily available 10 dB
   couplers, it is a very attractive method with which to upgrade even the
   highest power levels in the field. Unfortunately, if offers only a
   combining efficiency of 83\%, as 90\% of the IBOC power is wasted into a
   dummy load, along with 10\% of the generated FM power. Additionally, the
   power headroom demanded from the FM transmitter is proving to be an
   unsurpassable requirement for some existing,sites ready to upgrade.
   This paper presents an innovative combining technique that minimizes the
   FM and IBOC power loss in high level combining. Instead of combining two
   totally incoherent signals with its known resulting losses, this method
   first achieves partial coherence of the signals, and only then combines
   them at an optimum coupling ratio. A system implemented this way offers
   two main benefits; a higher overall system efficiency, and the
   elimination of the need for FM headroom. Though the paper focuses on the
   particular case of FM HD radio upgrade, this technique can also be used
   whenever low loss is needed when combining dissimilar signals.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a recursive filtering algorithm to restore
   monochromatic images which are corrupted by general dependent additive
   noise. It is assumed that the equation which describes the image field
   is not available and a filtering algorithm is obtained using the
   information provided by the covariance functions of the signal, noise
   that affects the measurement equation, and the fourth-order moments of
   the signal. The proposed algorithm is obtained by an innovation approach
   which provides a simple derivation of the least mean-squared error
   linear estimators. The estimation of the grey level in each spatial
   coordinate is made taking into account the information provided by the
   grey levels located on the row of the pixel to be estimated. The
   proposed filtering algorithm is applied to restore images which are
   affected by general signal-dependent additive noise.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of a
   three-dimensional (3D) thermopile; consists of 71 Cu-Ni series-connected
   thermocouples on polyimide (PI) flexible substrate. Using wet etching to
   etch through 25 mu m PI, the cold and hot junctions of thermocouples are
   formed on the top and bottom surfaces of PI substrate. This 3D layout
   design differentiates its innovative uniqueness from the traditional 2D
   planar thermopiles that have both hot and cold junctions on the same
   plane. The experimental studies on the PI etching with respect to the
   concentrations of KOH and C(2)H(7)NO in the etching solution conclude
   that the optimal composition of the etchant is 7-9 M KOH with 2-4 M
   C(2)H(7)NO and etched at 80 degrees C. A measured sensitivity of 0.44
   mV/K is realized in the fabricated device. The temperatures measured by
   the 3D thermopile are very close to those obtained with a digital
   thermometer, demonstrating that 3D flexible thermopiles has great
   potential to provide low cost thermal sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Nature is an information sourcebook of behaviour, function, colour and
   shape which can inspire visual design and invention. Studying the form
   and functional characteristics of a natural object can provide
   inspiration for product design and help to improve the marketability of
   manufactured products. The inspiration can be triggered either by direct
   observation or captured by three-dimensional (3D) digitising techniques
   to obtain superficial information (geometry and colour). An art designer
   often creates a concept in the form of a two-dimensional (2D) sketch
   while engineering methods lead to a point cloud in 3D. Each has its
   limitations in that the art designer commonly lacks the knowledge to
   build a final product from a 2D sketch and the engineering designer's 3D
   point clouds may not be very beautiful. We propose a method for Product
   Design from Nature (PDN), coupling aesthetic intent and geometrical
   characteristics, exploring the interactions between designers and
   nature's systems in PDN. We believe that this approach would
   considerably reduce the lead time and cost of product design from
   nature.}},

Abstract = {{The drive to achieve consistency and reliability of information across
   healthcare organizations has resulted in highly publicized
   standardization mandates by government regulators. The risk of funding
   loss, accreditation revocation, and financial penalties has led to
   speculation that disparity in management practices by healthcare
   organizations would largely disappear, as a result of government
   mandated initiatives to standardize and computerize patient information.
   This study seeks to examine how institutional forces influence the
   degree of outsourcing adoption in healthcare organizations, using a
   national survey of all accredited U.S. health information managers.
   Results suggest that significant non-adoption of information technology
   continues to occur across organizations, despite the risk of penalties
   designed to enforce reliability of medical patient information. We
   further examine how management varies across levels of incremental
   electronic record adoption and across organizations. We find significant
   variation exists in outsourcing adoption between highly computerized and
   paper-based medical record functions. We find like variation in
   motivating factors and task areas. Ramifications for information
   management in partial digital environments are discussed.}},

   architecture was used for chip design due to the development and
   validation of elementary fluidic designs, which are then assembled. This
   approach speeds up development and industrialization while minimizing
   the effort in designing and simplifying chip-fluidic programming.
   Dispensing reproducibility for 64 nl droplets obtained a CV below 3\%
   and mixing time was only a few seconds. Ease of the integration was
   demonstrated by performing on chip serial dilutions of 2.8-folds, four
   times. The second part of this paper concerns the development of new
   innovative fluidic functions in order to extend EWOD-actuated digital
   fluidics' capabilities. Experiments of particle dispensing by EWOD
   droplet handling are reported. Finally, work is shown concerning the
   coupling of EWOD actuation and magnetic fields for magnetic bead
   manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{Using an innovative time-varying front-end electronics in conjunction
   with a bulky coaxial high-purity germanium detector, we were able to
   extend the range of the radionuclide spectra well beyond the analog to
   digital converter (ADC) saturation point. The electronics automatically
   conditions the signal for digital-filtering optimization if it is in the
   ADC voltage range and for time-over-threshold analysis if it exceeds the
   ADC range. A high spectroscopic resolution has been achieved in both
   operation ranges. An unprecedented wide energy range from 5 keV to 150
   MeV of equivalent energy, or 90 dB, has been obtained using a single
   acquisition chain, while maintaining a high-energy resolution in the
   whole spectrum. For example, with an ADC range of 3 MeV a resolution has
   been obtained of 1.3/2.2 keV full width at half maximum on the 122/1332
   keV gamma-ray lines of (57)Co and (60)Co, and of <0.4\% in the
   time-over-threshold region, or for energy deposits beyond 3 MeV. (C)

Journal = {{SMPTE MOTION IMAGING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of high-definition television (HDTV) cameras and
   recorders; imagers, microprocessors, integrated circuits, and encoding
   schemes have all advanced in pace with the IT industry. Meanwhile, HD
   production has become the rule rather than the exception, as HDTV
   standards have matured. Image acquisition innovations have recently been
   focused on either expanding the HD market with smaller and more
   affordable cameras or pursuing ``Digital Cinematography,{''} which has
   inspired abandonment of the constraints of broadcast-type HD standards
   to emulate legacy 35mm film production and digital intermediary
   infrastructure. So what then can be accomplished with current
   technologies when they are applied to systems designed specifically for
   HD production and broadcast standards? In particular, what can be
   accomplished for the 2/3-in. 3 CCD shoulder-mount camera recorder? Can
   compromises made years ago be renegotiated? Advanced encoding schemes
   and recording methods can obviate the need for horizontal pre-filtering
   and additional color sub-sampling typical of in-camera recorders. Bit
   depth reduction is no longer necessary, and full 10-bit sampling, which
   was once reserved for master recording, can now be employed in a
   shoulder-mount camera recorder; therefore a 1920 x 1080 10-bit video
   signal can be recorded at the full 1920 x 1080 10-bit quality.
   Communications with digital lenses enable optical performance
   improvements in lightweight electronic field-production (EFP) style
   lenses. Electronic and optical improvements can work together to
   approach the performance of more cumbersome lens architectures. This
   paper examines some of the performance penalties of the formerly
   necessary design compromises and outlines specific newly-available
   innovations that allow us to revisit these compromises. Specific
   innovations that are highlighted include the AVC-Intra 100 Mbit/sec
   compression (AVC Intra-Frame coding at a bit rate of 100 Mbits/sec), and
   electronic chromatic aberration correction (CAC) technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Like other literacies (textual literacy, numeracy), digital visual
   literacy (DVL) is the ability both to create and to understand certain

Abstract = {{This paper is aimed at presenting a renovated model-building method of
   transfer function for industrial X-ray digital radiography based on the
   amorphous silicon X-ray flat-panel detector. The system, known as
   point-spreading function (PSF), is composed of three parts: the system
   geometrical dispersion with a non-spot power source, the scintillating
   screen dispersion and the aperture sampling of the pixel detector. For
   the innovation purpose, we have first of all established a mathematical
   simulation of the PSF and the modulation transfer function (MTF) on the
   basis of analyzing the intensity distribution of X-ray penetration area
   in each part and by taking Gaussian functions as a mathematical equation
   for depicting the transfer behavior of each part of the system. And,
   then, we have worked out the approximately effective bandwidth of the
   system from its half-wave width. And, finally, by taking the digital
   radiography based on the flat-panel detector for sampling, the paper has
   provided a theoretical foundation for the industrial X-ray radiographic
   testing and measurement operation. In addition, the author has also
   estimated the validation of the model through experiments and proved
   that the method helps to make high resolutions of the diacritical
   tiniest details in the work-pieces, which has shown and will show its
   technical rationality, technical appropriateness and practical working

Abstract = {{This article presents the importance and the aim of auto-regulation of
   e-commerce in Romania, as a tool that could be used to prevent and
   diminish the frauds within the virtual world. Electronic commerce, as a
   form of manifestation of informational revolution, induces specific
   problems that can not be solved using exclusively the legal norms and
   standards; these situations require new instruments that compensate the
   slow reaction of the public authorities in adopting technological
   innovations and adapting the dynamic changes induced by the transition
   to a new economy: information and knowledge economy. Frauds committed in
   the virtual world are among the negative effects of this transition
   towards digital era. E-fraud is a phenomenon that also affects the
   electronic commerce in Romania, although it is an early stage
   development sector with an important potential growth. Under these
   circumstances, it is required new solutions that prevent the extension
   of this phenomenon. Considering this aim, the article highlights the
   auto- regulation techniques that are suitable primarily for the real
   need of the electronic commerce in Romania: obtaining the trust of
   users, the main goal of the auto- regulation being the creation of a
   specific behavior that raises the level of the trust for the marketed
   products and services. This paper supports the implementation of auto-
   regulation in this sector, the article presents the main problems
   witnessed by the Romanian electronic commerce and the solutions provided
   by these techniques; the success of this technique that has been already
   proved at the international levels is also presented throughout the
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{The MEM Project (Magnetic and Electric fields Monitoring) has been
   running in the INGV Observatory of L'Aquila since 2004. The principal
   purpose of the project is to create a network of observatories in
   Central Italy to monitor the electromagnetic signals in the frequency
   band {[}0.001 Hz-100 kHz]. This band includes natural signals (magnetic
   pulsations of magnetospheric origin. Earth-ionosphere resonance mode
   signals, atmospheric noise, and so on) and artificial signals (power
   line emissions, VLF radio transmissions, and so on). The innovative
   characteristic of the project is the approach chosen to study the
   complex problem concerning the representation of the spatial and
   temporal distributions of the electromagnetic fields in the band of
   interest. Both the distributions can be represented by some parameters
   containing the locations and the characteristics of the sources of the
   electromagnetic signals. When all the stations will be in operation the
   wide-band interferometry will be applied. Combining the simultaneous
   observations of the electromagnetic field measured in the stations of
   the network, we will be able to obtain detailed information about the
   investigated electromagnetic sources. A new measurement system has been
   developed to fulfil these requirements focusing on the automation of the
   measurements. The system is designed for long term recording of the
   electromagnetic fields in a wide frequency band. In the frequency band
   {[}1 Hz-100 kHz] the three components of the magnetic field and the
   three components of atmospheric electric field are processed in real
   time using DSP (Digital Signal Processing) techniques. In the frequency
   band {[}0.001-25] Hz the two components of the telluric field and the
   three components of the magnetic field are recorded as sampled (100 Hz).
   One of the main scientific objectives of the MEM project is the
   long-term monitoring of the geodynamical processes, such as the
   earthquakes, by the calculation of the Poynting vector, and the analysis
   of the magnetic transfer functions and impedance tensor. In the coming
   years this kind of analysis can be useful to underline the possible
   correlation between the geodynamical processes and the local magnetic
   field anomalies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe a study of the effectiveness of mobile
   learning (m-learning) in the form of podcasting, for teaching
   undergraduate students in Higher Education. Podcasting involves
   downloading a series of audio or video broadcasts (files) onto a digital
   media player, via a computer, over a period of weeks. These can then be
   watched or listened to when, where and as often as students choose. The
   use of digital media players, popularised by Apple's iPod (TM), is
   widespread amongst undergraduate students. A pilot survey of Business
   and Management students indicated that over 74\% owned some form of
   digital media player, with a further 7\% indicating that they intended
   to purchase one in the next six months.
   Whilst podcasting is being utilized as a teaching tool by some educators
   in the secondary sector, its use in higher education, and its
   effectiveness as a learning tool for adults, remains to be established.
   In our study, a separate group of just under 200 first-level students
   were given a series of revision podcasts after completing a course in
   Information and Communications Technology (and prior to their
   examination). As part of the subscription process, they had to complete
   an online questionnaire about their experience. The questionnaire
   utilized a five-point Likert scale comparing their attitudes to
   lectures, podcasts, notes, textbooks and multimedia e-learning systems.
   Statistical analysis of the results of the study indicates that students
   believe that podcasts are more effective revision tools than their
   textbooks and they are more efficient than their own notes in helping
   them to learn. They also indicate that they are more receptive to the
   learning material in the form of a podcast than a traditional lecture or
   textbook. The study suggests that the use of podcasts as a revision tool
   has clear benefits as perceived by undergraduate students in terms of
   the time they take to revise and how much they feel they can learn.
   Coupled with the advantages of flexibility in when, where and how it is
   used, podcasting appears to have significant potential as an innovative
   learning tool for adult learners in Higher Education. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel 10-bit A/D converter based on a pipeline-like
   architecture specific for low-noise, self-triggered sensors, (e.g.,
   X-rays and gamma-rays spectrometry) is presented. The main innovative
   feature of the proposed A/D structure is the concept that, for a sampled
   input signal, a pipeline ADC may behave as a combinatorial logic and may
   operate without any timing signal (clock). The conversion is obtained
   asynchronously propagating the partial conversions and the residues
   through the various stages. This concept is validated by means of a
   prototype ADC fabricated in a standard 0.35 mu m CMOS technology. The
   active area is 2.24mm(2), and it provides a conversion in 2.5 mu s
   (i.e., it can operate with a 400 kS/s data rate) featuring an ENOB equal
   to 8.91.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of literature has explored the challenges of technological
   change for established firms. Much of this work has focused on factors
   internal to firms, such as inertial routines or managers' cognitive
   limitations that constrain incumbents' development of new capabilities
   and response to new technologies. But institutional pressures arising
   from financial markets and the securities analysts who mediate such
   markets likely also play a role in whether and how incumbent firms
   respond to technological change. We know little about how financial
   markets and securities analysts react as an incumbent firm is faced with
   a radical technological discontinuity that threatens to substitute for
   the existing technology. Understanding such reactions is critical, as
   they further influence whether and how incumbents respond to
   technological discontinuities. In this article, I explore securities
   analysts reactions to incumbent firms faced with technological
   discontinuities in two industries: digital technology in photography,
   and Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) technology in wireline
   telecommunications. I find that these discontinuities go largely
   unmentioned in analysts reports and appear to have little influence on
   analysts' recommendations or stock prices even for several years. The
   findings suggest further that analysts and investors continue to reward
   incumbents for cash flows arising from focusing on the existing business
   and technology despite the increasing certainty of technological
   obsolescence.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative testing system, capable of testing miniature testpieces at
   elevated temperatures, has been used to characterise appropriate samples
   of Nimonic 90, a nickel alloy. This alloy is being used for extensive
   validation testing to underpin a new European Code of Practice for TMF
   (thermomechanical fatigue) tests. This paper provides additional
   characterisation information using the miniature
   electro-thermomechanical test system (the ETMT) that has been developed
   at the National Physical Laboratory to obtain multiproperty data over a
   range of temperatures. The system uses DC electric current to heat
   rectangular cross-section testpieces. It has water cooling for the
   testpiece grips, a facility for inert gas supply to prevent sample
   oxidation, and full computer-control and digital data acquisition. In
   the present arrangement, strain is deduced by monitoring changes in
   resistance. Both thermal and mechanical loads can be cycled and a
   special program was written for conducting either IP or OP TMF tests.
   The system was used to obtain data on the variation of electrical
   resistivity with temperature and this data provided insight on the phase
   changes that occur in Nimonic 90 as a function of temperature. Uniaxial
   mechanical tests were performed at 400 and 850 degrees C, the
   temperature limits of the specified IMF cycle. Preliminary TMF tests
   were performed for comparison with the European interlaboratory testing
   exercise on macroscopic testpieces. The repeatability of miniature tests
   was good and the fracture mechanism appeared to be representative of
   deformation observed in macroscopic tests on the alloy. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{The introduction and clear benefits of silicon technology into
   automotive application were characterized by fast growth during last
   years. In effect, the technological innovation of microelectronics
   carried out a fast revolution into automotive fields, considering
   physical sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers and combustion monitoring
   and air quality control devices. The present paper describes a typical
   application of the microsystem technology gas sensor products into
   automotive fields. In particular, the fabrication enhancements of a
   sol-gel Pd-doped TiO2 sensor will be investigated. Main advantages of
   the realized sensors are the reduced dimensions, the low power
   consumption, and the cheap fabrication process. Some advancements
   regarding silicon wafer batch production are presented, together with a
   custom electronic board realized for proportional-integral-derivative
   (PID) temperature control and digital signal conditioning of sensors

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach to engaging and stimulating users in
   the requirements analysis process when developing a new information
   system - an ICT innovation for business. The approach is based on a
   synthesis of a constructivist learning theory and a creativity education
   theory. In contrast to previous approaches in which the systems analyst
   elicits requirements from the user, in the proposed approach, the user
   is engaged and stimulated to become a proactive and creative learner in
   the process of identifying and discovering their business problem as
   well as exploring opportunities to apply ICT innovations to solve the
   problem
   Two experiential digital simulations are described as a proof of concept
   to demonstrate the proposed approach a learning environment. Learning
   from the case study suggests that both systems analyst and business
   users can be stimulated to be active learners in their discovery of
   problem, creative ideas and problem solutions in requirements

Abstract = {{This paper studies the dynamics of mobile telecommunications market in
   Pakistan. It draws on the emerging approach that views mobile telecom
   industry as a complex socio-technical system comprising both human and
   technological components. Three set of actors that make such system are
   studied in depth. These include Institutions, Providers and Users. It is
   argued that the development of a viable mobile market depends on the
   creation of a feasible environment that encourages growth in the market.
   The unique combination and actions of various actors in the industry
   shape and contribute to the development of such environment. The
   creation of these conditions is thus a combined success or a failure of
   all actors involved. The study provides evidence that a pro-competition,
   liberalised and fair policy that provides level playing field to service
   providers is imperative for the success of mobile telecommunications. It
   emphasises on the importance of an independent regulator, technological
   innovation and harmony among all stake holders to develop a successful
   mobile industry.}},

Abstract = {{The digital reconstruction of an optically recorded hologram has become
   a fast developing method and has found a vast practical application in
   many branches of science and industry. An especially invented
   diffractive optical element with self imaging properties is placed in
   the reference beam. In the recording process this element forms its
   self-image in the hologram plane. Self-imaging properties of the
   diffractive optical element provide the possibility of recording a
   digital hologram by means of the phase-shifting without any additional
   imaging components. The innovation of the proposed method lies in using
   a self-imaging diffractive optical element which enables a significant
   simplification of a spatial phase shifting optical setup used to record
   the digital hologram with only a small decrease of the quality of the
   reconstructed image.}},

Abstract = {{Privacy protection of visual information is increasingly important as
   pervasive camera networks becomes more prevalent. The proposed scheme
   addresses the problem of preserving and controlling of the privacy
   visual data through two innovations. First, unlike the existing
   centralized control of privacy data, the proposed system allows
   individual users to make the final decision on every access to their
   privacy data. As such, it offers a much stronger form of privacy
   protection as the user no longer needs to trust, adhere or register
   his/her privacy preferences with a server. The second innovation is the
   development of a secure reversible data hiding scheme for embedding all
   the ownership information and privacy data into the obfuscated video
   bitstream. Not only has it resulted in an efficient design of protocols,
   the reversible data hiding allows perfect reconstruction of original
   data and supports arbitrary types of video obfuscation techniques.
   Impact of data hiding on bitrate and distortion is minimized through a
   rate-distortion optimization procedure and experimental results are
   provided to demonstrate its efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the Digital Ecosystem (DE) initiative(1) is to encourage
   Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to use the Internet and to
   adopt ICT technologies that would make them more innovative and
   competitive in the market. In order for a DE to take-off, specific
   solutions are required that are practical and easy to adopt, and that
   address the organizational and infrastructural particularities of the
   networked communities.
   This paper proposes a new trust model for DEs which has several
   innovative features. The model is based on the concept of social
   networks and addresses trust at different levels: user, data, service
   and node. The model allows fast bootstrapping of trust by importing
   existing trust relationships from outside DE systems and by relying on
   certificates issued by trusted authorities external to the DE.
   Furthermore, trust can be measured in a variety of contexts by using
   user-defined tags - folksonomy(2). The model abstracts from specific
   reputation algorithms by providing necessary interfaces for plugging-in
   those on one's own choice.}},

Abstract = {{Digital EcoSystems (DES) have recently been introduced into the computer
   and information societies. A Digital Ecosystem is the dynamic and
   synergetic complex of Digital Communities consisting of interconnected,
   interrelated and interdependent Digital Species situated in a Digital
   Environment, that interact as a functional unit and are linked together
   through actions, information and transaction flows. Digital Ecosystems
   integrate various cutting-edge technologies including ontologies,
   agent-based and self-organizing systems, swarm intelligence, ambient
   intelligence, data mining etc. The synergetic effects of these
   methodologies results in a more efficient, effective, reliable and
   secure system.
   The application of DES within the health domain would transform the way
   in which health information is created, stored, accessed, used, managed,
   analyzed and shared, and would bring an innovative breakthrough within
   health domain. In this paper, we illustrate how the DES Design
   Methodology can be implemented within the health domain. We focus on the
   key factors associated with the DES design. The design methodology
   framework allows better control over the design process and serves as a
   navigating tool during the Digital Health Ecosystems design.}},

Abstract = {{People with disabilities are parts of the development agenda. Those
   persons face lots of geographical and social barriers. Here come the
   needs to find alternative solutions, which can use the ICT (Information
   \& Telecommunications Technology) to meet the access and service needs
   for PWDs.
   This article focuses in one hand, on accessible design (or design for
   all) by using technical standards, adaptive hardware and software, and
   multi-modality architecture. On the other hand, it discusses the
   availability due to the lack of an ICT infrastructure in the developing
   countries, and the affordability as PWDs live in vulnerable situation
   due to exclusion from education, employment and health care systems.
   The main aim is to facilitate accessibility of ICTs for all, and how to
   bring about necessary conditions for PWDs to enjoy the same
   opportunities in life by creating global awareness on the importance of
   accessible ICT as means of economic and social integration, to bridge
   the digital divide and provide equal access to all, and to serve as a
   medium to exercise fundamental rights.
   These objectives can be accomplished by using appropriate educational
   and administrative infrastructure, encouraging the design of ICT
   equipment production, promoting the development of technologies,
   encouraging the research on the information society including innovative
   forms of networking, and by adapting ICT infrastructure, tools, and
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{E-learning is the use of Internet technologies to enhance knowledge and
   performance. E-learning technologies offer learners control over
   content, learning sequence, pace of learning, time, and often media,
   allowing them to tailor their experiences to meet their personal
   learning objectives. In diverse medical education contexts, e-learning
   appears to be at least as effective as traditional instructor-led
   methods such as lectures. Students do not see e-learning as replacing
   traditional instructor-led training but as a complement to it, forming
   part of a blended-learning strategy.
   A developing infrastructure to support e-learning within medical
   education includes repositories, or digital libraries, to manage access
   to e-learning materials, consensus on technical standardization, and
   methods for peer review of these resources. E-learning presents numerous
   research opportunities for faculty, along with continuing challenges for
   documenting scholarship. Innovations in e-learning technologies point
   toward a revolution in education, allowing learning to be individualized
   (adaptive learning), enhancing learners' interactions with others
   (collaborative learning), and transforming the role of the teacher. The
   integration of e-learning into medical education can catalyze the shift
   toward applying adult learning theory, where educators will no longer
   serve mainly as the distributors of content, but will become more
   involved as facilitators of learning and assessors of competency.}},

Abstract = {{Chaotic detection is to test weak signals based on trajectory changes of
   chaotic system. The traditional Duffing system is sensitive to frequency
   of periodical sine signals, but it is only suitable for detecting
   low-frequency signals, and can not be used to detect those of
   high-frequency. Therefore, an improved Duffing system is established in
   this paper, which is applied innovatively into demodulation process of
   OOK digital modulation signals. Simulation results by MATLAB show that
   the chaotic Duffing receiving system can demodulate signal OOK
   effectively.}},

Abstract = {{There is undoubtedly an increase in the number of consumer appliances
   that are enjoying networking capabilities. With data throughput
   increasing among devices that are renowned to be less capable than
   personal computers, we see an increase in the consumption of multimedia.
   In parallel, gaming and social networking are at the forefront of next
   generation entertainment systems where new and novel usage scenarios are
   pushing technological boundaries. Mobile devices are becoming more like
   computers and vice versa and television is becoming more interactive.
   These advances have undoubtedly provided a platform for innovation,
   where a natural progression would be to blur the gap between the
   aforementioned technologies. For example, multimedia service provided by
   a television could be integrated within a virtual environment and
   manipulated in ways not yet seen. Here we could see television rendered
   as 2D linear images and as 3D models of the scene itself. This will
   provide the user with immersive digital content that can be changed,
   viewed from multiple angles, and even handled. We present a new approach
   demonstrated using a working prototype to implement a virtual
   environment capable of receiving multimedia content from a networked
   appliances, and manipulating it in new and novel ways.}},

Abstract = {{Object recognition is an essential task in many image processing
   applications. Although object appears as three-dimensional in real
   world, they are usually perceived as two-dimensional in digital image or
   video. In most cases, major problems in recognizing objects lie on the
   two-dimensional geometry changes in object appearances. This paper
   presents an innovative template matching based object recognition method
   that is invariant to rotation and scale changes as well as resistant to
   noise. The approach is achieved by combining feature based search
   strategy and object matching in Log-Polar domain. Translation of the
   object is recovered with the new Gabor feature extraction method applied
   in the Cartesian coordinate. The multi-resolution Log-Polar search
   method is invented to reduce the number of feature point for Log-Polar
   matching in the target image. The new similarity measure for
   classification and verification is also proposed. The innovative
   combination of these techniques yields robustness in object recognition
   for fast computation without any resealing in the target image.
   Comparisons of the repeatability factor of the new Gabor feature
   extraction with other well-known techniques such as SIFT and
   Harris-Laplacian is presented to evaluate the two-dimensinal invariant
   and noise resistant properties of the proposed feature extraction.
   Experiments with still images and noisy images are provided to verify
   the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Computationally recognizing causal relationships in data is
   fundamentally important to good decision making. There are vast amounts
   of computer stored, mufti-faceted data. Understanding how stored data
   items affect each other is crucial in making good decisions. The most
   important decisional information is an understanding of causal
   relationships. An abundance of digital data riches promise a profound
   impact in both the quality and rate of discovery and innovation in
   science and engineering, as well as in other societal contexts.
   Worldwide, researchers re producing, accessing, analyzing, integrating
   and storing massive amounts of digital data daily, through observation,
   experimentation and simulation, as well as through the creation of
   collections of digital representations of tangible artifacts and
   specimens. After the data is captured, it is made available for
   analysis. Analyzing large data collections for possible causal
   relationships is computationally difficult and speculative.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile communication presents one of the mainstream research challenges
   in Information Communication Technologies. GPS, EGNOS and in near future
   GALILEO, represent technologies that enable implementation of innovative
   services following the concept of Personal Info-Mobility. The
   information can be related to time and territory, thus it presents quite
   interesting opportunities for location-based services. The paper
   forwards proposition of a tool for the geographical information system
   combining global positioning system with digital image acquisition. The
   problem of user's positioning during the image capture is not trivial
   and addresses both localization and synchronization issues. Information
   on camera optics, while accompanied by its geographical position and
   orientation may offer more valuable data for further interpretation and
   indexing in geographical information systems. While applied on a massive
   scale, people will be able to use such solutions to record and recall
   important places in their lives. The proposition of a geo-referenced
   imaging system is described along with description of the working
   prototype application.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing amount of digital media being stored, shared and
   consumed on the Internet, more imaging applications are deployed online.
   However, the usability and use model of those applications are often
   less studied. In this paper, we present Snapfish Lab, an open online
   imaging community web site, to enable both imaging technologists and
   enthusiasts participate actively in exploring; the usability and use
   model of the exploratory imaging applications. The main topic addressed
   in this paper is the challenges and solutions of building a production
   quality web site that supports open and high performance imaging
   application hosting, rich user feedback collection and satisfactory end
   user experience. The key value offered by Snapfish Lab is to bridge
   imaging research community and end users so than user's demand becomes

Abstract = {{In this work, we are proposing a novel approach targeted to handling
   signal processing and data transmission tasks related to a
   multi-standard terminal encompassing WiMAX and UMTS standards. We shall
   present an innovative Software-Defmed-Radio (SDR)-based framework which
   will be able to arrange the digital processing tasks concerning the
   baseband level of the multi-standard transceiver architecture. In
   particular, an objectoriented model will be proposed for the baseband
   level implementation. The general structure consists of a number of
   modules for each specific and/or common component of UMTS and WiMAX
   signal processing chain. We start to design the SDR architecture model
   as a software prototype. The framework model was built as C++ class
   library in order to evaluate how SDR-based implementation works and to
   assess its quantitative performances. This model allows to consider the
   process of the packet interaction between transmitter and receiver and,
   moreover, the inter-packet interaction inside each module of the
   terminal. After all, the proposed software model will be integrated into
   the hardware platform and the final tests will be performed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the concept of a universal controller hardware
   system for power electronics applications. With the presence of generic
   interfaces and communication schemes, this system can be used in various
   other control scenarios. A prototype hardware system incorporating a
   high performance floating point digital signal processor (DSP) and a
   powerful field programmable gate array (FPGA) has been built to
   demonstrate the concept of real-time hardware simulation. Prior to being
   deployed for control of a complete power electronics system, an
   intermediate step that would yield more information pertaining to system
   timing is the hardware simulation enabled by such a board. Extracting
   maximum throughput from this system with a few innovative schemes has
   been another goal of this project. In order to achieve this objective,
   the embedded peripherals of the Texas Instruments 06000 series DSP have
   been programmed to facilitate a higher degree of parallelism. The core
   of this paper deals with the different sub-systems that comprise the
   real-time controller (RTC) board, and their interaction with one
   another. One of the novel schemes proposed in this paper involves the
   on-board communication between the DSP and several analog-to-digital
   converter (ADC) chips using the multi-channel audio serial port (McASP)
   peripheral. The efficacy of this concept is made possible by a robust
   software architecture, enabled by the enhanced direct memory access
   (EDMA) peripheral. In addition to the DSP peripheral activity,
   significant processing capability is offered by the Cyclone II series
   FPGA. The option of universal connectivity is provided over either
   ethernet or USB. The FPGA also provides a platform for developing a
   complete system with an embedded 32-bit processor. The RTC board
   prototype can be used for power electronics applications with the
   addition of certain interface boards, which can be readily developed.}},

Abstract = {{A secure image transmission mechanism is necessary when malicious
   intruders intend to access and modify content delivery over wireless
   networks. To assure data integrity, authentication is required for
   multimedia data delivered over wireless image sensor networks.
   Watermarking technique is an effective vehicle to assert and assure the
   image data authentications. There have been recent works reported on
   watermarking, but few with the consideration of energy cost in terms of
   the data communication and processing, which is a key constraint to many
   embedded systems and wireless sensor networks. Most watermarking systems
   only target at minimizing watermarked image distortion and increasing
   robustness at the source coding site for lossy image processing. The
   watermarked image distortion caused by error-prone wireless environments
   during transmission has not been fully considered. In this paper, an
   innovative energy-aware adaptive watermarking scheme for real-time image
   delivery is proposed in wireless multimedia sensor networks. This new
   scheme allocates network resource to protect the watermarked image
   transmission while embedding watermark coding redundancies into the
   images. Dynamic watermark thresholds are applied to be adaptive to the
   network condition (packet loss ratio) and the inter-frame correlation is
   exploited to reduce processing delay. The simulation results show that
   the proposed adaptive watermark system can achieve considerable energy
   efficiency and assure the data integrity({[}1]).}},

Abstract = {{Digitization and competition has changed the ICT market structure
   completely. The ability of IP to surf on all networks has made it
   possible to offer same services on various types of broadband access
   networks including DSL, Cable Modem, Fiber infrastructure, Third
   Generation (3G) Cellular, and WiMAX. These networks are still passing
   through rapid technological innovations. In the presence of many
   alternate platforms for the same service and capability of each platform
   to offer almost all kinds of services due to IP revolution, it has
   become inappropriate to regulate these platforms differently. The main
   challenge for policy makers and regulators is how to tackle this new
   IP-based converged broadband world. This paper analysis the ``Layering
   Policy Approach{''} to find its suitability for ICT sector and also
   discusses a modified ``New Layering Theory{''} for finding Significant
   Market Power (SMP) for the IP world. The Layer Policy Model may be
   proved a reasonable choice for ICT industry if used carefully and by
   first analyzing each aspect of it. At least, this model can be helpful
   in pointing out problems and issues in a natural way for technologically
   advanced horizontal ICT sector.}},

Abstract = {{Analog and digital circuits are both prone to failure due to transient
   upsets, variations, etc. Redundancy techniques, such as N-tuple Modular
   Redundancy, has been widely used to correct faulty behavior of
   components and achieve high reliability for digital circuits, whereas,
   not much has been done on the analog side. In this paper, we propose a
   redundancy based fault-tolerant methodology to design a highly reliable
   analog to digital converters (ADC). Our methodology employs redundant
   analog blocks and chooses the best result using an innovative analog
   voter. Experimental results are reported to verify the concepts, measure
   the system's reliability and tradeoff reliability versus cost and power.}},

Abstract = {{In order to keep pace with advancements in technology, electrical and
   computer engineering education is undergoing some major changes. Today's
   students are utilizing more sophisticated equipment in the classroom and
   laboratory to enhance their engineering skills. Much of this change is
   fueled by the availability of more affordable and easy to use
   microcontrollers and embedded systems including reconfigurable
   multipurpose hardware platforms.
   At the heart of this paradigm shift in education is the proliferation of
   Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Programmable Logic Devices
   (PLDs) and the growth of system on a chip (SOC) design. SOC designs
   facilitate innovation by incorporating the speed of dedicated hardware
   and memory with the flexibility of general purpose processors on a
   single chip. The use of this prototyping platform is enabling students
   to combine information form courses in digital logic design and
   microcontroller programming to create system-level designs and more
   fully understand hardware / software interaction.
   In this paper we provide a background of the reprogrammable platform and
   discuss how academic research activities can also benefit from the use
   of a similar platform. By enhancing information sharing and cooperation
   between research and education undergraduate students can gain more
   exposure to cutting-edge academic research. In addition, the use of
   prototyping for research will provide additional visibility of research
   projects to the industrial community. We suggest, through the use of
   case studies utilizing the reprogrammable platform how such cooperation
   can be achieved and prove beneficial to technology development.}},

Abstract = {{An infant monitoring system based on the ARM embedded platform is
   proposed in this paper. Since both the parents need to work and look

   system consisting of an embedded system platform with a Linux kernel
   2.4.18 embedded operation system using the TCP/IP protocol, a CMOS image
   sensor, and peripheral control systems. The key feature of the system is
   that it can be used to monitor the living environment and the activities
   of the babies and/or infants through a web browser at any time from any
   place in the world. In order to increase the accuracy of the temperature
   sensor, the measured values from the TMP75 digital temperature sensor
   were calibrated using regression analysis methods, resulting in an
   accuracy of +/- 0.1 degrees C, a correlation coefficient of 0.996, and a
   standard deviation of 0.124. The experimental results show that the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel content-aware joint media error and
   authentication protection scheme based on error correcting coding (ECC).
   The innovation of the proposed scheme lies in the true joint design of
   error protection and authentication verification. This is fundamentally
   different from many existing schemes in which they consider media
   authentication separately from other media processing components such as
   error protection in media communication systems. By making use of the
   channel information and integrating the authentication with error
   protection necessary in contemporary media communication systems, we are
   able to achieve 100\% complete verification with low authentication
   overhead. With such integration, the end-to-end media quality and media
   security guarantee can be obtained. Based on this joint error and
   authentication protection framework, an optimal rate allocation
   algorithm under certain source and channel models is also developed.
   Simulations based on JPEG 2000 images have been carried out to validate
   the proposed scheme and the simulation results show that the proposed
   approach is indeed able to achieve simultaneous error and authentication
   protection for JPEG 2000 images.}},

Abstract = {{Many digital sound archives still suffer from tremendous problems
   concerning access. Materials are often in different formats, with
   related media in separate collections, and with non-standard,
   specialist, incomplete or even erroneous metadata. Thus, the end user is
   unable to discover the full value of the archived material. EASAIER
   addresses these issues with the development of an innovative remote
   access system which extends beyond standard content management and
   retrieval systems. The EASAIER system has been designed with sound
   archives, libraries, museums, broadcast archives, and music schools in
   mind. However, the tools may be used by anyone interested in accessing
   archived material; amateur or professional, regardless of the material
   involved. Furthermore, it enriches the access experience enabling the
   user to experiment with the materials in exciting new ways. The system
   features; enhanced cross media retrieval functionality, multi-media
   synchronisation, audio and video processing, analysis and visualisation
   tools, all combined within in a single user configurable interface.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in the technology industry and academia show that
   users are increasingly becoming the focus in technology development Not
   only new applications capable of performing certain tasks are brought to
   potential users, but also technical innovations that are built around
   people in order to best fit their needs.
   Beyond standard web and desktop applications, an ideal use of this
   principle would be in a digital representation of a real-world city
   which allows city inhabitants to access, add, and modify information and
   thus use the city in a more informed way. The term WikiCity represents
   this concept.
   The development of a WikiCity requires answers to questions such as: how
   can a city be sensed, modeled, and actuated in real-time? How can
   inhabitants interact with information in the city?
   The paper presents this idea through a use-case scenario in which users
   can inform themselves about certain events in the city. They can
   retrieve real-time information related to the events such as nearby
   happenings, availability of public transportation, and traffic
   conditions, or create a personalized event route. Users can also feed
   information back into the WikiCity system before, during, and after
   attending events.
   This requires new developments in modeling of human behavior, flexible
   back-end infrastructures, and semantic-web. The architecture of such
   system including the relations between data sources and user services,
   and data flow procedures are explained in the paper. A first
   implementation of the WikiCity concept was presented at the White Night
   event in Rome, Italy on September 8, 2007.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative remote experiment system is brought forward and realized
   in the paper, which is developed to allow using of FPGA devices remotely

   opportunities to design digital circuits and implement them into F-PGA,
   even if the FPGA devices are not available in their location. The system
   is aimed at structuring a new open mode of computer hardware design
   experiment, supplementing remote theory effectively, and resolving the
   problem that leaching experiment teaching could not keep up with theory
   teaching in the distance education.
   There are two innovative approaches in the system design, The first, the
   network of the system is built based on embedded Web Services
   technology, which is in the lead in technology field. The second is
   using boundary-scan technology as electric probe to realize remote
   experiment verification. There are no precedents applying boundary-scan
   testing technology to the experiment system in education field, so the
   idea is original.}},

Abstract = {{Today, technology continues to evolve as more functionality is placed
   into smaller packages with the aid of new innovative hardware and
   improving software in digital excitation systems. The advancement of the
   microprocessor has provided the means to increase the feature function
   capacity into less hardware and provide additional means to enhance
   reliability by offering redundancy of a complete fall functional digital
   excitation channel. This paper will discuss various approaches to
   redundancy being accomplished today by vendors that include discussions
   at various levels ranging from digital controllers, firing circuits,
   power supplies, and power rectifier bridges.
   Recently, the latest version of IEFEE 421.4 Guidelines for Specifying an
   Excitation System was released that included discussion of excitation
   system redundancy. This paper expands upon the various levels of
   redundancy offered by the manufacturers so the end user will have
   sufficient information to make the best choices for his application.}},

   One century after the first RADAR `idea{''} we registered the NODAR
   (Nanotechnology Optical Detection And Ranging) trademark. Such NODAR, by
   including both photonic and nano technologies, aims to implement
   multifunctional, multirole, multidomain sensors, as well as adaptive,
   flexible, knowledge-based sensors. NODAR requires proactive studies and
   developments on: I) nanotechnology vacuum tube amplifiers (TX reverse
   nano triode); II) wide bandwidth Tx-Rx optical beam forming network by
   means of optical modulator, combiner, analogue optical receive and
   programmable true time delay; M broadband photonic analogue to digital
   converters; M thermal management and interconnection by means of carbon
   nanotubes; V) nanotechnology infrared and chemical state of art sensors.
   Finally, the insertion of state of the art innovative technologies
   requires an integrated ``multiscide{''} approach, by combining materials
   sciences, photonics, nanotechnologies and production technologies with
   other based technologies}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces innovative SAR system concepts for the acquisition
   of high resolution radar images with wide swath coverage from spaceborne
   platforms. The new concepts rely on the combination of advanced
   multi-channel SAR front-end architectures with novel operational modes.
   The architectures differ regarding their implementation complexity and
   it is shown that even a low number of channels is already well suited to
   significantly improve the imaging performance and to overcome
   fundamental limitations inherent to classical SAR systems. The more
   advanced concepts employ a multidimensional encoding of the transmitted
   waveforms to further improve the performance and to enable a new class
   of hybrid SAR imaging modes that are well suited to satisfy hitherto
   incompatible user requirements for frequent monitoring and detailed
   mapping. Implementation specific issues will be discussed and examples
   demonstrate the potential of the new techniques for different remote
   sensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new modular design for implementation of active
   noise control (ANC) systems with online secondary path modeling. This
   design comprises of four similar modules to reduce the unwanted primary
   noise. One of these modules performs as the main adaptive control filler
   that uses an FxLMS algorithm to converge the lap-weights. Two other
   modules work as the adaptive modeling filters that use an LMS algorithm
   to model the secondary path filler. The last module works as a digital
   filler to produce the antinoise output signal. This innovative modular
   implementation of the ANC system results in a fast design and fast
   convergence with capability to expand the four adaptive filters and data
   bus when better noise reduction for ANC system is desired.}},

Abstract = {{Privacy {[}4] in the digital world is an important problem which is
   becoming even more pressing as new collaborative applications are
   developed. The lack of privacy preserving mechanisms is particularly
   problematic in federated identity management contexts. In such a
   context, users can seamlessly interact with a variety of federated web
   services, through the use of single-sign-on mechanisms and the
   capability of sharing personal data among these web services. We argue
   that comprehensive privacy policies should be stated by federated
   service providers and proactively checked by these providers, before
   disclosing users' data to federated partners. To address such
   requirements, we introduce mechanisms and algorithms for policy
   compliance checking between federated service providers, based on an
   innovative policy subsumption approach. We formally introduce and
   analyze our approach.}},

Abstract = {{The millimeter wave band from 60-95 GHz offers large swathes of
   unlicensed and semi-unlicensed spectrum, which may well form the basis
   for the next revolution in wireless communication, in which wireless
   catches up with wires. With the rapid scaling of silicon processes,
   low-cost implementations for radio frequency front-ends are on the
   horizon. A key challenge now is to parlay these breakthroughs into
   innovative system concepts. We review three such concepts here.
   Millimeter wave MIMO: The small carrier wavelength enables spatial
   multiplexing in line-of-sight environments, potentially resulting in
   point-to-point outdoor wireless links at optical speeds (40 Gbps) using
   bandwidths of the order of 5 GHz.
   Directional multihop networking: Indoor Gigabit wireless links based on
   60 GHz unlicensed spectrum are subject to disruption due to
   line-of-sight blockage by obstacles such as furniture and humans. We
   show that a multihop architecture with a small number of relays assures
   full network connectivity.
   All-digital multiGigabit baseband: Since high-speed analog-to-digital
   conversion (ADC) is costly and power-hungry, in order to design
   all-digital baseband processing that can be implemented inexpensively by
   riding Moore's law, we must be able to perform signal processing with
   sloppy ADC. We discuss Shannon-theoretic limits and signal processing
   challenges in this context.}},

Abstract = {{As process technologies slow down in their miniaturization, system
   design relies more heavily on innovation rather than technology to push
   the limits of speed beyond that of the existing systems. Parasitic
   capacitances dominate the paths in which the signals traverse through
   the circuit and the speed of operation largely depends on the reduction
   of these parasitics and on how fast these parasitics could be charged or
   discharged. This paper presents an innovation in this regime. Two
   innovative techniques, current pumping and voltage pulling are shown and
   their application to the sample and hold, pre-amplifier and latch
   components of a Flash Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC) is provided; It
   is shown that the frequency of operation can be pushed to double the

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of high-tech industry and the
   dynamics of technological learning, innovation, entrepreneurship in
   China through the telecom-equipment industry. The catching-up process in
   the telecom-equipment industry can be divided into three stages, that
   is, phone digital switches, the Global System for Mobile communication
   (GSM) and the third generation mobile communication systems (3G). In
   order to understand how domestic firms narrow their technological gap in
   these different stages and how these firms have been influenced by their
   innovation capabilities to catch up to the multinationals, four case
   studies will be made use of. The first case shows that the knowledge
   diffusion from Shanghai Bell and its absorption by public research
   institutes was critical in the stage of phone digital switches
   catching-up. The second case in point is concerned with Huawei's outlook
   on in-house R\&D development: it shows how Ren Zhengfei, the founder of
   Huawei, insisted on constructing the firm from the ground up and relying
   on its own innovation capability, thus giving Huawei a competitive
   advantage in later stages. The third case gives a demonstration of how
   Huawei, a latecomer in GSM, innovate in low-end market and uses its
   innovation capability to advance in GSM and later became the leader in
   providing the third generation mobile communication systems and network
   solutions for operators around the world. The last case illustrates how
   leapfrogging catching-up has occurred in the development of China's own
   3G standard: TD-SCDMA. Our study points out that there are two different
   catching-up patterns in China's telecom-equipment industry. One is
   ``path-following{''} catching-up in GSM driven by using new technology
   in low-end market. The other is ``leapfrogging{''} catching-up in the
   development of phone digital switches and China's own 3G standard
   (TD-SCDMA). However, it seems that leapfrogging strategy will meet more
   challenges and problems than path-following strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Archives are increasingly important to creative industries, especially
   the fashion sector, which often relies on historical collections for
   design inspiration, product-development, and market strategizing. As
   these collections are digitized and catalogued their accessibility
   becomes more complex and their usefulness restricted to those skilled in
   navigating through the metadata. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR)
   offers only a partial solution to this dilemma. Requirements of the
   fashion sector necessitate a tool to enhance the browsing experience for
   creative applications beyond retrieval. This paper highlights
   limitations of CBIR for applications in creative industries such as
   fashion. It briefly reviews relevant literature, highlights some
   research questions, and outlines the approach we are adopting to
   integrate the requirements of users with the appropriate technology.
   Examples from Fashion and Apparel Browsing for Inspirational Content
   (FABRIC), a collaborative 3-year 1.4M pound Technology Strategy Board
   project, sponsored by the Department for Innovation, Universities and
   Skills (DIUS), provide a real-world application.}},

Abstract = {{Several countries now have national programs to support cluster-based
   innovation in their key industries. They all realize that geographical
   clusters are significant drivers of innovations and competitiveness in
   today's fast-moving global economy. Cluster are formally planned and
   created with concentration of targeted industry and support
   infrastructure such as university researchers, supporting government
   agencies, vocational training providers, financial institutions, etc.,
   This study follows the development of the hard disk drive (HDD) industry
   in Thailand. Over the past twenty years, the hard disk drive (HDD)
   industry in Thailand has grown steadily. The inflows of foreign
   investment in HDD-related manufacturing to Thailand have made the
   country the world largest exporter of hard disk drives and components in
   the past year. The Big 4 companies (Seagate Technology, Hitachi Global
   Storage Technology (HGST), Fujitsu and Western Digital) all have
   production bases in Thailand. With their presences, most of their
   suppliers have decided to have production bases or representatives in
   Thailand as well. This makes Thailand to have an almost complete supply
   chain of the HDD industry.
   This study analyzes the strategy employed by the Thai government to
   build national technological capability in hard disk drive technology
   through strategic cluster management. The government has established the
   Hard Disk Drive Institute (HDDI) as a center to develop infrastructure
   for research capability for the industry. This case study highlights the
   government roles and its strategy to formally build national
   technological capability on specific industry.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating the customer in the innovation process is believed to be a
   powerful means to reduce failure rates and to increase the revenue from
   new products. Although many companies have launched programs to enable
   such integration, the understanding of the mechanisms behind successful
   programs remains limited. Furthermore, the benefit of integrating
   customers in the innovation process has to be weighed against the costs.
   Virtual customer integration has been discussed as a way to limit these
   costs and bring the benefits of potentially unlimited scalability.
   Using a sample of the Euro Stoxx 50 companies, we shed light on the
   various types of virtual customer integration platforms, their
   limitations, their benefits and the mechanisms that have to be put in
   place to make them succeed. Results indicate that only a limited number
   of platforms go beyond the sourcing of ideas. Especially the integration
   of the customer in the execution phase of the innovation process remains
   largely limited to digital goods.}},

Abstract = {{Most industrialized countries have been able to insert innovation into
   their national agendas, leveraging competitiveness, economic growth and
   social development. Well structured national innovation systems run
   across all the innovation value chain: from the transfer of ideas or
   inventions, to their commercialization as high value and differentiated
   products or services, producing high economic and social impacts
   In developing countries, the circumstances are quite different. There
   are weak liaisons, low trust and poor association between economic
   generators (companies) and their supporting institutions (government,
   federations, banks and academies). Regions are not electronically
   prepared (e-readiness) to support the infrastructure required for the
   effective formation of clusters (c-readiness). Innovation is not
   perceived as an asset, and high value entrepreneurship is not a common
   finding in the entrepreneurial profiles of most professionals. There are
   no world class industrial enabling conditions, nor high value core
   capabilities, and the digital economies are creating large digital
   development divides instead of business opportunities. In general, the
   economic gap between rich countries and poor ones widens every day.
   To help alleviate this situation, we have developed the WIT Model
   (Wealth creation through Innovation and enabling Technologies). This
   model has been designed to create the necessary and sufficient enabling
   conditions and core capabilities to empower developing regions to
   transform their scarce resources and hostile conditions, into attractive
   regions with competitive industries and innovative companies, capable of
   producing great added and differential values, strongly interrelated
   with their regional social capital, so that they can compete globally as
   extended networks of value, and share their economic value among their
   local communities.
   Several cases of application of the model are shown, specially the
   current project of the Institute for Innovation and Technology Transfer
   (IITT) planned to position the city of Monterrey, Mexico, as an
   international Pole of Innovation and Competitiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly SoC design is driven by integrated mobile devices such as
   cell phones, music players and hand-held game consoles. These devices
   rely on standard algorithms such as H.264, 802.11n, or JPEG2000, which
   allow room for innovative implementations that can result in
   differentiated products. Designers of these devices are constantly on a
   tread-mill to integrate more and more features within tight
   time-to-market constraints. They also play a very delicate balancing act
   to meet the aggressive goals for power, area and performance.
   Power consumption, rather than area, is an increasingly key design
   parameter for these designs, and architectural and micro-architectural
   choices at the high level have a significant impact (sometimes an order
   of magnitude) on the power consumption. For example, reducing the
   operating frequency and increasing the parallelism to maintain constant
   throughput reduces the power consumption, but at the expense of
   additional area. Currently, designers have no practical method to
   perform such architectural exploration for low power design. Instead,
   they rely on their intuitions and past experiences implementation of
   multiple design alternatives is not a viable option because of the high
   cost of manual design.
   Application engine synthesis, for example as provided by Synfora's PICO
   (Program-In Chip-Out) product, enables the design of a complete
   subsystem such as H.264 encoder from an un-timed C algorithm. A designer
   can explore multiple design alternatives by changing the design
   constraints or the C code.
   An ESL design-flow that integrates application engine synthesis with an
   industry-leading RTL power estimation technology, such as Sequence Power
   Theater, enables a designer to explore multiple algorithms and
   architectures with different power profiles to determine the optimal
   algorithm-architecture combination in a very short period of time. As an
   example, it took less than a day to perform four different designs for
   an imaging pipeline for a digital camera. The power consumption for
   these designs ranged from 24mW to 8mW, a 3X change in power consumption.
   This tutorial will describe in detail and demonstrate an ESL design flow
   for architectural exploration to determine low power designs.
   Participants in this tutorial will learn:
   1. The impact of architectural and micro-architectural choices on power
   consumption
   2. How architectural exploration reduces power and how to examine
   power/performance/area tradeoff using PICO Express and Power Theater
   3. How Exploring algorithmic variations reduces power consumption
   4. Integration into an existing SoC design methodology
   We will use real-life examples such as an imaging pipeline for a camera
   to illustrate the process
   Targeted Audience and Prerequisites: SoC architects, SoC project
   managers and RTL design engineers interested in low power design,
   architectural exploration and moving to a higher level of abstraction
   for design to reduce time to market.}},

Abstract = {{With the advances in Information Communication Technology (ICT) and the
   demand for more efficient and effective government, governments in
   various countries have implemented e-government strategies to offer more
   information and online services to citizens, government agencies,
   businesses, and others. E-government initiatives aim to benefit from the
   use of most innovative forms of information technologies, mainly
   web-based Internet applications, in improving governments' fundamental
   functions. It is considered the preferred tool to enhance government
   services among its customers and government agencies. However, an
   explosion in the use of wireless internet devices, including
   internet-ready mobile phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) in
   combination with the increasing mobility of people in industrial
   economies is forcing governments to prepare themselves to transition
   from e-government to m-government. This paper examines the development
   of in-government in Greece, which is in an early stage in comparison
   with other countries all over the world. More specifically, m-government
   services that are currently used are mentioned. In addition,
   recommendations are given for the further development of m-government in
   Greece as well as the benefits to citizens from using various
   m-government services are elaborated taking into account the initiatives
   of other countries on the application of m-government.}},

Abstract = {{This research examines dynamics associated with new representational
   technologies in complex organizations through a study of the use of a
   Single Model Environment, prototyping and simulation tools in the
   mega-project to construct Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport, London. The
   ambition of the client, BAA. was to change industrial practices reducing
   project costs and time to delivery through new contractual arrangements
   and new digitally-enabled collaborative ways of working. The research
   highlights changes over time and addresses two areas of `turbulence' in
   the use of: 1) technologies, where there is a dynamic tension between
   desires to constantly improve, change and update digital technologies
   and the need to standardise practices, maintaining and defending the
   overall integrity of the system; and 2) representations, where dynamics
   result from the responsibilities and liabilities associated with sharing
   of digital representations and a lack of trust in the validity of data
   from other firms. These dynamics are tracked across three stages of this
   well-managed and innovative project and indicate the generic need to
   treat digital infrastructure as an ongoing strategic issue.}},

Abstract = {{Imagine you are playing a videogame in which you impersonate a wizard
   who needs to create a potion in order to enchant your enemies. Through a
   desktop haptic probe, shaped as a baton, you are able to stir and feel
   the magical fluid inside a bowl. As you follow the potion recipe, you
   feel how the fluid changes its viscosity, density, velocity and other
   properties. Various hapto-visual user interfaces enable users to
   interact in three-dimensions with the digital world and receive
   realistic kinesthetic and tactile cues in a computer-generated
   environment. So far solid or deformable objects have been experimented
   for haptic-tactile feedback. In this paper we innovate by devising
   techniques that enable the haptical rendering of shape-less objects,
   such as fluids. Focusing on the real-time performance to enhance the
   user's experience, the system imitates the physical forces generated by
   the real-time fluid animation, stirring movements and fluid changes. We
   achieved real-time 3D fluid and overcame the challenges that arise
   during the integration of both haptics and graphics workspaces, the
   free-view visualization of 3D fluid volume, and the rendering of haptic
   forces. These fluid interaction techniques with haptic feedback have
   wide possible applications including game development and haptic
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores findings from a West Australian study that examines
   the ways in which 35 beginning teachers use information and
   communications technologies (ICT) in their teaching. The educational
   policy environment in Australia explicitly supports ICT integration, and
   this is translated into targeted initiatives covering infrastructure,
   equipment, electronic learning materials and professional development.
   However, for all the energy expended to encourage teachers to use ICT,
   it seems that few teachers take full advantage of the significant
   opportunities that they present. A number of reasons have been posited
   to explain this, the most compelling of which are bound up with
   teachers' skills in harnessing ICT and their pedagogical beliefs about
   teaching itself.
   In the spirit of Cuban's (2001) investigation into teachers' use of
   computers in the Silicon Valley, this study presents an in-depth
   examination of a cohort of teachers (2006 graduates) that are digitally
   literate and familiar with contemporary, student-centred theories of
   learning. It is suggested that these teachers may be likely to integrate
   ICT into their teaching in innovative ways, and the primary research
   question - to what extent is ICT integration, a feature of beginning
   teachers' classroom practice? - is aimed, at least in part, at
   confirming or challenging this assertion.
   The study tracks these teachers through their first three years in the
   profession, gathering evidence through a mixed method approach that
   helps to understand the dynamic nature of participants' beliefs about
   teaching and attitudes towards ICT within their socio-cultural context.
   As expected, the study has found that most participants are competent
   users of ICT. Participants also articulate pedagogical beliefs that aim
   to engage students in active meaning making. However, observations
   reveal that participants' ICT competence and stated pedagogical beliefs
   do not necessarily translate into classroom practices that optimise the
   use of ICT for learning. For example, none of the participants have used
   Web 2.0 tools although most claim to value electronic communication and
   rapid publishing.
   Using a schema developed by Newhouse, Clarkson and Trinidad (2005) where
   ICT use is considered on a continuum from Inaction to Transformation, it
   is apparent that most participants are at early stages of development.
   There seems to be a mismatch between the ideals that participants hold
   to be important and their capacity to use ICT to help realise these
   ideals. The use of ICT has been limited to a combination of three Rs:
   reward, rotate and reinforce. These themes, which will interest teachers
   and education managers, are explored in this paper along with a
   consideration of how different socio-cultural settings impact on
   participants' evolving pedagogical identities.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence from a grounded analysis study (Greener 2008) of UK teachers
   using blended learning (face to face and online learning using Learning
   Content Management Systems) suggested that the relative identities of
   teachers and learners could change online affecting the role an
   individual or group took in the learning process. In relation to the
   teacher's role, the development of the Community of Inquiry model by
   Garrison, Anderson and Archer (2003) can help us to disassociate the
   role of ``teacher{''} from the potentially all-powerful individual at
   the head of a physical classroom, to the three overlapping types of
   presence online (social, cognitive and teaching) described in the model.
   While Palloff and Pratt (2001) merely touch on the need for faculty to
   give up a degree of control (p153) when teaching online, this study
   supports more closely the Garrison et al analysis. Not only was there
   support for the idea of quieter students and those being taught in a
   non-native language changing roles and becoming more dominant in
   asynchronous communication online, but the teacher's status was also
   challenged, both in asynchronous and synchronous messaging and through
   the students' access to web resources from universities world-wide. It
   seems that human nature abhors a vacuum online as teachers in this study
   experienced ways in which identity could be constructed through text
   discussion, based on perceived effort, curiosity, maturity and
   perceptions of others' learning preferences and behaviours.
   Pedagogic focus affected teachers' perceptions of what kinds of learning
   could be achieved through LCMS technologies, with learner-centred
   teachers defiantly optimistic about the affordances of online learning
   despite the technical, political and confidence barriers experienced.
   They were prepared to step back after their initial input in
   ``designing{''} the learning environment, once learners had started to
   feel at home there, moving towards a situation where learners sourced
   and shared resources, set agendas and contributed to debate, while the
   teacher was able to become a reinvigorated learner within the virtual
   group. This study of enthusiastic teachers in Higher Education
   innovating at a time of transition to digital environments offers a
   challenge to less enthusiastic online teachers as their traditional
   authority status is changed with role shifts and conflicts. The
   potential equalising effect of the medium between learner and teacher
   does not enhance the role of the learner at the expense of the teacher,
   but puts both in the happy position of learner, albeit with concessions
   to the teachers additional experience and knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{At a time when mathematics and science provide essential knowledge tools
   and the foundations for lifelong learning skills, cross-national studies
   of student achievement indicate lack of mathematical and scientific
   competence for a considerable proportion of the student population
   across Europe. Acknowledging the central role of parents in children's
   learning, the EU-funded project SMASH (Success in MAth and Science at
   Home) aims to raise the educational standards of European youth in
   mathematics and science by cultivating underlying home cultures as
   springboards for learning. The project consortium is currently
   developing, and will then pilot test and deliver an innovative
   intercultural parent-trainer training course and related resources for
   professionals involved in parent education initiatives. Through the
   adoption of a blended learning approach that combines e-learning with
   physical meetings, the course will equip these professionals with
   current knowledge, techniques, and implementation tools for the
   provision of high-quality, culturally differentiated parent training in
   mathematics and science education. Individuals completing the course
   will be trained to offer programs designed to educate parents of
   elementary and middle school children (ages 6-15) in how to best support
   their child's mathematics and science learning at home using
   pedagogically sound strategies and technologies. Parents unable to
   attend parent-training sessions could still study independently using
   the project knowledge base, which will provide open access to all of the
   project's outputs and resources. This, in turn, will contribute towards
   improved parental participation in children's learning. Parents will be
   empowered to understand and implement reform, providing a home
   environment that enhances children's scientific development and prepares
   them to meet the challenges of the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{Textile Design at NTU is breaking new ground at Masters level by
   dissolving the parameters between subject `specialisms'. Textile
   designers have to understand that the interconnections between
   creativity, science and technology go `beyond' traditional boundaries
   and create new and innovative solutions for the demands of a global
   industry and a multi-cultural world. Traditional `crafts' are equally as
   important as the `new' outcomes of digitisation and the impact of the
   communication networks which have affected design, practice, research
   and development.
   Reflexive and multi-disciplinary approaches to teaching and learning at
   advanced levels of Textile Design are crucial to Higher Education
   provision and the needs of our global community, culture and commerce.
   Our analysis of the new needs of our rapidly changing industrial
   geography has demanded that we move beyond the `separation' of tradition
   and skill, knowledge and craft, and create `synergy'.
   In short, the `discipline' may be rooted in `tradition' but, discipline
   boundaries disappear when advanced design skills develop. At NTU the
   research community nurtures cross subject and specialist liaisons that
   challenge traditional subject boundaries to develop an education at
   Level 4 that can give students truly transferrable skills for innovation
   and entrepreneurship, ethical and sustainable mentalities as well as
   cultural sensitivity in an international workplace.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative print techniques are a specialist area for Belford. Having
   originated Belford Prints (1986) a small unique textile Print Company
   based in the UK. Pre digital, bonding, flocking shrinking and devore
   were just a few of the process used to create tactile textiles. The
   introduction of digital printing (1999) into the business, brought new
   scope and demands and although a great new way forward for print, had a
   feeling of flatness, and for Belford a creative distance from the
   process. In 2004 relocation back to Belfast working at a new research
   centre for art technologies and design (Interface, University of Ulster)
   gave Belford the opportunity to peruse innovative print techniques.
   Tumbull Thopmson (Thailand based print company) consult with Belford, in
   the quest for new innovative commercial applications for fashion and
   interior textiles. This paper will chart some of the methodologies
   applied from a Research centre in academia into a large commercial
   application. In particular the development of digitally printing a silk
   or linen warp, and inserting the weft using the craft of hand weaving.
   The hybrid processing of traditional and digital bringing depth and
   tactility into digital translation.
   Continually interested in the quest and challenges of Industry and
   academia embracing each other the second part of the paper will chart
   the progress of Girli Concrete a project crossing disciplines
   (architecture and textiles) Working between the interfaces of industry
   and academia, practice and theory, exposes the prejudices of both, and
   their miss-match. This paper will illustrate that not one particular
   discipline sits on its own but can weave between territories and

Abstract = {{Designers often strive to innovate by linking textile craft traditions
   with the latest technological advances. Opportunities afforded by
   digital technology, significant breakthroughs in materials science and
   the transfer of technology from other engineering disciplines, such as
   the use of lasers in textile manufacture and processing, have
   contributed to the making of exciting new products.
   This paper considers, through an illustrated case study, how engineers
   and designers can work together to develop innovative products
   uninhibited by traditional discipline boundaries. The collaboration is
   between a PhD design researcher, and her supervisors in Textile Design
   and in Mechanical Engineering.
   The research project, to create three-dimensional textiles, started with
   a conventional study of fabric pleating but this has progressively
   developed at the University School of Art and Design in a number of
   unconventional ways, as a result of thematic studies, that have included
   origami and mathematical modelling, and by using lasers and the latest
   developments in rapid manufacturing in the Loughborough Innovative
   Manufacturing and Construction Research Centre in the Faculty of
   Engineering.
   The paper identifies some of the key issues associated with this form of

Abstract = {{It is 2018 in a clothing store called Shop One, an automaton greets you,
   a body scan beam checks your vital signs and size. It says ``co-creation
   and customisation this floor, emotion and intelligent clothing first
   floor, track and trace swap shop third floor and artisanal collections
   penthouse{''}. This is the fashion experience for generation `C',
   digital Children of the digital world. They are not dictated to by the
   brands. They will be in Control, part of a local and global Community
   they will Co-Create products with business, innovate and expect the
   supply chain to `do the right thing'. Sustainability, or people, profit,
   planet will be part of the bedrock of a Cradle to Cradle fashion
   textiles system.
   Next door, the warehouse outlet Shop Two, has mountains of colour and
   trend merchandise. Huge `how to' fashion projections line the walls and
   holograms march the catwalk. Buy one get three free, proliferate in
   natural fibre fabrics, `rent a look' is popular. Mobile phones say what
   to buy, what suits, how much and what size. This glimpse of `fiction'
   fashion retail illustrates the emergence of the polarisation of the
   future fashion textile industry. But it is already taking place in the
   best and the worst of the industry on every high street and mall.
   We predict a polarisation, a division in the producer, consumer,
   disposal and reuse market which will become ever more extreme, using a
   future global fashion textile retail scenario as a vehicle for this
   thesis underpinned by knowledge of current business practice. Although
   there is a burgeoning of literature and theory relating to
   sustainability, in the fashion textile industry it is fragmented and
   often vague, thus we predict a continuation of the unsustainable global
   manufacturing fashion textile industry on the one hand seen in Shop Two,
   running in parallel to an emerging new paradigm of fashion and textiles
   found in Shop One.
   The polarisation hypothesis has been developed by focussing on issues of
   sustainability contrasting an audit trail through an existing and future
   fashion textile retail supply and disposal chain and analysing the
   content. The thesis emerges from a combination of data saturation and
   deductive reasoning using the notion of cradle to cradle and cradle to
   grave as our methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The textiles curricula in schools in the United Kingdom began it's
   metamorphosis with the introduction of the National Curriculum in 1990,
   textiles began its shift from being an integral part of the `home
   economics' curricula, to being new subject specialism in the subject
   area `design and technology'.
   Twelve years later, this shift in the textiles curricula would take on a
   new twist in 2002. The introduction to schools of specialist textiles
   and fashion software, from the German software company SpeedStep in
   January 2002 to UK secondary schools via Design and Technology
   Association (DATA) and the Department for Children Skills and Families
   (DCSF) Cad/Cam Initiative. This initiative allowed schools access to
   Industry standard software at prices to allow its integration into the
   design and technology curriculum, supported with a range of training
   models and support marterials.
   This UK Government led Initiative would give both teachers and students
   access to industry standard software, with support via training and
   web-based resources, which could be used to support teaching and
   learning as well as student studies. One of the key aims of the
   programme being, to engage teachers with industrial practices, and for
   students to gain access to the world of work in textiles.
   Through this programme teachers and students have opportunities to
   address methods of developing new skills in designing and making using
   CAD technology in textiles, it also allowed teachers the opportunity to
   integrate CAM technology in a more holistic manner. Students could
   become autonomous learners and take on the role of designer and
   manufacturer of their products from start to finish
   This paper contends that this acquisition of new skills in using and
   applying Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Computer
   aided design(CAD and Computer aided Manufacture (CAM), to classroom
   practice, has led to teachers utilising pedagogical, creative and design
   skills and integrating new technology for the next generation of
   designers. Textiles have a unique place in the design and technology
   curriculum as it straddles the interdisplinary areas of Industrial
   practice, design, creativity and art.
   Through the advent of innovative programs such the CAD/CAM Initiative,
   the questions still to be asked at this stage are; what are the new
   directions for textiles, and fashion in schools; what are the important
   lessons to be learnt from the introduction of this programme; what will
   the impact be for higher education in terms of teaching and learning;
   and how will it impact on the teaching of textiles and fashion for the
   future; By negotiating a digital transition and the future of education
   for the Y and Z generation.}},

   technology has been emerging in endless these years. In the process of

   illogical thinking is an essential kind of thinking mode that sometime
   helps designers solve problems. This paper explains the necessity of
   using CAD technology and illogical thinking, and shows how they work
   together to achieve a better design. The destination of using CAD
   technology is to exhibit designers' concept completely, and therefore
   designers should keep their mind innovative when using CAD technology to
   develop their concept design. In this way, they can make much better

Abstract = {{Budgets for marketing to children have spiked well into the billions, an
   escalation that mirrors the rise in childhood obesity rates. Children
   are targets for a maelstrom of marketing for all sorts of products
   enabled by sophisticated technology and minimal government regulation.
   Despite the fact that recent studies document links between food
   advertising and childhood obesity, a significant proportion of marketing
   that targets children is for energy-dense, low-nutrient food. Moreover,
   advances in digital technology allow marketers to find more direct
   personalized gateways to reach young audiences that sidestep parental
   authority and bank as much on the unknowing parent as the gullible
   child. Cataloguing the depth and breadth of child-centered food
   marketing while discussing grassroots strategies for instituting change,
   the authors argue that parents can no longer keep pace either with
   innovations in advertising or increased spending, suggesting the need
   for more stringent government regulations on food marketing to children.}},

Abstract = {{In 2007 the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB) - National Library of the
   Netherlands and the Nationaal Archief of the Netherlands delivered a
   durable x86 component-based computer emulator: Dioscuri, the first
   modular emulator targeted specifically at digital preservation.
   Recognised as a challenging but viable approach to retain long-term
   access to digital objects, the next step is to integrate this emulator
   with the operational digital archiving environment. This will offer a
   new and innovative long-term access solution based on emulation. To
   achieve this, both institutions recognised that several requirements
   have to be met: the organisation's policy and finance should support it;
   the significance of the digital collection and user requirements should
   be identified; software, documentation and user experiences should be
   preserved; preservation metadata should be captured; there should be a
   durable development process for emulation; and finally a technical
   infrastructure is needed to facilitate emulation as a long-term access
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{In today's digital archives the problem of continuous migration is
   ubiquitous. Due to the limited lifetime of storage media and the
   availability of reading devices, the digital data has to be copied on a
   different system every few years. As each migration process requires
   financial and personal resources, a real long-term storage medium would
   be appreciated. The medium microfilm, already well-established in analog
   archives, seems to be a promising alternative to overcome these
   fundamental problems as it allows an estimated storage lifetime up to
   several hundred years. This contribution is about an innovative
   technology to store digital data on microfilm based on laser recording.
   The mainfocus is on error correction and storage capacities. An insight
   into the technology itself will be provided and possible realistic
   storage capacities will be pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{Principal rules defining the adaptation of ECG interpretation software
   in a distributed surveillance network are presented in this paper.
   Thanks to the pervasive access to wireless digital communication
   services, the intelligent monitoring networks automatically solve
   difficult medical cases thanks to the auto-adaptation of data
   interpretation and transmission to the variable patient status and
   technical constrains. The foundation of this innovative approach is the
   use of selected diagnostic parameters in a loopback modifying the
   running interpretive software. The auto adaptive process maximizes the
   general estimate of patient description quality aggregating the
   divergence values of particular parameters modulated by the medical
   relevance factor dependent on the status of patient. Our approach is
   motivated by the outcomes from the research on human experts behavior,
   statistics of the procedures reliability and usage as well as tests in a
   prototype client-server application. The tests yielded very promising
   results: the convergence of the remotely computed diagnostic outcome was
   achieved in over 80\% of software adaptation attempts. Comparing to the
   rigid reporting mode, avoiding unnecessary computation extends the
   autonomy time by 65\% and the transmission channel occupation was
   reduced by 3,1 to 5,6 times}},

Abstract = {{Two supply fan speed control methods for a variable airflow volume (VAV)
   system using the fan airflow station (FA S) are introduced in this paper
   In the first method, the supply fan speed is controlled to maintain an
   optimized system resistance (S), which is calculated based on the
   measured fan head, and airflow. In the second method, the supply fan
   speed is controlled to maintain the duct static pressure set point,
   which is reset based on the airflow ratio measured by the FAS. Both
   methods can make the terminal box open more compared with the
   conventional supply fan speed control using a fixed duct static pressure
   set point. These innovative methods can be applied to systems with
   either direct digital control (DDC) or pneumatic control terminal boxes.
   The case studies show that the new control methods can significantly
   save supply fan power and improve fan efficiency.}},

Title = {{Flickr: a case study of Web2.0}},
Journal = {{ASLIB PROCEEDINGS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{493-516}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The ``photosharing{''} site Flickr is one of the most commonly
   cited examples used to define Web2.0. This paper aims to explore where
   Flickr's real novelty lies, examining its functionality and its place in
   the world of amateur photography. Several optimistic views of the impact
   of Flickr such as its facilitation of citizen journalism, ``vernacular
   creativity{''} and in learning as an ``affinity space{''} are evaluated.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a wide range of sources
   including published interviews with its developers, user opinions
   expressed in forums, telephone interviews and content analysis of user
   profiles and activity.
   Findings - Flickr's development path passes from an innovative social
   game to a relatively familiar model of a web site, itself developed
   through intense user participation but later stabilising with the
   reassertion of a commercial relationship to the membership. The broader
   context of the impact of Flickr is examined by looking at the
   institutions of amateur photography and particularly the code of
   pictorialism promoted by the clubs and industry during the twentieth
   century. The nature of Flickr as a benign space is premised on the way
   the democratic potential of photography is controlled by such
   institutions. The limits of optimistic claims about Flickr are
   identified in the way that the system is designed to satisfy commercial
   purposes, continuing digital divides in access and the low interactivity
   and criticality on Flickr.
   Originality/value - Flickr is an interesting source of change, but can
   only be understood in the perspective of long-term development of the
   hobby and wider social processes. By setting Flickr in such a broad
   context, its significance and that of Web2.0 more generally can be fully
   assessed.}},

Title = {{Promotion, speculation and their outcome The ``steamship mania{''} of
   1824-1825}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Offering an empirical study of the rush to promote a new
   technology of its time, which is a significant phenomenon in its own
   right, the paper's purpose is to offer a reminder that new technologies
   often generate speculative and unstable business conditions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses Henry English's A Complete
   View of the Joint Stock Companies Formed during the Years 1824 and 1825
   to identify companies (n = 70), and follows up cases with record and
   archive study.
   Findings - The development of steamship services was an important push
   of transportation and communication technology. The establishment of
   steam shipping services in coastal waters and near country trade is an
   analogy of later technologies such as the telegraph, telephone and
   latterly computer-mediated digital communication over the internet with
   global reach. Unlike the canal and railway manias the outcome was
   minimal.
   Practical implications - As in the Dotcom boom of the early 2000s the
   study highlights the dangers of speculative business ventures
   (over-ambitious promotion and fraud) which lacked a strong link to
   markets, the pull of significant demand and were weak in terms of
   business acumen and organization.
   Originality/value - As a piece of original business historical research
   it is not only the findings which are of value, but the paper represents
   an exemplar of the continued use of archival and record material and
   information resources to support scholarly activity. Historians of today
   who wish to study the emerging digital economy may yet encounter
   problems in an ability to draw on bodies of contemporary evidence. The
   current issues of digital archiving and digital curation are only just
   beginning to be appreciated.}},

Abstract = {{We propose to apply the ultra fast Time Of Flight technique (TOF)
   developed for High Energy Physics (HEP) particle detectors to biomedical
   imaging. The similarity of the problem in the two fields as well as the
   remarkable opportunities in biomedical imaging to use technologies
   developed in HEP have the potential to make major advances in the
   medical world, in particular for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). We
   will describe and present some preliminary results of the development of
   a new complete read-out chain able to manage signals from various types
   of modem photo detectors (MCP, APD, SiPM). This innovative architecture
   is made of a fast front-end electronics ASIC with novel Digital Signal
   Processing (DSP) concepts able to reach the Pico-second timing
   resolution, a time-to-digital converter, a pipelined digital readout and
   an integrated trigger/filter with real-time data treatment and display.
   In parallel with the hardware development, we have begun a systematic
   program to simulate system characteristics from the initial particle
   interaction to the final digital data, including a bit-by-bit mapping of
   the front end/data acquisition system. The introduction of these
   techniques and tools, common in HEP, has the potential to make
   improvement to biomedical imaging systems.}},

Abstract = {{In a recently released Infocomm Technology Roadmap entitled iN2015,
   Singapore hopes to provide its citizens a milieu where people live, work
   and play digitally. The government has embraced infocomm technologies
   for economic sustainability and global competitiveness. Singapore has
   been rewarded with a second ranking in the world's e-government
   leadership survey in 2003. The dilemma faced by Singapore is that with
   almost no natural resources, she relies heavily on its citizens as its
   human resource and the need to renew and re-skill as an imperative for
   survival. Key points from the roadmap will be shared with participants
   in the form of an illustrated history of Singapore's e-government
   development. The presenter will put into context the Singapore's
   e-government framework and agenda for creating an e-citizen,
   highlighting the growing digital divide, the large graying population
   and the blue-collar workers. Participants will learn how the government
   is addressing this by setting in motion to a series of innovative public
   education programmes and incentives with key partners such as the public
   and private sectors. The National Library Board, Singapore (NLB) has
   been proactive in using its critical mass of over 31 million visitors
   and its network of 40 borderless libraries to offer a range of programs.
   The paper will provide vignettes of how the NLB worked in collaboration
   with the Infocomm (Information Commerce) Development Agency (iDA) to
   promote e-government applications and foster e-citizenry to further the
   NLB's mission of fostering learning and expanding the learning capacity
   of the nation. The information and IT literacy programs which
   successfully reached out to the heart-landers and demystified infocomm
   applications for social inclusion will be elaborated upon. Libraries
   will be celebrated as possible partners for government agencies to offer
   e-government services leveraging on infrastructure and resources. The
   paper will introduce the Singapore government e-citizen website
   www.ecitizen.gov.sg and share creative and innovative ideas for
   participants to take back as possible learning applications for their
   respective organizations}},

   Mentoring procedure and learner satisfaction, as well as ICT competence

   found satisfactory by users. However, the level of acquisition of

Title = {{New trends in immunoassays}},
Booktitle = {{BIOSENSING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY}},
Series = {{Advances in Biochemical Engineering-Biotechnology}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{123-154}},
Abstract = {{This article takes a special focus on signal amplification technologies
   in immunoassays and new generations of lateral-flow assays. Novel signal
   amplification technologies based either on new classes of biofunctional
   nanocrystals consisting of releasable fluorophores or on
   aggregation-induced emission (AIE) can improve the sensitivity and the
   limits of detection in immunoassays. A bio-barcocle assay also allows
   signal amplification by utilizing antibody-coated magnetic beads to
   concentrate the analytes and antibody-coated gold nanoparticle probes to
   carry with a large number of oligonucleoticles. These innovative
   technologies boost the development of immunoassays.
   Growth in rapid immunoassay is fueled by the increasing number of
   diabetics, the globalization of infectious diseases and the surge in
   cardiovascular and other chronic diseases as well as other chronic
   conditions. Rapid, near patient, decentralized, point-of-care (POC)
   tests are emerging as a tool for more efficient diagnosis and patient
   evaluation. Technological innovations in lateral-flow assays have
   enabled a move to bring testing closer to the patient. A novel
   ``digital-style{''} lateral-flow assay provides semi-quantitative
   results by simply counting the number of red lines in the test without
   any expensive reading instrument. An immuno-threshold-based assay can
   give a signal directly proportional to the concentration of a hapten to
   prevent confusion on interpretation of the test results. In addition,
   POC tests become more meaningful to healthcare professionals by
   combining the benefits of new technologies to provide quantitative
   results. A molecular compact disc provides a high-resolution imaging
   capability that can identify and quantify many different antigens
   simultaneously in highly complex immunoassays.
   Further advances in immunoassays will bring diagnostic testing even
   closer to the patient, and can help physicians to monitor diseases that
   require immediate test results, thereby enhancing the quality of patient
   care.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the design of an efficient automated data
   interpretation system that is able to output its interpretation directly
   to describe the nature of contact with the tactile surface. The work
   integrates distributive tactile sensing technology, artificial neural
   networks (ANNs), and advanced FPGA-based application-specific real-time
   digital signal processing, to produce working systems for use in a
   steerable endoscope that retrieves shape and `touch' information.
   Different configurations of the signal interpretation such as single and
   cascade neural networks were assessed. It was shown that the cascaded
   ANN architecture could achieve an overall accuracy of better than 94\%
   when measuring clinically significant contact information. This
   technology has the potential to discriminate contact and palpation in
   minimal invasive surgery (MIS) tools.}},

Abstract = {{Digital games are evolving beyond the solitary context into a
   ubiquitous, social and collaborative experience. Addressing beliefs
   about technology and attitudes towards technology-mediated processes is
   fundamental to the successful implementation of any innovation. In
   collaborative gaming, attitude towards gaming influences learners'
   interactions along the domain, technology and community dimensions.
   Building on various seminal works, an instrument was developed for
   measuring four components of attitude towards gaming-affective
   components, perceived control, perceived usefulness and behavioural
   components. The survey, including 21 statements each scored on a 5-point
   Likert scale, was used with a sample of college students to investigate
   the influence of gender and gaming competence on attitude towards
   gaming. The pedagogical implications of the different attitude
   components are discussed in relation to game design and to the different
   interactions triggered by the gaming context.}},

Abstract = {{Community management is a significant project in the process of
   urbanization in China as well as a primary mission for the government's
   building harmonious society. While along with the development of digital
   technology, the traditional community management mode finds it hard to
   adapt itself to the requirements of community management in the new
   trend. The information age's approaching cries for a brand-new community
   management mode to match with it. This article takes the Chinese
   characteristics of community development, management and service into
   full consideration and proposes an integrated means to construct a new
   digital technology-based community management mode, which, through the
   digitization of community management and service work, aims at realizing
   the innovation of community and real property management}},

Abstract = {{The specialization of the forelimb into a wing allowed bats to become
   the only mammals to achieve powered flight. Recent studies in
   developmental biology have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
   behind elements of this important morphological transformation.
   Specifically, researchers have identified molecular changes contributing
   to: the formation of the bat wing membrane, the elongation of skeletal
   elements of the bat wing and the reduction of the bat ulna. The general
   picture emerging from this research is that small changes in the
   expression of genes critical to many aspects of development have driven
   large changes in bat wing morphology. Thus, bats can be added to the
   growing list of groups in which expression changes in key developmental
   genes have been linked to the evolution of morphological innovations

Abstract = {{During the last years, we had witnessed the boom of the digital market
   clue to proliferation of emergent audiovisual services and increasing
   number of broadband networks. In this scenario, users insistently demand
   for innovative services for exchanging and sharing their own audiovisual
   contents and productions. In order to meet these needs, in this paper we
   propose the ZapTV system. Broadly speaking, this tool broadcasts
   user-generated audiovisual contents for handheld devices in a mobile
   network based on the DVB-H broadcasting standard. ZapTV offers diverse
   added-value services to these new active users, such as: `i, multi modal
   access (via Web and by handheld devices) to digital contents anywhere
   and anytime, (ii) availability of a return channel to transmit
   interactive contents that enhance the user's viewing experience, and
   (iii) annotation, sharing and personalized distribution of audiovisual
   contents. To achieve these goals, our system adopts both well-known
   technologies for broadcasting and semantic annotation of audiovisual
   contents (such as DVB-H and TV-Anytime), and emergent technology from
   the so-called Web 2.0, which permit the users to actively cooperate in
   tasks of generation, annotation and classification of digital contents.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an experiment was conducted to measure the effect of
   framing a high definition television (HDTV) clip. One group of
   participants was told they were watching a brand new HDTV clip while the
   other group was told they were watching a digital DVD clip. Both groups
   were in fact watching the same (low) quality DVD clip. After watching
   this clip the beliefs of participants and their viewing experience was
   measured through a questionnaire. A significant more positive viewing
   experience for people framed to watch the HDTV clip was found. This
   means participants were unable to discriminate properly between digital
   and high definition signals and were influenced by the frame set for
   them. This effect has been shown in many different situations and now it
   has been established for watching HD-quality television as well. The
   results still indicate that the HDTV-frame is already associated with a
   high quality viewing experience, which may influence the selling
   strategy and/or adoption speed of this technology.}},

   demonstrate that these characteristics accord with Dutch viewer demands

   paper presents analyses from an ethnographic study of virtual currency
   use in China to discuss implications for game design, and HCI design
   more broadly. We found that how virtual currency is perceived, obtained,
   and spent can critically shape gamers' behavior and experience. Virtual
   and real currencies can interact in complex ways that promote, extend,
   and/or interfere with the value and character of game worlds. Bringing
   money into HCI design heightens existing issues of realness, trust, and
   fairness, and thus presents new challenges and opportunities for user

Abstract = {{The term digital divide describes how the lack of digital
   infrastructures divides rural territories from well-served areas; it is
   still the core of the debate on ICT investments as solutions for
   socio-economic growth and as a condition for technology transfer and
   development. Many factors such as cost of infrastructures, low
   population density and classical business models make up the barriers
   constituting this problem. In this paper, we describe how an innovative
   business and social approach - working on the local territory together
   with local administrations makes it possible to solve many issues thus
   giving a new digital life to rural areas. The result is a model suitable
   for rural regions and NMSs in Europe and the Mediterranean area, where
   the system proposed - Wikitel WDSL - is just one technical solution but
   the structured and inclusive approach, oriented to users and local
   stakeholders, is a guarantee for transferability.}},

Abstract = {{The joint growths of digital services and identity fraud exploiting poor
   identity management solutions have led to an identity crisis on the
   Internet. People struggle to keep control over their fragmented digital
   identities, and user privacy is not correctly enforced. As
   countermeasures, new digital identity initiatives include several
   distinct federated identity models, like Liberty Alliance or InfoCard.
   Based on the results of a French innovative R\&D project called FC(2)
   (Federation of Circles of Trust), this paper investigates the ways to
   create a federated identity architecture compatible with the major
   existing identity technologies while providing a secure and coherent
   user experience. In the light of a practical use case involving a bike
   rental service requiring attributes from its users to complete their
   registration, the card-based identity selector seems to arise as a major
   client identity component. The first project results highlight the need
   for clear and simple user information on service providers about
   identity exchanges. A `Simplified Sign-On' procedure for users and the
   need for digitally certified attributes are also exposed. On the
   business side, possible future models are sketched with their benefits
   for the different actors of the identity value chain. Eventually,
   studying the legal issues related to the federated identity model show
   that the responsibilities of the different actors should carefully be
   established within a circle of trust.}},

Abstract = {{The system dedicated to optimization of the manufacturing processes,
   used in metal forming branches, is presented in the paper. The proposed
   approach is based on the conventional optimization methods supported by
   Good Practice Guides (GPG), which represent rich engineering knowledge
   and are usually applied in industrial practice. Each step of
   optimization algorithm includes numerical simulations of analyzed
   manufacturing process, while the goal function is calculated regarding
   the `in use' material properties allowing to minimize the number of
   expensive, time consuming industrial tests. It also leads to the higher
   efficiency of the production chain under consideration. These features
   result in the system which is flexible enough to face the challenges of
   the market and rapid development of customers requirements. Moreover,
   this combination guarantees that the whole presented solution is
   innovative and unique in the field of manufacturing support Application
   of the developed software to optimize the flat rolling process with
   respect to uniformity of final material properties was selected as all
   example. The obtained results regarding temperature distribution in the
   slab are presented in the paper. Possibilities of further improvement of
   the system are finally drawn.}},

Abstract = {{The Thames Gateway Development Zone is the biggest urban development
   project in the UK for over 50 years. Developers and planners need to
   understand the implications of such large-scale urbanization on the
   environment. Requirements for Sustainable growth within the Thames
   Gateway region mean that developers are being required to demonstrate
   that proposals are based on sound scientific information. This has
   resulted in a growing demand for geo-environmental information to be
   provided in more accessible, relevant and understandable forms. Advances
   in the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D modelling
   software mean that there is now far greater opportunity to develop
   geo-environmental information products for urban development. New and
   innovative ways of visualizing and communicating geoscience information
   have been developed. Using this new technology it is possible to predict
   not only the types of rocks beneath a site. but also the engineering
   properties (such as rock strength, shrink-swell characteristics or
   compressibility), hydrogeological properties (such as permeability,
   porosity and thickness of the unsaturated zone) and geohazard potential.
   Geoscientific information can then be imported into standard GIS
   packages and queried along with other complementary ground investigation
   data, resulting in the creation of a powerful tool to assist in
   strategic planning and sustainable development.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the relationship between confidence and CALL -
   specifically the use of audio and video technology among language
   teachers. Through logged usage of CALL, the authors tracked seven
   teachers at two large universities in the United States over a term.
   These teachers were also interviewed periodically in order to gain
   insight into their confidence with and use of CALL. Upon data analysis,
   the authors identified the teachers as less confident, contextually
   confident and highly confident. Highly confident teachers used
   technology less often with less integration than the contextually
   confident teachers. Less confident teachers integrated CALL only in
   prescribed ways. The authors conclude that CALL teacher preparation may
   benefit from a focus on developing contextualized confidence within
   certain teaching domains or types of technology rather than expecting
   teachers to develop a high level of confidence with technology across
   domains.}},

Abstract = {{Many technical processes and products in the area of mechanical and
   electrical engineering are showing an increasing integration of
   mechanics with digital electronics and information processing. This
   integration is between the components (hardware) and the
   information-driven functions (software), resulting in integrated systems
   called mechatronic systems. Their development involves finding an
   optimal balance between the basic mechanical structure, sensor and
   actuator implementation, automatic information processing and overall
   control. Simultaneous design of mechanics and electronics, hardware and
   software and embedded control functions resulting in an integrated
   component or system are all of major importance. This technical progress
   has a very large influence on a multitude of products in the area of
   mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering and changes the
   design, for example, of conventional electromechanical components,
   machines, vehicles and precision mechanical devices with increasing
   intensity. This contribution Summarizes ongoing developments for
   mechatronic systems. shows design approaches and examples of mechatronic
   products and considers various embedded control functions and system's
   integrity. One field of ongoing developments, automotive mechatronics,
   where especially large influences can be seen, is described in more
   detail by discussing mechatronic suspensions, mechatronic brakes, active
   steering and roll stabilization systems. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background
   Understanding the three-dimensional (3D) volumetric relationship between
   imaging and functional or histopathologic heterogeneity of tumours is a
   key concept in the development of image-guided radiotherapy. Our aim was
   to develop a methodologic framework to enable the reconstruction of
   resected lung specimens containing non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
   to register the result in 3D with diagnostic imaging, and to import the
   reconstruction into a radiation treatment planning system.
   Methods and Results
   We recruited 12 patients for an investigation of radiology-pathology
   correlation (RPC) in NSCLC. Before resection, imaging by positron
   emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (CT) was obtained.
   Resected specimens were formalin-fixed for 1-24 hours before sectioning
   at 3-mm to 10-mm intervals. To try to retain the original shape, we
   embedded the specimens in agar before sectioning. Consecutive sections
   were laid out for photography and manually adjusted to maintain shape.
   Following embedding, the tissue blocks underwent whole-mount sectioning
   (4-mu m sections) and staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Large
   histopathology slides were used to whole-mount entire sections for
   digitization. The correct sequence was maintained to assist in
   subsequent reconstruction.
   Using Photoshop (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.),
   contours were placed on the photographic images to represent the
   external borders of the section and the extent of macroscopic disease.
   Sections were stacked in sequence and manually oriented in Photoshop.
   The macroscopic tumour contours were then transferred to MATLAB (The
   Mathworks, Natick, MA, U.S.A.) and stacked, producing 3D surface
   renderings of the resected specimen and embedded gross tumour. To
   evaluate the microscopic extent of disease, customized ``tile-based{''}
   and commercial confocal panoramic laser scanning (TISSUEscope:
   Biomedical Photometrics, Waterloo, ON) systems were used to generate
   digital images of whole-mount histopathology sections. Using the digital
   whole-mount images and imaging software, we contoured the gross and
   microscopic extent of disease.
   Two methods of registering pathology and imaging were used. First,
   selected PET and CT images were transferred into Photoshop, where they
   were contoured, stacked, and reconstructed. After importing the
   pathology and the imaging contours to MATLAB, the contours were
   reconstructed, manually rotated, and rigidly registered. In the second
   method, MATLAB tumour renderings were exported to a software platform
   for manual registration with the original PET and CT images in multiple
   planes. Data from this software platform were then exported to the
   Pinnacle radiation treatment planning system in DICOM (Digital Imaging
   and Communications in Medicine) format.
   Conclusions
   There is no one definitive method for 3D volumetric RPC in NSCLC. An
   innovative approach to the 3D reconstruction of resected NSCLC specimens
   incorporates agar embedding of the specimen and whole-mount digital
   histopathology. The reconstructions can be rigidly and manually
   registered to imaging modalities such as CT and PET and exported to a
   radiation treatment planning system.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade various international Information and
   Communications Technology networks have been created for a global access
   to high-level medical care. OP 2000 has designed and validated the
   high-end interactive video communication system WinVicos especially for
   telemedical applications, training of the physician in a distributed
   environment, teleconsultation and second opinion. WinVicos is operated
   on a workstation (WoTeSa) using standard hardware components and offers
   a superior image quality at a moderate transmission bandwidth of up to 2
   Mbps. WoTeSa / WinVicos have been applied for IP-based communication in
   different satellite-based telemedical networks. In the DELTASS-project a
   disaster scenario was analysed and an appropriate telecommunication
   system for effective rescue measures for the victims was set up and
   evaluated. In the MEDASHIP project an integrated system for telemedical
   services (teleconsultation, teleelectro-cardiography, telesonography) on
   board of cruise ships and ferries has been set up. EMISPHER offers an
   equal access for most of the countries of the Euro-Mediterranean area to
   on-line services for health care in the required quality of service.
   E-learning applications, real-time telemedicine and shared management of
   medical assistance have been realized. The innovative developments in
   ICT with the aim of realizing a ubiquitous access to medical resources
   for everyone at any time and anywhere (u-Health) bear the risk of
   creating and amplifying a digital divide in the world. Therefore we have
   analyzed how the objective needs of the heterogeneous partners can be
   joined with the result that there is a need for real integration of the
   various platforms and services. A virtual combination of applications
   serves as the basic idea for the Virtual Hospital. The development of
   virtual hospitals and digital medicine helps to bridge the digital
   divide between different regions of the world and enables equal access
   to high-level medical care. Pre-operative planning, intra-operative
   navigation and minimally-invasive surgery require a digital and virtual
   environment supporting the perception of the physician. As data and
   computing resources in a virtual hospital are distributed over many
   sites the concept of the Grid should be integrated with other
   communication networks and platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The global struggle with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   and the battle to develop affordable CD4 T-cell counting technology are
   both unfulfilled goals in 2008. The need for such instrumentation is
   more critical now as implementation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is
   in progress in many resource limited regions. Major scaling-up efforts
   in rural situations are difficult to implement without laboratory
   infrastructure. CD4 T-cell counting is especially critical when trying
   to reach individuals with HIV to have them enrolled in ART as soon as
   they qualify for treatment based on CD4 count.
   Method: This review covers both the chronological evolution and the
   scientific milestones of technological development of affordable
   immunophenotyping. It is more focused on flow cytometry but does
   consider the potential contribution by digital image cytometry.
   Results: Thus far flow cytometry offered only modest progress toward
   affordable immunophenotyping. A list with desirable features is offered
   for side by side comparison. Digital image cytometry has yet to show its
   enormous affordable market potential.
   Conclusions: It is possible to develop truly affordable, portable flow
   cytometry but it is not here yet. There are some hopeful signs as there
   are innovative and practical technical components appearing at regular
   intervals. However, so far the technical breakthroughs have been
   fragmented efforts without any attempts to consider intercorporate
   collaboration to optimize critical mass and synergy. The smaller players
   in the industry have made some progress toward meeting the monumental
   needs in Africa and Asia. Digital image cytometry may well be the
   ultimate winner in the affordable technology race. (C) 2008 Clinical

Abstract = {{The prohibitive costs of excavating all geophysical anomalies are well
   known and are one of the greatest impediments to efficient clean-up of
   unexploded ordnance (UXO)-contaminated lands at Department of Defense
   (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) sites. Innovative discrimination
   techniques that can reliably distinguish between hazardous UXO and
   non-hazardous metallic items are required. The key element to overcoming
   these difficulties lies in the development of advanced processing
   techniques that can treat complex data sets to maximize the probability
   of accurate classification and minimize the false alarm rate. To address
   these issues, this paper uses a new approach that combines a physically
   complete EMI forward model called the Generalized Standardized
   Excitation Approach (GSEA) with a statistical signal processing approach
   named Mixed Modeling (MM). UXO discrimination requires the inversion of
   digital geophysical data, which could be divided into two pars: 1)
   linear - estimating model parameters such as the amplitudes of the
   responding GSEA sources and 2) non-linear - inverting an object's
   location and orientation. Usually the data inversion is an ill-posed
   problem that requires regularization. Determining the regularization
   parameter is not straightforward, and in many cases depends on personal
   experience. To overcome this issue, in this paper we employ the
   statistical approach to estimate regularization parameters from actual
   data using the un-surprised mixed model approach. In addition, once the
   non-linear inverse scattering parameters are estimated then for UXO
   discrimination a covariance matrix and confidence interval are derived.
   The theoretical basis and practical realization of the combined
   GSEA-Mixed Model algorithm are demonstrated. Discrimination studies are
   done for ATC-UXO sets of time-domain EMI data collected at the ERDC UXO
   test stand site in Vicksburg, Mississippi.}},

Abstract = {{Visual privacy is a sensitive subject because it literally deals with
   human private parts. It presents a bold challenge to the field of
   Computer Science. The goal of this study is to build a virtual human
   model for designing and evaluating visual privacy technologies before a
   security system is built. Given the available databases of
   anthropological models from CAESAR, 3D scanners and the physical
   parameters of human imaging systems, we simulate the scanning imagery
   data with the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). The proportion
   and template matching algorithms have been developed to find the human
   surface features from 3D scanning data. The concealed object detection
   algorithms are developed according to the wave intensity and surface
   characteristics. Then the privacy-aware rendering methods are evaluated
   by usability studies. This forward-thinking approach intends to
   transform the development of visual privacy technologies from
   device-specific and proprietary to device-independent and open source.
   It also advances privacy research from an ad-hoc problem-solving process
   to a systematic design process, enabling multi-disciplinary innovations
   in digital human modeling, computer vision, information visualization,
   and computational aesthetics.
   The results of this study can be used in the privacy-aware imaging
   systems in airports and medical systems. They can also benefit the
   custom-fit products that are designed from personal 3D scanning data.
   Furthermore, our results can be used in the reconstruction of objects in
   digital archeology and medical imaging technologies such as virtual
   colonoscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The many important innovations and reforms that over the years have
   involved Public Administration in a change and growth process have
   resulted in the dissemination of new analytical technologies aimed at
   exploring cost structures and the correlations between costs and
   achieved results, so as to support Government decision-makers with
   dependable and verified data. The achievement of this goal has been
   facilitated by the legislation introduced in this area over the years
   and by ICT's continued evolution.
   More specifically, IT evolution has brought about the use and
   dissemination of information systems related to the State Budget and the
   management of the public expenditure of central State administrations
   through the standardization not only of its criteria, but also of the
   tools employed, ensuring an efficient and timely execution of
   operations.
   The Ministry of the Economy and Finance (MEF) and the State General
   Accounting Department (RGS) are today a crucial pivot of a complete
   system that supports central State Administrations in the implementation
   of all their accounting, economic and financial activities and that is
   going through further evolution, both in the use of new technologies and
   in the extension of the functional reach of correlated processes.}},

Abstract = {{A critical element that has been generally recognized is that the
   Italian Public Administration provides services and operates emphasizing
   the formal abidance to administrative regulations and procedures, having
   in part lost sight of its institutional goal of providing quality and
   timely services to citizens and -so crucial in our digital age- the goal
   of ``system creation{''}. The opportunity that Italy is given through
   eGovernment lies in fact in the possibility of promoting a change
   management of public services towards a culture aimed at the
   satisfaction of the final user. From this point of view, eProcurement
   can become the ``Trojan Horse{''} (or the killer application) capable of
   promoting change within Public Administration; This is true, first of
   all, because it synthesizes all the critical aspects of typical change
   management processes: Structure reorganization, integration and
   interoperability of functions/service, process re-engineering,
   professional training and growth of human resources, legislative
   revision, technology introduction, the monitoring of public expenditure
   and its monitoring (while maintaining the decentralization of
   expenditure decisions), as well as quality control. Secondly, because it
   is an issue that covers horizontally all Public Administrations, whose
   boundaries and procedures are well known and whose achievable results
   are therefore highly visible and economically valuable. Thirdly, the
   contracting sector appears more conducive than others to the promotion
   of this change process because it has the necessary critical mass in
   terms of expenditure volume to support innovation. Public contracts
   account for more than 16\% of GNP. Lastly, through a growth in the
   efficiency of public contracts it is possible to achieve results that
   are substantial and permanent in the areas of process savings, good and
   services cost savings and of positive externalities in terms of tool
   innovation that will promote market innovation.}},

Abstract = {{As MOSFET is scaled below 90nm, many daunting challenges arise. Short
   channel effects (DIBL and V(TH) roll-off), off-state and gate leakage,
   parasitic capacitance and resistance severely limit the performance of
   these transistors. These, in addition to V(DD) scaling limitation and
   high sub-threshold swing (>60mv/dec) give rise to high I(OFF) and make
   power dissipation an enormous challenge, especially for low power/low
   current applications. New device innovations are essential to achieve
   low I(OFF) and high g(m) with high R(OUT) for digital and analog
   applications respectively. Towards this end, novel asymmetric Tunneling
   Source MOSFETs are proposed in this paper. The main feature of these
   devices is the concept of gate controlled carrier injection through
   tunneling at the source junction. The tunneling source MOSFETs can be
   fabricated using conventional CMOS processes. These novel devices have
   the potential for steep sub-threshold behavior, improved I(ON)/I(OFF),
   high R(OUT) and gain (g(m) x R(OUT)) at low bias currents. They also
   possess excellent immunity against short channel effects which improves
   scalability into sub-50nm regime and makes them an attractive candidate
   for low power digital and analog operations.}},

Abstract = {{What has long since been everyday practice in consumer electronics,
   office communications and in the private sector, meaning the use of
   information and communications technologies and the Internet, is still
   not routine procedure for public health services. The State of Bavaria
   was very quick to recognize the importance of telematics in public
   health for better health care and for Bavaria as an economy location.
   Ever since 1995, we have been promoting innovative and forward-looking
   pilot projects in the field of telemedicine to ensure that all patients
   in a state like Bavaria can have state-wide access to a wide range of
   telemedical applications. While innovative IT applications that network
   doctors in private practice, patients and clinics and hence reduce
   friction losses at the interfaces of the classic sectors in-patient
   treatment, out-patient care as well as rehabilitation and nursing care
   are gaining ground in the health market, there is still much to be done
   to bring our public health system up to the latest IT state of the art.
   A key factor on the road towards digital medical care will be the
   introduction of the electronic health card in Germany. It is expected in
   2008.}},

   senior citizens, citizens without employment, or citizens with low
   education utilise online services in a distinct way, often to a lesser

   make use of different online services. Here, four types on services are
   taken into account and contrasted with each other: Internet usage,
   E-Commerce usage, E-Government for Information and E-Government for
   Transaction. As a result, we develop the E-Inclusion-Gap Model which
   addresses gaps between such service-specific usage and we discuss
   possible reasons behind them.}},

Title = {{The ETS iSkills (TM) assessment: a digital age tool}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{158-171}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how information and
   communications technology (ICT) literacy skills reflect twenty-first
   century requirements for researching and communicating information in
   digital environments. An interactive problem-based, scenario-based,
   web-based assessment tool, iSkills (TM), has been developed through a
   broad-based effort to establish standards for performance and
   certification of ICT literacy proficiencies. This paper aims to discuss
   the assessment's potential in determining the effectiveness of
   instruction programs.
   Design/methodology/approach - Since January 2001, a consortium of
   experts in ICT literacy served as advisors to the Educational Testing
   Service (ETS) test developers as they designed an internet-delivered
   assessment that measures students' abilities to research, organize, and
   communicate information using technology. This paper reviews that R\&D
   process, concluding with an example of its application to information
   literacy program planning and evaluation. A mixed methods approach
   collected and analyzed qualitative sources and iSkills'
   pre-test/post-test data for first-year Purdue University students.
   Findings - Findings informed curricular decisions for instituting an
   integrated problem-based learning (PBL) information literacy program.
   Secondary goals included developing an understanding of how
   information-processing skills are acquired, identifying best practices
   for integrating information literacy into the curriculum, and assessing
   the impact of skill acquisition on overall academic achievement. ICT
   literate students are generally better problem-solvers, more
   self-directed, and communicate ideas more efficiently.
   Practical implications - Universities are beginning to require ICT
   literacy as competencies for graduation. This paper presents a new
   strategy for assessing the effectiveness of instructional programs which
   aim to matriculate proficient students.
   Originality/value - This paper reports on the efficacy of a
   problem-based learning (PBL) approach involving three convergent
   principles of design: the organization and dissemination of information,
   the creation and communication of information, and problem solving
   within the context of research projects and assignments. As such, it
   provides important insights into pairing an innovative instructional
   approach and the iSkills (TM) ICT literacy assessment.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{303-317}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative approach
   that is proposed for developing e-libraries with metadata to meet the
   need of training observation and classification skills in a mobile
   learning environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - A knowledge engineering approach is
   proposed to assist teachers in defining metadata of e-libraries to meet
   the need of training observation and classification skills. Based on the
   innovative approach, an e-library of butterfly and ecology has been
   developed. Moreover, an experiment was conducted from March-April 2007
   on the science course ``Butterfly and Ecology{''} at an elementary
   school in Taiwan. There were two teachers and 35 students participated
   in the experiment.
   Findings - Experimental results showed that the e-library developed with
   the innovative approach is able to effectively support the training of
   observation and classification skills for elementary school students.
   Research limitations/implications - Currently, the innovative approach
   has only been applied to the training of observation and classification
   knowledge. Further studies will be needed to assist teachers in defining
   metadata of e-libraries for other educational objectives, such as
   ``analysis{''} (the ability to separate material or concepts into
   component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood),
   ``synthesis{''} (the ability to put parts together to form a new whole)
   and ``evaluation{''} (the ability to judge the value of material for a
   given purpose).
   Originality/value - With the innovative approach, personalized supports

Abstract = {{Purpose - New Zealand's population is aging; government agencies realise
   the impact of this and are factoring it into their planning for the
   future. There is a perception that ``Seniors{''} are reluctant to
   change, but a recent Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind (RNZFB)
   pilot project to test all internet-connected Digital Talking Book Player
   with 40 borrowers, most of whom were in their 70s and 80s, has shown the
   opposite. The purpose of the trial was not only to test an online
   talking book delivery system but also to ascertain if the RNZFB seniors,
   some of whom have little or no experience with computers, could cope
   with an internet capable Digital Talking Book Player. The purpose of
   this paper is to describe the RNZFB trial.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 39 RNZFB library members between
   the ages of 60 and 93, most in their 70s and 80s and one 40 year old
   were selected to participate in a Digital Talking Book Trial. Each of
   the trialists were loaned a Digital Talking Book Player for
   approximately four weeks and were asked to read two books and two
   magazines per week.
   Findings - The outcome of the trial was remarkable. The trial showed
   seniors do have a positive attitude to change and are not afraid of
   technology.
   Originality/value - The trial showed that if the reward is greater
   independence and a better service, and seniors are given appropriate
   support they will embrace new technology and make it work for them. By
   moving ahead and using new innovative technology the library service
   will be able to provide a greater variety of titles and better access to
   information and recreational reading.}},

   be fruitfully used in the field of Cultural Heritage for carrying out
   educational and awareness raising interventions. It is an attempt to
   underline the relevance of extending the potential of Educational
   Technology tools and methods to Cultural Heritage Education, two fields
   that have not largely been in touch so far. The paper aims at going
   beyond the idea that technology is a precious mean for offering
   closer/better view and easier access to cultural heritage artifacts;
   rather, by assuming a methodological perspective, the paper investigates
   the pedagogical impact that may derive from exploiting the potential of
   both technological tools and the related new educational models and

Abstract = {{Semantic Web technology is able to provide the required computational
   semantics for interoperability of learning resources across different
   Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Learning Object Repositories
   (LOR). The EU research project LUISA (Learning Content Management System
   Using Innovative Semantic Web Services Architecture) addresses the
   development of a reference semantic architecture for the major
   challenges in the search, interchange and delivery of learning objects
   in a service-oriented context. One of the key issues, highlighted in
   this paper, is Digital Rights Management (DRM) interoperability. A
   Semantic Web approach to copyright management has been followed, which
   places a Copyright Ontology as the key component for interoperability
   among existing DRM systems and other licensing schemes like Creative
   Commons. Moreover, Semantic Web tools like reasoners, rule engines and
   semantic queries facilitate the implementation of an interoperable
   copyright management component in the LUISA architecture.}},

   e-content, suitably adapted to the needs of hearing impaired people
   through the use of contemporary animation and digital video
   technologies. In addition, audits and evaluation tests were incorporated
   within the platform, in order to assess and evaluate the linguistic
   skills of the hearing impaired students and the educational e-content
   was divided into various levels according to the educational level of
   each e-student. Both the evaluation process and the setting of the
   e-content to the appropriate level are achieved through the use of an

Abstract = {{The paper presents two tools for teaching the basics of eddy current
   inspection. The first tool is a semi-quantitative simulation code
   showing the correspondence between probe action and signal behaviour.
   The student guides a virtual probe over a virtual workpiece with
   different defects. The measurement immediately appears in the normalized
   impedance plane.
   The second tool is a complete eddy current instrument plugged to the
   USB-port of a PC or notebook. Absolute and differential probes permit to
   inspect reference pieces with typical defects and material properties.
   The signal is displayed in the complex plane directly on the monitor.
   The current setting and the recorded signals may be included in a report
   automatically. Single and dual frequency modes are available. These
   tools help the teacher to explain eddy current fundamentals via notebook
   and data projector. The student gets interactive tools for theoretical
   and practical training. Additionally EddyCation permits to test eddy
   current inspection method for new tasks.}},

Abstract = {{We present our innovative approach to keep navigation maps up to date by
   deducing map changes from recorded GPS tracks using adequate models and
   rules.
   First, we describe, how models for receiver, mobility and terrain can be
   generated from adequately preprocessed recorded GPS tracks. These models
   are used by a server in order to predict plausible extensions of
   available navigation maps. In order to allow for multi-modal track
   sources (pedestrians, automobilists, bicyclists, horseback riders,
   etc.), geometrical matches have to be further checked for plausibility.
   We give examples of such plausibility rules we have developed for this
   purpose.
   The main benefits of our development are better maps and better guidance
   for various classes of possible users, from pedestrian, over
   cross-country skier, to bus driver, to name just a few.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) based frequency
   identification approach designated as adaptive magnitude spectrum
   algorithm (AMSA) is proposed in this paper. Characterized by the a
   posteriori property, the AMSA does not need the a priori information
   about the modal frequencies to be identified, and the situations that a
   modal frequency may be contained along specific segments of the whole
   time duration of one or more intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are allowed
   for automatically in the resulting adaptive magnitude spectrum (AMS).
   The algorithm introduces a banded frequency sweep procedure, during
   which a series of digital filters are designed to process the original
   signal. Then upon applying HHT to the filtered signals, the forward
   weighted averages and the backward weighted averages are computed to
   construct the AMS, based on which the frequencies can be clearly
   identified. Two numerically simulated examples, i.e. the free vibration
   signal from a concrete slab subjected to impact loading and the random
   vibration signal generated by the Phase I IASC-ASCE structural health
   monitoring analytical benchmark problem, and one experimental example,
   i.e. the free vibration signal based on the Phase II IASC-ASCE
   structural heath monitoring experimental benchmark problem, are used to
   demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm. The results indicate that the
   AMSA is an effective frequency identification technique. (c) 2007

Title = {{Teaching challenge in hands-on DSP experiments for night-school students}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2008}},
Abstract = {{The rapid increase in digital signal processing (DSP) applications has
   generated a strong demand for electrical engineers with DSP backgrounds;
   however, the gap between industry needs and university curricula still
   exists. To answer this challenge, a sequence of innovative DSP courses
   that emphasize hands-on experiments and practical applications were
   developed for continuing education in electrical and computer
   engineering. These courses are taught in the evening for night-school
   students having at least three years of work experience. These courses
   enable students to experiment with sophisticated DSP applications to
   augment the theoretical, conceptual, and analytical materials provided
   in traditional DSP courses. The inclusion of both software and hardware
   developments allows students to undertake a wide range of DSP projects
   for real-world applications. Assessment data concludes that the digital
   signal processor fundamentals course can increase learning interest and
   overcome the prerequisite problem of DSP laboratory experiments. This
   paper also briefly introduces representative examples of some
   challenging DSP applications. Copyright (C) 2008 H.-T. Wu and S. M. Kuo.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of information and its possibility to be evaluated has a
   reciprocal relation to reflective judgement. Our respect for systematic
   knowledge and our general confidence in science grew enormously, but by
   knowledge explosion our capacity to find specific information fitting to
   any situation and any question has declined. The user staggers between
   excessive demands of new technology and his curiosity, and the
   particularisation of target groups seems to build up information
   barriers before the innovation process even reaches the quantum leap
   necessary. The analogue switch-off scenario has got to be the only
   reasonable way to master the situation. Yet for the sake of better
   arguments it is important to be aware of some limits of information
   behaviour.
   Arguing that interactive digital broadcasting corresponds well with out
   ability of determining judgement this paper discusses limits of
   educational concepts, the knowledge and ability gap, socio-technological
   barriers, technological innovation as status-symbol, steady promotion
   and cross media reference, autonomy in media consumption, fragmentation
   of audience and uses, and some general information problems.}},

Abstract = {{The dam-break problem (i.e., the sudden release of a given volume of
   fluid down a slope) has attracted a great deal of attention from
   mechanicians and physicists over the past few years, with particular
   interest devoted to the free-surface profile and the spreading rate.
   Experimentally, impediments to accurate measurements of the free-surface
   evolution are numerous because of the significant variations in its
   curvature and velocity. To accurately measure the surge's free-surface
   variations with time, we have developed a new imaging system, consisting
   of a digital camera coupled with a synchronized micro-mirror projector.
   The object's surface is imaged into a camera and patterns are projected
   onto the surface under an angle of incidence that differs from the
   imaging direction. From the deformed pattern recorded by the camera, the
   phase can be extracted and, by using unwrapping algorithms, the height
   can be computed and the free surface reconstructed. We were able to
   measure the free surface of the flow to within 1 mm over a surface of
   1.8 x 1.1 m(2). Although the techniques used in our system are not new
   when taken individually, the system in its entirety is innovative and
   more efficient than most methods used to-date in practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Graduate programs for a cross-disciplinary MS degree in Manufacturing
   Systems Engineering are in their twenty-fifth year since being
   stimulated by an innovative request for proposals (REP) by the IBM
   Corporation. The RFP called for solutions to perceived gaps in
   engineering education. There is a continuing need for engineering
   professionals to gain appreciation of business issues, the importance of
   interpersonal communication, teamwork, information technologies and
   globalization. The Lehigh program, one of the five US proposals funded,
   has evolved both pedagogically and technologically since welcoming the
   first students in January, 1984. The program has migrated from dealing
   with twenty to thirty full-time on-campus students sent by their
   industry employers to catering for similar numbers of partial-release
   students and in the last decade to students that participate remotely.
   Classes are delivered by satellite and are available on-line; students
   employ a `phone bridge to join `live' classroom discussions and to
   support their own presentations or those of their team colleagues.
   Digitized videos of class proceedings are available on customized
   Blackboard (TM) sites. Blogs, Discussion Board assignments and analysis
   of leading-edge technical releases empower the students of this
   `classroom factory' as they undertake research and share their industry
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Instruction of innovative engineering design skills has been identified
   as an important goal for engineering educators. Some universities choose
   to delay the design content of their curriculum until the senior year,
   when the designers can utilize the engineering concepts learned in
   lectures. This delay is unnecessary as the skills needed for innovative
   designs can be learned independently from the engineering theories being
   implemented. The first year curriculum at OSU introduces three design
   courses, each with a manipulative rich laboratory provided by the
   TekBots program and staffed by freshman mentors. The three initial
   TekBots courses explore core topics to our incoming students, which
   include computer architecture, analog circuits, and digital circuits.
   Further enhancements to the first year electrical engineering course
   include curriculum development, increased collaboration with other
   departments, and development of a high school outreach program.}},

Abstract = {{Eight years on from the start of the development of the aLF (active
   Learning Framework) platform, by the Innova group (in the LINED, Spain),
   we have approximately 100,000 users grouped in more than 500 virtual
   learning communities. The development of an integrated space of
   communities and courses has provided a unified model adapted to the new
   European Higher Education Area (EHEA). In the first part of the paper
   the fundamentals of aLF are discussed, and the service model provided
   based on the concept of virtual community.
   Following the description of aLF, how the official digital repository
   (based on an application of Fedora) has been integrated into aLF to
   allow professors and students to search for (and retrieve) digital
   content (audio and video generated from more than 30 years of LINED
   activity and references from papers) is described. The paper will
   discuss the application developed together with the advantages of using
   it: recorded classes reused in the courses, access to institutional
   library material in a distance education model and a simple way of
   consulting related content to help students in their learning
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{With student persistence and retention being a cascading issue within
   higher education (particularly in Computer Science and Engineering),
   developing processes and tools to help students overcome the challenges
   of systemized learning becomes an academic necessity. The authors
   contend that if an information translation apparatus was in existence
   that could generate individual learning data formats, students will have
   another tool to understand and apply information that was delivered in a
   fashion un-natural to their personal learning processes. Survey data has
   revealed that in many situations students spend mental effort trying to
   record, via note-taking, exactly the words being used by the instructor
   instead of the synergy and application of the content.
   Voice recognition software (voice-to-text) is the vehicle by which data
   is digitally recorded for format manipulation between a marriage of
   human learning and technology. The research-tested Interactive Learning
   Model is the foundation of the learning systems component of this
   project and an innovative algorithmic development was utilized to
   manifest specific data formats consistent with technical learning
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile devices such as cellular phones and smart personal digital
   assistants out-ship personal computers (PCs) 20 to 1, and for many
   students the mobile device is becoming the computer. Such devices are
   becoming more powerful than the PCs of twenty years ago and they
   represent a useful tool for conveying important computer science
   concepts. This calls for innovations in the computer science curriculum,
   not only in some specific courses but across the curriculum to create a
   motivating framework for computer science students. After all, students
   expect faculty to integrate leading edge technology in the classroom.
   Here we present our approach for integrating mobile devices into the
   Computer Science curriculum, supported by an example of our experience
   in integrating BlackBerry devices into two programming courses, a
   distributed systems course, and senior capstone projects. Some of the
   courses are lab-intensive where students experiment with the devices,
   and develop and deploy applications for them. Teaching computer science
   and programming in the context of mobile applications provides a
   motivating framework for students and inspires them to excel due to the
   practical experience they gain allowing them to develop applications for
   their own mobile devices.}},

   ubiquitous technologies to support informal and collaborative learning
   in Kenyan rural farming communities. Such an approach is achieved by the
   development of a Knowledge Management System (KMS) integrated with
   existing local community communication channels, together with
   experimental Knowledge Management (KM) initiatives employing the VeSeL
   (Village e-Science for Life) distributed resource kits (DRKs). The
   initiatives support illiterate and semiliterate farming community
   groups, in learning new agriculture practices, and also enable the use
   of advanced digital technology to improve their agricultural practices
   and literacy levels. Results of a recent field trip to Kenya are
   presented and an application sketch is developed. The process of
   applying wireless and Internet technologies for the education of local
   farming communities, using irrigation and water management as the
   application, concludes the paper.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, digital sound material becomes more and more available.
   However, there is still lack of qualitative solutions for access to
   digital sound archives. Not only that there is no consistency in formats
   of archived materials with related media often in separate collections,
   but related metadata are given in non-standard specialist format,
   incomplete or even erroneous. Hence, the full value of the archived
   material is hidden from the end user. EASAIER addresses these issues
   with the development of an innovative remote access system which extends
   beyond standard content management and retrieval systems. The EASAIER
   system focuses oil sound archives, libraries, museums, broadcast
   archives, and music schools. However, the tools may be used by anyone
   interested in accessing archived material; amateur or professional,
   regardless of the material involved. Furthermore, it enriches the access
   experience enabling the user to experiment with the materials in
   exciting new ways. The system features; enhanced cross media retrieval
   functionality, multi-media synchronisation, audio and video processing,
   analysis and visualisation tools, all combined within in a single user
   configurable interface.}},

Abstract = {{Content consumption in mobile devices is no longer limited to ringtones,
   games or images. The increasing capabilities of new mobile devices
   include now music and video clips. The content sent to the mobile device
   and even content created from devices has an increasing value. The
   application of security mechanisms and the introduction of Digital
   Rights Management (DRM) can give companies and final users a new way of
   interchanging content. Nevertheless, it is not easy to provide
   applications that work on different mobile devices. The specific
   features of these devices (manufacturers, operating systems, programming
   environments, capabilities, etc.) make difficult to implement innovative
   applications for them, especially those I-elated to DRM which usually
   involve several security aspects. Different approaches have been taken
   to overcome these problems, which are presented here.}},

Abstract = {{Building geologically realistic reservoir models that honour well data
   and seismic-derived information remains a major challenge. Conventional
   variogram-based modelling techniques typically fail to capture complex
   geological structures while object-based techniques are limited by the
   amount of conditioning data. This paper presents new reservoir facies
   modelling tools that improve both model quality and efficiency relative
   to traditional geostatistical techniques. Geostatistical simulation
   using Multiple-Point Statistics (MPS) is all innovative depositional
   facies modelling technique that uses conceptual geological models as
   training images to integrate geological information into reservoir
   models. Replacing the two-point statistic variogram with multiple-point
   statistics extracted from a training image enables to model nonlinear
   facies geobody shapes such as sinuous channels, and to capture complex
   spatial relationships between multiple facies. In addition, because the
   MPS algorithm is pixel-based, it call handle a large amount of
   conditioning data, including many wells, seismic data, facies proportion
   maps and curves, variable azimuth maps, and interpreted geobodies, thus
   reducing the uncertainty in facies spatial distribution. Facies
   Distribution Modelling (FDM) is a new technique to generate facies
   probability cubes from user-digitized depositional maps and
   cross-sections, well data, and vertical facies proportion curves. Facies
   probability cubes generated by FDM are used as soft constraints in MPS
   geostatistical modelling. They are critical, especially with sparse well
   data, to ensure that the spatial distribution of the simulated facies is
   consistent with the depositional facies interpretation of the field. A
   workflow combining MPS and FDM has been successfully used in Chevron to
   model important oilfield assets in both shallow- and deep-water
   depositional environments. Sedimentary environments can be characterized
   by a succession of deposition of elements, or rock bodies, through time.
   These elements are traditionally grouped into classes, commonly named
   `depositional facies'. based on their lithology, petrophysical
   properties, and biological structures. For example, the typical
   depositional facies encountered ill fluvial environments are high
   permeability sand channels, with levees and crevasse splays, having a
   more variable range of permeability and net-to-gross ratio, within a
   background of low permeability shaley facies.}},

Abstract = {{There is lots of dust in the constructing rock tunnel with New Austrian
   Tunneling Method. Since the length of visible light wave is shorter than
   dust, and the light is always not sufficient in the tunnel, it's hard to
   get clear pictures with classical photography technique. Using the
   infrared photography technology, it is possible to get vivid picture
   through dust and fog for the length of infrared wave is close to dust.
   This paper specifies the process of shooting tunnel face with infrared
   technology in the constructing rock tunnel. Based on sufficient
   experience of taking pictures of tunnel face with this method,
   regulation has been advanced which describes how to get clear pictures
   in the complex circumstance in constructing rock tunnel with the special
   equipments. Based on former researches of identifying the digital
   photographs of tunnel face with joints and cracks, this paper has
   attempted several ways of image processing and intelligent recognition
   on the tunnel face photographs. After the comparing and analyzing of the
   results, regulations of image processing and intelligent recognition
   which are fit for this kind of photographs was advanced. Infrared
   photography which is described in this paper is a useful innovation for
   getting clear tunnel face photograph in constructing rock tunnel with
   NATM. The image processing implements semi-automatic geological
   sketching. The intelligent recognition of tunnel face images provides
   some critical parameters for rock masses classification, and makes 3-D
   numeral reconstruction of the tunnel more precise and convenient.}},

Title = {{Sectoral Innovation System and a Technological Catch-up: The Case of the
   Capital Goods Industry in Korea}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECONOMIC REVIEW}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{135-155}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the question of why making a catch-up is even more
   difficult in capital goods industries that are usually led by small or
   middle-sized companies. It relies upon the sectoral systems of
   innovation as a theoretical framework for analysis. From the findings,
   the paper has identified three sources of difficulties in the catch-up
   of the capital goods industry, particularly in machine tools.
   First, while small firms in the capital goods industry are usually
   specialized suppliers to big final goods assembly firms in the consumer
   goods industry or other industries, and thus the tacit knowledge
   accumulated from the interface between the producer and the customer
   firms is very important, a serious difficulty lies in the fact that
   local client firms are reluctant to use locally made capital goods due
   to their poor quality and low precision level. Second, while a
   successful catch-up first requires the ability to produce goods of
   better quality and lower prices than those produced by incumbent firms
   from advanced countries, a typical difficulty arises because incumbent
   foreign firms often react by charging predatory prices upon news of the
   local development of capital goods by latecomers. Third, if the catch-up
   firms overcome this barrier, then the next strategy used by incumbent
   firms is to charge latecomers with legal actions for patent violations.
   Despite these intrinsic difficulties, the Korean economy has achieved a
   very slow but gradual catch-up in the capital goods industry. The paper
   has attributed such achievement to several factors, including the
   strenuous efforts of the government, niche markets in general-purpose
   machine tools and emerging economies, and finally, the increasing
   introduction and adoption of information technology (IT) or digital
   technologies in machine tools.
   Furthermore, the three sources of barriers to catch-up imply that any
   latecomer firms that wish to record a successful catch-up should have
   these barriers in mind from the beginning of the road towards catch-up.
   We observe that a successful catch-up requires the ability to produce
   goods of better quality and lower prices than those produced by
   incumbent firms from advanced countries. After the initial success, they
   should also be well prepared against eventual or possible attacks by the
   incumbent firms in the forms of predatory pricing and intellectual
   property rights (IPR) charges.}},

Abstract = {{The present document describes the features, the applications, the
   functionalities and the benefits of the 2d barcodes, pictorial
   machine-readable representations of information and data. A 2D barcode
   can represent encoded information like a business card or a website
   address. Different formats and standards are available. Mobile phones
   with digital camera can act as barcode reader: a software client
   installed on the mobile phone controls the digital camera in order to
   acquire, scan and decode a 2D barcode, and retrieve the information from
   the Internet. 2D barcodes' main application field is mobile multimedia
   content consumption with particular reference to advertising; according
   a typical use case, a user: 1. finds a barcode printed on a magazine,
   for instance in an advertising; 2. launches the application on the
   mobile phone and scans the barcodes; 3. retrieves a URL form a WAP pages
   and watches a video clip streamed over 3G network. As a result, a
   website can be accessed with the mobile browser; a multimedia content
   can be played with the mobile phone's media player; additionally, this
   technology enable users to directly call a phone number 0 send a text
   message just acquiring and decoding a tag. From the publisher's
   perspective, 2D barcodes give the users the ability to learn more about
   a story and watch related multimedia content.
   From the advertisers' perspective, 2D barcodes are also an effective
   mean to reach a wider audience; by acquiring a barcode, consumers can
   enjoy at least two kinds of mobile multimedia content: commercials of
   products or services and premium content (music video clips...) starting
   with an advertisement.
   From the mobile network operators' perspective, tags can help to boost
   mobile value added services, mobile browsing and mobile Internet
   subscriptions.
   2D barcodes bring an innovative approach to multimedia mobile
   consumption as they allow users to retrieve digital content from a
   picture printed on paper and to experience valuable information in
   mobility, without typing long URLs.}},

Abstract = {{Collaborative knowledge networks come in various shapes and forms,
   digitally connected or clustered in a particular geographical location.
   In industry-university collaboration, a new model has emerged with more
   direct involvement and benefits for universities especially in Business
   Schools, focussing on managerial and administrative innovation. Yet,
   little research has been devoted to investigating the role of
   universities as sources and even co-ordinators of managerial
   innovations. The most popular among such innovations seem to be those
   related to IT-enabled enterprise management systems such as CRM
   (Customer Relationship Management) and SCM (Supply Chain Management)
   (Roberts, 2007). In SCM, various US universities have established forums
   and industry consortia with various companies and even government
   organizations. Such consortia explore new research avenues and bring the
   industry into the classroom, involving faculty and Students in finding
   solutions to real industry problems of member companies. Since almost
   every university in the GCC has a Business School, the application of
   this new collaboration model in GCC universities is pertinent. This
   paper addresses the issues of transferability and implementation
   challenges of such university-based knowledge networks in the GCC.}},

Abstract = {{Recent banking industries are systems of people, equipment, inventory
   and procedures arranged to interact in order to accomplish one or more
   objectives. Rapid changes due to globalization of banks, technological
   innovations, social and political changes cum increased awareness and
   demands from customers are putting pressures on banks which are being
   countered by new management approaches ranging from telecommuting to
   bank process reengineering. ICT is at the core of most innovations used
   today by banks to succeed or survive. ICTs are known for strategic
   management, communication, collaboration work, customers' access,
   managerial decision making, data management and knowledge management.
   This paper focused on advantages and disadvantages in using digital ICTs
   in banking activities for effective service delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Regarding the ICT industry, we have a fast evolving sector being under
   pressure due to a growing number of failing innovations. Companies are
   forced to be the first on the market and for that reason thorough
   insights in user preferences are indispensable. New technological
   innovations often fail because too much attention is given to
   (technical) product-related features without taking into account the
   most important parameters of user acceptance. In this paper we highlight
   some theoretical considerations on this matter. First of all, we propose
   an approach in which more traditional and often scattered vision(s) on
   adoption determinants are broadened into an integrated framework. The
   approach should provide a stronger base for better targeting of (new)
   users of technologies. Second, we elaborate on this by rethinking these
   determinants with regard to the later adopters. Later adopters (or even
   non-users) are often ignored in technology acceptance research. However,
   especially for policy purposes, the understanding of why people do not
   adopt or do not use ICT is strongly relevant in the light of the
   development of the information society. Both approaches - focusing
   towards early as well as late adopters - are illustrated by case studies
   starting from a common framework.}},

   the human brain for medical applications. This model, or physics-based
   brain atlas, combines inputs from both medical imaging processing and

   this model for which both geometric and biomechanical validation was
   carried out. Quantitative measurements of the model's accuracy were
   studied. An indentation experiment was conducted with its numerical
   simulation. The results suggested the proposed model, with qualitative
   measurements of its fidelity obtained from its validation process, may
   be adopted as a useful tool in brain deformation applications..}},

Abstract = {{The innovative Ubiquitous-Health was born through convergence of medical
   service, with development of up to date information technologies and
   ubiquitous IT. The U-Health can be applied to a variety of special
   situations for managing functions of each medical center efficiently.
   This paper focuses on estimation of various routing protocols for
   implementation of U-health monitoring system. In order to facilitate
   wireless communication over the network, a routing protocol on the
   network layer is used to establish precise and efficient route between
   sensor nodes so that information acquired from sensors may be delivered
   in a timely manner. A route establishment should be considered to
   minimize overhead, data loss and power consumption because wireless
   networks for U-health are organized by a large number of sensor nodes
   which are small in size and have limited processing power, memory and
   battery life.
   In this paper a overview of wireless sensor network technologies
   commonly known is described as well as evaluation of three multi hop
   routing protocols which are flooding, gossiping and modified low energy
   adaptive clustering hierarchy(LEACH) for use with these networks using
   TOSSIM simulator. As a result of evaluation the integrated wireless
   sensor board was developed in particular. The board is embedded device
   based on AVR128 porting TinyOS. Also it employs bio sensor measures
   blood pressure, pulse frequency and ZigBee module for wireless
   communication. This paper accelerates the digital convergence age
   through continual research and development of technologies related the
   U-Health.}},

   reduction policies is used. The 79.5 mm(2) chip was manufactured in a
   130 nm CMOS technology and is integrated in a prototyping platform to
   perform real-time experimentation of advanced MIMO OFDM based telecom
   techniques. It is composed of 23 functional units, such as computing
   intensive IPs, channel coding blocks, programmable DMA engines, an
   ARM946ES core, and an Ethernet interface. These elements are
   interconnected via an asynchronous layered Network-on-Chip using an
   interface that controls the communication and configuration parameters
   during application scheduling.}},

Abstract = {{Service economy and service computing are taking a surge in interest in
   what is being called Service Science or SSME (Service Science,
   Management, and Engineering). From the historical perspective, this
   paper analyzes the birth and research object of SSME, argues that
   compared with traditional ICT applications, service science focus on the
   reconstruction and integration of digital service system. Here,
   integration is defined as a process of redefining and connecting parts
   of a whole in order to form a new one. To obtain flexibility and service
   innovation, from service and integration perspective, this paper
   presents a logical integration model of business system based on service
   components, which shows the similarity with the technical architecture.
   Finally, a generic conceptual architecture for the integration using the
   SOA approach is proposed, related research problems are identified.}},

Abstract = {{At nanoscale, quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) defines a new device
   architecture that permits the innovative design of digital systems.
   Features of these systems are the allowed crossing of signal lines with
   different orientation in polarization on a Cartesian plane, the
   potential of high throughput due to efficient pipelining, fast signal
   switching, and propagation. However, QCA designs of even modest
   complexity suffer from the negative impact due to the placement of long
   lines of cells among clocking zones, thus resulting in increased delay,
   slow timing, and sensitivity to thermal fluctuations. In this paper,
   different schemes for clocking and timing of the QCA systems are
   proposed; these schemes utilize 2-D techniques that permit a reduction
   in the longest line length in each clocking zone. The proposed clocking
   schemes utilize logic-propagation techniques that have been developed
   for systolic arrays. Placement of QCA cells is modified to ensure
   correct signal generation and timing. The significant reduction in the
   longest line length permits a fast timing and efficient pipelining to
   occur while guaranteeing a kink-free behavior in switching.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a resynthesis framework, called
   COunterexample-guided REsynthesis (CoRe), that automatically corrects
   errors in digital designs. The framework is based on a simulation-based
   abstraction technique and performs an error correction through two
   innovative circuit resynthesis solutions: distinguishing-power search
   and goal-directed search, which modify the functionality of circuits'
   internal nodes to match the correct behavior. In addition, we propose a
   compact encoding of resynthesis information, called the Pairs of Bits to
   be Distinguished, which is a key enabler for our resynthesis techniques.
   Compared with previous solutions, CoRe is more powerful for the
   following reasons: 1) It can fix a broader range of error types because
   it is not bounded by specific error models; 2) it derives the correct
   functionality from simulation vectors without requiring golden netlists;
   and 3) it can be applied with a broad range of verification flows,
   including formal and simulation-based flows.}},

Abstract = {{The paradigm and the usage of CMOS are changing, and so are the
   requirements at all levels, from transistor to an entire CMOS system.
   The traditional drivers, such as speed and density of integration, are
   subject to other prerogatives related to variability, manufacturability,
   power consumption/dissipation (mobile products!), mix of varied digital
   and analog/RF functions (system-on-chip integration), etc.
   Controllability of variations and static leakage will add to, and in
   certain products prevail, over speed and density. Implications at all
   levels are multiple and are more diverse than just speed and smallness.
   The goal of the authors has been to see the problem globally from the
   product level and to place its components in their true proportions.
   Therefore, we will start with drawing the product-level picture and
   placing it in a historical perspective. Next, we will review the state
   of the art, the requirements, and solutions at the level of materials,
   transistor, and technology. Detailed analysis and potential solutions
   for prolonging CMOS as the leading information technology are presented
   in this paper.}},

   applications like along-track interferometry and moving object

Abstract = {{Digital signal processing algorithms are nowadays playing an
   increasingly more important role in most measurement processes.
   Furthermore, in the presence of poorly digitized data, reliable and
   repeatable measurement results can often be assured by complementing the
   adopted procedure with a suitable processing stage. The realization of a
   ``collection{''} of measurement algorithms to be shared among
   researchers and technicians who work on similar topics should, thus, be
   advisable. Complex algorithms, however, suffer from critical drawbacks,
   in terms of computational burden and hardware resources, when applied to
   very long acquired records. The authors suggest the adoption of GRID
   Service as an innovative solution to provide researchers with a
   ``collection{''} of measurement algorithms and concurrently overcome the
   cited drawbacks. GRID Service is a new hardware/software approach that
   is capable of merging the higher computational performance of parallel
   GRID computing with key mechanisms and standards of Web Service. It
   would be very possible to migrate complex measurement algorithms into
   services that are available and accessible on the Internet. As an
   application example, the authors present a GRID Service mandated to
   power measurement in digital wireless communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the practical approach of technology enhancement
   in mobile industry by using technology innovation tools. TRIZ (Teoriya
   Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadatch) that is also called TIPS (Theory of
   Inventive Problem Solving) is a methodology and model-based technology
   for generating innovative ideas and solutions for problem solving. In
   addition, it is also most practical technology innovation tool that have
   been originally designed by Genrich Altshuller {[}1]. In the other hand,
   Digital Right Management (DRM) is considered as the target of applying
   the TRIZ for technology enhancement because DRM is one of most critical
   features in the mobile industries. DRM is the access control technology
   to be used by issuers and other copyright holders to limit usage of
   digital media or devices. Event driven Digital Right Management {[}3] is
   the new DRM technology that has been designed by using TRIZ method.

Abstract = {{The relevance and incidence of strategic alliances in business practice
   significantly increased since the past decade thus renewing the interest
   of management scholars on the topic. In a globalised economy, where
   technological innovation and industry dynamics are becoming faster and
   faster, strategic alliances of a firm are expected to change in number
   and nature (exploration vs. exploitation) not only in relation to the
   strategic intent or the firm but also as an outcome of the co-evolution
   of the environment in which it operates. The paper investigates, through
   an in depth case shady or Hp, the evolution of strategic alliances at
   the ICT industry during the period 1998-2007 and relates it, in a
   co-evolutionary perspective, to the major industry dynamics
   (product/market modularity and digital convergence). The paper provides
   an example of and supports the application of the co- evolutionary
   perspective in the fast moving ICT industry. Finally, it identifies and
   initially discusses an evolutionary virtuous cycle for strategic
   alliances.}},

Abstract = {{After the computer technology flourished in the 1980s and internet in
   the following decade, communication for development -especially that for
   agriculture- has entered to a new era. Telecenter media, with its icon
   e-agriculture (agricultural information service using internet), has now
   become an integral part of distant agricultural learning program. This
   non-formal educational system may become the future hopes for
   revitalizing agricultural communication system in Indonesia. The basic
   assumptions are that this ICT (information and communication technology)
   has capability to diffuse agricultural information in quick, accurate
   and up to date ways. Conventional agricultural education systems were
   not likely able to achieve these natures. In the beginning of this
   21(th) century -although still in very limited scale-there have some
   efforts to explore obstacles, potencials, and social implications of the
   emergence of this new digital technology in agricultural sector. As
   agricultural communities have a special case, the questions are how the
   management and agricultural agents, as well as any other agricultural
   stakeholder (particularly farmers), respond to the existence of this
   cyber-technology. This paper will review some studies regarding the
   issues, and will be concluded with some important recommendations in
   order to accelarate the diffusion of e-agricultural innovation in
   Indonesia.}},

Abstract = {{Technological literacy has become a new imperative for survival in
   technological society. Technology adds to its diversity and complexity
   with new innovations. One way of measuring the extent to which an
   individual copes effectively with the technological environment is to
   survey their attitudes towards technology. These attitudes if found
   positive provide evidence to the fact that the person is either
   effectively using technology or willing to learn technology. The
   negative attitudes, on the contrary, indicate that there is a tendency
   to resist technology. By using the definition of technology as an
   efficient means to solve the problems and digital technology as a
   dominant form of technology it can be demonstrated that there could be a
   digital divide between those who are users of technology and those who
   are anti technology. Persons with disabilities are generally deprived of
   digital technology because Of its unfriendly nature to their special
   needs. The digital divide between persons with and without disabilities
   could be even deeper than one may think of. The combination of handicap
   created by disability and a lack of technological literacy could
   Multiply the handicapping condition. This divide will continue to grow
   if efforts are not made to adapt technology according to their special
   needs. Consequently they could be digitally marginalized and will become
   an unbearable burden on the society. This Study unfolds the digital gap
   between the persons with and without disabilities by comparing the data
   on attitudes toward technology. The recommendations are made on possible
   changes in the curriculum to make it technology and disability friendly.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the innovative design of
   prosthetic hands now in production from a Scottish spin-off company.
   Design/methodology/approach - The novel features are described, followed
   by the details of the mechanical construction and the available grip
   patterns. The benefits of the modular design are explained, and the
   function and construction of a skin-like covering are explored. The
   clinical network supporting the prosthesis is briefly outlined.
   Findings - The design allows patients to achieve many functional and
   natural-looking hand configurations from simple ``open{''} and
   ``close{''} signals. Miniature motors and gearboxes allow independent
   movement of each digit, and an integral microprocessor translates
   electric signals from the forearm to control the movements of the hand.
   Stall detection ensures that no finger exerts excessive force or wastes
   power. Artificial skin can be very realistic, with imitation
   fingernails, hairs and pores. The lifelike prosthesis helps the patient
   emotionally, socially and at work.
   Originality/value - The paper shows how advances in motors, gearboxes,
   batteries and electronics have enabled a breakthrough in prosthetic
   design.}},

Abstract = {{There are many factors - currently not well understood - which influence
   how efficiently the educational system builds and cultivates digital
   literacy of pupils. Among them is the quality of the educational policy
   documents, which set the overall strategy from the governmental point;
   the level of digital literacy of the schools' management and teachers;
   the level of concern of the pupils and their parents in acquiring
   competency; the quality and richness of the teaching-learning resources;
   how dedicated the school is to innovation in general; how is competency
   implemented in schools - through Informatics or ICT as a subject, or
   through ICT integrated in all subjects and the quality of collaboration
   between teachers of different subjects etc.
   In our department we make a great effort to positively stimulate two of
   these factors: provide modem university pre-service teacher development
   and produce attractive and inspiring Informatics textbooks, educational
   software and learning resources for children, students and teachers. In
   this paper we present our current series of Informatics textbooks for

Abstract = {{The diffusion and adoption of Web 2.0 applications the most actual
   peculiar phenomena of the digital era- have significantly transformed
   the traditional way in which firms and people interact. This has
   Contributed to the modification of the traditional processes of

   aware and urged to adopt these applications to grasp the potentialities
   of the market and more precisely of the lead customers that play an
   important role in the firm's process of innovation, providing
   competitive advantage and pro-active market positioning to the firms.
   In this paper, we present evidences about the importance of Web 2.0
   applications and their recent process of adoptions by firms. For this
   purpose two case studies from different industries are presented The
   case study comparison describes the several benefits of the adoption of
   Web 2.0 application by firms in terms of customers contribution to the

Abstract = {{Several transformations in the digital economy have introduced
   complexity mid dynamicity in the competitive environment. Continuons and
   effective innovation is considered the main source of sustained
   competitive advantage. For this purpose, it is fundamental to redesign
   enterprises. As innovation and knowledge can come from a different set
   of potential innovators, enterprises have to extend their boundaries for
   involving internal and external innovator for creating and delivering
   complex products. This emergent business model of the firm, called
   extended enterprise (EE), is deemed to open business frameworks, able to
   address the rising development costs and shorter product life cycles of
   the new products, through a greater integration of external technology
   in their own innovation processes. Based on the resource-based and on
   the knowledge-based views of the firm, this paper describes the EE's
   foundations, highlights the importance of knowledge management (KM) and
   relationship management (RM)for successful new product development (NPD)
   and of the Knowledge Management Systems as enabler of the capabilities
   of the EE.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States an intense debate has taken place between those
   wishing to minimize the digital divide and others who are skeptical of
   this view. In regard to the global digital divide, by contrast, although
   a similar type of complacency can be found, it has not yet been
   seriously debated. This article, accordingly, hopes to initiate such a
   discussion. It attacks the notions that information technology can be
   easily compared with the earlier diffusion of consumer durable goods,
   that the divide can be made to disappear by redefining the issue, and
   that the global divide can be analyzed without the help of basic
   knowledge from fields such as innovation studies, technology and
   development, and the diffusion of process innovations.}},

Abstract = {{In assessment of site, contractors have a lot of routine jobs such as
   checklists, daily reports, collection of construction data and the
   inspection. Contractor needs to access the real construction site to
   manage the construction project progress. They usually use sheets of
   paper or field notes. A gap in time and space between the outdoor
   construction site and the office which leads to the low efficiency and
   increasing cost of construction project. This project describes the
   development of a productive software tools to help contractors for site
   process evaluation and reporting. This software tool called eWorks.
   eWorks is an initiative that integrates the assessment of site process
   in construction project supply chain onto an electronic or digital
   medium using web based technologies in hope that it can transcend
   geographical, time, economical, people-based error and low efficiency
   making it faster, more efficient and more profitable for Contractors.
   This software will help to reduce the paper usage, visualization
   progress by using graphical image, video and Gantt chart format. eWorks
   is an innovative web based software solution for tracking and monitoring
   construction site assessment and progress.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to advances in digital technology, emerging breakthrough solutions
   responding to market needs are becoming increasingly innovative and
   complex. Large amount of resources, competencies, skills, etc. are
   required to accomplish such solutions, usually beyond the capabilities
   and capacities of a single organization. The emergence of co-innovation
   networks as breeding environments for creation of temporary partnerships
   has enhanced the possibility of success for organizations and
   facilitating their collaborations. One obstacle to configuration of such
   partnerships as well as collaboration has been the difficulty in
   assessing the trust level of potential partners. So far, trust level
   assessment has been performed manually by organizations and in ad hoc
   manners, which is both time consuming and hardly produces accurate
   results. Consequently, formation of collaborative initiatives has become
   more challenging and organizations are reluctant to work with each
   other. This paper addresses the supervised automation of the assessment
   of trust level of organizations in co-innovation networks. It presents
   the design. and development of Trust Management system, addressing its
   specifications and architectures to facilitate its implementation.}},

Abstract = {{This study pioneered an innovative project regarding the use of ICT for
   creating learning resources and opportunities for faculty members and
   adult learners on both sides of the Taiwan Straits - Taiwan and mainland
   China - that would not have been possible during the past five decades.
   This paper is based on a one-year in-depth study of an ICT initiative
   project in two established universities in Taiwan and China. This paper
   documents how the faculty members made this initiative a reality through
   collective efforts on designing, producing and delivering the digital
   learning materials by overcoming difficulties and challenges resulting
   from both distance and longtime political separation. The findings
   indicate that most of the learners gave positive responses to whether
   course content was current and of value and were satisfied with the
   instructors. This project develops a new and profound co-operative model
   and introduces a new business marketing opportunity for universities for
   the commercialisation of knowledge that critically meets the demands of
   working people in the high-tech arena and is driven by corporate need
   and the self-interest of learners in the Chinese and Taiwanese
   community. Some issues related to e-learning are identified and several
   suggestions are made in the conclusion for further reference.}},

Abstract = {{In this era of hyper-technological innovation, massive amounts of data
   are being generated at almost every level of applications in almost
   every area of disciplines. Extracting interesting knowledge from raw
   data, or data mining in a broader sense, has become an indispensable
   task. Nevertheless, data collected from complex phenomena represent
   often the integrated result of several interrelated variables, whereas
   these variables are less precisely defined. The basic principle of data
   mining is to distinguish which variable is related to which and how the
   variables are related. In many situations, the digitized information is
   gathered and stored as a data matrix. It is often the case, or so
   assumed, that the exogenous variables depend on the endogenous variables
   in a linear relationship. Retrieving ``useful{''} information therefore
   can often be characterized as finding ``suitable{''} matrix
   factorization. This paper offers a synopsis from this prospect on how
   linear algebra techniques can help to carry out the task of data mining.
   Examples from factor analysis, cluster analysis, latent semantic
   indexing and link analysis are used to demonstrate how matrix
   factorization helps to uncover hidden connection and do things fast. Low
   rank matrix approximation plays a fundamental role in cleaning the data
   and compressing the data. Other types of constraints, such as
   nonnegativity, will also be briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explain the issues in the current digitizing and
   servicizing economy, and how knowledge exploratory could contribute to
   providing innovation management to solve them. We also explain some of
   the actual research and education activities as an example of promoting
   knowledge exploratory. They are information literacy management, service
   innovation management, and the unbundling \& rebundling model. We
   believe that this kind of systematic approach, having human beings
   located in the system, will have more meaningful implications for the
   new economy.}},

   assistance to collaboration during innovative design project. This model
   is dedicated to the development phase of new products for which product
   architecture is indeed not a priori defined and tasks will be set
   dynamically during the product development process. In an integrated
   design perspective, product behaviours must also be forecasted; that is
   achieved by assessing PPO behaviours. This paper presents the PPO model
   and the open IPPOP framework that instantiates this model. It
   investigates how such a model with such a digital platform may interact
   with other services used to assist other phases of the product life

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH}},
Year = {{2008}},

Abstract = {{Virtual Australia is not a well-defined or agreed concept. This
   discussion paper conceptualises Virtual Australia as a `virtual
   {[}digital] model containing and representing all non-trivial objects
   and their contextual environment - from blue sky to bedrock - in real
   world Australia'. It describes a scenario for Virtual Australia, one or
   two decades from now, in which the locations and conditions of
   non-trivial objects and their environment are updated automatically
   through a combination of remote sensing and wireless communication
   technologies in support of a `Supranet'. It then examines the concept of
   the `Supranet' - a pervasive information network based largely on
   wireless technology linking the physical world to a virtual model in
   real time - and develops and discusses three principal characteristics
   of the Supranet: the ability to have or collect specific information
   (know); the ability to process information (think); and the ability to
   communicate that information. If, in the near future, any or all
   non-trivial devices are to some extent able to know, think and
   communicate, the potential for object autonomy will be realised.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},

Pages = {{450-465}},
Abstract = {{In spring 2006, Duke University piloted a new, interdisciplinary,
   service-learning course, in which undergraduate, graduate, and
   professional students conducted a life cycle analysis of natural
   disasters. Invited experts discussed: the range of meteorologic,
   hydrologic and geologic factors that cause disasters; explored how
   societies plan for and/or respond to the immediate and long-term
   physical, social, emotional and spiritual issues associated with
   survival; and presented case studies of response, recovery and
   reconstruction efforts. Students had the option to participate in either
   a service-learning exercise in an area ravaged by a natural disaster or
   to research a topic related to natural disasters. All students attended
   the lecture component of the course and completed on-line quizzes to
   demonstrate understanding of the material presented. Students who
   elected to undertake the service-learning experience participated in a
   trip over spring break to assist residents of St. Bernard Parish,
   Louisiana. During their time in Louisiana, they kept journals (audio and
   written) of their activities and upon their return wrote a brief
   synopsis, and made a group oral presentation of their experience.
   Students not participating in a service-learning project prepared one
   individual paper on a relevant topic and one group paper, the results of
   which were presented to the class. Additionally, as part of the Duke
   Digital Initiative, the course also relied on technology to enhance
   student learning. Twice-weekly lectures were recorded and provided in
   the form of Webcasts for future reference and students completed online
   quizzes based on these lectures. Also, students recorded interviews with
   hurricane survivors and volunteers on Duke issued iPods and used that
   audio content, interwoven with their own thoughts and experiences, to
   create audio journals about their service-learning experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite plays an important role in global information infrastructure
   (GII) and next generation networks (NGNs). Similarly, satellite
   communication systems have great advantages to support IPv6 (Internet
   Protocol version 6) networks as a technology that allows universal
   access to broadband e-services (audio, video, VPN, etc.). In the context
   of DVB-S2 (digital video broadcast-satellite) and DVB-RCS (digital video
   broadcast-return channel via satellite) standards, this paper presents
   the current SatSix project (satellite-based communications systems
   within IPv6 networks) within the European 6th Framework Programme, which
   is implementing innovative concepts and effective solutions (in relation
   with the economical cost) for broadband satellite systems and services
   using the technology presented above. This project is promoting the
   introduction of the IPv6 protocol into satellite-based communication
   systems.
   Moreover, through SatSix, the industry is addressing the next generation
   Internet, IPv6. It also enhances its competitive position in satellite
   broadband multimedia systems by exploiting the common components defined
   by the European DVB-S2 and DVB-RCS satellite broadband standards.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses major risks and challenges for information security
   which will especially result from current and ongoing innovations in
   ICT. These innovations are primarily caused by rapid technological and
   technical advances of computer and communication hardware which enable
   permanently new (software- and firmware-implemented) services and
   applications. The drastically increasing miniaturization and integration
   of digital components on silicon, and the permanent advances of digital
   communication media and techniques will lead us into the era of
   ``Ambient Intelligence{''}, which means the era of invisible, pervasive
   and ubiquitous computing and communication. Besides a lot of benefits,
   this era of a global, digitized ``information and knowledge society{''}
   will also open new risks and challenges with respect to information
   security.
   In this regard, this paper summarizes some major trends for realization
   of future digital computer and communication components, structures and
   principles, and resulting new challenges for data and information
   security. At first, in Section 2, major technological and technical
   trends will be summarized which form the basis for the implementation of
   new computing paradigms, concepts and structures discussed in Section 3.
   In Section 4, new evolving services and application scenarios of
   ubiquitous computing and communication will be considered, especially
   focusing on security relevant issues. The final summary lists some major
   research actions which should be taken to decrease risks for information
   security in the new approaching digital era of invisible, ubiquitous
   computing.}},

Abstract = {{Iris recognition has become a popular research in recent years due to
   its reliability and nearly perfect recognition rates. It-is recognition
   system has three main stages: image preprocessing, feature extraction
   and template matching. An innovative method is proposed to extract iris
   features based on texture analysis. Iris textures are analyzed to
   capture the discriminating frequency information. Specific filters with
   different center frequency are applied to three different zones to
   extract the texture of the iris. Different weightings are given to each
   zone depending on its contribution to the recognition. The encoded
   binary templates are compact in size and can avoid the visibility of the
   individual iris images. The templates are suitable for implementing iris
   recognition devices using DSP (Digital Signal Processor). The proposed
   method was evaluated using CASIA iris image database version 1.0 {[}1].
   Experimental results show that the proposed approach has achieved high
   accuracy of 98.62\%.}},

Abstract = {{The role of information and communication technologies (ICT) has been
   growing in the economic and social life recently. Information and
   communication technologies are one of the basic priorities of research
   and development (R\&D) in the information society. In recent years,
   analyses on the impact of ICT on business and economic environment have
   been widely addressed by policy makers, technology developers, and
   science and business societies more and more often. Studies of the
   socioeconomic impact of ICT cover a wide spectrum of questions. The
   Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) defines five
   important thematic trends in ICT research: macroeconomic and social
   conditions for ICT-based innovations; ICT, organizational changes and
   transformation of work processes; the social dimension of ICT political
   instruments related to ICT development.
   In the case of ICT-related research, different visions by information
   society of what ICT is and what role it should play in directing
   research. Although variety of positions exists, ICT socio-economic
   impact remains one of the most often discussed issues. The spectrum of
   problems defined by IPTS shows that the impact of ICT is important both
   at macroeconomic and microeconomic levels as well as on social and
   political processes affecting all economic subjects activities.
   Consumers and producers form private sector and government-public. ICT
   development has conditioned the fact that ICT is used by all economic
   entities in their activity. ICT creates opportunities for an economic
   entity and transforms its methods and techniques of activity
   simultaneously.
   Evaluating the impact of ICT on business, it is necessary to indicate
   that the implementation of ICT-enabled solutions is related to both
   internal and external factors. The implementation of ICT does not only
   mean acquiring certain software; it also affects different processes of
   the enterprise. The enterprise has to be able to change, because the
   implementation of ICT requires primarily transformations inside the
   enterprise.
   Changes conditioned by ICT are closely related to the impact of ICT on
   consumers. One of the main impacts of ICT is the capacity ``to move
   people to the Centre{''}. In this context the European Union declares a
   possibility ``to move every citizen, home and school to the digital
   century; create literate Europe in digital systems supported by business
   culture ready to finance and develop new ideas; ensure that the process
   is socially comprehensive, creating consumer reliance and enforcing
   social cohesion{''}. This includes efforts like the development of
   e-learning, e-government, e-health, etc.
   Usually e-Government is defined as the usage of ICT to provide public
   services (therefore, it is closely related to an administrative
   management unit); however, ICT-enabled solutions are also applied at
   various administration levels-international, national, regional or
   local. The application at the local level is related to the concept of
   e-City. The concept of e-City is based not only on the provision of
   information, but also on the possibility to include citizens into the
   life of a city more actively and mutually usefully. E.g. digital
   technologies (remote network systems, internet and mobile technologies)
   are used to facilitate the process of decision-making for public
   institutions, improve public policy in local communities and transform
   relations with citizens, business and other public institutions.}},

   able to emulate a complete DVB-RCS (Digital Video Broadcasting - Return
   Channel via Satellite)- DVB-S2 (Digital Video Broadcasting - Second)
   system in a realistic and flexible way. It is possible to configure the
   platform to emulate a transparent DVB-RCS system dimensioned around a
   single Hub, or to emulate a system using a regenerative satellite with
   an onboard switching matrix. Different DVB-RCS protocol stacks are
   implemented, and the adaptive physical layer is emulated in real time
   thanks to precalculated DRA schemes and MODCOD files. A DiftServ-like
   QoS Architecture that couples MAC and IP-Layer QoS mechanisms and Layer
   2 security framework are currently under development. At the network
   side, IPv4 and IPv6 are fully supported as well as IPv6 mobility and
   dynamic multicast. In this paper, we mainly focus on the emulation
   platform and the tools developed to help the performance analysis of the
   emulated system.}},

Abstract = {{Today System-on-a-Chip (SoC) is like a black hole which draws all the
   important IP/Cores in a digital system. Current SoC design methodologies
   are no longer adequate to meet the challenges of SoC design
   productivity, design quality and diminishing time-to-market window. This
   paper describes an innovative SoC platform integration and verification
   design methodology to enhance design productivity based on IP reuse and
   IP-XACT standard. Platform Integrator including RPTKit (Reusable
   Platform Toolkit) is developed to improve the efficiency and reliability
   in platform integration, and Platform Verifier to improve verification
   setup time and work efficiency. Several cases of SoC platform designs
   substantiate the validity and capability of the Platform Integrator and
   Verifier, which reduced the total SoC integration and verification time
   by more than 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{Inkjet printing is the most innovative technique for the application of
   dyestuffs onto textile materials. Digitally-printed textile substrates
   with reactive inks produce brilliant shades with outstanding fastness
   properties. Usually, the fixing of reactive prints is done with
   saturated steam or heated air, techniques which are not quite suitable
   for online fixation in a highly flexible ink-jet printing process.
   Therefore, a demand has arisen for the adoption or development of new
   fixation techniques which would be compatible with the digital textile
   printing technique. One appropriate solution could be the microwave
   technique, which is known, and frequently used, in textile drying
   processes. The aim of this study was to determine efficiency in regard
   to microwave fixation of those reactive prints applied with the help of
   a DOD digital textile printer. Monochlorotryazine (MCT) reactive ink was
   printed on pre-treated cotton fabric (alkali, urea, oxidizing agent),
   fixated with a laboratory prototype microwave device, and then washed to
   remove unfixed reactive dyes. The characteristics of those reactive
   prints fixed with saturated steam or hot air were compared with the
   microwave-fixed prints. The colour properties were evaluated, in regard
   to penetration and fixation degree, as colour fastness to washing and
   wet rubbing. The results of the presented research project shows that it
   is possible to achieve quality characteristics regarding microwave-fixed
   reactive prints, and which are comparable with the characteristics of
   prints fixed with saturated steam or hot air.}},

Abstract = {{CAD/CAM fashion and textile design software plays an important role at
   many levels during the the planning and production of garments,
   especially by small manufacturing units. It provides designers and
   technologists with a full range of higher-end pattern design, textile
   software grading tools, anautomatic and interactive marker making
   process, as well as 3D clothing design. This paper presents a new,
   innovative method for preparing garment patterns for individuals. The
   goal of our research was to follow and analyze the production process of
   a woman's blouse, where all activities before sewing were done using
   different computer technologies. The differences between the virtual and
   real models are discussed from the following points of view, colour
   changes and fabric shrinkage, as well as rationalization of work
   stages.A woman's blouse with popular colour motifs was designed, using
   the OPTITEX computer system for this purpose and using different raw
   materials i.e. cotton, linen and viscose. The clothes patterns were
   printed on textile materials using a Mimaki JV2-160II InkJet printer.
   After printing, all fabrics were treated over the following stages of
   work: dying, curing, washing, and drying. The results show that fabric
   shrinkage, as well as colour changes, according to the raw material,
   should be considered at the beginning when planning the clothes. The
   given results, suggest that it should be included within those data
   bases technologists and designers consult when planning new products.}},

Abstract = {{This paper illustrates a human-centered cyberinfrastructure (CI) for
   conducting scientific and engineering grid applications. CI comprises
   computing systems, data, information resources. networking, digitally
   enabled-sensors, instruments. observatories, and virtual organizations,
   along with in interoperable Suite of software services and tools. The
   Taiwan Knowledge Innovation National Grid (KING) began with a
   human-centered. application-driven Cl. In addition to the development of
   usual CI which covers the planning of required resources, technology
   development and forming the environment for research and education, our
   CI emphasizes how to connect experts and communities via collaborative
   technologies to work as a Virtual organization. The approach
   technologically leads to bridging and balance between intensive
   computing which is file base of CI, and pervasive computing which allows
   a wide variety of access to remote and local intelligence. In
   applications, topics strongly related to people's living in Taiwan, such
   as epidemics alleviation Support. medical care, flood mitigation and
   ecological conservation, are of interest and used to drive the Cl
   development. It enables human-life related applications as a result. The
   accomplishments and social impacts associated with the applications are
   highlighted ill this article. The Grid middleware and core technologies
   utilized by individual applications and impacts are also explored in
   this paper. It is found that pervasive computing technology plays a
   significant role in human-life related grid applications, and the demand
   for data grid support to applications is more than within the intensive
   computing category. With the accumulated capability. the human-centered
   Cl call be extended to serve business and industry, and further
   developed to play a key position in the Asia Pacific cyber-education and

Abstract = {{The WWW is currently experiencing a revolutionary growth due to numerous
   emerging tools, techniques and concepts. Digital journals thus need to
   transform themselves to cope with this evolution of the web. With their
   growing information size and access, conventional techniques for
   managing a journal and supporting authors and readers are becoming
   insufficient. Journals of the future need to provide innovative
   administrative tools in helping its managers to ensure quality. They
   also need to provide better facilities for assisting authors and readers
   in making decisions regarding their submission of papers and in
   providing novel navigational features for finding relevant publications
   and collaborators in particular areas of interest. In this paper, we
   explore an innovative solution to address these problems by using an
   emerging Web 2.0 technology. We explore the application of mash-ups for
   J.UCS - the Journal of Universal Computer Science and encourage readers
   and authors to try out the applications (see section 11 Conclusions).
   J.UCS can then serve as a model for contemporary electronic journals.}},

Abstract = {{The use of digital games in education is well documented in the
   literature. They have been used in preschool, K-12, the university. A
   specific type of digital games is board games. Adding board games to the
   educational process can lead to an interactive stimulating learning
   experience. With a board game, players often learn from one another
   while at the same time having fun in a competitive environment. In this
   paper we propose the ``ELG{''} game, an e-learning board game that
   adopts the basic elements of a racing board game but fosters students'
   creativity, problem-solving skills, and imagination as students are
   trying to reach the end by improving their performance in a variety of
   learning activities. The innovative feature of the ELG is that it offers
   an adaptive authoring tool that enables teachers to customize their
   games according to the needs, interests and motives of students. The
   teacher enters hierarchically categorized learning activities according
   to the learning goals of a course, sets the rules and assesses the
   learning progress easily and simply. Students participate in a discovery
   or exploration trying to reach the goals. After attaining them their
   level of activities is upgraded and they are challenged to reach the
   next learning goal. The dice in ELG is not randomized but controlled by
   the teachers in order that they can customize adaptive learning rules.
   The educational benefits of exploiting ELG in the learning process is
   that the teacher can define the levels of difficulty according to the
   students' needs and interests, facilitate and monitor the learning rate
   of each student, combine a variety of evaluation techniques, and address
   potential learning problems in a timely manner.}},

Abstract = {{The complex Potato virus Y classification, including groups (PVYN and
   PVYO) and variants (PVYNTN and PVYN-W), is based mainly on biological
   properties of isolates. Published PVY detection tools targeting markers
   not associated with biological proper-ties could fail to assign
   correctly isolates in the current classification. To improve PVY
   detection tools, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNaPshot) detection
   assay was developed. The technique was adapted to target the T/C-9259,
   A/C-2271, G/C-8573 and A/G(2213) PVY polymorphic nucleotides. The
   ``TAGA{''}, ``CCCG{''}, ``CACA' and ``CAGN{''} four-digit codes
   associated with tested samples allowed identification of PVYN, PVYO,
   PVYN-W and PVYNTN isolates, respectively. The PVY SNaPshot procedure is
   efficient and reliable for PVY detection and characterization in samples
   containing as few as 10(2) viral RNA copies. Moreover. PVY group
   assignment is possible for fractions containing only 10 copies of a PVY
   RNA genome. Finally, the SNaPshot assay allows PVYN/PVYO dual
   characterization for mixed samples containing PVYN/PVYO quantity ratios
   in the range of 0.1-10. This innovative SNaPshot tool improved clearly
   PVY diagnostic assays described previously by targeting simultaneously
   major functional markers and sequence unlinked to biological properties
   used separately in PVY detection tools available currently. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{Collaborative knowledge management (KM) system for organizational
   learning, addressing the needs of the individual within a purposeful
   context should be improved in term of organizational responsiveness,
   innovation, competency and efficiency. Mobile devices, such as Personal
   Digital Assistants (PDAs), evolve rapidly and addition to the
   capabilities of these devices, new mobile communication technologies,
   such as Wireless LAN, enable `anytime' and `anywhere' access to
   information infrastructures and integrate the devices as the front ends
   of mobile information systems. In Implementing the KM system in mobile
   computing, there are many frameworks but lack of implementation in
   bioinformatics domain. Therefore, this research is an attempt to develop
   a framework for mobile knowledge management in bioinformatics domain
   especially in herbs plantation and formulate this concept in order to
   deliver the best information to the users, organizations in term of

Abstract = {{Cognitive systems are a fundamental prospect of innovation and growth
   activities in the European Union (and worldwide) as they are able to
   perceive, reason and vigorously interact in modern digital operational
   environments by interpreting received information and acting
   purposefully (and autonomously) towards achieving specific goals. Their
   effective use will help open up new technological and business
   opportunities for industry and will affect an immense variety of the
   underlying market sectors-domains, especially by offering major
   innovative opportunities and facilities, aligned to the perspective of
   network and service convergence. Cognitive networks constitute a very
   significant strategic priority for the European Union policy context and
   actual corresponding research effort has been identified as one of the
   European key priority research areas. In the scope of the present work
   we discuss recent European initiatives and we assess the potential
   motivation for further development. We evaluate essential features of
   innovative cognitive systems, as outlined by the European strategic
   framework for growth. In addition, we identify several targeted areas
   where further progress is expected and we analyze the impact on the
   market sector, by identifying several categories of market players
   (users, network operators, manufacturers, service and application
   providers). As cognitive systems have the potential to address (and to
   satisfy) an extended variety of both modern technical- and
   business-related characteristics, while being fully in line with the
   European policies for development, they hold great promise for future
   wide-scale applications.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper seeks to review a source of information on
   applications of digital technology in medicine and patient care. A
   recent period of lively discussion in the online discussion list
   associated with the American Society for Cybernetics, initiated by a
   question about the relationship of cybernetics to systems science, is
   partially reviewed.
   Design/methodology/approach - The aim is to review developments on the
   internet, especially those of general cybernetic interest.
   Findings - Modelling of human physiology and pathology, especially when
   patient-specific, offers many benefits including novel procedures.
   Attention is also given to management of out-patient appointments and to
   aids for the old and infirm. The discussion in the CYBCOM list raises
   many important and fundamental issues concerning the nature of
   cybernetics.
   Practical implications - The applications of IT in medicine and patient
   care are of undoubted actual or potential value. The CYBCOM discussion
   reveals a diversity of attitudes, with general agreement that
   cybernetics offers deeper insights than alternative approaches.
   Originality/value - It is hoped this is a valuable periodic review.}},

Title = {{A service design framework for value co-production: insight from
   mutualism perspective}},
Journal = {{KYBERNETES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{226-240}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study proposes to discuss an up-to-date framework for
   service design as a means-end tool for modeling, designing, and
   developing the service systems (e-service) which can fulfil
   (semi-)automated value co-production between the service providers and
   the customers in a service. In order to achieve the goal of service
   innovation, this study raises concerns regarding how an innovative
   e-service can be a systematic service process according to the proposed
   service design framework. However, the framework takes into account a
   novel service classification and individual criteria.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study addresses an intelligent
   service design using design science. According to the proposed
   framework, the service systems (e-services) are implemented by
   simulation. In this study, either service classification or the
   counterparts of service performance measures emerged from the ecological
   symbiosis perspective through analytic and synthetic methods. The
   proposed service design framework defines two dimensions - continuity of
   co-production and mutual adaptability - characterized by the process of
   exchanging service/benefit and building .relationship (i.e. partnership)
   involved within a service. The framework indicated how the interactions
   and the service/benefit exchange between the service provider and the
   consumer can work in a service process. The aim is to build a
   partnership by the service participants due to mutual adaptability in
   adapting to the counterpart of service (i.e. the service provider or the
   customer).
   Findings - Comparing with traditional service classification and service
   design, a more positive niche in systematic service innovation was
   established than before. According to the synthetic methodology, this
   study classifies the six categories of service based on ecological
   symbiosis perspectives. Examining individual service performance is
   derived from a set of criteria of species performance measures in
   ecological mutualism including proximate response, evolved dependence,
   and ultimate response. The service systems comply with the
   characteristics and criteria in the framework to demonstrate the sets of
   methodology for innovative service design.
   Practical implications - This study has yielded findings on both
   managerial insight on service innovation and the impact of service
   system design.
   Originality/value - The value of the framework is demonstrated through
   the diverse service systems. For example, digital content, interior
   design, or mobile phone design is characterized by service participants
   who embody knowledge-intensive attributes when engaged in their service
   process. In order to further complete a novel framework for service
   design, the question of evaluation that arises concerns the extent of
   ensuring the necessary service performance.}},

Abstract = {{Reflections regarding changes in the learning landscape and their
   implications for the ( lifelong) learner are placed against the backdrop
   of an ecological perspective on learning. Learning-individually and as a
   feature of social behavior-is defined in relation to constructive
   interaction of complex adaptive systems with their wider environment.
   Human existence involves more and more that people interact online.
   Consequently, such interactions have increasingly become a crucial
   dimension of learning. Adapting to life-and thus also to learning-on the
   Net poses a certain challenge to those whose major life experience
   predates the digital era. However, more important than the changes
   brought about by technological innovation as such are the challenges
   posed by increased complexity of the world in which we live, the nature
   and scale of the problems it faces, and the changed nature of our
   productive and transformative presence in the world. The latter
   challenges require a fundamental rethinking of the purposes for which we
   learn, given the complex thinking educated individuals must be capable
   of. They also call for a strategic reorientation of the processes and
   environment that afford such learning. Tentative answers will be offered
   and questions will be raised regarding the implications of the referred
   challenges for today's learners and the learning ecology in which they
   operate.}},

Abstract = {{Nowhere in the current digital technology landscape is the process of
   `blurring the lines between media' more apparent than with the uses and
   applications of gaming practices and technologies. Here the overlaps
   between new media and media interfaces are becoming significant as games
   technologies and practices are becoming more pervasive as commonplace
   social practices. This article reviews literature for evidence of these
   trends of convergent media forms as a starting point for a wider debate
   for using games technologies and practices to support learning
   practices. The article outlines convergences between gaming and cinema,
   gaming and the Internet, and gaming and emergent technologies and
   interfaces ( e. g. mobile phones and social software). The article aims
   to foreground major dimensions of convergence in relation to the
   potential of innovations in educational practice and activities. The
   article concludes that variant forms of gaming are widespread. But while
   the converging forms of gaming with other media forms provide potential
   for supporting educational practices, these new forms still need to be
   considered in relation to clear pedagogic strategies, supported peer
   interactions and tutor engagement.}},

Abstract = {{Among other things, Gregory Bateson is considered a pioneer in the study
   of communication in living systems and evolution. His contribution to
   cybernetics was very special because for him communication was a
   characteristic property of the living world. But his formulation of
   information as differences sensed by living systems did not hinder him
   from using the rest of the conceptual tool-box from cybernetics like,
   e.g., the notions of feedback, digital and analogical codes, and even
   information as improbability or restraints, which in his view emphasised
   the importance of the context in a developmental pathway. Being a
   central figure in the development of cybernetic theory he collaborated
   with a range of researchers from the life sciences who were innovating
   their own disciplines by introducing cybernetic concepts in their
   particular fields and disciplines. In the light of this, it should not
   come as a surprise today to realize how the general ideas that he was
   postulating for the study of communication systems in biology fit so
   well with the astonishing findings of current molecular biology, for
   example in the field of cellular signal transduction networks. I guess
   this is the case due to the fruitfulness of his abductive approach,
   being as he was concerned with advancing the search for fundamental
   principles in communication processes in living systems at different
   hierarchical levels. In this paper I point out some passages to
   illustrate Bateson's coherent approach to context-dependent information,
   hierarchical contexts and analog/digital communication, which I think
   molecular biologists could find of great inspiration. In particular I
   highlight ten ``Batesonean ideas{''} that may prove to be of great
   relevance to the field of cellular signal transduction.}},

Abstract = {{In his recent book, ``The World is Flat{''}, Thomas L. Friedman reviews
   the impact of networks on globalization. The emergence of the Internet,
   web browsers, computer applications talking to each other through the
   Internet, and the open source software, among others, made the world
   flatter and created an opportunity for individuals to collaborate and
   compete globally. Friedman predicts that ``connecting all the knowledge
   centers on the planet together into a single global network... could
   usher in an amazing era of prosperity and innovation{''}. Networking
   also is changing the ways by which libraries and museums provide access
   to information sources and services. In the flat world, libraries and
   museums are no longer a physical ``place{''} only: they are becoming
   ``virtual destinations{''}. This paper discusses the implications of
   this transformation for the digitization and preservation of, and access
   to, cultural heritage resources. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-57}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to describe work at Kent State University
   Libraries and Media Services to promote and devise electronic thesis and
   dissertation (ETD) storage at OhioLINK's ETD Center, to find efficient
   methods to represent these unique scholarly materials within the
   library's catalog, and to foster the establishment of state-wide library
   catalog standards for ETDs.
   Design/methodology/approach - A semi-automated process has been devised
   that extracts student-supplied metadata already available in the
   OhioLINK ETD Center to provide almost instantaneous access to unique
   resources through the library catalog. A Perl program uses the OAI-PMH
   protocol to extract metadata, modifies and enhances the data, and
   inserts it into the Innovative Interfaces, Inc. catalog. Significant
   effort was made to map the data from ETD-MS to MARC. Catalogers retrieve
   records for completion and contribute full bibliographic records to OCLC
   WorldCat in addition to the local and consortium catalogs.
   Findings - The process successfully produces a provisional bibliographic
   record that is useful immediately for resource discovery and that can
   serve as the basis for full cataloging.
   Practical implications - This research provides libraries with a method
   they can adapt locally to provide provisional level access, full level
   access, or both, to unique scholarly research.
   Originality/value - This research broke new ground regarding the use of
   a software agent to repurpose metadata in library catalogs. It also
   impacted national cataloging standards for ETDs.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The objective of this article is to describe how two small
   non-profit, primarily grant-funded music projects are working to provide
   solutions for scholars and students in an environment dominated by
   for-profit companies and aggressive rights regimes. Technology in some
   ways levels the playing field for organizations such as ours while at
   the same time forcing a more rapid pace of innovation because of
   heightened user expectations.
   Design/methodology/approach - This article is a case study. It describes
   each of the authors' projects and how technology has aided their efforts
   in certain areas: organizationally: what technologies have aided us in
   terms of staffing and project organization; how technology has impacted
   the kinds of services and products we are able to provide; and how the
   overall environment of rapid innovation in music sometimes makes our
   work more difficult than in other areas of content creation.
   Findings - The paper finds that overall the projects would not be
   possible without recent innovations. The authors are finding it
   challenging to meet the needs of the generative web, but are reacting as
   quickly as their projects allow.
   Originality/value - This is the first joint case study published by the
   authors' organizations and, in the authors' literature review, they did
   not find any other study about music product utilization and innovation
   by non-profits serving library populations.}},

Journal = {{LIGHTING RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The effective use of complex fenestration systems in buildings requires
   knowledge of their optical spectral and directional properties. While
   the directional properties are commonly assessed by the measurement of
   bidirectional transmission or reflection distribution functions, the
   addition of spectral information would significantly aid in the design
   and analysis of such systems. This paper describes the development of a
   spectral estimation method that reconstructs reflectance and
   transmittance spectra of unknown complex fenestration samples in the
   Heliodome, an innovative video-goniophotometer. The estimation method
   relies on the digital output of a tri-chromatic charge-coupled device
   camera in eight filterbands to reconstruct a sample's spectrum using the
   truncated generalised singular value decomposition. This method is
   validated by comparing estimated spectra with documented reflectance and
   transmittance spectra of reference samples. In most spectrally selective
   materials, the method achieved average improvements of 50\% over the
   Heliodome's previous quasi-spectral assessment method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an innovative technique for measuring the wave field
   around a towed model is presented. This method, denoted as Free Surface
   Scanning (FSS) and developed in the towing tank of NTUA, is advantageous
   over the commonly used methods of similar field resolution, as it is
   optical and therefore non- intrusive, fast and accurate. The arrangement
   gives the flexibility to cope with almost every type of ship, including
   sailing yachts. The resolution and consequently the accuracy of the
   system can be adjusted depending on the needs of the experiments.
   Moreover, it incorporates the modern measurement philosophy for
   uncertainty analysis, while the cost and complexity of implementation is
   reasonable. It is based on the following concept: A stationary vertical
   laser- sheet, normal to the direction of model movement is produced
   underwater in the towing tank and illuminates a vertical cut of the
   water. The upper border of this cut represents a vertical cut on the
   free surface. As a towed model travels along the towing tank and passes
   through the laser-sheet, digital cameras capture sequentially luminous
   cuts, which represent sequentially cuts of the wave field around the
   model. Finally the captured images are filtered and analysed using image
   processing techniques. Applying special treatment and in combination
   with simple complementary techniques, the captured field is extended in
   some cases up to close vicinity of the hull surface. The implementation
   of the method is described and its efficiency is demonstrated via
   comparison with standard experimental methods. A typical hull form and a
   sailing yacht are used in this respect.}},

Abstract = {{Fuelled by the rapid expansion of broadband connectivity and increasing
   interest in online multimedia-rich applications, the growth of digital
   multimedia content has skyrocketed. Among others, this growth is
   compounding the need for more effective methods for searching multimedia
   information. The automated web search engines that are currently used
   rely only oil text descriptions and as a result provide matches of poor
   quality in case Of Multimedia content. The services of a multimedia
   search engine are therefore a possibility that the internet users still
   lack. The scope of this paper is thus to present an implementation
   approach for a personalised web-based multimedia search engine in the
   Java programming language. This approach combines the characteristics of
   the current search engines as well as new innovative features which
   guarantee at the same time the system's quick response and better search
   results. In this paper, the reader can find an analytical presentation
   of all the components required to form a multimedia search engine, as
   well as indications on how to implement key algorithms and functions.}},

Abstract = {{OpenCourseWare (OCW) represents an innovative and cost-effective
   opportunity for institutions to take a more active role in strengthening
   health sciences education worldwide. OCW content can provide a

   provide much of the basic content critical to teaching and research in
   resource-limited health education environments. Educational institutions
   worldwide have the opportunity to explore how OCW and other open tools
   and materials can supplement efforts to build health education capacity
   to address global shortages of healthcare workers. Tufts University has
   worked to leverage open, digital resources to support medical education
   since 1994 with the creation of the Tufts University Sciences
   Knowledgebase (TUSK). This experience has yielded vital lessons for
   institutions interested in OCW, including: effectively motivating
   faculty participation; managing the inherent complexity of open
   publishing of health sciences content due to its rapidly evolving nature
   and reliance on copyrighted materials; generating support through
   internal and external communication throughout the process; and creating
   institutional systems that ensure the long-term sustainability of OCW

Abstract = {{Background: The introduction of competency-based curricula in
   institutions situated in resource-limited environments is likely to pose
   new challenges for the implementation process. The St. Elisabeth
   Hospital (SEHOS) in Curacao, Dutch Caribbean, is affiliated to
   university teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. It is a teaching
   hospital in a resource-limited environment. Aims: Following the revision
   of the curriculum of the Dutch paediatric residency training, the
   country's paediatric society mandated its implementation in all training
   institutions within Dutch sovereignty. We set out to implement the
   revised curriculum in SEHOS and highlight the benefits it may have in a
   setting like Curacao. Method: The intended learning outcomes for the
   16-week project were (1) the implementation of the core changes in the
   curriculum and (2) conduct an assessment of the learning environment.
   The strategies used included informative meetings, workshop and
   lecture-based trainings, questionnaire surveys, and focus group
   interviews. Results: Registrars and staff were successfully trained in
   how to use brief clinical assessments and digital portfolios.
   `Departmental portfolio' was introduced as an innovative method of
   evaluating and monitoring departmental educational activities.
   Conclusions: Competency-based curricula can be successfully implemented
   in resource-limited environments. Educational experts in the local
   setting are crucial for the success of the process.}},

Title = {{Low-power wireless smart data acquisition system for monitoring pressure
   in medical application}},
Journal = {{MICROELECTRONICS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{3-14}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - To develop a wireless sensor micro-systems containing all the
   components of data acquisition system, such as sensors,
   signal-conditioning circuits, analog-digital converter, embedded
   microcontroller unit (MCU), and RF communication modules. This has now
   become the focus of attention in many biomedical applications.
   Design/methodology/approach - The system prototype consists of miniature
   FSK transceiver integrated with MCU in one small package, chip antenna,
   and capacitive interface circuitry based on Delta-sigma modulator. At
   the base station side, an FSK receiver/transmitter is connected to
   another MCU unit, which send the received data or received instructions
   from a PC through a graphical user interface GUI. Industrial, scientific
   and medical band RF (433 MHz) was used to achieve half duplex
   communication between the two sides. A digital filtering has been used
   in the capacitive interface to reduce noise effects forming capacitance
   to digital converter. All the modules of the mixed signal system are
   integrated in a printed circuit board of size 22.46 x 20.168 mm.
   Findings - An innovation circuits and system techniques for building
   advanced smart medical devices have been discussed. Low-power
   consumption and high reliability are among the main criteria that must
   be given priority when designing such wirelessly powered microsystems.
   Switched capacitors readout circuits have been found to be suitable for
   pressure sensing low-power applications.
   Research limitations/implications - The presented wireless prototype
   needs a second phase of development that will lead to a further
   reduction in both size and power consumption. Currently, the main
   limitation of the RF system is the number of working hours according to
   the selected battery.
   Practical implications - The developed system was found to be useful in
   terms of measuring pressure and temperature in a system of either slow
   or fast physical change. It would be a good idea to explore the system
   performance in human or animal trials.
   Originality/value - This paper fulfils useful information for capacitive
   interface circuitries and presents a new short-range wireless system
   that has different design features.}},

Title = {{SALVAGE OF AMPUTATED THUMBS BY TEMPORARY ECTOPIC IMPLANTATION}},
Journal = {{MICROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{559-564}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the indications and benefits of ectopic
   implantation in the salvage of amputated thumb. Basic procedures: Two
   cases of avulsed amputated thumbs were temporarily ectopically implanted
   onto the forearm and foot, with microvascular anastomoses. When the
   stump condition allowed, and the soft-tissue defects were repaired, the
   ectopic implanted thumbs were replanted to their anatomic positions.
   Results: Both thumbs survived the temporary ectopic implantation and
   second-stage replantation. The length of the thumbs was maintained, and
   the thumbs regained their function in 16- and 10-week follow-ups.
   Conclusions: Temporary ectopic implantation of amputated parts provides
   an innovative procedure for the salvage of amputated thumbs under
   special circumstances. Although this procedure is very demanding, it
   does deserve special consideration in reconstructive microsurgery, since
   it offers the possibility to salvage amputated thumbs with extensive
   soft tissue loss of the hand, by preserving the anatomy and restoring
   the function of severely injured hands. (C)2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Abstract = {{Background: Soft tissue defects in the distal lower extremity present a
   formidable challenge due to the lack of reliable local flap options.
   Pedicled adipofasciocutaneous flaps provide the closest match to local
   tissues, but random pattern flaps are limited in reliability, size,
   reach, and arc-of-rotation. One hundred and eighty degree
   perforator-based propeller flaps are an innovative option because they
   provide robust axial perfusion to flaps with significantly greater
   surface area and ease of transposition versus that provided by their
   random pattern counterparts in these anatomic regions traditionally
   addressed with free tissue transfer. Case: We present a rare case of
   aggressive digital papillary carcinoma of the posteriolateral ankle and
   Achilles region. Wide local excision resulted in a defect with Achilles
   tendon exposure and denudation. A fasciocutaneous propeller flap based
   on a dominant peroneal artery perforator was raised and rotated 180
   degrees to resurface the wound, providing a gliding surface for Achilles
   tendon function. The reconstruction was successful with no
   complications, excellent contour, and esthetic appearance. Conclusions:
   Peroneal perforator-based propeller flaps in the ankle region are useful
   local options providing unparalleled form and function, with excellent
   surface area and mobility, for dynamic areas of the lower extremity,
   without sacrificing any major vessels or nerves. This technique adds to
   the reconstructive microsurgeon's armamentarium for complex coverage of
   the ankle region. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Microsurgery 28:663-670,

Abstract = {{This article is devoted to tangible interfaces for steering and control
   of interactive multimedia presentations. Various methods for digital
   encoding of physical objects are considered and their applicability in
   surface encoding for tangible inter-face components is discussed.
   Experiments with presentation controls, based on direct interaction with
   digitally encoded printed handouts are reported. An innovative approach
   for transferring presentation controls from printed handouts to surfaces
   of real physical objects is introduced. Consequently labels, digitally
   enhanced with CLUSPI codes are created and presentation control trials
   involving real products with digitally encoded surfaces are conducted.
   USB and wireless cameras are employed as CLUSPI readers for implementing
   surface based interactions and a portable communication device with an
   embedded camera is considered as a possible truly mobile solution.}},

Abstract = {{We present a multi-agent simulation model of a concentrated industry
   undergoing technological change. The simulation consists of
   heterogeneous firm agents, heterogeneous consumer agents, and one
   intermediating agent, the auctioneer, who aggregates market information
   to transmit to agents and to arrive at prices. Firms seek to maximize
   profit by estimating market demand, entering and exiting product
   markets, and optimizing output based on strategic conjectures of
   competing firm behavior. Consumers maximize utility by optimizing
   consumption within their budget sets. The auctioneer matches firm
   research with shifting consumer preferences, diffuses product knowledge
   among firms and consumers, and sets prices. We study. technological
   shifts; the diffusion of new technologies that directly compete with and
   replace existing ones. Sensitivity analysis is discussed in terms of the
   effects that model parameters have on product adoption, demand, output,
   spending, price, and profits. We validate our model against actual
   industry data on film cameras versus digital cameras.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents access engine to digital audio and related content
   developed under IST FP6 project EASAIER. The main driving force for the
   project was the lack af qualitative solutions for access to digital
   sound archives. An innovative remote access system which extends beyond
   standard content management and retrieval systems, addresses in range of
   issues identified, such as inconsistent formats of archived materials
   with related media often in separate allocations and related metadata
   given in non- standard specialist format, incomplete or even erroneous.
   The system focuses on sound archives, libraries, museums, broadcast
   archives, and music schools, but the tools may be used by anyone
   interested in accessing archived material; amateur or professional,
   regardless of the material involved. The system functionalities;
   enhanced cross media retrieval, multi-media synchronisation, audio and
   video processing, analysis and visualisation tools, enable the user to
   experiment with the materials in exciting new ways.}},

Title = {{An orthotopic model of pancreatic somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive

Abstract = {{Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) scintigraphy is currently used as one
   standard imaging modality in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). However,
   future optimization of NET imaging may be achieved with positron
   emission tomography based methods utilizing more sensitive and specific
   tracers in combination with computed tomography or magnetic resonance
   imaging. Here we established an orthotopic mouse model that reflects
   relevant aspects of human pancreatic NETs such as SSTR expression, dense
   vascularization and metastatic disease. This model was then utilized to
   test the feasibility of combined magnetic resonance imaging and animal
   positron emission tomography. Orthotopic implantation of amphicrine,
   SSTR-positive pancreatic AR42J cells resulted in rapidly growing tumors,
   with concomitant metastatic spread into abdominal lymph nodes and
   peritoneal cavity. Primary tumors as well as their metastases expressed
   the neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A and synaptophysin. For imaging
   experiments, the SSTR ligands Ga-68-DOTATOC or Ga-68-DOTANOC were
   injected intravenously, and animals were subsequently examined in an
   animal positron emission tomography scanner and a clinical 3T ( tesla)
   magnetic resonance imager. All animals showed radionuclide accumulation
   in the primary tumor. Definite anatomical correlation was achieved using
   digital image fusion of the positron emission tomography and magnetic
   resonance imaging data. Ga-68-DOTANOC strongly accumulated in the tumor
   tissue (mean 6.6-fold vs. control tissues) when compared to
   Ga-68-DOTATOC, which showed a higher renal clearance. In good agreement
   with the biodistribution data, the kidney-to-tumor ratio was higher for
   Ga-68-DOTATOC (2.43-fold vs. 1.75-fold). Consequently, Ga-68-DOTANOC
   achieved better signal enhancement in the primary tumor and allowed for
   detection of metastatic lesions. In summary, we established a novel
   orthotopic pancreatic SSTR-positive tumor model and used this model to
   provide proof of principle for the diagnostic combination of SSTR-based
   molecular imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. Specifically, the
   animal model allowed the comparative evaluation of Ga-68-DOTANOC and
   Ga-68-DOTATOC, with Ga-68-DOTANOC providing better tumor-specific
   accumulation and renal activity. We conclude that this animal model will
   be of innovative value for further investigation in the imaging of NETs.

Abstract = {{This research work thoroughly presents an innovative testing-bed for a
   power system protection relaying scheme whose main algorithm is based on
   the use of the time-inverse over-current relaying curves. The algorithm
   is developed using fast digital signal processing techniques to rapidly
   detect over-currents magnitudes and duration of the occurrence in
   electrical power system. The protection algorithm also includes a full
   set of inverse-time curves and, if electro-mechanic relays are installed

   constant. The developed algorithm is evaluated using a DSP-based digital
   relay prototype testing-platform, also developed by the authors, capable
   of being programmed with visual language. Several testing cases are
   presented in this paper. The tests include measurement of response
   speed, accuracy of detection and noise vulnerability. The evaluation
   results indicate that the developed protection algorithm is fast, robust
   and reliable algorithm also suitable for power distribution systems.}},

Abstract = {{Today the common reputation of the paper business is that of a
   technically mature industry with, if any, long innovation cycles. A
   closer look into this industry, however, discloses that paper and paper
   properties are still far from being constant. Paper properties are
   rooted in a complex system of diverse requirements: cost pressure,
   restrictive legal regulations, keen competition, and new demands from
   customers (printer, converter, publisher, and end-consumer), which
   result in perpetual process and quality improvements as well as the
   development of new products with different properties. This paper gives
   an overview of recent developments in the industry and their possible
   impact on electrophotographic devices. Special emphasis is given to
   runability and printability of some of these new products on a Kodak
   NexPress S2500 digital production color press, and the results were
   compared to the data obtained from conventional papers of the same
   market segment.}},

Abstract = {{Printing inflexible Packaging is often done on very thin films whose
   thickness ranges from 12 micron to more than 100 microns. When the
   thickness of the printed ink layer approaches the thickness of the film,
   it often introduces severe roll distortion in normal roll-to-roll
   applications. This distortion is also observed in a less pronounced
   manner in applications that use stacking, such as labels and books. This
   distortion is conventionally managed by reducing the ink-pile height. in
   digital printing (inkjet and also in xerographic) the pile height
   problem limits the applicability of printing for flexible packaging
   applications.
   In this paper we describe an imaging based for managing pile height that
   normalizes the surface height across the Substrate. The solution
   proposed here tries to intelligently balance the ink-layer discrepancies
   across the roll width using image-based compensation so that cylindrical
   shape of roll is maintained. This enables the film/substrate to advance
   at a uniform rate, and the differential rolling stress across the
   substrate cross section to approach the normal operational range. This
   innovation will enable digital printing to play a more significant role
   in roll-to-roll based packaging applications such as flexible packaging.}},

   One century after the first RADAR ``idea{''} we registered the NODAR
   (Nanotechnology Optical Detection And Ranging) trademark. Such NODAR, by
   including both photonic and nano technologies, aims to implement
   multifunctional, multirole, multidomain sensors, as well as adaptive,
   flexible, knowledge-based sensors. NODAR requires proactive studies and
   developments on: I) nanotechnology vacuum tube amplifiers (TX reverse
   nano triode); II) wide bandwidth Tx-Rx optical beam forming network by
   means of optical modulator, combiner, analogue optical receive and
   programmable true time delay; III) broadband photonic analogue to
   digital converters; IV) thermal management and interconnection by means
   of carbon nanotubes; V) nanotechnology infrared and chemical state of

Abstract = {{Our Digital World is becoming increasingly real (and vice versa), is
   being extended to include the physical world, and is growing in size,
   scope, and significance apparently on its own trajectory. The
   elimination of the ancient boundaries of time, space, location, and
   organizational structure appear to be unleashing social and other forces
   that threaten to disrupt real and automated systems replacing them with
   organically evolving digital ecosystems. Yet at the threshold of these
   amazing changes do we have the tools to understand, design, or harness
   these changes for safety, improvement, innovation, and economic growth?
   In ancient times, Hephaestus, the Greek god of technology, devised
   cunning machines with which to right transgressions only to find that
   his machines aggravated problems that were beyond his understanding.
   This talk will briefly review the amazing growth of the Web and of our
   increasingly digital world as indicators of two fundamental shifts. We
   will first look at the End of the Computing Era and the emergence of the
   Problem Solving Era in which the problem owners attempt to solve
   problems with increasing realism and complexity aided by technology -
   not vice versa. Second, we will examine the emergence of a fundamentally
   more flexible, adaptive, and dynamic computing, Computer Science 2.0,
   and how it might serve the next generation of problem solving with its
   pillars of semantic technologies, service-oriented computing, and the
   semantic web.}},

Abstract = {{During the last few years, innovative optical design strategies to
   generate and control image mapping have been successful in producing
   high-resolution digital imagers and projectors. This new generation of
   panoramic lenses includes catadioptric panoramic lenses, panoramic
   annular lenses, visible/IR fisheye lenses, anamorphic wide-angle
   attachments, and visible/IR panomorph lenses. Given that a wide-angle
   lens images a large field of view on a limited number of pixels, a
   systematic pixel-to-angle mapping will help the efficient use of each
   pixel in the field of view.
   In this paper, we present several modern applications of these modern
   types of hemispheric lenses. Recently, surveillance and security
   applications have been proposed and published in Security and Defence
   symposium. However, modern hemispheric lens call be used in many other
   fields. A panoramic imaging sensor contributes most to the perception of
   the world. Panoramic lenses are now ready to be deployed in many optical
   solutions. Covered applications include, but are not limited to medical
   imaging (endoscope, rigiscope, fiberscope...), remote sensing (pipe
   inspection, crime scene investigation, archeology...), multimedia
   (hemispheric projector, panoramic image...). Modem panoramic
   technologies allow simple and efficient digital image processing and the
   use of standard image analysis features (motion estimation,
   segmentation, object tracking, pattern recognition) in the complete 360o
   hemispheric area.}},

Title = {{Image restoration of an off-axis three-mirror anastigmatic optical
   system with wavefront coding technology}},
Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2008}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Wavefront coding technology can extend the depth of focus of a
   well-corrected three-mirror anastigmatic optical system by about ten
   times, but the image obtained directly by charge-coupled devices blurs
   at the same time. An effective image restoration must be applied to
   these blurred images. This paper describes an innovative method that
   restores the blurred image, which combines the optical design software
   and mathematical software. The point spread function of system with
   wavefront coding technology is quite different from the usual and
   difficult to simulate by a disk function or other simple function in
   most cases. The commercial optical design software is applied to obtain
   the point spread function. If a 1 X 1-pixel image with brightness 255 is
   set as the point source of a optical system, the result of calculation
   software using a ray tracing algorithm will itself be the digital point
   spread function. This is proven to be a simple and effective way to
   acquire the complicated point spread functions of unusual optical
   systems such as those using wavefront coding technology. A
   regularization factor and contrast-adjusting factors are introduced into
   the classical Wiener filter, which achieves good restored images: the
   root-mean-square error is less than 0.0193, while the peak signal-noise
   ratio is higher than 23.7. Some parameters of the filter can be adjusted
   so that the restored image is more suitable for evaluation by eye. It is
   also shown that a single filter can restore all the images within the
   extended depth of focus. (C) 2008 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{The wavefront coding technology is known as a system-level technology
   which can extend the depth of focus of optical system by innovative
   optical design and image restoration. This technology can control
   misfocus related aberrations including misfocus, astigmatism, and
   Petzval curvature, temperature-related misfocus in digital imaging
   systems. It can also help optical system tolerate more residual error in
   optical manufacturing and alignment besides misfocus. The brief
   introduction of wavefront coding technology and the wavefront coded TMA
   system under research is presented respectively in part I and part 2.
   The ``MTF similarity{''} is defined to describe the relationship among
   MTF at different position or different fields in the third part. It is
   also shown in this part that the MTF similarity of wavefront coded
   system is much higher than the normal system within a large range. In
   part 4 comparison between the origin system and the new system with
   wavefront coding technology is provided after multiple errors are
   introduced, from which it can be observed that the system with wavefront
   coding technology can tolerate much bigger error than origin system. The
   error tolerance is re-distributed according to a new criterion based on
   MTF similarity. If the MTF similarity is less than a certain value, it
   can be regarded that the system can tolerate the residual error. The new
   error tolerance is displayed and it is shown that the wavefront coding
   technology can also loosen the error distributing besides extended the
   depth of focus.}},

Abstract = {{Emergence of practical and collective common-sense knowledge in a
   scientific and technical community This paper looks at how a particular
   aspect of organizational cognitive processes develops. The work focuses
   on the interrelations between individual and collective knowledge by
   analyzing the social construction of the latter from a communicational
   perspective. A critical analysis of the practices in an environment
   marked by the heterogeneity of its fields of knowledge and domains of
   expertise was undertaken based on the results of observation conducted
   at a scientific and technical research center. These results validate
   the hypothesis that the construction and mobilization of knowledge
   within an organization's local entities are embodied in the different
   logics and contexts of a given activity. Individuals are confronted with
   their presuppositions and prerequisites regarding their activities and
   tacit knowledge when drawn to interact with one another. In this way,
   skills, reasoning and points of view enter into confrontation. This
   confrontation leads to the progressive search for solutions through the
   reinvestment of knowledge depending on the various contexts and
   difficulties encountered. By taking the different contexts of activities
   into consideration, this progressive search for solutions through the
   confrontation of different cultures and knowledge can become creative,
   or innovative. Prospective and retrospective dimensions, which require
   individuals to learn and share knowledge amongst themselves, are
   integrated into the progressive search for solutions. The communication
   processes between an organization's heterogeneous entities can therefore
   encourage the emergence of practical and collective common-sense
   knowledge.}},

   paper. This innovative combination of modalities allows users to
   continue using a paper calendar in the manner they are used to, whilst
   the ECA provides verbal notifications on what has been written in the
   calendar. Users may also ask questions such as ``When was I supposed to
   meet Sara?{''} or ``What's on my schedule today?{''}}},

Journal = {{POPULAR MUSIC AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{489-510}},
Abstract = {{Critical evaluations of audio mash-ups and remixes tend to congregate
   around two poles. On the one hand, these often clever re-combinations of
   recorded music are celebrated as innovative and creative interventions
   in the material of bland commodity culture. On the other hand, they are
   often reviled as derivative, inauthentic, and illegal because they do
   nothing more than appropriate and reconfigure the intellectual property
   of others. This essay does not side with either position but identifies
   and critiques the common understanding and fundamental assumptions that
   make these two, opposed positions possible in the first place. The
   investigation of this matter is divided into two main parts. The first
   considers the traditional understanding of technologically enabled
   reproduction and the often unquestioned value it invests in the concept
   of originality. It does so by beginning with a somewhat unlikely source,
   Plato's Phaedrus-a dialogue that, it is argued, articulates the original
   concept of originality that both determines and is reproduced in the
   theories and practices of sound recording. The second part of the essay
   demonstrates how the audio mash-up deliberately intervenes in this
   tradition, advancing a fundamental challenge to the original
   understanding and privilege of originality. In making this argument,
   however, the essay does not endeavor to position the mash-up as anything
   unique or innovative. Instead, it demonstrates how mash-ups, true to
   their thoroughly derivative nature, plunder, reuse, and remix anomalies
   that are already available in and constitutive of recorded music.}},

Abstract = {{Alone with fast urbanization, inefficient delivery of urban utilities
   and public services has become an issue of increasing concern in China.
   Many city governments are seeking governance innovation and testing new
   urban management patterns to enhance the performance of public services
   delivery. Stemming from the study on the digital urban management (DUM)
   program of Chaoyang District in Beijing, an information-driven urban
   performance management approach, the research analyzed the
   administrative structure, achievement and limitation of this new
   management pattern. From historical perspective, DUM has brought great
   benefits to urban management performance. DUM enhanced the
   responsiveness of city departments and agencies at operational level.
   This approach reinvented the administrative process and separated
   supervision from urban management by establishing independent
   supervision centre. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of DUM is limited
   for lack of institutional arrangements such as commitment from political
   leadership, efficient channels for citizen participation, dedicated
   staff for data analysis, continuous review of data, linking data to
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Middle and High schools together with Colleges get increasingly involved
   with international programs to prepare Chinese students for foreign
   Universities. The context of a private school is very interesting to
   capture the complex nature of the Educational Technologies adoption

   to ICT adoption in schools is mainly a question of Risk Management and
   Reliability of control procedures. This case study will describe the
   relationship of school students to both ICT and ESL. It will draw a few
   guidelines toward improving creativity, the spirit of innovation and
   excellence for all walks of life. This paper will be very helpful for
   Educators, School administrators, Educational policy makers and ESL
   teachers in China and other fast developing countries. It will also shed
   light on a strange situation affecting the academic sector. It will

Abstract = {{Using mobile devices for exploring and interacting with the user's
   physical environment is among the most promising candidates for
   commercially successful future telecommunication services and
   applications. This trend is confirmed by the rollout of latest mobile
   phones equipped with advanced navigation features like built-in GPS
   receivers, digital compasses and acceleration sensors. The increasing
   technological potential of Mobile Spatial Interaction (MSI), however,
   requires a wider comprehension of appropriate visualization
   possibilities for spatially referenced content in the field of Mobile
   Human-Computer Interaction.
   In this paper, we argue for an integrated approach comprising
   innovations in MSI with latest advances in visualization. In order to
   demonstrate the potential of this joint approach, we present a series of
   three related projects and highlight in each case research challenges
   and results in the field of Mobile HCI and mobile application

Abstract = {{In a software-defined GPS receiver (SGR), the carrier synchronization
   typically adopts arctangent or its approximations as the phase
   discriminator because it maximizes SNR for analog signal cases. However,
   for few-bits ADC which are always used to implement a real-time SGR,
   this method greatly reduces the accuracy of phase estimate because of
   the significant quantization error, e. g., greater than 2 dB in power
   degradation for 1-bit ADC {[}1]{[}2].
   In this paper, a novel phase discriminator based on pure digital
   approach is implemented in 1-bit ADC SGR. It can be shown that the novel
   phase discriminator achieves one-order higher accuracy on phase estimate
   than traditional arctangent method under high SNR environment. In
   addition, the proposed phase discriminator is combined with a post
   correlator phase compensation (PCPC) structure to address the navigation
   bit transition issue throughout tracking stage. The real GPS data is
   tested on our self-developed SGR to verify the feasibility of the
   combined structure. The less computational load than that of APD and
   higher accuracy than other typical phase discriminators approximating
   APD, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed phase discriminator in
   SGR implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The last decades have been characterized by extremely intense
   digitization - in the shape of investments in administrative and
   embedded IT together with advanced Internet solutions - as regards
   companies and organizations worldwide. Today, however, most
   establishments are already highly digitized, which affects the
   conditions for work and organizations' forms and functions.
   Thus, based on an empirical investigation of the health care sector,
   this paper addresses the notion of the post digitization era through
   specifically examining IT-based reward systems. This. of course, is not
   a novel phenomenon, but new ways of using the reward system concept -
   together with IT and original ideas - in order to increase efficiency,
   effectiveness, and productivity are considered. This, in turn, might
   have great implications concerning core strategies and the organization
   of work. In order to fulfill the paper's purpose of identifying possible
   benefits and risks associated with digital reward systems, especially in
   health care, a case study built on semi-structured interviews was
   performed.
   The findings of this study indicate that there are several possible
   fields of innovative application - including both developments of
   existing solutions and potential future utilizations - concerning
   digital reward systems in health care. Moreover, in order for reward
   system implementations to be successful, organizations have to define,
   measure, valuate and evaluate input, output and performance
   appropriately, and the process of doing so is also affected by the
   present stage of digitization. This too is contemplated throughout the
   paper. Finally, important associated matters such as risk-reward
   trade-offs and quantity versus quality are discussed.
   The results presented in this paper are based on a limited material.
   Still, they are valuable and original because of the empirical
   foundation derived from an important industry/sector. Furthermore, they
   illustrate modern implications of reward systems in highly digitized
   contexts, and put forth novel views on possible fields of application of
   IT-based reward systems, and associated potential benefits and risks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports how digital technologies can be successfully
   incorporated into traditional teaching programmes to support the
   learning of a new generation of learners. The paper describes two
   e-learning tools, in part one it describes the introduction of LessonLab
   an innovative e-learning venture with preservice teachers. This
   web-based platform called LessonLab used with six cohorts of preservice
   teachers approximately 600 students, of whom 25\% participated in this
   evaluation. A special feature of this platform is its ability to house
   streaming video and a range of digital video analysis functions.
   Research was conducted to determine the effectiveness of this use of
   digital technology. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained from
   participants, which revealed that the majority of participants benefited
   from this use of technology to support their learning. Part two of the
   paper describes a new application developed by one of the authors. This
   application called Artichoke is a cost effective digital video analysis
   tool, which can be used in research and teaching applications. These
   studies have relevance for all educators who are keen to use technology
   to promote effective learning and thinking for today's' learners.}},

   concerned by innovators, especially for those of digital information
   products. The innovation products easily to be pirated generally have an
   important nature of network externalities, which may influence the

   develops mathematical models to describe the interrelationship of an
   original innovation product and its piracy product, for analyzing the
   copyright protection strategy for innovation products with network
   externalities. The study shows that network externalities might change
   the nature of the interrelationship between an original innovation
   product and its piracy product from competition to mutualism, which will
   influence the market shares of both products, and the success or failure
   of innovation further. According to the study, this paper also analyzes
   and suggests the copyright protection strategy for innovation products.}},

Abstract = {{South Africa is an emerging democracy, with characteristics of both a
   developed and developing country. Although the South African government
   has innovated in many ways to improve service delivery to its citizens,
   in the area of narrowing the `digital divide', developed countries
   remain the leaders. Nevertheless, some of the initiatives involve
   state-of-the-art technology, which places South Africa (SA) amidst the
   most progressive countries in terms of e-Government initiatives. This
   paper provides an overview of e-Government initiatives undertaken by the
   South African government. The paper cites two cases of where
   e-Government initiatives are currently undertaken. Cape Online Strategy,
   which is an e-Government initiative by the provincial government of the
   Western Cape in SA, is an example of a global trend towards greater
   levels of interactivity between government and citizens. This initiative
   is an excellent example of how Web-based solutions can be used to
   deliver certain services to citizens. Another excellent example is an
   eJustice initiative undertaken by the Department of Justice. The
   initiative aims at promoting a more efficient system of Justice in SA.
   The purpose of the eJustice programme is to reform and modernize the
   administration and delivery of Justice through the re-engineering of
   work processes using enabling technologies. The paper also provides an
   evaluation of where e-Government currently stands in SA. In evaluating
   e-Government in SA, the paper also compares SA to North America and
   Canada. There are a number of factors that have contributed to the
   success of e-Government initiatives in SA. For example, it enjoys strong
   political support from government. However, there are also challenges
   that impact on the progress and success of e-Government, such as the
   persistent lack of infrastructure in rural and semi-rural areas in SA.
   The SA government would therefore need to make a more comprehensive
   effort, so that citizens can benefit from the circle of technological
   transformation for service delivery.}},

Abstract = {{An automated system to manage records has become a shopping list item
   for many organisations. In the public sector this trend has been largely
   driven by the introduction of laws, regulations and standards relating
   to records management and the provision of accurate corporate records
   augmented by the fact that records are increasingly `born-digital'
   rather than paper-based. Despite their increasing popularity as solution
   providers, successful uptake of Electronic Document and Records
   Management Systems (EDRMS) is not yet widespread and research into their
   implementation is still limited. This paper supplements the small number
   of published EDRMS case studies with a detailed review of a recent
   implementation by a local government authority in South Australia. We
   then describe the recent use of Leximancer (TM) a software application,
   to identify ten key success factors from the EDRMS literature by Nguyen
   et al (2008) and conclude by illustrating how researchers can apply this
   instrument for additional quantitative analysis of their case study
   data.}},

Abstract = {{For many years there has been Much talk about intellectual property
   right (IPR) from many persons in various disciplines of innovation.
   Intellectual abilities are an asset that is of significance to any
   society. However, one of the main issues associated with piracy is that
   it hinders innovation. The basic concept behind this statement is that
   when a firm knows that its products or services will be pirated and
   distributed in the market they have less incentives to be innovative
   because less capital can be spent in R\&D. But in reality, is this
   really the fact from a bigger perspective or does it provide a potential
   catalyst that companies Should see as a source that fuels innovation? It
   seems, however, the sector of the industry that is most affected by
   piracy are the most innovative in digital goods and uses the pirate's
   ideas for creation of legitimate business: software, games, movies and

Abstract = {{The paper presents and empirically tests a framework of service
   innovation systems capable of studying interactions between users,
   service providers, contents developers and network providers in the
   digital contents (DC) industry. The framework is tested against a case
   study that traces the growth of the online game industry in Korea since
   its introduction. From the results of this application, the framework is
   developed into an innovation model of the DC industry. The model offers
   several advantages over other approaches in understanding the dynamics
   in the DC industry. Most importantly, it provides a single unified basis
   within which to analyze both service innovation resulting from users and
   publishers as well as manufacturing innovation induced by contents
   developers, platform holders and network providers. The distinction
   between service and manufacturing innovation is important in many ways,
   for instance in selecting proper government policy tools for promotion
   or regulation of the DC industry. Second, the model clarifies impacts of
   network externalities that are characteristics of the DC industry,
   Third, the Korean online game industry has experienced both radical
   innovation during the beginning period and non-radical innovation
   throughout the maturation period. The model developed herein is able to
   illustrate several types of non-radical innovations that are crucial to
   the sustainable development of the DC industry.}},

Abstract = {{The UK e-voting policy is an integral component of the strategy to
   modernise the electoral system to afford choice and flexibility to the
   electorate. The policy is being introduced via local government through
   a series of voluntary pilot schemes designed to test the new technology,
   and local authorities become involved in this policy process at the
   implementation stage when they are invited to participate in the pilot
   programme. This paper is based on qualitative research into the
   implementation of the UK government's e-voting policy as this innovation
   is introduced into the local government system. It argues that, as the
   essence of diffusion is communication, there needs to be a revised
   strategy to consider the diffusion of the policy at an earlier stage in
   the process.
   The findings are based on interviews with the Chief Executive of the
   Association of Electoral Administrators and with Electoral Officers who
   did not participate in the most comprehensive pilot programme conducted
   in 2003. They establish an overview of the administration of e-voting
   and identify the reasons why local authorities did not volunteer for
   that pilot programme. The analysis draws on Anderson's model of the
   public policy process, to identify the stage at which local government
   becomes involved in the policy process, and Rogers' model of the
   diffusion of innovations, to demonstrate the UK government's failure to
   understand the need to consider a diffusion strategy.
   The results suggest that the UK government fails to appreciate the
   benefits of cohesion between the public policy process and the diffusion
   process, and that the likelihood of the adoption of public policies
   concerned with the introduction of technological innovations would be
   enhanced by the formulation of a revised public policy model. This
   revised model recognises that policy implementation needs to be
   considered throughout the policy process as it amalgamates the heuristic
   public policy process model and the diffusion of innovations model
   incorporating selected diffusion concepts at the formulation stage of
   the linear policy process.}},

Abstract = {{There is little disagreement in the doctrine that we live in extremely
   changing and innovative societies. Nowadays, the information technology
   is getting more and more accessible, complex and secure, changing the
   well-established traditions of modern societies. In many democratic
   states, electronic-government represents an answer to the request of
   reducing the cost of the decisional process. However, the new
   administration requires not only an innovative solution, but
   ``intelligent citizens{''} to make use of it. Recent studies show that
   e-government has developed five stages, each of them reflecting the
   degree of technical sophistication and of interaction with the users:
   simple information dissemination (one-way communication), two-way
   communication, service and financial transactions, integration
   (horizontal and vertical), and political participation. Starting from
   this model, the present research evaluates the stage of urban
   e-government within Romania, and identifies its influencing variables.
   All existing sites of urban local administration - 165 cities - are
   analyzed through the perspective of both digital government (public
   services through internet) and digital democracy (citizens'
   participation to the governing process through internet). Despite the
   fact that literature regarding e-government is continuously developing,
   the number of empirical researches worldwide is relatively a small one.
   The evaluation of Romanian local e-government is a national premiere and
   will enlist Romania among those where a comprehensive evaluation has
   been made. Finally, alternative future researches on variables that
   influence Romanian e-government performance are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations are an essential factor of competition for manufacturing
   companies in technical industries. Patent information plays an important
   role for innovation-processes and innovators in the knowledge
   management.
   The combination of cross-organisational spread information and resources
   from patent databases and digital libraries is necessary in order to
   gain profit for innovation experts. The central challenge is to overcome
   the current information deficit and to fulfil the information need of
   the experts in the innovation-process.
   Classical information retrieval (IR) research has been dominated by the
   system-oriented view in the past. A user formulates a query and then
   evaluates the elements found through the query according to their
   relevance. But this rather static setting does not always correspond to
   the communication and interaction needs of humans. IR systems should
   explicitly support also the cognitive abilities of the users in order to
   realize a dynamic dialogue between the user and the system. An
   information dialogue which does not only support an individual query but
   also the complete search process is necessary. Only in this way is it
   possible to satisfy an information need and support the
   innovation-process.
   In this paper we present in detail three innovation scenarios to
   highlight the challenges of advanced information systems, query
   reusability and result visualisation. By defining the essential
   activities and conditions of a search task, it is possible to develop
   user interfaces which offer assistance in the form of a connection of
   dialogues. From this we derive the elementary information sets and
   activities in the next step. An example illustrates the applicability
   and utility of the innovation scenarios described and shows how the
   activities satisfy the user's information dialogue context. As part of
   the example we apply a cognitive walkthrough on a patent database.
   Aiming for an implementation of Daffodil-System we will benefit from
   these results.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of Knowledge Ecosystem (KE) is used to define a community of
   practice that builds knowledge in a bottom-up, networked and dynamic
   fashion. These features define a new kind of digital ecosystem that is
   domain specific and operate in an open (virtual or real) world. The
   openness is an ideal situation that needs to apply the unified
   standards, for instance the Semantic Web Standards and Rules and Web 3.0
   that help the building, growth, sharing and forgetting of knowledge
   across the Knowledge Ecosystems.
   What makes the KE different from the ``classic{''} view upon the digital
   ecosystem is an active and dynamic process that involves:
   the creation of knowledge;
   the intentional elicitation of knowledge;
   the ability of share knowledge across the entities; and
   the possibility to depreciate and forget knowledge.
   How does the dynamic nature of knowledge influence the nature of
   knowledge ecosystems? What are the general principles that can be
   applied to design the sound and enduring knowledge ecosystems? These are
   some of the questions will try to get answers in our paper work.
   First of all, we will show that the dynamic evolution of knowledge and
   the dynamic character of the flows of knowledge are essential for the
   transition from digital ecosystems to knowledge ecosystems. Having a
   static collection of pieces of knowledge, processing them and placing
   them in a digital ecosystem are not really enough for this one to
   becomes a knowledge ecosystem. Continuous knowledge creation is
   responsible for transforming the digital ecosystem in a knowledge one.
   The process of dynamic knowledge building occurs when internal (tacit)
   knowledge becomes external (explicit). The continuously feedbacks that
   operate between internal and external knowledge are producing new
   knowledge among entities and create the energy and permanent innovation
   that characterizes a knowledge ecosystem.
   In the second part of the paper we've draw some general principles of
   accelerating the apparition of new knowledge ecosystems, while in the
   third section we define the main features of the knowledge healthcare
   ecosystem design for the home rehabilitation of people with motor
   disabilities. In order to do so, we are going to extract from these
   general principles the specific in-rules that make the agents involved
   in home health rehabilitation to act as a knowledge ecosystem. Alongside
   the theoretical approach of our paper (that refers to the principles'
   establishing), this brings also the practical one.
   We conclude the paper work with some remarks on the KE's role and
   importance in healthcare, and in particular in home rehabilitation
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Modern commerce stimulates retail expansion. In Romania this market
   finds itself in a continuous expansion as can be seen in the growth
   registered every year. This phenomena is sustained, most of all, by the
   increasing number of superstores and supermarkets. In the same time
   mentalities change and people become more and more receptive to what the
   market has to offer. Therefore it is necessary to answer the needs of
   the market with innovative measures, in order to sustain a new approach
   of the selling process for all companies acting in retail. Combining
   classical methods and new advanced tools, we intend to show non
   conventional ways to improve sales management for Romanian retail
   companies, having as a starting point the Western-European Experience.
   In the present conditions of the market, businesses need to use powerful
   instruments for decision making, instruments that can capture, process
   and display a real image of the reality. This action needs to be done
   through modeling processes, in a suggestive manner as to obtain a
   spatial representation of the market's characteristics.
   The new tools to be taken into consideration are computer based
   solutions known as Geographical Information Systems (GIS), which are
   used successfully in USA and in Western European Countries for market
   analysis of any kind.
   A digital map (and the associated thematic database) becomes a way in
   which spatial data, sophisticated spatial analysis and display
   procedures can be integrated. By representing and identifying the
   reality on a map it is possible to show tendencies and traits which
   cannot be revealed easily using only usual data sets and table displays.

Abstract = {{Virtual worlds and social networks in general are emerging phenomena
   which can benefit from information in the real world. For example, since
   its introduction in 2003. Second Life has grown explosively, and today
   is inhabited by nearly 10 million residents from around the globe.
   A,fair number of the residents make part of or their entire real world
   living by running business on Second Life. Communications in this vast
   digital continent happen between avatars and make use of web facilities.
   Leveraging context aware capabilities such as presence, location,
   identity, anchored in the real world opens monetizing opportunities for
   the service providers. Services on the real word were mashed with Second
   Life used here as a typical example of a 3D virtual world. The authors
   present in this paper how the integration of these two worlds was
   achieved. This integration leveraged rapid application prototyping,
   development and deployment and brings the potential of a dramatic
   reduction in service lifecycle costs.}},

Abstract = {{Memories and microprocessors improvements rely on the continued scaling
   in silicon based CMOS technologies known as ``Moore's{''} law. However,
   new classes of products are emerging that provide additional value based
   on functional innovation and diversification instead of scaling. This
   functional diversification is being called ``More-than-Moore{''}.
   Product innovation in ``More-than-Moore{''} technologies is
   differentiated by circuit design, architecture, embedded software and
   unique process technology. These innovations enable the use of older,
   proven technologies in highly reliable products. This approach allows
   for non-digital functions such as RF, power control, passive components,
   sensors and actuators to migrate from the system board level into a
   package level (SiP) or chip level (SoC) implementation. The objective of
   ``More-than-Moore{''} is to incorporate digital and non-digital
   functionality into compact systems. ``More-than-Moore{''} technologies
   are application specific and focus on the interface between the
   ``Analog{''} and the digital world. In this paper we will discuss the
   applications of ``More-than-Moore{''} concept and its utility in real
   life.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an innovative design method for digital jacquard textile
   under layered-combination mode is introduced. Directly borrowed from
   layered design method of digital image and corresponding color theory,
   this innovative design method theoretically can be divided into two
   parts, colorless mode and colorful mode. Based on the design method of
   full-color compound structure invented specially for layered-combination
   design mode, several colorless single-layer structures can be combined
   to form a compound structure that enables digital jacquard fabric to
   express an inimitable digital effect of mega-level mixed colors. The
   results of study are not only of tremendous benefit to developing
   digital jacquard fabric toward the fulfillment of ever-demanding
   requirement of today's fabric creation, but also the possibility of
   opening creative horizon and aesthetical dimension for jacquard fabric

Abstract = {{The new programming technologies allow for the creation of components
   which can be automatically or manually assembled to reach a new
   experience in knowledge understanding and mastering or in getting skills
   for a specific knowledge area. The project proposes an interactive
   framework that permits the creation, combination and utilization of
   components that are specific to mathematical training in high schools.
   The main framework's objectives are:
   authoring lessons by the teacher or the students; all they need are
   simple operating skills for Equation Editor (or something similar, or
   Latex); the rest are just drag \& drop operations, inserting data into a
   grid, or navigating through menus
   allowing sonorous presentations of mathematical texts and solving hints
   (easier understood by the students)
   offering graphical representations of a mathematical function edited in
   Equation
   storing of learning objects in a database
   storing of predefined lessons (efficient for expressions and commands,
   the rest being calculations; allows a high compression)
   viewing and/or modifying predefined lessons, according to the curricula
   The whole thing is focused on a mathematical expressions minicompiler,
   storing the code that will be later used for different purposes (tables,
   graphics, and optimisations).
   Programming technologies used. A Visual C\# .NET implementation is

Title = {{Personalised information services using a hybrid recommendation method
   based on usage frequency}},
Journal = {{PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{436-447}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper seeks to describe a personal recommendation service
   (PRS) involving an innovative hybrid recommendation method suitable for
   deployment in a large-scale multimedia user environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed hybrid method partitions
   content and user into segments and executes association rule mining,
   collaborative filtering, and contents popularity algorithms over various
   combinations of content partitions and user groups. The process results
   in recommended content for end-users based on the linear combination of
   candidate data sets.
   Findings - This study reveals that: the use of usage frequency is an
   effective way to analyse user's behaviour patterns and their selection
   of content, the partitioning of content and users into meaningful groups
   and the identification of optimal parameter values of constituent
   recommendation methods, yields successful results in the implementation;
   the hybrid method performs better than any constituent methods in most
   evaluation metrics.
   Practical implications - The PRS system serves as a useful reference for
   electronic libraries or information centres considering the development
   of personalised information services.
   Originality/value - The PRS system is designed and implemented to work
   efficiently in the large-scale multimedia User environment. It can also
   be applied to small and medium-scale environments or mobile platforms.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the diffusion and adoption process of an
   electronic service delivery innovation, which can be seen as an example
   of e-policing-called SMS-alert-among Dutch police forces. It is not only
   important to pay attention to the question how an innovation has spread
   - and the factors and mechanisms that stimulated or frustrated this
   process - but also to the reasons why an innovation has spread.
   Therefore, it is important to look at what kind of different meanings
   organizations attach to an innovation, especially in a public sector
   context. This research shows that functional, political and
   institutional patterns of meaning should be taken into account. In this
   case, the functional and political meaning dominated the appreciation of
   the innovation, although elements of the institutional meaning also
   played a role. Furthermore, the case shows that it is important to look
   at the-in diffusion studies underexposed-influence of diffusion policies
   and strategies, which have been conducted.}},

   Generator, a tool to simplify and automatise the Digital Library

   and modifying such a fundamental component. This tool models its issue
   as a generic search problem that can easily be adapted to different
   application scenarios. In particular, to guarantee its extensibility we
   carefully identify, isolate and organise the VDL Generator constituents,
   i.e. (i) the set of logical components that can be used when designing a
   Digital Library, (ii) the set of physical components that by
   implementing the logical components contribute to implement the Digital
   Library and (iii) the search strategy exploited to accomplish the
   generation task. Furthermore, we report on the experiences matured in
   implementing and exploiting such an innovative service in the context of
   the DILIGENT EU funded project and discuss future plans for its

Abstract = {{Agility, or the ability to respond quickly and effectively to market
   demands has become an important competitive tool in the manufacturing
   industry. Firms deploying global sourcing strategies have to balance the
   benefits of cost-effectiveness against the limitations of off shore
   productions. Improving supply chain performance is a key to achieving
   cost effectiveness, and the improvement largely depends upon the degree
   to which uncertainty can be reduced in the supply chain. This paper
   conducts a case study of Apple as it moves into the arena of digital
   content delivery and initiates hardware innovations in an industry that
   is characterized by increasing product variety, new technologies, price
   erosion, and fast inventory turn-overs. The purpose of this paper is to
   explore Apple's supply chain and some of the challenges it has faced in
   agilely managing its offshore manufacturing in facing demand. Secondly,
   the paper also explores the manoeuvering, shift of power and change of
   roles within the supply chain as it moves into the arena of digital
   content delivery. As a result of our study, we reach the conclusion that
   the traditional suppliers in the media content industry are yet to make
   the transition in mind to becoming pure digital players. As more and
   more consumers make a complete switch to digital media and become used
   to not owning physical media, the suppliers who retain control through
   copyrights fall back on strategies that reflect the workings of the
   non-digital era. Successful companies stand to face the dual task of
   changing the mindset of its suppliers on one band, and meeting and
   setting up an uncharted path for its customers in digital content in a
   pioneering role for the industry on the other. We find that while
   managing the supply chain in the traditional `non-e' market provides
   challenges related to cost-effectiveness and physical barriers, in the
   `e' marketplace managing the supply chain encounters barriers not
   physical but rather strategic that is entrenched in more traditional
   operating modes.}},

Booktitle = {{REVERSE ENGINEERING: AN INDUSTRIAL PERSPECTIVE}},
Series = {{Springer Series in Advanced Manufacturing}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, advanced reverse engineering (RE) techniques have been
   developed to convert point cloud data, obtained through digitization (by
   contact or noncontact scanning), into CAD models either in NURBS or STL
   (triangular mesh) format. These CAD models can be subsequently used for
   fabrication by using either conventional material removal methods (e.g.,
   milling) or material incremental methods, i.e., rapid prototyping (RP).
   On the other hand, as a nonconventional fabrication method, RP has been
   gaining greater popularity in industry recently due to its capability of
   creating three-dimensional (3-D) parts with complex geometries.
   Typically, the CAD model in the STL format is first sliced into 2-D
   layers before RP fabrication can be carried out. The fabrication
   efficiency and accuracy are directly affected by the thickness of the
   layers.
   Recently, there has been much research on developing adaptive slicing
   techniques to determine the minimum number of layers required under an
   allowable shape error. Unrtil now, the modeling algorithms developed in
   RE and adaptive slicing algorithms in RP are quite capable of handling
   problems in their own domains. When using RP to fabricate a part based
   on its point cloud data, the RE modeling and RP slicing algorithms are
   used sequentially. This, however, can result in serious problems in
   error control because in either of the two processes, shape error is
   controlled within the given tolerance band independently. Therefore, the
   shape error between the finally fabricated part and the original point
   cloud data cannot be controlled effectively. To solve this problem, the
   RE modeling process and the RP slicing process must be integrated by
   following a model-for-RP approach.
   This chapter focuses on issues in RE for direct RP by describing an
   innovative modeling method that slices the point cloud directly along
   the part building direction and generates a layer-based model (RP model)
   that can be used directly for fabrication by RP techniques. With this
   method, the integration of RE and RP in shape-error control can be
   effectively achieved. Furthermore, the slicing algorithm is also
   adaptive; thus the RP model generated has a minimum number of layers.
   Issues discussed include cloud data filtering, 2-D curve generation from
   point cloud data, and optimal layer thickness. Finally, the efficacy of
   the algorithms is demonstrated by several case studies.}},

   expensive, in terms of development costs, power consumption,

Abstract = {{Telecommunication systems based on wireless technology (Wi-Fi, WiMax,
   Sat DVB-RCS, etc.) offer more than others systems, the opportunity to
   provide a wide range of broadband services and applications. There are

   of need of communications such as, for example, for communication
   restoration during emergencies and catastrophic events as well as for
   communication services deployment in rural suburban areas typically
   affected by ``digital divide{''}.
   This paper presents a proposal for an unique integrated wireless network
   system, mainly based on TCP-IP protocol, which provides a wide range of
   applications like voice, video, internet browsing, data access, etc.

   of the TENS. The innovation consists in using FPGA digital programmable
   components instead of the traditional electronic components. Prototypes
   on electronic boards with FPGA components and analogical devices will be
   realized in order to validate the methods of stimulations used. The
   choice of FPGA circuits compared to ASICS ones is explained by the
   reduced number of devices using these kinds of circuits in the world.
   The achieved model should be portable with low consumption and small
   dimension. The advantage of the FPGA circuits used in this project
   consists in changing the impulse parameters provided to the patient
   without changing the electronics of the device. There will be only the
   program stored in the memory of the system to modify. This stimulator
   will thus have the advantage of being evolutionary and adapted to the
   medical discoveries related to the anti-pain remedies by electric
   stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal oxidation of an M-rich AlGaAs buried layer is a common
   established technique used to improve the performances of some
   optoelectronic devices, like VCSEL or optical waveguides, in terms of
   electro-optical confinement. This oxidation technique is usually
   proceeding laterally, which allows achieving good results but leads to
   some difficulties on the control of the shape and size of the oxidized
   areas. In this work, a new technology to oxidize GaAs/AlAs epitaxial
   structures which avoids these limitations is presented. This method
   consists of an oxidation through the top of the sample, allowing in
   consequence a total control of the shape of oxidation by means of
   photolithography. For this purpose the method has two steps: first, the
   intentional creation of defects in the top GaAs layer, in order to make
   it possible the oxidant species diffusion through this material, and
   second the planar oxidation of the AlAs layer. In this paper this
   technique is thoroughly studied: different methods to create defects in
   the GaAs layer have been analysed, and the optimization of the procedure
   has been achieved leading to a uniform oxidation and a reduced lateral
   oxidation spreading. Finally a comparison between the experiments and
   simulations has been realized in order to provide an explanation for
   this type of vertical oxidation. This innovating technique allows
   addressing separately the electrical and optical operating aspects of
   optoelectronic devices, thus opens to novel structures with controlled
   transverse optical behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper seeks to describe an innovative new technology for
   digitizing the shapes of 3D objects quickly and accurately, which uses
   accordion fringe interferometry (AFI).
   Design/methodology/approach - Laser beams cast fringe patterns on
   objects, a digital camera captures images and software constructs point
   clouds of data. A software package then analyzes the point cloud to
   extract information such as dimensions or variations in shape for
   subsequent operations.
   Findings - The AN approach has already been applied to a number of
   applications such as: inspection of jet engine airfoils, repair of
   composite structures and inspection of very delicate objects.
   Practical implications - Point cloud digital shape scanning will find an
   ever increasing number of applications which will benefit from this
   fast, accurate and non-contact three-dimensional digitizing technology.
   Originality/value - Users now have a totally new means for capturing
   dense, three-dimensional data.}},

   infective algorithm was used to fill the center of edge closed bubble in
   the binary image. The modified infective algorithm was applied to the
   binary images with ringent bubbles in this paper, which make up for the
   disadvantage of the simple infective algorithm. The area and the
   geometric center of the bubble were acquired from the filled image. Then
   the track of bubble rising was acquired by the geometric center.

   For the creation and the implementation of these editions the latest
   developments within corpus research have been taken into account. The
   digital editions of the historical literary journals ``Die Fackel{''}
   (published by Karl Kraus in Vienna from 1899 to 1936) and ``Der

   have been developed within the corpus research framework of the ``AAC -
   Austrian Academy Corpus{''} at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in
   collaboration with other researchers and programmers in the AAC from
   Vienna together with the graphic designer Anne Burdick from Los Angeles.
   For the creation of these scholarly digital editions the AAC edition
   philosophy and edition principles have been applied whereby new corpus
   research methods have been made use of for questions of computational
   philology and textual studies in a digital environment. The examples of
   the digital online editions of the literary journals ``Die Fackel{''}

   literature before taking a look at a university intervention in ICT for
   development in a small rural community in Yola, Northeastern Nigeria.
   The African Center for ICT Innovation and Training, an American
   University of Nigeria community engagement initiative is used as a case
   study to gauge its importance as an ICT resource center for the
   community and for small businesses and whether applied skills in
   information technology for university faculty and staff taught at the
   Center is leading to more productivity. The Yola and Jimeta Communities
   are also surveyed to find out whether the activities of the Centre and
   its interventions on developing ICT competencies and capacity building
   is helping to bridge the digital divide and empowering the community,
   especially women.}},

Abstract = {{Experimentalists are familiar with the aliasing that happens in data
   acquisition when the sampling rate is less than twice the highest
   frequency of energy in the signal to be sampled. Much effort has been
   made using a combination of analog and digital filters to make sure that
   the higher frequencies are filtered out to avoid or minimize the effect
   of this aliasing. Much less talked about is the aliasing that occurs in
   modal parameter estimation, or curve-fitting, when the residual effects
   of out-of-band modes violate assumptions of the finite dimensional
   parametric model that the experimentalist uses to curve-fit the acquired
   digitized data. While the out-of-band energy has been filtered out of
   the now band-limited data, the tails, sometimes called residual
   flexibility and inertial restraint of the out of band modes, are still
   present in the data. This article looks at some classes of modal
   parameter estimation algorithms and shows by theory and example that the
   algorithms based on continuous time or Laplace domain formulations are
   superior to the discrete time domain or z domain models in that they
   give results that are not contaminated by the aliasing effect of these
   residuals.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel 3D display that can show any 3D contents in free
   space using laser-plasma scanning in the air. The laser-plasma
   technology can generate a point illumination at an arbitrary position in
   the free space. By scanning the position of the illumination, we can
   display a set of point illuminations in the space, which realizes 3D
   display in the space. This 3D display has been already presented in
   Emerging Technology of SIGGRAPH2006, which is the basic platform of our
   3D display project. In this presentation, we would like to introduce
   history of the development of the laser-plasma scanning 3D display, and
   then describe recent development of the 3D contents analysis and
   processing technology for realizing an innovative media presentation in
   a free 3D space. The one of recent development is performed to give
   preferred 3D contents data to the 3D display in a very flexible manner.
   This means that we have a platform to develop an interactive 3D contents
   presentation system using the 3D display, such as an interactive art
   presentation using the 3D display. We would also like to present the
   future plan of this 3D display research project.}},

Abstract = {{The article argues that we make best use of learning technologies if we
   begin with an understanding of educational problems, and use this
   analysis to target the solutions we should be demanding from technology.
   The focus is to address the issue from the perspective of teachers and
   lecturers (the `teaching community'), and to consider how they could
   become the experimental innovators and reflective practitioners who will
   use technology well. Teachers could become `action researchers',
   collaborating to produce their own development of knowledge about
   teaching with technology. For this to be possible, they must be able to
   share that knowledge, and the article proposes the use of an online
   learning activity management system as a way of capturing and sharing
   the pedagogic forms teachers design. An action research approach, like
   all research, needs a theoretical framework from which to challenge
   practice, and the article shows how teachers could use the
   conversational framework to design and test an optimally effective
   learning experience. Examples of `generic' learning designs illustrate
   how such an approach can help the teaching community rethink their
   teaching, collectively, and embrace the best of conventional and digital
   methods. In this way they will be more likely to harness technology to
   the needs of education, rather than simply search for the problems to
   which the latest technology is a solution.}},

Abstract = {{Internet access has an important impact on innovation, society
   development, and the economy of the country. The free connectivity to
   internet plays a vital part on government services, working practice,
   and efficiency of delivering various services to the country citizens.
   With the availability of cheap wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi,
   achieving country-wide free connectivity is not difficult and it has
   many advantages for the government as improves productivity, enhances
   country security, and creates knowledge-based society. The free
   connectivity also has advantages for the citizens of the country as it
   bridges digital divide, creates job opportunities, and motivates to
   develop a number of commercial business models. This paper explores the
   benefits of free internet access, business models, and policy
   implications through analysis of free Municipal Internet in United
   States and Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Information communication technologies (ICTs) have significantly
   revolutionized the travel industry in the last decade. E-tourism has
   been developed in travel industry in the world, which helps to realize
   digitalization of travel service process and value chains in travel
   industry, and has been used to evaluate the entire range of ICT
   application in tourism industry. E-tourism has developed variedly in
   different regions or countries. This research aims to examine how ICTs
   and Internet have impacted the travel industry in China. This study
   explores the current e-tourism development in China and examines the use
   of Internet in travel organizations. In addition, it investigates some
   issues related to the e-tourism development, including the drivers and
   barriers in e-commerce adoption from both travel organizations' and
   travelers' perspectives. The results indicate that in general China is a
   late-adopter as regards to the adoption of e-commerce in tourism
   industry. In China only a few innovative travel organizations are at the
   early adoption stage of Internet and have experienced the benefits and
   advantages of early-adopters. Though e-tourism has been a growing trend,
   travel agency still keeps the main travel service delivery channel in
   China. This study also suggests that travel organizations in China
   should learn from developed countries to know how to develop e-tourism
   and improve the competitiveness of tourism in China.}},

Abstract = {{Advance in technologies has revolutionized the traditional mode of
   teaching and learning. Various media authoring systems have been
   developed in order to enhance the effectiveness of learning and teaching
   processes by supplementing traditional teaching materials such as text
   books and lecture notes with interactive digital media. In this paper,
   we are going to discuss two media authoring systems, KooBits and Web 2.0
   Media Publisher, which incorporate creativity, innovation and
   cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and
   Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The major part of KooBits system
   is a client based e-book editor that is specifically designed to enhance
   interactivity, while Web 2.0 Media Publisher is a server based
   publishing platform. This paper describes various features, design
   consideration, implementation of KooBits and Web 2.0 Media Publisher,
   and compares them with other existing systems in terms of these aspects.
   Possible future developments for KooBits and some applications for Web
   2.0 Media Publisher are also being discussed in the end.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Puppetry is a hybrid art form that includes a broad range of
   creative practices. The current chapter explores real-time video
   montages and avatar control using wireless game controllers while
   exploring what is meant by the term digital puppet and raises issues
   surrounding the virtual and tangible body in performance. Real-time
   media objects are viewed as extensions to the human performer -
   sympathetic with the traditions and conventional definitions of
   puppetry.
   I document the workings of a prototype performance system made using
   Apple's innovative and free development tool Quartz Composer. It
   encompasses screen-based digital puppetry and scenography, mixed-reality
   video composites and custom software programming and the gestural
   control of an on-screen avatar using the popular game controller, the

   system is being developed within the EC-granted project DATAFORM
   (Digitally Adjustable Tooling for manufacturing of Aircraft panels using
   multi-point FORMing methodology, FP6-AERO-030877). The principle of the
   MPF technique is to employ two sets of height-adjustable punch matrices.
   Each punch in a matrix can be controlled by a robotic device to adjust
   its coordinates for shaping two discrete 3D tooling surfaces. Compared
   with traditional solid die forming, the MPF is for dieless forming. The
   DAT technology integrates the MPF technique with the CAD/CAE/CAT
   software to achieve the flexible forming and rapid fabrication of 3D
   panels through two processes of dieless press/stretch forming and
   jigless positioning assembly.}},

Journal = {{WIENER TIERARZTLICHE MONATSSCHRIFT}},

Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{9-10}},
Pages = {{226-234}},
Abstract = {{The term ``digital image management{''} refers to a rather young
   technology, offering useful and effective systems for the administration
   of digital image libraries. This publication discusses 2 main aspects of
   this field, the digitalization of analog image archives and the
   implementation of digital images into a clinically oriented image
   database. The results and suggestions can be very helpful for
   veterinarians, who use analog or digital images to document their
   clinical cases and work.
   Through the digital revolution the traditional, chemical photography was
   replaced by innovative digital photographic techniques. Additional
   digitalization of existing analog film materials as negatives or
   diapositives allows to use the key benefits of the digital technology
   also for older archive material. On one hand, digitalization offers the
   chance to improve image quality of the digital copy and on the other
   hand it makes image management (e.g. duplicating, processing, sending
   per e-mail) much easier. Additional, the digital copies can be
   administrated comfortably by a digital image data base. Digital storage
   makes it possible to save several copies of the valuable image data as
   well as preserving the copyright of the author by imprinting a digital
   copyright-signature in each file.
   The generated image-quality is affected by the chosen scanning system
   and the setup of the quality-related parameters like scan resolution and
   colour depth. The implementation of a colour-management system allows
   image analysis and fine adjusting, as it manages a consistent appearance
   of the images in different programs, displays and in prints.
   If the image quality of the analog originals is poor, the quality of the
   digital copies can be improved by the use of semiautomatic
   software-tools and a detailed manual adjustment. The chosen types of
   image-formats and their processing are additional determinant factors
   for image quality and the produced data volume.
   The embedding of digital pics into an image data base enables the
   efficient and comfortable administration of large image libraries
   containing thousands of files. The gobal market offers a wide range of
   different products, the multimedia database FotoStation Pro is an
   example for a reccomandable solution for veterinarians. FotoStation
   Profulfils the requirements of a clinical image database and is used
   successfully to manage the 13,000 images and video files of the Clinic
   for Ruminants at the University for Veterinary Medicine Vienna.
   The software is built on multiple modules, based on IPTC, an
   international standard for image caption, and offers a
   thesaurus-function as well as the opportunity to create an individual
   mask for an efficient workflow. To give an example, the image database
   at the Clinic for Ruminants uses 12 individual IPTC-fields and 2
   thesauri consisting of more than 3,000 keywords. Various functions make
   the tool helpful for all demands of image administration, one of the
   basic features allows to select a single image out of a million within a
   second and move it quickly into other windows-applications per
   drag-and-drop function.}},

Abstract = {{This paper details the Wireless@Virginia Tech--Center for Wireless
   Telecommunications' (CWT) design and implementation of its Smart Radio
   (SR) communication platform. The CWT SR can identify available spectrum
   within a pre-defined band, rendezvous with an intended receiver, and
   transmit voice and data using a selected quality of service (QoS). This
   system builds upon previous cognitive technologies developed by CWT for
   the public safety community, with the goal of providing a prototype
   mobile communications package for military and public safety First
   Responders. A master control (MC) enables spectrum awareness by
   characterizing the radio environment with a power spectrum sensor and an
   innovative signal detection and classification module. The MC also
   enables spectrum and signal memory by storing sensor results in a
   knowledge database. By utilizing a family radio service (FRS) waveform
   database, the CWT SR can create a new communication link on any
   designated FRS channel frequency using FM, BPSK, QPSK, or 8PSK
   modulations. With FM, it supports analog voice communications with
   legacy hand-held FRS radios. With digital modulations, it supports IP
   data services, including a CWT developed CVSD-based VoIP protocol. The
   CWT SR coordinates spectrum sharing between analog primary users and
   digital secondary users by applying a simple but effective
   channel-change protocol. It also demonstrates a novel rendezvous
   protocol to facilitate the detection and initialization of
   communications links with neighboring SR nodes through the transmission
   of frequency-hopped rendezvous beacons. By leveraging the GNU Radio
   toolkit, writing key modules entirely in Python, and utilizing the USRP
   hardware front-end, the CWT SR provides a dynamic spectrum test bed for
   future smart and cognitive radio research.}},

Abstract = {{For many foreseen applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for
   example monitoring the structural health of a bridge message integrity
   is a crucial requirement. Usually, security services such as message
   integrity are realized by symmetric cryptograph), only, because
   asymmetric cryptography is often stated is impracticable for WSN.
   However, the proposed solutions for symmetric key establishment
   introduce a significant computation, storage, and most important
   communication overhead. Digital signatures and key-exchange based oil
   asymmetric algorithms would be very valuable though. In the literature
   nearly only RSA and ECC are implemented and compared for sensor nodes,
   though there exist a variety of innovative asymmetric algorithms. To
   close this gap, we investigated the efficiency, and suit ability of
   digital signature algorithms based oil innovative asymmetric primitives
   for WSN. We chose XTR-DSA and NTRUSIGN and implemented both (as well as
   ECDSA) for MICAz motes.}},

Abstract = {{The design and implementation of an angular speed control loop for a
   universal rheometer is not a trivial task. The combination of a highly
   dynamic, very low inertia (drag cup) motor (motor inertia is 10(-5) kg
   m(2)) with samples which can range in viscosity from 10(-3) Pas to 10(8)
   Pas, which can be between purely viscous and higly viscoelastic, which
   can exhibit yield-stresses, etc. asks for a highly adaptive digital
   control loop.
   For the HAAKE MARS rotational rheometer a new adaptive control loop was
   developed which allows the control of angular speeds as low 5x10(-9)
   rad/s and response times a short as 10 ms. The adaptation of the control
   loop to ``difficult{''} samples is performed by analysing the response
   of the complete system to a short pre-test.
   In this paper we will show that the (very) short response times at
   (very) low angular speeds are not only achieved with ideal samples, but
   due to the adaptable control loop, also with ``difficult{''} samples. We
   will show measurement results on ``difficult{''} samples Re cosmetic
   creams and emulsions, a laponite gel, etc. to proof that angular speeds
   down to 10(-4) rad/s are reached within 10 ms to 20 ms and angular
   speeds down to 10(-7) rad/s within 1 s to 2 s. The response times for
   reaching ultra low angular speeds down to 5x10(-9) rad/s are in the
   order of 10 s to 30 s.
   With this new control loop it is, for the first time, possible to
   measure yield stresses by applying a very low constant shear-rate to the
   sample and measuring the torque response as a function of time.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been known to be
   associated with health and cognitive impacts for more than a century,

   Neuropsychological consequences in children with snoring or subtle
   breathing disturbances not meeting the traditional definition of sleep
   apnea suggest that ``benign, or primary snoring{''} may be clinically
   significant, and that the true prevalence of SDB might be
   underestimated. There is no standard definition of SlDB in children. The
   polysomnographic technology used in many sleep laboratories may be
   inadequate to diagnose serious but subtle forms of clinically important
   airflow limitation. in the last several years, advances in digital
   technology as well as new observational studies of respiratory and
   arousal patterns in large populations of healthy children have led to
   alternative views of what constitutes sleep-related breathing and
   arousal abnormalities that may refine our diagnostic criteria. This
   article reviews our knowledge of childhood SDB, highlights recent
   advances in technology, and discusses diagnostic and treatment
   strategies that will advance the management of children with pediatric
   SDB.}},

Abstract = {{Radiological imaging is progressing towards an all-digital future,
   across the spectrum of medical imaging techniques. Computed radiography
   (CR) has provided a ready pathway from screen film to digital
   radiography and a convenient entry point to PACS. This review briefly
   revisits the principles of modern CR systems and their physical imaging
   characteristics. Wide dynamic range and digital image enhancement are
   well-established benefits of CR, which tend themselves to improved image
   presentation and reduced rates of repeat exposures. However, in its
   original form CR offered limited scope for reducing the radiation dose
   per radiographic exposure, compared with screen film. Recent innovations
   in CR, including the use of dual-sided image readout and channelled
   storage phosphor have eased these concerns. For example, introduction of
   these technologies has improved detective quantum efficiency (DQE) by
   approximately 50 and 100\%, respectively, compared with standard CR. As
   a result CR currently affords greater scope for reducing patient dose,
   and provides a more substantive challenge to the new solid-state,
   flat-panel, digital radiography detectors. (c) 2007 The Royal College of

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the varied socio-economic implications of ICT-based
   educational change. Drawing from a rich, 3-year long research project
   with 20 secondary schools throughout Europe, the social, human,
   professional, institutional, and economic costs for building the school
   of tomorrow in close alliance with ICT are discussed. The aim of this
   paper is to show the real costs involved in such a comprehensive model
   of educational change, which cannot be reduced to the cost of installing
   computers in classrooms. Rather, it must aim at capturing the varied
   long-term requirements necessary for educational change in conjunction
   with ICT. Great emphasis is placed on questions concerning the very
   sustainability of innovation and the necessity to adopt a long-term
   perspective that provides us with a realistic socio-cconomic evaluation.
   We argue that the real costs of educational change only become apparent
   when short-term improvements have been converted into sustainable
   changes that last beyond a project's life-time. Key aspects for lasting
   contributions are identified, among which ``network building{''} and
   applying a ``bottom-up strategy{''} for change are given particular
   importance. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the cinematographic language claims for a specific type of
   interpretation and understanding. The emergence of the digital image and
   the innovative immersive reception devices provide new and diverse
   possibilities of reading and interacting within the filmic narrative.
   That is to say, cinema is constantly reinvented and explores potential
   renewals within the new interactive medias. This article reflects not
   only on the mutations of the filmic narrative, but also on its
   adaptation to interactivity. It proposes, also, new models of
   implementation, from traditional filmic narrative towards an interactive
   one. The experimental project Transparency illustrates it-it is a
   cinematographic project, which has the main goal of studying the
   interactive filmic narrative. An original plot has been created and
   adapted to an interactive narrative structure. The project is presented
   under the form of an installation allowing the spectators to choose the
   narrative sequences of the story. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An innovative digital-signal-processing method, which is aimed at
   detecting and evaluating I/Q impairments in radio-,frequency digital
   transmitters, is presented and validated. It takes advantage of a
   suitable clustering procedure that is capable of matching each symbol in
   the distorted I/Q diagram to its ideal position, even though concurrent
   and severe impairments disturb the standard functioning of the
   transmitter under test. Right identification of impairments, along with
   accurate evaluation of their amount, is then achieved through the
   application of original and straightforward measurement algorithms to
   the recovered symbols. The results of a number of experiments, which are
   conducted on quadrature-amplitude-modulation signals affected by the
   known I/Q impairments, show the superior performance of the proposed
   method over measurement techniques suggested by the European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute and alternative solutions already
   presented in literature. Further experiments conducted in the presence
   of interfering tones or phase jitter give evidence of the method's
   reliability also in critical measurement conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative approach for position estimation
   using traditional displacement inductive sensors such as linear variable
   transducers. In addition, the same algorithm offers an evaluation of
   velocity and acceleration. However, the same approach can be applied to
   any other kind of alternating-current-excited sensor. The proposed
   method overcomes the typical limit of traditional processing techniques
   as coherent demodulation or spectral analysis by implementing a least
   mean squares estimation of the variables of interest. A working
   prototype has been designed around a low-cost digital signal processor
   from Texas Instruments Inc., and an estimation time on the order of 1 ms
   has been obtained. In static conditions, the resolution is about 0.01 \%
   of the full scale of the considered sensor, which is on the same order
   as the one obtained with spectral estimation. In dynamic conditions,
   simulations show a performance improvement in position and velocity
   estimation with a sensible root mean square error (RMSE) reduction. The
   experimental results in dynamic conditions are difficult to quantify,
   owing to noise, even if the performances are better than with
   traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a reconfigurable platform for the real-time digital
   emulation of broadband copper access networks. The instrument, which
   uses hard real-time digital-signal-processing techniques on Xilinx
   Virtex II field-programmable gate arrays, is capable of accurately
   reproducing the physical layer of a digital subscriber line (DSL). The
   magnitude and the true phase of the insertion and return loss of the
   twisted pair access loop, which consists of cables with various
   characteristics and length, are digitally emulated over the full DSL
   bandwidth. The innovative character and advantages of digital emulation
   techniques over conventional analog loop emulation are demonstrated, and
   its performance is assessed using several test cases.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an innovative methodology for determining the quality of
   digital images. The method is based on measuring the variance of the
   expected entropy of a given image upon a set of predefined directions.
   Entropy can be calculated on a local basis by using a
   spatial/spatial-frequency distribution as an approximation for a
   probability density function. The generalized Renyl entropy and the
   normalized pseudo-Wigner distribution (PWD) have been selected for this
   purpose. As a consequence, a pixel-by-pixel entropy value can be
   calculated, and therefore entropy histograms can be generated as well.
   The variance of the expected entropy is measured as a function of the
   directionality, and it has been taken as an anisotropy indicator. For
   this purpose, directional selectivity can be attained by using an
   oriented 1-D PWD implementation. Our main purpose is to show how such an
   anisotropy measure can be used as a metric to assess both the fidelity
   and quality of images. Experimental results show that an index such as
   this presents some desirable features that resemble those from an ideal
   image quality function, constituting a suitable quality index for
   natural images. Namely, in-focus, noise-free natural images have shown a
   maximum of this metric in comparison with other degraded, blurred, or
   noisy versions. This result provides a way of identifying in-focus,
   noise-free images from other degraded versions, allowing an automatic
   and nonreference classification of images according to their relative
   quality It is also shown that the new measure is well correlated with
   classical reference metrics such as the peak signal-to-noise ratio. (C)

Abstract = {{During recent election campaigns non-partisan party profile websites
   (PPWs) have become hugely popular in various countries with multiparty
   systems, sometimes even attracting 25 percent of all voters. On these
   interactive websites, PPW users respond to policy questions, and their
   answers are used to calculate the distance between their own preferences
   and party agendas, resulting in an individualized `party profile'. PPWs
   can be seen as one of the few innovations in election campaigning that
   fully exploit the internet's interactive opportunities. The analysis in
   this article of the log files of 2003 and 2004 Belgian PPWs demonstrate
   that PPW users tend to be highly educated, male and young. Party and
   policy preferences of late PPW users (the final days before the
   elections) are not more crystallized than those of early PPW users (40
   days before the elections). The article concludes with speculation on
   what this finding might reveal about campaign dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{After several years of development, agricultural digital libraries in
   China have made great achievements in the acquisition and accessibility
   of documentation and information. However, many of their services focus
   on the indexing and transfer of inforination, based on a service concept
   as an agricultural information provider. As internet technology evolves
   from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, the manner in which information is produced,
   organised, and disseminated has changed. User behaviour and their modes
   of using inforination are also changing. In this paper, we briefly
   introduce the principle and the operating model of Web 2.0 and go on to
   analyse the relationship between Web 2.0 and digital library
   technologies. After analysing some limitations with existing library
   services, we suggest that Web 2.0 be used in agricultural digital
   libraries to improve services, focusing on the user and on how to meet
   their needs.}},

Abstract = {{TanDEMA (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements) is an
   innovative spaceborne radar interferometer that is based on two
   TerraSAR-X radar satellites flying in close formation. The primary
   objective of the TanDEMA mission is the generation of a consistent
   global digital elevation model (DEM) with an unprecedented accuracy,
   which is equaling or surpassing the HRTI-3 specification. Beyond that,
   TanDEM-X provides a highly reconfigurable platform for the demonstration
   of new radar imaging techniques and applications. This paper gives a
   detailed overview of the TanDEM-X mission concept which is based on the
   systematic combination of several innovative technologies. The key
   elements are the bistatic data acquisition employing an innovative phase
   synchronization link, a novel satellite formation flying concept
   allowing for the collection of bistatic data with short along-track
   baselines, as well as the use of new interferometric modes for system
   verification and DEM calibration. The interferometric performance is
   analyzed in detail, taking into account the peculiarities of the
   bistatic operation. Based on this analysis, an optimized DEM data
   acquisition plan is derived which employs the combination of multiple
   data takes with different baselines. Finally, a collection of
   instructive examples illustrates the capabilities of TanDEM-X for the
   development and demonstration of new remote sensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{In today's digital world, privacy issues have received widespread public
   attention. Current research on information privacy protection focuses on
   release control and subject identity obscurity. Little work has been
   done, however, to prevent a piece of private information from being
   misused after that information has been released to external entities.
   This paper focuses on information privacy protection in a post-release
   phase. Without entirely depending on the information collector, an
   information owner is provided with powerful means to control and audit
   how his/her released information will be used, by whom, and when. The
   goal is to minimize the asymmetry of information flow between an
   information owner and an information collector. A set of innovative
   owner-controlled privacy protection and violation detection techniques
   has been proposed: Self-destroying File, Mutation Engine System,
   Automatic Receipt Collection, and Honey Token-based Privacy Violation
   Detection. Next generation privacy-enhanced operating system, which
   supports the proposed mechanisms, is introduced. Such a privacy-enhanced
   operating system stands for a technical breakthrough, which offers new
   features to existing operating systems. We discuss the functionalities
   of such an operating system and the design guidelines. To our best
   knowledge, no similar technical work has been found to provide
   post-release information privacy protection.}},

Abstract = {{The super conducting stellarator WENDELSTEIN 7-X (W7-X) is designed as a
   steady-state device which will run pulses of 30 min or more. During
   discharges W7-X will be controlled by a dedicated ``segment control
   system{''} addressed in this article. Due to the innovative nature of a
   fusion device and its subsystems a failure of a subsystem during a
   discharge cannot be ruled out. Safety critical failures are handled by
   the safety system. In many cases a failure leads only to a degradation
   of the plasma quality and not to a safety critical situation. Because of
   the long pulses the segment control has to detect the situation and
   steer the discharge into another state in which preferably the discharge
   can continue without the failed subsystem or the discharge is gracefully
   brought to an end.
   After a short summary of the main aspects of the ``segment control
   system{''} this paper deals with the online resource check required for
   fault detection and recovery. It explains how the online resource check
   is integrated in the control system and how the control system support
   recovery strategies. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The case for curriculum reform in Australian information management \&

   digitization as drivers}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2007}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Against a background of declining enrolments and closure
   of schools, information professionals and educators in Australia have
   expressed concerns about education for information. The aim of this
   study then is to formally canvass views and thinking about these
   concerns with stakeholders academics, educators, library managers and
   students.
   Method. A semi-structured interview process was used for getting the
   story behind each participant's experience. Questions began with a
   `stimulus' quotation from recent literature and were open-ended in
   nature. A stratified purposive sample of information professionals for
   whom information management or library and information science is an
   essential component of their occupation was used. Interviews, conducted
   during June to August 2006, were tape-recorded and transcribed.
   Analysis. Context and meaning in the interviews was explored through
   content analysis using NVivo (TM) software. The grounded theory approach
   to data analysis drew out major themes and concerns of participants. Use
   of several coders and monitoring for consistency ensured the reliability
   of classifications.
   Results. Responses mainly from educators and academics are discussed in
   this paper. A framework of significant changes to the information
   environment as seen by the information professionals interviewed is
   presented. Analysis focuses on the impact of changes experienced and on
   reforms they suggest for the education sector. Four broad themes emerge
   from the data: changes driven by technological innovations; a
   confirmation of the basic core knowledge; the need for broadening the
   scope of education programmes; and relationships with neighboring
   information fields. Work on the analysis of interviews is ongoing.
   Conclusions. Findings to date indicate that academics and educators
   think that information management or library and information science
   education in Australia needs reform. They also point to necessary
   adjustments to content in order to prepare graduates for expanding
   career opportunities and roles in business, industry, and
   non-traditional settings as well as in traditional settings and
   services.}},
