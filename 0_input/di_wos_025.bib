Abstract = {{This paper describes a new calibration method for robot manipulators
   using a mobile TV camera and 3D digitizer. This method is motivated by
   the need of precisely calibrating a large work space without using
   special instruments or calibration fixtures. The method uses an
   innovative kinematic model of the robot-camera system, which permits to
   combine, without loss of precision, measurements taken from different
   camera positions of different work volumes. The method includes
   algorithms for the selection of robot poses and for kinematic parameter
   identification. Results of simulation tests of a surgical robot are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a testing scheme for analog and mixed-signal
   circuitry compatible with the IEEE 1149.4 mixed-signal test bus
   standard. An innovative self-diagnostic method called VDDQ is proposed.
   The proposed method performs a pass or fail function which sequentially
   senses quiescent voltage on several nodes of the circuit under test and
   compares them with their nominal value. The output is a digital flag
   that Passes or fails the nodes accessed. Simulation results are provided
   for the flag and amplifier circuit used for the design of the testing
   circuit. Through simulations this test has performed testing one node
   every millisecond. This testing scheme is at least 12 times faster than
   currently used methods in industry, which average to 5000 nodes per
   minute. This will potentially allow a defect free IC to enter the market
   in significantly less time than with conventional testing methods.}},

   the need for new tools, which are capable of tracking and mitigating the
   voltage disturbances caused by non-linear loads. This paper introduces a
   new strategy to track and mitigate the voltage flicker and the unbalance

   innovative technique for voltage disturbance extraction, which uses
   symmetrical components. This paper proves that The Unified Power Quality
   Conditioner (UPQC) is capable of suppressing the entire voltage
   disturbance in the industrial system. Results of digital simulation are
   presented to validate and verify the control strategy and to assess the
   performance of UPQC to mitigate the voltage flicker and the unbalance

   of Service (QoS). In this paper, an object-based system for quality of
   service assessment is presented to blindly evaluate the quality of a
   multimedia communication link by means of an unconventional use of
   semi-fragile digital watermarking. Specifically, a known watermark is
   hidden into each single object of a MPEG-4 video using a spread spectrum
   technique. In this fashion, the object and the embedded watermark follow
   the same communication link. In fact, the degradations endured by the
   (known) watermark allows inferring about the degradations suffered, at
   the receiver's side, by the original (unknown) object. The quality of
   service evaluation is based on the calculation of the mean square error
   between the estimated and the actual watermarks. The performed
   experimentations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

   services for ``active content{''} (e.g. adaptive video, interactive
   visualization) that can scale. We describe how this challenge can be
   addressed by technologies based on Logistical Networking, an innovative
   approach to communication infrastructure that combines bandwidth and
   storage in a way that supports the flexible co-scheduling of data
   transport and data storage. Two technologies are central: The Portable
   Channel Representation (PCR), which embodies an abstract model of the
   sever in order to support the automated mirroring of DL services on a
   heterogeneous infrastructure; and the Internet Backplane Protocol (IBP),
   which provides a primitive network storage service that achieves both
   scalability and strong management of data locality while conforming to
   the Internet's ``end-to-end{''} design principles. We argue that this
   approach can lead to a DL service architecture for active content that
   will scale up just as the guiding vision of the DL community requires -
   to millions of users, distributed around the globe in diverse

Abstract = {{Based on a long term background and experience of modem active phased
   array radars and industrial sensor applications up to 94 GHz inside the
   EADS the communication modules for RF radio links and LMDS (Local
   Multipoint Distribution Systems) communications are commercial products
   for high volume production in our MicroWave Factory.
   Focal points are Point-to-Point radios within 20-38-64 GHz and
   Point-to-Multipoint radios with spectrum allocations at 26, 28, 31, 32
   and 42 GHz and VSA T modules with an UP-Link frequency at 30 GHz and a
   Down-Link frequency at 20 GHz.
   Beside all the discussions around communication market situation, a
   steady growing demand for LMDS products is obvious. The only success
   will be the low-price solutions for this high volume market. A more
   trendy module architecture based on RF-PCB multilayers (MCM-L) and
   single packaged MMICs together with MacroModules in MLC (Multilayer
   Ceramic) technology will be shown. The assembly of this type of module
   is an SMD reflow soldering process, comparable to well known established
   usage in high volume electronic products, e.g. digital audio products.
   The needs in combining RF-PCBs with integrated filters and RF packages
   will be shown as well as typical material and electrical issues, like
   performance, CTE, mismatch and extreme points in design will be
   discussed. Results of a typical LMDS transmit/receive module at 42 GHz
   based on SMD technology will be compared with traditional module
   solutions in sub-unit and Chip\& Wire technology. The LMDS demonstrator
   module is built with a 8 mil thick RO4003 laminated on a Brassplate and
   a FR4 core with additional 3 metal layers for signal and power routing.
   RF measurements show an insertion loss of 0.07 dB/mm, and PCB integrated
   planar filters as well as integrated wave-guides show an excellent
   stability within a temperature range from -40 degreesC to + 80 degreesC.
   Our technology strategy and packaging roadmap is mainly driven by
   long-term reliability, availability of basic materials and components
   and modularity. In combination with the idea and challenge of a
   Box-of-Bricks for a standard mm-wave transceiver radio, future trends of
   innovative module architectures and packaging technologies will be
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The computer has made a whole range of new visual art forms possible.
   This paper describes the thinking behind the Virtual Visions project,
   which pursues a relatively untrodden sub-form within the digital art
   genres - 3D still imaging for digital print. It is also an argument for
   the inclusion of science as a theoretical framework from which to pursue
   art, as an alternative or addition to contemporary cultural and media
   theory. The paper introduces some of the philosophical and
   art-theoretical implications of an artform that is predicated on
   computer graphics technologies, showing how an artist who is also a
   graphics programmer can bring together such different intellectual
   disciplines. The paper ends with a request for the computer graphics
   community to collaborate on this project in which there are many
   interfacing and aesthetic innovations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative approach to enhance students' learning
   and understanding of digital design using complex commercial design
   flows. The architecture of the experimental system is based on new
   technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), XML metadata, and an XML
   integrated database system. The database provides the content for
   multimedia presentation in a virtual environment, visualised through AR,
   which enables students to engage effectively in the process of learning,
   and includes textual descriptions, animated videos, auditory
   information, images and 3D computer generated objects of related
   diagrams and designs. An XML interface will allow the teacher to input
   multimedia information into the database remotely in a simple way. Using
   an AR interface the content of the database will be visualised in real
   time using state-of-the-art virtual reality technologies, ie head
   mounted displays, tracking devices, etc. Through this interface, users
   will be able to interact collaboratively. Using collaborative AR the
   students also will develop team skills that play a significant role in
   the learning process. Finally, an illustrative description is provided
   of how this experimental system will operate and some initial results
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid expansion of digital technologies has created a large demand
   for scientific staff in the IT sector. The lack of scientists is the
   reason behind the formation of the Department of Informatics and
   Telecommunications at the Technological Education Institute (TEI) of
   Series, Greece. An innovation of the Department is that it has increased
   the number of laboratory-based to classroom-based hours, compared to
   those of other relevant courses in Greece. Furthermore, real-life
   applications and projects have been introduced into the scheme. Some
   statistical data and conclusions from its two-year history are also
   presented in the paper. The aim of this paper is to outline the concepts
   behind the formation of this new Department and to serve as a possible
   guideline for departments that may be founded in the future. The
   literature research conducted in the context of designing the curriculum
   and forming the scheme of study concluded that occupations related to IT
   technologies have promising employment prospects. These comments
   concluded from a questionnaire completed by students and from an
   evaluation report produced by a team of professors outside the
   institution and industry representatives, were also considered for the
   amelioration of the Department.}},

Abstract = {{The Packaging Research Center (PRC) is developing System-on-a-Package
   (SOP) technology, as a complimentary alternative to SOC, as the
   fundamental building block for next generation convergent systems with
   computing, telecom and consumer capabilities with data and voice. Any
   systems of this nature have to provide not only high-speed digital, but
   also high bandwidth optical, analog, RF and perhaps MEMS functions. The
   SOP technology being pursued at PRC with embedded digital, optical and
   RF functions addresses this need, optimizing the IC and the package for
   functions, performance, cost, size and reliability. The PRC is
   developing this complimentary alternative to SOC using a three tier
   strategy consisting of fundamental research innovations, enabling
   technology developments and system-level testbeds. Individual digital,
   optical and RF testbeds have been developed to enable the integration of
   novel packaging technologies like embedded passive and optical
   components, high density global interconnections and wafer level
   flip-chip assembly. A phased system testbed is being evolved from these
   three testbeds to develop new SOP convergent system platforms for a
   digital/optical/RF system implementation. This paper summarizes the
   latest PRC accomplishments in the development of SOP baseline processes
   and system testbeds and updates the progress from basic research and
   technology integration to system testbeds for SOP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique for simulation of the lossy behavior of
   transmission line elements that addresses the most common problems that
   digital designers encounter when called upon to simulate links operating
   above 500 Mb/sec. Models that seek to represent the distributed losses
   of the transmission lines with a multiple section RLC network run into
   complexity related problems when the number of sections exceeds about
   100. The SPICE integration routine begins to insert its own oscillations
   and may fail to converge, yielding no answer or ar best a loss of time
   when the user tries various methods to achieve convergence. In addition,
   the time to evaluate the SPICE model can become an annoyance or a real
   time sink for the designer. Alternative methods using S-parameters or
   Laplace transforms are often compute intensive as well. The elegant W
   element (by Avant!) solves most problems of this sort, but is available
   on only one SPICE platform. The model presented here addresses the above
   problems by reducing the number of elements to a minimum with innovative
   circuit design, and by using appropriate approximations. It can be
   implemented in any SPICE version, and it works unchanged in both AC and
   transient modes.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we present the study and the implementation of a Bit Error
   Rate Tester (BERT) for the performance analysis of digital communication
   systems with very high speed bit rate, up to 40 Gbit/s.
   A Bit Error Rate Tester is normally used to measure the most important
   performance parameter of a digital communication system that is the bit
   error probability. The approach to implement this system exploits some
   particular properties of the pseudo-random bit sequences: in fact the
   sequence generation and its reception will be implemented through
   algorithms with high parallelism. In this way we will have N parallel
   streams of data, each one with a bit rate of, for example, 40/N Gbit/s:
   with high parallelism we can avoid data processing architectures at high
   speed with remarkable lowest costs and much more easy implementation.
   The innovative aspect of this research is the development of a
   re-configurable platform with a flexible architecture for digital signal
   conditioning using state of the art programmable devices for very
   high-speed bit rate (from 1.25 Gbit/s to 40 Gbit/s). This platform is
   based on programmable devices such as DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and
   PLD (Programmable Logic Devices).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel computer-based tool for real-time simulation
   and rapid control prototyping of power electronic systems and drives.
   The tool consists of innovative algorithmic software (ARTEMIS(TM1)) for
   the fixed-time-step simulation of stiff electric circuits, and a

Abstract = {{The paper describes the findings and approach of Ex NEAR HORIZONS, which
   as part of a series of trials, aimed to explore the performance
   characteristics and potential operational benefits of a number of
   technology inserts for the UK Digitization Programme. Although the
   exercise contained 5 discrete options (hypotheses) for improvement in
   Command, Control, Communications, Computing and Information (C4I) this
   paper explores only two of these: a web-based approach and the provision
   of technology to support distributed and co-located collaborative team
   working. Despite the commercial world moving towards an information
   exchange model based on publish and subscribe, the trial found that,
   although the concept was well received, the implications for changes in
   organisation and process were substantial. When working collaboratively
   in a distributed environment, the findings indicate difficulties in
   gaining an initial shared understanding of the situation and to exercise
   command. The participants were a wide range of regular British Army
   Officers, not only to provide broad views on current military benefits
   but also to move away from the traditional trials, which tend to expose
   a single HQ, with prescriptive processes and organisations to the
   technology. The innovative trial was considered to have been very
   successful, gathering a considerable body of valuable data and
   identifying clear paths for exploitation of information technologies to
   support the military decision-maker. The paper extrapolates the findings
   of the trial to provide comment on the potential difficulties facing the
   concept of Network Centric Warfare.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling of signals nonuniformly rather than periodically opens up the
   principal possibility of avoiding aliasing. If the right techniques are
   used for such sampling and subsequent processing of the digital signals
   obtained in this way, the frequency range for digital processing of
   signals can be extended, for many applications, far beyond the
   traditional limit of half the sampling rate. The benefits, obtainable in
   this way, as well as the limitations of these techniques, are discussed.
   An innovative signal processing technology, called Digital Alias-free
   Signal Processing, has been developed on the basis of the knowledge
   accumulated in this area. Systems for fully digital processing of RF and
   microwave signals in a frequency range extending up to several GHz can
   be built, in many cases, on this basis. The application potential of
   this technology is substantial. Access to this technology has been
   provided by the European project EURODASP.}},

Abstract = {{As the Internet model created an environment for creativity and

   innovative architecture that unifies the circuit and IMS domains by
   providing a single control plane for both. The Flexent(R) IMS
   architecture is specifically designed to accomplish this by the
   deployment of a hardware platform based on the wireless Lucent
   Softswitch (LSS) that initially supports circuit mobiles and then
   evolves through software upgrades to support both packet and circuit
   mobiles off of a common SIP call processing architecture. This
   evolutionary approach bridges not only the circuit and packet worlds,

   access technology, whether it is wireless (CDMA2000{*} or Universal
   Mobile Telecommunications System {[}UMTS]) or wireline (digital

Abstract = {{Digital mammography creates very large images, which require new
   approaches to storage, retrieval, management. and security. The National
   Digital Mammography Archive (NDMA) project, funded by the National
   Library of Medicine (NLM), is developing a limited testbed that
   demonstrates the feasibility of a national breast imaging archive. with
   access to prior exams; patient information; computer aids for image
   processing, teaching and testing tools; and security components to
   ensure confidentiality of patient information. There will be significant
   benefits to patients and clinicians in terms of accessible data with
   which to make a diagnosis, and to researchers performing studies on
   breast cancer. Mammography was chosen for the project, because standards
   were already available for digital images, report formats and
   structures. New standards have been created for communications protocols
   between devices, front-end portal and archive. NDMA is a distributed
   computing concept that provides for sharing and access across corporate
   entities. Privacy, auditing, and patient consent are all integrated into
   the system. Five sites', Universities of Pennsylvania., Chicago, North
   Carolina and Toronto, and BWXT Y12, are connected through high-speed
   networks to demonstrate functionality. We will review progress,
   including technical challenges. innovative research and development
   activities. standards and protocols being implemented, and potential

Abstract = {{Purpose: Tumorigenesis is characterized by the stepwise accumulation of
   multiple genetic changes that modify specific growth controls and cell
   survival. Conventional fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays
   reliably target one to three probes in a single hybridization.
   Simultaneous detection of more than three chromosomal or gene targets
   should increase the overall power of molecular cytogenetics by
   permitting detection of multiple genetic aberrations at the single cell
   level. Method: Spectral FISH (S-FISH) is an innovative molecular
   cytogenetic approach that can target many specific chromosomal
   aberrations in interphase and metaphase cells in a single hybridization,
   using combinatorial fluorescence and digital imaging microscopy.
   Results: S-FISH is a reliable means to identify disease-specific
   aberrations at the DNA level in individual tumor cells in hematopoietic
   disorders and malignant melanoma. Conclusion: S-FISH is a sensitive
   assay for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease-specific or
   patient-specific genetic aberrations, with significant clinical
   application in oncology for early detection of new or re-emerging
   abnormal clones, allowing for earlier therapeutic intervention. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The rapid generation of computer models from existing buildings will
   enable to enhance creativity and innovation within the architectural
   design process. Over the past two decades, redesign has been extensively
   studied and several efforts to build computer models of architectural
   scenes have been made. However, the traditional methods of constructing
   models from existing buildings are particularly labour-intensive,
   implying the survey of the site, the digitisation of existing
   architectural drawings, or the modification of existing computer-aided
   architectural design data. In this paper a new approach based on the
   replication of the human vision process is proposed. This process uses
   two-dimensional photos to create three-dimensional computer models

Abstract = {{The employment of simulation technology together with the exploration of
   virtual environments promise to be a unique advantage for digital
   enterprises in diverse fields like planning, rapid prototyping,
   marketing and presentations, as well as information dissemination and
   training. However, there are serious obstacles that inhibit digital
   enterprises to take a competitive advantage when using 3D for business
   processes. Most of these obstacles are concerned with the fact that 2D
   interaction metaphors are used for interacting with 3D content. With the
   motivation to help a digital enterprise to benefit from the advantages
   of applying 3D and virtual reality for different purposes and different
   user groups, this paper introduces an innovative dedicated interaction
   device for the digital enterprise. It employs the metaphor of a glove
   box where stereoscopic visualization together with haptic feedback is
   given in a natural manner. This makes it intuitive to manipulate
   three-dimensional content and makes it easy for users to navigate and to
   orient themselves in a virtual 3D world. Beside presenting the Virtual
   Glove Box device, we will discuss its advantages for new industrial
   organisations and deal with the question how to integrate it in existing
   structures and processes of an enterprise.}},

Abstract = {{The High Performance Computing (HPC-I) payload is an innovative
   computing device designed for deployment on the Australian scientific
   mission satellite FedSat. HPC-I will validate and evaluate the
   practicality of using reconfigurabte Field Programmable Gate Array
   (FPGA) technology in the space environment. The deployment of
   reconfigurable FPGA technology on-board satellites is a very promising
   solution for digital signal processing in the challenging space
   environment, offering tremendous flexibility to adapt to changing
   operation requirements, while achieving very high performance. Such
   combined flexibility and performance is not found in conventional signal
   processing architectures. This paper presents the design and
   implementation on HPC-I of two common digital signal filtering
   algorithms, a 4-tap low pass FIR filter and a 32-tap moving average
   filter. The flexibility and adaptability of the system is discussed in
   the context of more complex functionality and changing operation

Abstract = {{Globalisation of foreign markets intensively stimulates the
   implementation of information technology and telecommunication networks
   into different sectors of economy. Any furher progresses in the field of
   information technologies will indisputably result in facilitation and
   acceleration and transformation of classical trade and payment
   procedures into their electronic equivalent. Internationally designed
   and accepted trade and payment standards will result in growth of world
   output.
   United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Working Party 4 -
   UN/ECE/WP4 was appointed with diagnosis of conditions for worldwide
   electronic trade exchange, analysis of the directive for registration
   and certification of digital signatures, and creation of databasis of
   electronic legistative documents - Archive of E-conditions. Electronic
   Data Interchange with its standard EDIFACT could serve as unfied
   standard for transfer of electronic documents and information.
   Electronic payment and settlement is one of the basic functions of EDI
   systems. Cheques and bills are payment instruments of modern market
   economy, an effective usage of which can help Slovak entrepreneurs keep
   and join new trade contacts in global economy.
   Aim of this article is to present new possibilities and innovations of
   cheques and bill of exchanges in compliance with their present trend.
   This article has assessed the desirability of ligislating for electronic
   cheques and bills. It has established the validity of their electronic
   forms under the existing legal framework in Slovakia. To state the topic
   in complex we point at their genesis. Both of these payment instruments
   are under Slovak conditions mostly used in cross border trade contacts.
   Any further increase of their usage can be expected together with the
   implementation of their electronic equivalent. These are not the
   technical difficulties, however, missing legistative conditions.
   Writing and signature, e. g. are two of the several requirements that
   bills and cheques must satisfy in order to be valid under the Bills and
   Cheques Act. It has been established in this article that improvement in
   the present legislation will enable bills and cheques satisfy those two
   requirements. Both instruments should be capable of being transferred by
   way of indorsement and delivery from one person to another in such a way
   as to constitute the transferee their holder with a right to enforce the
   obligation against the underlying debtor.
   Electronic payment instruments represent a great benefit to the
   business. improved legislation will broaden the types of transactions,
   that-could be conducted electronically. Legislation will enable business
   to compete nationally and internationally with the exploitation of
   electronic payment and monetary instruments.
   New economy calls for implementation of electronic trade and payment
   methods, which can become the fastes instruments in the global business
   world.}},

Abstract = {{European neighbors wondered at Germanys relatively slow start into
   Electronic Government. With a certain anxiety they had looked at this
   nation of eighty millions with its five million of public employees -
   the level of entire countries like Norway, Finland or Denmark.
   Consequently Europe was not surprised that Germany in 1997 took over a
   pole position presenting the first law on digital signature, an
   important element for Electronic Government purposes. But it turned out
   that this early law meant only a pre-dawn. It turned out that Germany -
   as it is undoubtedly big - needed much time and energy to get itself in
   motion. The presumed ``giant{''} evolved to be a specter of mostly
   isolated actions and projects. Since two years - beginning with a
   memorandum on Electronic Government triggered by the two major IT
   associations - there are more and more actors striving for joint action.
   German Federal Government set up the program ``BundOnline2005{''}
   putting comprehensive targets and respectable money into the necessary
   transformation of government processes, aiming at - as Chancellor
   Schroeder stated - ``not citizens but data have to run{''}. A
   public-private initiative ``D21{''} is backing jointly strategies.
   Germany now appears to reach necessary pace to play the expected
   visionary role as well as to overcome the obstacles every innovative

Year = {{2002}},

Abstract = {{The digitization and restoration of images that have been degraded by
   white or black blotches seen in motion picture films prior to the 1950s
   have attracted attention. Conventional restoration methods are composed
   of two processes. The first process is motion estimation by block
   matching (BM). The second process matches the current frame to the
   previous and next frames based on the motion estimates and filters in
   the temporal direction. Blotch detection accompanies the filtering in
   the second process. The BM used in the first process is average BM or
   sorted BM. Blotch detection in the second process employs Spike
   Detection Index-a (SDIa). In conventional BM, however, there are limits
   to the accuracy of motion estimation when blotches are present in the
   blocks used to estimate the motion in images corrupted by blotches.
   Furthermore, the accuracy of the filtering in the second process is
   affected by the accuracy of the motion estimation. And although blotch
   detection based on SDIa is a simple method, the accuracy of its blotch
   detection is a problem. To solve these problems in this paper, we create
   a blotch position image by using a median filter with an iteration
   constraint as the first stage, and obtain a virtual original image with
   the blotches removed by filtering based on the blotch position image.
   The accuracy of the motion estimation is improved by using the virtual
   original image, and the accuracy of the filtering is improved by using
   the blotch position image in the filtering. Based on these innovations,
   we propose a new method to obtain a restored image sequence having
   enhanced image quality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   clearly demonstrated through a variety of examples. (C) 2002 Wiley

Abstract = {{The IMED-LA or Interactive Multimedia Education at a Distance Linear
   Algebra is the ongoing international joint project by the collaboration
   of the Japan Team currently consisting of five members and the Center
   for Digital Innovation (CDI) of the University of California at Los
   Angeles (UCLA) headed by Director Maha Ashour-Abdalla. The project
   started in July, 1999. Its goal is the production of virtual university
   content in linear algebra, intended primarily for graduate students and
   working students who need a fast-paced study of the basic facts from
   linear algebra; hence the content can also effectively be used by the
   beginning college students under a proper guidance from the teacher. Our
   partially completed content is already available on the Internet at the
   following URL: http://www.cdi.ucla.edu/Iinearalgebra.
   This Internet course has several special features worth mentioning: in
   its approach to the subject matter, the topics selected, the way and
   style the exercises are supported and the provision of the philosophical
   or historical notes for encouraging the learners or opening up new
   horizons for them. At the same time no mathematical rigor is sacrificed
   and a high level of standard is maintained. It is our pleasure to state
   that, thanks to our collaboration, the Japan team mainly providing
   authoring and the UCLA team the needed IT and project management
   expertise, the project has been enjoying a steady progress and the both
   teams are gaining valuable practical experiences. At the present this
   project is probably only one of its kind as an international joint
   Virtual University Content Production Project between Japanese and US
   universities. In this paper we will discuss the content under
   construction, the needed IT support and the project management
   technology being employed. For the activities of the CDI/UCLA, see their
   home page: http://www.cdi.ucla.edu.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation concerns the application of different techniques,
   including optical fibre strain sensing pulsed Digital Speckle Pattern
   Interferometry (DSPI), traditional modal analysis and finite element
   model updating procedures to the study of vibrating composite
   structures. A prototype system for condition monitoring of composite
   structures is being developed which relies on the on-line measurement of
   dynamic strains in order to detect any deterioration in performance due
   to damage. A range of carbon-fibre reinforced composite specimens that
   incorporate innovative Fabry-Perot interferometric long gauge-length
   strain sensors have been produced and tested. The optimal design of
   fibre sensor network configurations for the identification of different
   damage parameters is being aided through the development of a software
   simulation tool and the use of a p-version FEM package. Vibration modes
   of the excited structures have also been determined using an
   out-of-plane pulsed-DSPI system, employing a dual-cavity
   frequency-doubled Nd:YAG pulsed laser with a 25 Hz repetition rate. In
   general, experimental results compare favourably with finite element
   predictions. The data derived from the strain sensors is used to update
   a parameterised FE model of the composite structure, allowing the
   determination of the position and extent of damage present.}},

Abstract = {{The motion estimation block in the digital video encoder is the most
   important block and the most difficult block to design. The block-based
   motion estimation is simple technique for doing motion estimation and it
   is suitable for VLSI implementation. The full search block-based motion
   estimation suffers from the huge number of computations needed to look
   for the best match block among all the candidate blocks. To face this
   computation cost parallel and pipelined implementations are needed.
   This paper presents innovative parallel-pipelined architecture for
   full-search block-based motion estimation. Full search block matching
   algorithm is used in the proposed architecture. The proposed
   architecture has been prototyped, simulated and synthesized for 0.18 mum
   CMOS technology using TSMC standard cells. Using 100 MHz clock frequency
   the proposed architecture needs 50.5 musec to compute the motion
   vectors, which enables processing of more than 10k frames per second.
   The prototyped architecture consumes 312.07 mW with 1.6 V supply voltage
   and has core area of 0.795 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the project of the earth digital receiver
   (based around DSP C6416) for LEO satellite application on W band
   (80-90Ghz), in order to design a robust architecture to frequency
   offset. The maximum doppler frequency is proportional to the relative
   speed and the carrier frequency, therefore on W band this value is large
   congruent to 2 MHz According to this phenomenon the carrier recovery of
   the received signal is very difficult. Starting from the IF
   stage(Intermediate Frequency), we present a digital method to estimate
   and correct the doppler-shift directly in base band. In particular we
   propose an innovative algorithm based on a two step doppler-recovery.
   Beside we provide simulation results indicating the accuracy of this
   method and a prototype system (based around DSP C6416) for real time
   carrier recovery with unknown doppler-shift.}},

Abstract = {{The exploration of the design space for heterogeneous reconfigurable
   Systems on Chip (SoC) becomes more and more important. As modem SoCs
   include a variety of different architecture blocks ensuring flexibility
   as well as highest performance, it is mandatory to prune the design
   space in an early stage of the design process in order to achieve short
   innovation cycles for new products. Therefore, the goal of this work is
   to provide estimations of implementation specific parameters like
   throughput rate, power dissipation and silicon area by means of cost
   functions. A concept for a model based exploration strategy supporting
   the design flow for heterogeneous SoCs is presented. In order to prove
   the feasibility of this exploration strategy first of all operations
   were implemented on discrete components like DSPs, FPGAs or dedicated
   ASICs. Implementation parameters are provided for a variety of basic
   operations frequently required in digital signal processing. These
   implementation parameters serve as a basis for deriving models for the
   design space exploration concept.}},

Abstract = {{FIFEDOM is an innovative digital airborne image acquisition system,
   which exploits the additional information inherent in highly overlapped
   image frames. FIFEDOM proposes a new analysis methodology for aerial
   mapping, based on image processing algorithms, which extract the
   information found only in highly overlapped image sequences to create
   orthographic map information. FIFEDOM will concentrate on three
   applications of highly overlapped aerial image data. They were selected
   because they fill a clear commercial need and have the most direct
   impact on the core business of the mapping industry. They are also
   comprehensive in the sense that they span the radiometric, geometric and
   classification aspects of the new data. The three applications are:
   improved mosaicking, improved DEMs and orthorectified images, and
   improved land classification. Currently, these sophisticated tasks
   require skilled human operators. The intelligent systems built for
   FIFEDOM will reduce human interaction, thereby reducing operating costs.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate knowledge of the shoreline position is of fundamental
   importance in several applications such as cartography and ships
   positioning. Moreover, the coastline could be seen as a relevant
   parameter for the monitoring of the coastal zone morphology, as it
   allows the retrieval of a much more precise digital elevation model of
   the entire coastal area. The study that has been carried out focuses on
   the development of a reliable technique for the detection of coastlines
   in remotely sensed images. An innovative approach which is based on the
   concepts of fuzzy connectivity and texture features extraction has been
   developed for the location of the shoreline. The system has been tested
   on several kind of images as SPOT, LANDSAT and the results obtained are
   good. Moreover, the algorithm has been tested on a sample of a SAR
   interferogram. The breakthrough consists in the fact that the coastline
   detection is seen as an important features in the framework of digital
   elevation model (DEM) retrieval. In particular, the coast could be seen
   as a boundary line all data beyond which (the ones representing the sea)
   are not significant. The processing for the digital elevation model
   could be refined, just considering the in-land data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an innovative measurement system for odor classification,
   based on Quartz Ctystal Microbalances (QCMs), is presented. In
   particular, the problem of detecting typical wine aroma components in
   mixtures where ethanol is present is taken into account. In QCM sensors
   the sensitive layer is a polymeric layer deposited on a quartz surface.
   Chemical mixtures are adsorbed by the polymeric layer, inducing a change
   in the quartz mass and therefore in its resonance frequency. The
   frequency shift is measured by a dedicated fully digital front-end
   hardware implementing a technique proposed by Cantoni {[}1]. This
   approach allows reducing the measurement dine while maintaining a high
   frequency resolution. The developed System allows measuring variations
   of the QCM resonance frequency shifts during chemical transients
   obtained with abrupt changes in odor concentration. Hence the reaction
   kinetics can be exploited to differentiate among different compounds In
   this study some measurements obtained with an array of 4 sensors with
   different sensitive layers are presented. An exponential fining of the
   transient responses is used for feature extraction. Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality is used.}},

   samples fed back with the output of the neural network, which is capable
   of generating a better quantized output. The algorithmic solution,

Abstract = {{The paper discusses commercial cleaning robots available on the market.
   It introduces Gecko, a virtual prototype of a cleaning robot. Gecko has
   been conceived, assembling mainly standard components, and the actual
   behaviour in running conditions is shown by using consistent digital
   mock ups: Gecko is able to fully clean and sanitise floors, walls and
   ceilings. To comply with health needs, the robot cleans surfaces using
   steam. Details on abilities and components are provided. The wall
   sustentation is guaranteed by four suction cups. The path planning
   allows a 2D Cartesian motion. To simplify the robot control, innovative
   ``automatic suspensions{''} are integrated in the sustain and actuation
   system. Finally, other possible applications fields for such a robot are
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Technology spillovers and economic vitality: an analysis of
   institutional flexibility in Japan with comparisons to the USA}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7-8}},
Pages = {{746-768}},
Abstract = {{In Japan, technology spillovers have been less successful in the 1990s
   than they were in the 1980s. One apparent reason for this is a decline
   in institutional flexibility - the ability of organisations to absorb
   technology, transform human capital and adapt to changing global
   conditions. Information and communication technology (ICT) has become
   embedded in US business practice, but Japanese firms have yet to absorb
   ICT or respond to human capital needs. This lack of flexibility has had
   a significant negative impact on the vitality of the Japanese economy.
   Section 2 of this paper will demonstrate recent changes in Japan's
   institutional flexibility by contrasting technology spillovers of the
   1970s and 80s with those of the 1990s, linking this institutional
   flexibility with R\&D diversification and showing the negative impact on
   Total Factor Productivity and GDP. This analysis was performed using
   data compiled by the Tokyo Institute of Technology as well as data from
   recent surveys conducted by a number of Japanese government offices and
   agencies. Section 2 will also discuss Japan's `dual economy' by looking
   at key differences between Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and
   Large Enterprises (LEs) in terms of labour rigidity and ICT penetration.
   These differences are one aspect of institutional flexibility. Section 3
   starts by comparing the economic growth rates in Japan and the USA in
   the second part of the 1980s and the first part of the 1990s, A
   comparison of labour, capital, material and Total Factor Productivity
   indicates a decline in flexibility in Japan and an increase in
   flexibility in the USA. Additionally, this reversal can be seen in
   technology, labour and capital substitution. Section 4 discusses key
   changes in the US and Japanese organisational environments as they
   converge on different digital platforms and implications for their
   respective institutions. Key questions are raised regarding often
   over-simplified fundamental changes purported in the USA. In this
   regard, the truly `innovative' nature of SMEs in the USA is questioned
   as institutional rigidity in this sector grows. Section 5 summarises
   final implications of this analysis and directs future work towards
   questions arising from this study.}},

   superimposed dominant color) in a digital image without any a priori
   knowledge of its semantic content. The color gamut of the image is first
   mapped in the CIELab color space. The color distribution of the whole
   image and of the so-called Near Neutral Objects (NNO) is then
   investigated using statistical tools then, to determine the presence of
   a cast. The boundaries of the near neutral objects in the color space
   are set adaptively by the algorithm on the basis of a preliminary
   analysis of the image color gamut. The method we propose has been tuned
   and successfully tested on a large data set of images, downloaded from
   personal web-pages or acquired using various digital and traditional
   cameras.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the study and the desiqn of an embedded electronic
   control system that allows diesel engine driven stand-alone synchronous
   generators to operate at variable (optimum) speed. A new control
   strategy has been developed, based on passivity theory for the PWM
   inverter control and a fuzzy logic fuel admission control system, to
   overcome the nonlinearity introduced into the system by the diesel
   engine. In order to use the passivity theory approach, the system was
   described in Euler-Lagrange form, such systems representing the outcome
   of the powerful variational modelling method. MATLAB software was used
   for the complete power and control system design and simulation and a
   novel approach was adopted for the FPGA implementation of the digital
   controller. The method is based on using Handel-C, an innovative
   language for implementing algorithms in hardware, architectural design
   space exploration and hardware/software co-design. The new PWM passivity
   based controller was designed, successfully simulated and is currently
   being implemented in a Virtex Xilinx FPGA. Experimental tests are being
   carried out to validate the behaviour of the controller. The main
   achievements of the new control system relate to the efficient
   maintenance of the output voltage at the desired magnitude and
   frequency, independent of the rotational speed of the generator, under
   variable loading conditions. thus allowing, variable (optimum) speed
   operation of the diesel engine.}},

   digital cable subscribers based on a telephone survey. The study results
   indicate that digital cable subscribers are more likely to watch
   television, subscribe to premium services, perceive their cable operator
   to be technologically progressive, and express greater satisfaction with
   current cable service compared to analog-only subscribers. It was also
   found that the more people watch television, have premium channels, and
   evaluate their cable operator as innovative toward technology, the
   sooner they can be expected to upgrade to new cable services.
   Implications for cable service structuring and marketing behaviors are

Abstract = {{The paper explores how East Asia's upgrading perspectives in the
   electronics industry are affected by three important transformations in
   global production networks (GPNs): i) structure: the emergence of
   increasingly complex ``networks of networks{''} that juxtapose
   ``original equipment manufacturers{''} and ``contract manufacturers{''};
   ii) coordination \& contents: the increasing use of digital information
   systems to manage these networks, and to build ``global information
   service networks{''} that complement networks centered on manufacturing;
   and iii) location: the emergence of China as a priority investment.
   target for GPNs in the electronics industry.
   The paper provides an important message for the management of innovation
   and technology in a globalizing, world: As GPNs have gradually enhanced
   the mobility of knowledge, this has created greater opportunities for
   East Asia to use network participation as a catalyst for further
   upgrading. But realizing this potential has also become more difficult
   for mid-sized countries like Malaysia. The best choice arguably is to
   move forward in incremental steps, and to build on existing strengths in
   assembly and volume manufacturing, by adding knowledge-intensive support
   services in sectors like ``embedded software{''} and photonics.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing, dramatic increase in speed and accessibility in digital
   computing has been potentiated since the early 1970s by the increasing
   capacity of integrated circuits expressed as gates per unit chip area.
   The governing model, called Moore's Law, states that gate density
   doubles approximately every 18 months, and has held since the early
   1970s. However, there exist physical limits on the size of integrated
   circuit features such as insulators. These limits are expected to be
   reached in conventional circuit technology in the next 15 to 20 years.
   At that time, (a) circuit density will no longer increase significantly,
   or (b) new technologies (if available) are envisioned to support further
   progress approximating the curve dictated by Moore's Law. Such
   technological innovations can be classified as: (1) fundamental advances
   in circuit technology that support further growth in gate density
   according to Moore's Law, or (2) technologies that advance
   state-of-the-art in computing in either hardware or software to provide
   a constant offset to the graph of Moore's Law. Examples of the former
   include quantum computing, and of the latter, more efficient chip
   layouts. In this paper, we show that another, recently-developed
   technology exists that can partially ameliorate the performance
   constraints imposed by physical limits on gate density, thereby
   providing a sustainable but constant offset of two to three orders of
   magnitude in Moore's performance model. Called compressive processing,
   this technique involves computation using compressed data (e.g., signals
   or imagery) in compressed form, without decompression, primarily for
   image and signal processing (ISP) applications. Given a source image a
   and a compression transform T, a compressed image c = T(a) is subjected
   to an operation O-{*} that is an analogue over range(7) of an operation
   on uncompressed imagery b = O(a), such that d = O-{*}(c) = T(O (a)). By
   applying the inverse of T (denoted by T-1) to d, we obtain b. If T does
   not have an inverse, then an approximation T-{*} to the inverse can be
   applied, such that the decompressed image is given by d = T-{*} (O
   (T(a))) approximate to b, which is the customary case in lossy
   compression. Analysis emphasizes implementational concerns such as
   applicable compression transforms (T) and theory that relates
   compressive operations (O-{*}) to corresponding image or signal
   processing operations (O). Discussion also includes error propagation in
   cascades of compressive operations. Performance results are given for
   various image processing operations.}},

Abstract = {{Discordance between lesion severity from angiocardiography and
   physiological effects has been reported elsewhere. Quantification of
   myocardial perfusion during the angiography procedure may supply
   additional information about short- and long-term outcomes and may be
   helpful for clinical decision making. In previous works, myocardial
   perfusion has been assessed using ``time density curves{''} (TDC), which
   represent the contrast medium dilution over time in the myocardium. The
   mean transit time (MTT), derived from the TDC., has been reported as a
   good indicator of the regional myocardial perfusion. Our objective is to
   estimate the accuracy and reproducibility of MTT estimation on digital
   flat panel (DFP) images. We have simulated typical myocardium TDC
   obtained with a DFP cardiac system (Innova 2000, GE), taking into
   account scatter and noise. Logarithmic or linear subtractions have been
   applied to derive a contrast medium concentration proportional quantity
   from image intensity. A non-linear minimisation realises the model curve
   fitting. MTT estimates are more stable with linear subtraction in
   presence of scatter. However logarithmic subtraction presents smaller
   bias when scatter level is small. Both approaches are equally sensible
   to image noise,. Linear subtraction should be preferred. Image noise.
   has a high influence on MTT accuracy and we may reduce.}},

Abstract = {{Computational and information-theoretic research in philosophy has
   become increasingly fertile and pervasive, giving rise to a wealth of
   interesting results. In consequence, a new and vitally important field
   has emerged, the philosophy of information (PIP. This essay is the first
   attempt to analyse the nature of PI systematically. PI is defined as the
   philosophical field concerned with the critical investigation of the
   conceptual nature and basic principles of information, including its
   dynamics, utilisation, and sciences, and the elaboration and application
   of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to
   philosophical problems. I argue that PI is a mature discipline for three
   reasons; it represents an autonomous field of research; it provides an
   innovative approach to both traditional and new philosophical topics;
   and it can stand beside other branches of philosophy, offering a
   systematic treatment of the conceptual foundations of the world of
   information and the information society.}},

Abstract = {{It is accepted that stream cryptosystem, which implements encryption by
   selecting a few parts of the block data and header information of the
   compressed video stream, can achieve a good real-time performance and a
   high flexibility. Chaotic random number generator, for example Logistics
   Map, is a comparatively promising substitute, but it is vulnerable to
   attacks by nonlinear dynamic forecasting and geometric information
   extracting. In this paper, a hyperchaotic cryptography scheme is
   presented to encrypt the compressed video, which integrates Logistics
   Map with Z(2(32)-1) field linear congruential algorithm to strengthen
   the security of the mono-chaotic cryptography, and meanwhile maintains
   the real-time performance and flexibility of the chaotic sequence
   cryptography. The scheme also integrates with the dissymmetrical
   public-key cryptography and implements encryption and identity
   authentification on control parameters at. the initialization phase. In
   accordance with the importance of data in compressed video stream,
   encryption is performed in layered scheme. In the innovative
   hyperchaotic cryptography, the value and the updating frequency of
   control parameters can be changed online to satisfy the requirements of
   the network quality and processor capability, as well as security
   requirements. The innovative hyperchaotic cryprography guarantees robust
   security by cryptoanalysis, and proves a good real-time performance and
   a high implementation flexibility through the arithmetic evaluation and
   test.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: An innovative stenting technique to treat a
   difficult case of a fusiform aneurysm of the intracranial vertebral
   artery (VA), with restoration of the vessel lumen, is described.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old patient experienced sudden pain in
   the upper cervical spine, followed by a severe headache. He underwent
   computed tomographic evaluation, which demonstrated subarachnoid
   hemorrhage in the prepontine cistern. A fusiform aneurysm of the distal
   right VA and critical stenosis of the left VA were detected in digital
   subtraction angiograms. The patient experienced a new subarachnoid
   hemorrhaging episode, and urgent endovascular treatment was planned.
   INTERVENTION: The patient underwent angioplastic and stenting procedures
   in the left VA, with good results. Forty-eight hours later, an
   endovascular procedure was performed to treat the right VA aneurysm. We
   decided to use a graft stent (Jostent graft stent; jomed, Conroe, TX)
   instead of a balloon to preserve the arterial lumen. The complete
   procedure was well tolerated by the patient, and he was discharged,
   without symptoms, 48 hours later.
   CONCLUSION: The patient was discharged, without neurological deficits,
   48 hours after completion of the endovascular procedure, with
   clopidogrel (75 mg/d) and aspirin (325 mg/d) therapy. This treatment was
   discontinued after 4 weeks. According to our search of the medical
   literature, this is the first clinical case in which an intracranial
   fusiform aneurysm was permanently sealed with a graft stent.}},

Abstract = {{The image of ocean science in Hawaii is familiar to many of the
   scientists and entrepreneurs in the industry, but not necessarily
   familiar to those funding sources, potential - customers, press and
   prospective employees vital to the maintenance of funding, sales and
   recruitment in Hawaii's ocean science and technology industry. There
   exists a strong need to let the world know what is happening in Hawaii,
   and innovations in information technology now makes it possible at a
   reasonable cost.
   The traditional method of information distribution (designing, printing
   and mailing elegant messages) would have been far too expensive for the
   Hawaii budget to adequately reach its significant audience. Considering
   the budgetary constraints of the traditional method, the Internet
   enables a better medium for reaching the target audiences. One of the
   primary assets of most scientists and engineers is the ability to write.
   A relatively low-cost Internet publishing vehicle was designed to allow
   Hawaii's ocean scientists to easily promote themselves and their
   industry by submitting stories, images and exhibits, in their area of
   expertise, using ordinary browser software.
   The vehicle is ``Hawaii Ocean Science Magazine{''}
   (http://HawaiiOceanScience.org), a dynamically driven, multi-media
   internet magazine developed by the State of Hawaii Ocean Resources
   Branch (ORB), as part of its industry promotion program. It consists of
   technical articles written by scientists, for scientists to read. In
   addition to other scientists, the primary audience consists of grant and
   investor funding sources, potential customers, technology and science
   press, and prospective employment recruits. It also serves as a window
   into the world of ocean science in Hawaii for students, teachers and the
   general public.
   Technical articles are converted into a press release style to benefit
   non-technical readers. Attachments to the technical articles may even
   include previous technical journal reprints from the author related to
   the magazine article. This approach can support a complete technical
   drilldown into the subject area assisting due diligence. investigations
   by potential investors and grant agencies.
   The magazine was initially launched in November 2001, with further
   development and testing through March 2002. Submitted articles ranged
   throughout eleven fields including: Aquaculture, Marine Biotechnology,
   Marine Ecology, Ocean Energy, Ocean Engineering, Fisheries, Marine
   Geophysics, Marine Minerals, Oceanography, Ocean Safety, and Ocean
   Surveying.
   Since the Internet requires readers to find the site, and not all
   readers have sufficient bandwidth to appreciate the video elements of
   the magazine, another method of delivery was designed. The software was
   designed to accomplish a download of the magazine and the accompanying
   multimedia industry directory to CD or DVD on request, allowing
   distribution of the most recent articles by mail and at events such as
   tradeshows and conferences.
   An editor in the Ocean Resources Branch manages the contents of the
   magazine. The editor distributes access codes allowing the authors into
   the submission section and the software requires the editor to approve a
   story before it goes online. Readership is promoted by the Ocean
   Resources Branch through press releases, trade show distribution,
   magazine advertising, direct mail and permission email. A feature of the
   software is the automated ability to inform readers whenever a new
   article appears. The magazine is published in a continuous style with
   newsletter style e-mail announcements sent out when new stories are
   published.}},

Abstract = {{The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), through its
   Office of Ocean Exploration (OE), has embarked on an ambitious effort to
   support a national strategy for exploring the ocean realm. An important
   part of this effort is the establishment of a data management capability
   for the large and diverse data sets that will be captured and made
   available for timely access by a variety of stakeholders. A large and
   important subset of these data is digital imagery and video. To support
   OE and other line offices producing increasing volumes of these data,
   the NOAA data management infrastructure must be expanded to accommodate
   these data, as well as storing, classifying, processing, archiving, and
   providing users with innovative, functional access. This paper
   introduces a methodology so that video data, and their associated
   metadata, can be centrally managed and archived by a dedicated facility
   under the cognizance of the NOAA Central Library in Silver Spring,
   Maryland. This effort is also consistent with the OE Data Management
   Strategy.}},

   (3-14 mm). Multispectral sensing, by virtue of its many spectral bands
   can provide the capability of characterizing and identifying natural and
   man-made targets in terms of both their spatial characteristics and
   often more importantly, their material properties. The research
   described in this paper combines spectroscopic tools and techniques,
   based on physical models of the absorption and scattering spectral
   phenomenology in the scene, with signal processing techniques.
   Innovative methods of directly fusing terrain representations and data
   from separate sensors during spectral feature extraction were also
   explored. The resulting algorithms were then programmed on a
   four-processor PCI-bus-based digital signal processing (DSP) board. The
   DSP board performed end-to-end processing of the multispectral imaging
   task, including; camera calibration, image acquisition from the four
   digital imaging cameras, and image processing.}},

Abstract = {{J-DSP+ is a java-based object-oriented programming environment that was
   developed at Arizona State University for use in the undergraduate DSP
   class {[}1]. In this paper, we describe innovative software extensions
   on J-DSP to accommodate on-line laboratories for speech processing,
   image processing, and communications systems. Significant modifications
   in the object-oriented GUI of J-DSP that enable simulation of feedback
   systems are also presented. The speech processing functions enable
   on-line simulations of speech coding algorithms and include PCM and
   ADPCM quantization as well as more elaborate algorithms such as the LPC
   and the CELP. Image processing functionalities include development of
   2-D signal processing capabilities including 2-D-FFT, 2-D-filter design,
   and 2-D graphics and picture processing. Communications functionality
   covers several aspects of analog and digital modulation and
   demodulation. On-line laboratory exercises have been developed in the
   aforementioned areas and posted on a web site (http://jdsp.asu.edu).
   This site also includes on-line evaluation forms for the exercises.
   Statistical and qualitative evaluations that assess the learning
   experiences of the students that use J-DSP are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Future system designs will use, in addition to traditional embedded
   processors, innovative approaches based on flexible distributed
   processors, enabled by digital programmable logic devices like complex
   FPGA.
   The complexity of many of today's system architectures can be likened to
   highly integrated microelectronic chip design. Traditional system
   partitioning is generally done at the early stage of system
   architecture, by defining the tasks to be implemented on the embedded
   processor(s), and the tasks to be implemented on the hardware.
   Evolution of system-on-chip, or integration of an application in one of
   few devices becomes a revolution when the technology enables innovative
   system architectures. The key to this new approach is high-bandwidth
   communications between distributed processors, and a flexible hardware /
   software partitioning which can be adapted to the evolution of the
   system in real time, and during the complete product life cycle.
   This study targets the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro(TM) platform FPGA, and is
   illustrated by comparative examples of hardware or software
   implementation. Another example shows how distributed processors can
   optimize interrupt management.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, memory components have been used as technology drivers in
   the semiconductor industry. Consequently memory components have been and
   remain the most dynamic product segment in the area of digital
   integrated circuits. An abundance of different memory types exists and
   product life cycles tend to be short, in some instances with up to 2 die
   revisions per year. For space applications this presents a particular
   challenge in the area of radiation testing. Device complexity,
   performance, the diversity of architectures and the use of innovative
   micro-packaging concepts, pose many practical problems in the
   implementation of Single Event Effects (SEE) testing and analysis of
   test results. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current
   situation and describes the evolution of test approaches used or

Abstract = {{While the information revolution is surely and certainly having a
   profound impact on the developed world, developing nations are yet to
   explore these new digital opportunities presented by Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) to foster rapid growth and benefit the
   poor. Without urgent and satisfactory localization of digital systems,
   it is difficult to envisage any significant impact of ICT in less
   literate nations such as India, where over 92\% of the population cannot
   communicate in English or in any of the other human languages supported
   today in these new innovation products. A major factor impeding
   localization is the less known fact that much like software development,
   localization is a very human intensive task covering the entire
   life-cycle of a digital system - from conception to retirement. The
   primary, contribution of this research is the design of an integrated
   environment that will hell) ease this problem to a reasonable extent.
   This paper first presents the localization problem showing why it is
   human effort intensive. The localization process is then. sketched. This
   is followed by a description of the integrated localization environment,
   including tools and activities covering the localized product life
   cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such attempt. The
   paper concludes describing the efforts in progress towards the creation
   of such (in environment within the Linux platform, including a brief
   description of sample tools developed by the authors as part (if this
   development - OS level support for enabling Indic scripts and an
   electronic glossary of GUI terms that can assist in the automation of

Abstract = {{A dynamic model for a one-degree-of-freedom (DOF) twin rotor multi-input
   multi-output (MIMO) system (TRMS) in hover is obtained using a black-box
   system identification technique. The behaviour of the TRMS in certain
   aspects resembles that of a helicopter; hence, it is an interesting
   identification and control problem. This paper investigates modelling
   and open-loop control of the longitudinal axis alone, while the lateral
   axis movement is physically constrained. It is argued that some aspects
   of the modelling approach presented are suitable for a class of new
   generation or innovative air vehicle's with complex dynamics. The
   extracted model is employed for designing and implementing a
   feedforward/open-loop control. Open-loop control is often the
   preliminary step for development of more complex feedback control laws.
   Open-loop control strategies using shaped command inputs are accordingly
   investigated for resonance suppression in the TRMS. Digital low-pass and
   band-stop filter shaped inputs are used on the TRMS testbed, based on
   the identified vibrational modes. A comparative performance study is
   carried out and the corresponding results presented. The low-pass filter
   is shown to result in better vibration reduction.}},

Abstract = {{A cost-effective and innovative airborne inventory and inspection patrol
   system for distributed assets such as transmission lines, pipelines, and
   roadways has been developed and evaluated. Results show that aerial
   high-resolution digital visual and spectral images tagged by Global
   Positioning Satellite (GPS) coordinates can be successfully used to
   cost-effectively identify the majority of conditions/defects on electric
   power lines. Experiments show that the condition and defect detection
   rate of the airborne inventory and inspection system is significantly
   higher than rates derived from traditional aerial patrols and comparable
   to values achieved from driving patrols. Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS) based mapping tools can be used to quickly and efficiently
   interpret digital images collected from aerial platforms. Digital images
   provide an archival record of the condition of the distributed assets to
   estimate the long-term performance of the assets and to define
   cost-effective maintenance and replacement schedules.}},

Abstract = {{The current situation in PCP is marked by development of complex
   products taking into account quality, costs, time and innovation aims in
   a concurrent environment. Unidentified mistakes in early phases cause
   high expenses and time delays in late phases. A possible solution is
   collaborative engineering based on digital mock-up (DMU). DMU is a basis
   for visualization based on complete and current 3D models, and used by
   product development teams as a communication method. During discussion
   of product geometry based on DMU (kinematics, assembly...), the

   PMI in DMU drives key activities like design or manufacturing: PMI in 3D
   models is not only text describing technical requirements, it has also
   to integrate non-technical information that has direct or indirect links

Abstract = {{This article analyses the diffusion of digital cameras and other digital
   imaging techniques among professional photographers. It is based on
   interviews with photographers and others in the image industry and a
   survey conducted in the spring of 1999. Digital cameras have diffused
   more slowly than expected, whereas other types of digital image
   techniques are widely used. The article focuses this difference, and
   analyses obstacles to the diffusion of digital cameras. First, the
   competition between new and old image technologies is discussed briefly.
   The photographic production chain is analysed next. It is found that
   techniques used in core activities in photography diffuse slowly, but
   techniques used in peripheral activities diffuse more easily. This leads
   to a discussion of prevalent perspectives on photography among its
   practitioners. It is concluded that a visual innovation dynamic prevails
   whereas technical innovations are less important for the competition
   among photographers. Lastly, contact networks among photographers are
   analysed and it is shown that digital camera users interact much more
   with each other than would be expected on the assumption of randomness.
   It is concluded that in this case, diffusion depends on 1) which parts
   of the production chain are affected and how central they are for
   professional role identities, 2) the social construction of the relation
   between technical and visual innovations and 3) whether users are able
   to communicate among themselves and with others about the concrete
   problems and possibilities of digital image technologies.}},

   well underway. With the exponential rise in interactive information
   exploration and dissemination through the World-Wide Web, the major
   inhibitors of rapid access to on-line video data are the management of
   capture and storage, and content-based intelligent search and indexing
   techniques. This paper proposes an approach for content-based analysis
   and event-based indexing of sports video. It includes a novel method to
   organize shots-classifying shots as close shots and far shots, an
   original idea of blur extent-based event detection, and an innovative
   local mutation-based algorithm for caption detection and retrieval.
   Results on extensive real TV programs demonstrate the applicability of

Abstract = {{South African major cities have undergone, in recent times, major
   changes in parallel with the political turmoil of the last decade. New
   socio-economic policies have indirectly caused massive migrations from
   the countryside and peripheral townships towards the urban areas, of
   people in search of a better life. Job seekers and informal traders have
   consequently flooded Central Business Districts and traditional formal
   businesses have moved out to Mid-Town developments. Residential areas
   close to city centers have been abandoned by previous residents and
   re-occupied by large numbers of legal and illegal new immigrants.
   Because of lack of available inner-city residential space, peri-urban
   areas, on the outskirt of SA cities, have been populated by informal
   settlements, accommodating a multi-cultural population, living in
   sub-standard conditions. This paper describes the social, economic and
   political factors, which have determined such rapid changes in the last
   decades. New community empowerment and sustainability strategies adopted
   by Metropolitan Authorities are also examined, in line with new
   Government national guidelines. Among the new strategies adopted, this
   paper describes the innovative use of digital 3D Visualization and
   interactive Technologies, already adopted for accelerated planning and
   capable of bridging gaps in understanding between decision makers and
   the population affected by proposed urban developments.}},

Abstract = {{Reverse Engineering (RE) is desirable to create models of existing
   objects. The research emphases of Reverse Engineering are data capture
   and modeling. Aiming at the deficiency of the traditional copy of
   prototype, this article introduces a system that is based on Compute
   Aided Engineering (CAE) and focuses on the re-design after construction
   of model. This reverse design concept is intent to surpass the
   performance of prototype through simulating and pre-analysis. This
   article gives a specific example, the re-construction of fan model,
   which mainly illustrates the key role of the simulation analysis with
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Based on exact exchange of data and
   re-construction of CAD model, digital wind tunnel provided an effective
   way to verify hydro-mechanical and mechanical performances of the
   re-constructed CAD model. Then designers can ameliorate the product
   through changing some specific details. The result showed that the
   adoption of CAE in Reverse Engineering is innovative and competitive.}},

Abstract = {{Life-long learning is an instrument for knowledge workers to stay
   up-to-date in an innovative economy. So far higher education has not
   been very successful in realising life-long learning. A possibly helpful
   educational concept is the `virtual learning organisation'. The newly
   founded Dutch Digital University, for example, has taken this concept on
   board. The virtual learning organisation, however, is a `container'
   concept. Key questions are: what constitutes a virtual learning
   organisation and how can it be constructed in different domains? In this
   paper the virtual learning organisation is seen as an extension of the
   normal work situation of the knowledge worker. A model is presented for
   knowledge work and career development in such innovative organisations
   that have been used in practice to construct a successful virtual
   learning organisation.}},

Abstract = {{In March 2000, The World Bank sounded an alarm that higher education in
   developing countries was in crisis. It is overcrowded, chronically
   underfunded, poorly managed, and beset with inadequate faculty and
   curricula. Additionally, research universities face an array of
   especially serious problems. The disappearance of a research agenda and
   postgraduate studies from these universities has serious consequences.
   The inability to pursue research isolates the nation's elite scholars
   and scientists, leaving them unable to keep up with developments in
   their own fields (Task Force on Higher Education and Society, 2000 and
   UNESCO, 1998).
   It can be argued that in higher education there are three main learning
   activities: taught courses, research, and projects/peer learning. Recent
   advances in technology have resulted in internet-based learning, which
   has significantly contributed to the improvement of distance learning in
   higher education. However, most of the work seems to focus on taught
   e-courses with little emphasis on research. Computing networks, modem
   communication techniques and digital libraries seem to offer valuable
   facilities that can assist research students in carrying out their work
   at a distance. The e-PhD is an international collaborative programme run
   by the University of Nottingham, for developing countries. It started
   last year with a pilot scheme with Egypt. It is an innovative approach
   employing modem distance learning techniques and the internet to conduct
   postgraduate education and joint research studies.}},

Abstract = {{The basis of compression is redundancy removal. In digital image
   compression, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to remove the
   inter-pixel redundancies. Although the DWT is very powerful at removing
   the linear redundancy, there are still various correlations left in the
   DWT coefficients. These correlations can be modeled as within-subband
   clustering(Intra) and cross-subband similarity(Inter). The success of
   recent wavelet image coders can be mainly attributed to the innovative
   strategies for data organization and representation that exploit these
   Inter and Intra correlations one way or the other. In this paper, we try
   to quantify the performance loss if these correlations are removed.
   Experiments are performed on two best zero-tree coders: set partitioning
   in hierarchical trees(SPIHT) and set partitioned embedded block
   coder(SPECK). After recapitulate the data organization adopted in SPIHT
   and SPECK in a more general tree formation framework, a block or
   coefficient based pseudorandomization is applied to remove the Inter,
   Intra correlation. Our experimental results indicate that the
   performance loss due to the removal of Infra correlation is much bigger
   than the performance loss due to the removal of Inter correlation.
   Therefore, the excellent PSNR performance of the well-known SPIHT
   algorithm should be much credited for the data structure that exploit
   the Intra correlation although only the Inter correlation is widely
   mentioned in-the previous literature.}},

Abstract = {{An important element of the growing e-economy is the emergence of firms
   in the telecommunications sector and the ways in which these are
   evolving, competing and attempting to capture markets based on strategic
   goals. A key aspect is the `wireless' or `mobile' telephony phenomenon,
   which has attracted users across the globe and is gaining importance as
   new developments linking it to the internet are realised. Utilising the
   perspectives of competitive advantage and national innovation systems
   theory, our work examines the evolution of Nokia's mobile phones and
   mobile, fixed and internet protocol (IP) networks divisions. The success
   of the firm can be attributed to a variety of factors. Among the most
   important are employment of the innovative industrial cluster concept,
   networking, and state promotion of an emerging information and
   communication technology (ICT) duster through the liberalisation of the
   telephony market. Within the firm itself identification of core
   competencies (digital signal processing, electronics manufacturing,
   software platforms and architectures) and the development of niche
   markets has been important. A major factor in the success has been the
   ability to evolve technology and to place leading edge innovative
   products in the market in a timely fashion.}},

Abstract = {{The societal diffusion of information and communications technologies
   (ICTs) remains starkly uneven at all scales. It is in the contemporary
   city that this unevenness becomes most visible. In cities, clusters and
   enclaves of `superconnected' people, firms and institutions often rest
   cheek-by-jowel with large numbers of people with non-existent or
   rudimentary access to communications technologies. In such a context,
   this paper has two objectives, reflected in its two parts. The first
   part of the paper seeks to demonstrate that dominant trends in ICT
   development are currently helping to support new extremes of social and
   geographical unevenness within and between human settlements and cities,
   in both the North and the South. The paper's second part aims to explore
   the prospect that such stark `urban digital divides' might be
   ameliorated through progressive and innovative policy initiatives which
   treat cities and electronic technologies in parallel. It does this using
   a range of illustrative exemplars from a variety of contexts.}},

Abstract = {{No one doubts that the ability to create innovative designs and get them
   to market before anyone else remains key to long-term success. It has
   been the catalyst for change for many years and nearly every
   manufacturing company has seen the benefits of adopting a digital
   development environment. Most have made advances in the `form and fit'
   stages of the design process - knowing how components fit together in
   `virtual space'. Yet getting the design to perform as expected for
   functional performance attributes such as noise and vibration, fide \&
   handling, comfort, safety \& durability is still a challenge. It's the
   missing link that is needed to turn the digital enterprise vision into a
   real competitive advantage.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid generation of computer models from existing buildings will
   enable to enhance creativity and innovation within the architectural
   design process. Over the past two decades, redesign has been extensively
   studied and several efforts to build computer models of architectural
   scenes have been made. However, the traditional methods of constructing
   models from existing buildings are particularly labour-intensive,
   implying the survey of the site, the digitisation of existing
   architectural drawings, or the modification of existing computer-aided
   architectural design data. In this paper a new approach based on the
   replication of the human vision process is proposed. This process uses
   two-dimensional photos to create three-dimensional computer models
   either to produce sophisticated photo-realistic renderings or to
   generate surface models for simulation purposes and rapid prototyping
   applications. The starting part of the computer code is briefly
   described in this paper from a mathematical perspective.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective was to assess dune vulnerability-a reduced ability to
   adapt to change, which is of serious concern not only in Western Europe
   but on a world scale. A main root checklist together with two daughter
   ones were devised in order to achieve this objective. The main root
   checklist comprised six categories (site and dune morphology, beach
   condition, surface character of the seaward 200m of dune, vegetation,
   anthropogenic impact and protection measures in place) and dunes were
   classified according to their vulnerability compared to protection
   measures. The Resilience daughter checklist encompassed dune erosion,
   sand input. sand retention, degradation by use and dune management. This
   was compared with risk factors such as obstacles to dune transgression
   and recreation. The geomorphology, aeolian, vegetation, anthropogenic,
   marine influences daughter checklist looked at 30 dune systems in the
   Gulf of Cadiz and assessed dune condition by a dune vulnerability index
   based on the above conditioning influences. Values for all checklists
   were expressed as percentages. Over 200 dune sites in Spain, France,
   Portugal and the UK were analysed by means of these checklists. Results
   confirmed that regional trends concerned with dune vulnerability could
   be assessed, although successful differentiation at the end of the dune
   spectrum (large sand sheets, e.g. Pyla. France and meadow formation,
   e.g. many of the UK systems) and at the local scale were muted. An
   innovative aerial digital photographic system was developed and
   photographs were successfully used to assess dune condition,
   anthropogenic impact on dune systems, etc., i.e. the checklist
   parameters and was used to modify checklist procedures in assessing
   regional dune degradation. Ca 70\% of the checklist parameters could be
   obtained by this means. This also provided a photographic record of the
   current dune condition. Principal component analysis provided a strong
   justification for the majority of checklist questions and the approach
   and relevance of the technique. The enumerated techniques provide
   valuable toots for dune managers. Rapid assessment of large areas of
   coastline can be obtained at a low cost and the resulting remote sensed
   images can provide a permanent record of the condition of the
   photographed dunes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Telepathology is the practice of pathology at a distance by using video
   imaging and telecommunications. Significant progress has been made in
   telepathology. To date, 12 classes of telepathology systems have been
   engineered. Rapid and ultrarapid virtual slide processors may further
   expand the range of telepathology applications. Next-generation digital
   imaging light microscopes, such as miniaturized microscope arrays (MMA),
   may make virtual slide processing a routine laboratory tool. Diagnostic
   accuracy of telepathology is comparable with that of conventional light
   microscopy for most diagnoses. Current telepathology applications
   include intraoperative frozen sections services, routine surgical
   pathology services, second opinions, and subspecialty consultations.
   Three telepathology practice models are discussed: the subspecialty
   practice (SSP) model; the case triage practice (CT?) model; and the
   virtual group practice (VGP) model. Human factors influence performance
   with telepathology. Experience,with 500 telepathology cases from
   multiple organs significantly reduces the video viewing time per case (P
   < .01). Many technology innovations can be represented as S-curves.
   After long incubation periods, technology use and/or efficiency may
   accelerate. Telepathology appears to be following an S-curve for a
   technical innovation. Copyright (C) 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company.}},

Abstract = {{Portable terminals supporting the Digital Enhanced Cordless
   Telecommunications (DECT) standard have entered the world market the
   last few years. For such devices low energy dissipation is of critical
   importance. In this paper, the design of a low-power fully digital
   baseband receiver that embodies innovative and conventional low-power
   optimizations is presented. The proposed baseband receiver complies with
   the DECT standard as far as digital modem functions are concerned. The
   developed energy-conscious, low complexity DECT demodulation algorithm
   and the low-power hardware architecture are described in a detailed
   manner.}},

Abstract = {{The conduct of net-enabled business, known variously as electronic
   commerce (EC) or e-Business, has changed the landscape and opportunities
   for IS research by shifting the focus from internal to
   customer/partnering systems. The article examines the two primary dyadic
   net-enabled relationships in the marketplace: B2C and B2B. It also
   considers issues that extend beyond these two relationships. B2C
   practice and research are analyzed from: (1) consumer, (2) service, and
   (3) risk perspectives. Three central issues of B2B or supply chain
   practice and research are next considered: (1) beyond simple
   efficiencies, (2) innovations in B2B technology, and (3) information
   visibility. Finally, four overarching research issues are examined: (1)
   strategy, (2) organizational design, (3) metrics, and (4) managing IS.
   Not all research on the net-enabled organization (NEO) is IS research,
   and it is critical that IS journals maintain their distinctive focus.
   Within the bounds of the net-enabled revolution, though, the IS field
   has an opportunity to shape the phenomenon with timely, theory-based
   work that will disseminate beyond the IS academic and practitioner
   communities.}},

   supplemented top-down by innovators in the Americas and Europe and
   bottom-up by sites serving one locality in Massachusetts. Despite losing
   typical print elements, the late modern designs emphasize text, with
   minimal multimedia content, especially on local sites. Instead of giving
   outlet to news handicraft, corporate and promotional models abound. The
   web flattens hierarchies, exposes content sources, and deforms
   journalistic authority by disarticulating the audience. Historical
   parallels include 19th-century flows of design innovation from
   advertising into news and of informational tasks from reporting into
   photojournalism. Newspapers can coexist with the internet while
   surrendering some tasks, such as archiving factual background, becoming
   instead more analytical advocates.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative method to study plant cross-sectional area changes under
   wind conditions is presented. Changes in soybean (KS3494) plant
   cross-sectional area at different wind velocities were studied using
   image-processing techniques with photographs taken in a wind tunnel.
   Three stages of greenhouse-grown soybean plants (V4, V6, and V8) and
   four wind velocities (6, 7, 8, and 9 m/s) were used. Changes in plant
   cross-sectional area were computed in comparison to plants with no wind
   applied. Plant images were processed in the KHOROS image-processing
   system, and the percentage change of plant cross-sectional area before
   and after wind application was calculated and analyzed. The results
   showed that plant cross-sectional areas decreased linearly with
   increased wind velocity over the range tested. Plants in V4 and V6
   growth stages were not significantly different in plant cross-sectional
   area changes, but they were significantly different from plants in the
   V8 growth stage.}},

Title = {{A packing algorithm for particles of arbitrary shapes}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{175-186}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Particle packing is a subject of both academic and industrial
   importance, and a number of packing algorithms have been proposed and
   widely used. However, most of these packing algorithms can only deal
   with spheres and a few regular shapes. If applied to arbitrarily shaped
   particles, they would have difficulties in at least one of three
   aspects. First, arbitrary shapes are notoriously difficult to model
   mathematically. Secondly, efficient algorithms for collision and overlap
   detection of arbitrary shapes are difficult to derive and more difficult
   to implement. Thirdly, the packing program would be very computationally
   expensive for routine and practical use. This paper describes a new,
   digital approach to particle packing, which can avoid many of the
   difficulties suffered by conventional methods. The key innovation is
   digitisation of both particle shapes and the packing space. Thus, a
   particle is now just a coherent collection of pixels or voxels,
   regardless of its shape, moving on a square lattice, onto which the
   packing space is mapped. Using the digital approach, it is easy to pack
   particles of any shapes and sizes into a container of any geometry,
   generally requiring no more than an ordinary PC. Although, as yet, the
   packing algorithm does not involve physical forces explicitly, it can
   simulate some physical phenomena such as size segregation. The ability
   to pack particles in their real shapes, rather than approximated as
   spheres, opens up many new industrial and academic opportunities, some
   of which are discussed. Examples of packing density predictions of
   particles subject to various effects, including vibration and rotation,
   are given. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A case-control study was conducted among 205 women in Michigan and Ohio
   who were diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease
   (UCTD) to investigate the significance of self-reported past exposures
   to implanted silicone-containing or non-silicone-containing medical
   devices. The 205 UCTD cases were compared with 2,095 controls who were
   sampled by random digit dialing. When silicone-containing devices,
   including shunts and catheters, were analyzed collectively, a
   significant association was observed (odds ratio (OR) = 2.81, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.34, 5.89). The odds ratio for exposure to
   breast implants was increased, but not significantly (OR = 2.22, 95\%
   CI: 0.65, 7.57). Among the non-silicone-containing devices, artificial
   joints (OR = 5.01, 95\% CI: 1.60, 15.71) and orthopedic metallic
   fixation devices (OR = 1.95, 95\% CI: 1.05, 3.60) were associated with
   UCTD. The estimations of risk associated with implanted medical devices
   in UCTD cases were explored in a comparison with 660 scleroderma
   patients who were ascertained concurrently in Michigan and Ohio. In
   general, the associations that were observed with
   non-silicone-containing devices, and more specifically with the fixation
   devices, persisted in the comparison of UCTD cases with scleroderma
   patients. The studies conducted among populations in Michigan and Ohio
   are intended to stimulate new hypotheses, innovative approaches, and the
   fostering of understanding of the environmental determinants of
   autoimmune disease.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Because of the recent innovative growth in computer technology,
   digital imaging, and the Internet, we can take advantage of these
   facilities for education and clinical work in nuclear medicine. We
   developed a tele-nuclear medicine conference system with electronic mail
   (e-mail) on the Internet. Methods: Twenty-one physicians (20
   radiologists, 1 neurologist), 6 technologists and 2 medical students in
   six university hospitals (Japan 5, Canada 1), 5 local hospitals in Japan
   participated in this project. We used digital still cameras (330 k
   pixels) equipped with a floppy disk drive and 10 x optical zoom to
   digitize images with JPEG compression (640 x 480 matrix). The images
   were attached to e-mail messages (containing a brief description of each
   case). The mail was sent simultaneously to all members on the mailing
   list. Scintigram and SPECT images as well as other radiological images
   were sent by e-mail. Reply mails about each case were sent to all
   members via the mailing list. Results: During a period of 6 months, 18
   cases (tumor/infection: 7, bone: 6, cardiovascular: 1, neurology; 3,
   endocrine: 1) with 144 e-mails. (average 5.6/case) were submitted to the
   conference. The average period of discussion was 15.6 days. The number
   of attached images was 1 to 9 (average, 4.2/e-mails). JPEG compression
   rate was 1/10 to 1/20. The quality of the images was good enough for
   discussion. Some cases required additional images for further
   discussion. Conclusion: Our tele-nuclear medicine conference with an
   electronic mailing list and digital camera was simple and low-cost. The
   conference system was useful for education and clinical work.}},

Abstract = {{Indiana University has led the way in both the 1990s and the current
   decade in innovative projects whose goal is to create and continue to
   build usable digital music libraries comprising ordinary materials in
   more than one format for teaching, learning, studying, and performing
   music. Concurrently, innovative methods have been developed during the
   process of digitizing discrete collections at the Library of Congress,
   Johns Hopkins University, Duke University, and the University of
   California at Berkeley (by Mary Kay Duggan). Meanwhile both the
   materials and the tools of the ordinary music librarian have become
   digital. Music publishers are beginning to distribute complete scores
   electronically, although acquisitions systems are not yet functioning to
   music librarians' standards. The Culpeper Project at the Library of
   Congress will achieve much-needed research into preservation of recorded
   sound. Online access to collections and archives and to full-text
   documents is now widely available, and reference librarians must keep up
   with constantly changing availability and protocols while advising on
   better Web interfaces based on users' needs. The use of digital audio
   reserves is spreading rapidly. Music librarianship is fast becoming a
   collaborative art with technological innovation.}},

Title = {{A multicarrier CDMA architecture based on orthogonal complementary codes
   for new generations of wideband wireless communications}},
Journal = {{IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE}},

Abstract = {{This article is a review of our ongoing research effort to construct a
   new multicarrier CDMA architecture based on orthogonal complete
   complementary codes, characterized by its innovative spreading
   modulation scheme, uplink and downlink signaling design, and digital
   receiver implementation for multipath signal detection. There are
   several advantages of the proposed CDMA architecture compared to
   conventional CDMA systems pertinent to current 2G and 3G standards.
   First of all, it can achieve a spreading efficiency (SE) very close to
   one (the SE is defined as the amount of information bit(s) conveyed by
   each chip); whereas SEs of conventional CDMA systems equal 1/N, where N
   denotes the length of spreading codes. Second, it offers MAI-free
   operation in both up- and downlink transmissions in an MAI-AWGN channel,
   which can significantly reduce the co-channel interference responsible
   for capacity decline of a CDMA system. Third, the proposed CDMA
   architecture is able to offer a high bandwidth efficiency due to the use
   of its unique spreading modulation scheme and orthogonal carries.
   Lastly, the proposed CDMA architecture is particularly suited to
   multirate signal transmission due to the use of an offset stacked
   spreading modulation scheme, which simplifies the rate-matching
   algorithm relevant to multimedia services and facilitates asymmetric
   traffic in up- and downlink transmissions for IP-based applications.
   Based on the above characteristics and the obtained results, it is
   concluded in this article that the proposed CDMA architecture has a
   great potential for applications in future wide-band mobile
   communications beyond 3G, which is expected to offer a very high data
   rate in hostile mobile channels.}},

Abstract = {{Life at the beginning of the 21st century is characterized by the
   ever-increasing pace of technological development and the associated
   changes in patterns of communication, work and leisure. This paper
   comments on some of the benefits and limitations of current technology,
   the potential of emerging technologies to deliver enhanced quality of
   life for all on a global basis, and the role of human factors in
   enabling such a vision to become a reality. The author presents an
   integrative framework for the human factors (HF) domain. In this
   framework the key HF inputs to be made at each stage of the innovation
   design life cycle are identified, as well as the crucial enabling
   processes associated with change management necessary for HF to have a
   significant impact. Combined together, these elements constitute a human
   factors strategy. The author suggests that such strategies have a
   powerful capability to harness information and communications
   technologies and to ensure the delivery of wide-ranging benefits. (C)

Abstract = {{In our previous studies the volume-averaged strain rates, of 2-22 s(-1),
   were obtained in an oscillatory baffled column (OBC) based on velocity
   measurements over a half baffled cell for oscillatory Reynolds numbers
   of 1000-4030. These values are very low compared with those in a
   traditional stirred tank vessel (at least > 100 s(-1)) for similar
   operational conditions and the same power consumption. It was also
   observed that the volume-averaged strain rates in the OBC fluctuated
   with the phase of oscillation over any cycle, with high values
   coinciding with eddy generation, and low values with eddy cessation. The
   objective of this study is to show that such fluctuations can be
   attenuated by employing innovative flexible baffles, whose inside edges
   move with the fluid oscillation. In this paper experimental measurements
   of velocity vector maps and strain rate distributions using Digital
   Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) are presented for both conventional
   and flexible baffles in an OBC. Mixing characterisation, in terms of
   axial dispersion coefficients, are compared for both baffle designs. The
   results show that the flexible baffles can reduce the fluctuations and
   magnitudes of the volume-averaged strain rates in the OBC without
   compromising the mixing performance. Low and uniform strain rate
   distributions in time and space are essential biochemical, biomedical
   and pharmaceutical applications where shear sensitive cultures are
   involved. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in computing and communications are leading to the
   creation of large-scale databases of visual and multimedia information.
   Such databases are finding ready applications in a wide range of fields
   such as advertising and marketing, education and training,
   entertainment, medicine, and remote sensing. Because of the very nature
   of visual and multimedia data, new and innovative methods are called for
   in modeling, processing, organizing and indexing of this data for
   efficient storage, management, access, and delivery of the content. The
   goal of this special section is to highlight the new research areas and
   explore technology frontiers, by soliciting and selecting quality papers
   addressing issues from various aspects of storage, search, retrieval,
   and processing of digital media data (video/image/audio) and across a
   wide range of research disciplines.
   For this special section, we have solicited papers in relevant areas,
   ranging from content capture and processing, database management, new
   results on similarity measures and semantic features, and query methods
   to multimedia systems embracing leading-edge technology, and special
   applications of media management, retrieval, and processing across
   multiple fields, from consumer media systems, digital libraries, and
   media imaging to remote sensing. We encouraged the authors of some very
   promising papers in the SPIE/IS\&T Electronic Imaging Symposium (San
   Jose) 2001 Conference on Storage and Retrieval of Media Databases to
   submit a full journal-quality version of their conference manuscript to
   this special section. We also received submissions from outside of the
   conference, in response to our general call for papers. All submitted
   papers have undergone multiple peer-reviews, and we accepted 12 papers
   after two rounds of revisions and follow-up reviews.
   We have classified the 12 papers into four major categories: (A)
   Content-based Image Retrieval (the first two papers), (B) Content-based
   Video Retrieval (the next four papers), (C) Video Categorization and
   Summarization (the following three papers), and (D) Systems and
   Applications (the last three papers).
   We would like to thank all those who have contributed significant time
   and effort to make this special section what it is today-the authors,
   JEI editor Jan Allebach, JEI staff members, and our reviewers, in
   addition to the efforts of the guest editors. This was a tremendous
   accomplishment given the tight deadlines we had to meet.
   We hope you will enjoy the papers.}},

Abstract = {{The perching foot of living birds is commonly characterized by a
   reversed or opposable digit I (hallux). Primitively, the hallux of
   nonavian theropod dinosaurs was unreversed and lay parallel to digits
   II-IV. Among basal birds, a unique digital innovation evolved in which
   the hallux opposes digits II-IV. This digital configuration is critical
   for grasping and perching. I studied skeletons of modern birds with a
   range of hallucal designs, from unreversed (anteromedially directed) to
   fully reversed (posteriorly directed). Two primary correlates of
   hallucal orientation were revealed. First, the fossa into which
   metatarsal I articulates is oriented slightly more posteriorly on the
   tarsometatarsus, rotating the digit as a unit. Second, metatarsal I
   exhibits a distinctive torsion of its distal shaft relative to its
   proximal articulation with the tarsometatarsus, reorienting the distal
   condyles and phalanges of digit I. Herein, I present a method that
   facilitates the re-evaluation of hallucal orientation in fossil avians
   based on morphology alone. This method also avoids potential
   misinterpretations of hallucal orientation in fossil birds that could
   result from preserved appearance alone. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the role of design, as the emergent arrangement of
   concrete details that embodies a new idea, in mediating between
   innovations and established institutional fields as entrepreneurs
   attempt to introduce change. Analysis of Thomas Edison s system of
   electric lighting offers insights into how the grounded details of an
   innovation's design shape its acceptance and ultimate impact. The notion
   of robust design is introduced to explain how Edison's design strategy
   enabled his organization to gain acceptance for an innovation that would
   ultimately displace the existing institutions of the gas industry. By
   examining the principles through which design allows entrepreneurs to
   exploit the established institutions while simultaneously retaining the
   flexibility to displace them, this analysis highlights the value of
   robust design strategies in innovation efforts, including the
   phonograph, the online service provider, and the digital video

Abstract = {{The ancestral role of the Hox gene family is specifying morphogenetic
   differences along the main body axis. In vertebrates, HoxD genes were
   also co-opted along with the emergence of novel structures such as limbs
   and genitalia. We propose that these functional recruitments relied on
   the appearance, or implementation, of regulatory sequences outside of
   the complex. Whereas transgenic human and murine HOXD clusters could
   function during axial patterning, in mice they were not expressed
   outside the trunk. Accordingly, deletion of the entire cluster abolished
   axial expression, whereas recently acquired regulatory controls were
   preserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is in the field of vehicle positioning technology for the
   Intelligent Transportation Systems. The ideas of an innovative
   light-emitting diode (LED)-based location beacon system are developed
   and verified. The system developed is a combination of several latest
   technologies which include a CMOS vision sensor, high brightness LEDs,
   and digital image processing techniques. It belongs to a new kind of
   simplex communication link. A digital camera is used to capture images
   contained in the LED beacon signal. The captured digital images are
   processed by the algorithms developed and a location code is extracted.
   The location code can be used for calibration of a vehicle positioning
   system which may consist of a GPS, Inertial Navigation System (INS) and
   other sensors. The issues examined include the structure of the
   transmitter and the receiver, the signaling method, the transmission
   protocol of the LED panel, the relationship between the camera capturing
   rate and the LED pattern update rate, the digital camera exposure
   technology, and the efficiency of the image processing algorithms.
   Experiments using a prototype transmitter and a receiver were performed.
   The experimental results provide a good demonstration of the viability
   of the ideas and methodologies developed.}},

Abstract = {{The explosion of information and the popularity of the Internet and
   commercial search engines has required librarians to look afresh at
   their profession. With the overwhelming amount of information now
   available have come new demands and expectations. The need to bring
   information to the remote user has encouraged the creation of many
   innovative services linking new technology with traditional library
   services. How do librarians build on their age-old status as trusted
   advisors and create services that will both meet demand and revitalize
   the profession? How do we take the reference desk to cyberspace? The
   Collaborative Digital Reference Service (CDRS) launched by the Library
   of Congress and partner libraries is one such response. CDRS provides
   professional reference service to users anytime anywhere through an
   international digital network of libraries. This article explores how
   CDRS began and what lies ahead for this and other innovative e-reference

Abstract = {{Shaker tables are commonly used in laboratories for automotive vehicle
   component testing to study durability and acoustics performance. An
   example is development testing of car seats. However, it is difficult to
   repeat the measured road data perfectly with the response of a shaker
   table as there are basic differences in dynamic characteristics between
   a flexible vehicle and substantially rigid shaker table. In addition,
   there are performance limits in the shaker table drive systems that can
   limit correlation. In practice, an optimal drive signal for the
   actuators is created iteratively. During each iteration, the error
   between the road data and the response data is minimised by an
   optimising algorithm which is generally a part of the feed back loop of
   the shake table controller.
   This study presents a systematic investigation to the errors in time and
   frequency domains as well as joint time-frequency domain and an
   evaluation of different digital signal processing techniques that have
   been used in previous work. In addition, we present an innovative
   approach that integrates the dynamic characteristics of car seats and
   the human body into the error-minimising iteration process. We found
   that the iteration process can be shortened and the error reduced by
   using a weighting function created by normalising the frequency response
   function of the car seat. Two road data test sets were used in the
   study. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{During the course of its historical development the Beta-plant has been
   modernised and extended in different parts by means of investments. In
   this way a very complex, inhomogeneous automation landscape has evolved
   over the last thirty years. Suitable concepts have been developed and
   realised to a large extent to ensure not only good maintenance in the
   case of disturbance but also quick and flexible reactions to the needs
   and wants of production.
   Past development has led to four generations of technical equipment
   standing next to each other. The situation in control is similar: Next
   to the most innovative digital systems with the possibility of online
   changes there is still discrete control technology for which every
   additional logical link requires the installation of a new electronic
   card. Due to the historical development of the plant there are now 11
   different systems for information technology. It has proved to be
   extremely useful in many areas to install, project and commission
   sufficient reserve capacity straight away. This additional capacity
   needs then only be filled with life as required. Costs for such
   installed reserves are usually very low.}},

   sensitivity to weakly absorbing details, these techniques seem to be
   very promising for applications in the medical field. On the other hand,
   digital radiology is undergoing a wide diffusion, and its benefits are
   presently very well understood. Up to now, however, the strong pixel
   size constraints associated with phase contrast pattern detection
   limited the possibility of exploiting the advantages of phase contrast
   in digital radiology applications, In this paper, an innovative setup
   capable of removing the pixel size constraints, and thus opening the way
   to low dose digital phase contrast imaging, is described. Furthermore,
   we introduce an imaging technique based on the detection of radiation
   scattered at small angles: the information extracted from the sample is
   increased at no dose expense. We believe that several radiological
   fields, mammography being the first important example, may benefit from
   the herein described innovative imaging techniques. (C) 2001 American

   Wissel Mossbauer velocity transducers and electronics supplies energy
   synchronization for indefinite collection times. Magnetic materials

Abstract = {{Equine dentistry has gained renewed interest because of the significant
   advances made in the last decade. Innovations in motorized and hand
   instruments allow practitioners to perform dental procedures with
   greater ease and precision. The full mouth speculum, appropriate
   sedation, and equine cranial support allow for a safe and thorough
   visual and digital exam, enabling the practitioner to perform proper
   dental procedures without significant patient trauma. Continuing
   education provides veterinarians the knowledge to identify dental
   pathology and perform prophylactic and corrective procedures with
   confidence and understanding. Modified procedures, new techniques, and
   improved instruments are complimented by recent publications describing
   prophylactic and corrective procedures, surgical techniques, nonsurgical
   treatments, pathologic conditions, and aging in the horse. Continued
   research, new treatment protocols, progressive practice philosophies,
   and advances in preventive care are shaping the future of equine dental

   birthday. The need for valid climate forecasts has been underlined by
   the recognition that human activities are now modifying the climate. The
   complex nature of the climate system has resulted in the development of
   a surprisingly large array of modelling tools. Some are relatively
   simple, such as the earth systems and energy balance models (EBMs),
   while others are highly sophisticated models which challenge the fastest
   speeds of the most powerful supercomputers. Indeed, this discipline of
   the latter half of the twentieth century is so critically dependent on
   the availability of a means of undertaking powerful calculations that
   its evolution has matched that of the digital computer. The
   multi-faceted nature of the climate system demands high quality, and
   global observations and innovative parameterizations through which
   processes which cannot be described or calculated explicitly are
   captured to the extent deemed necessary. Interestingly, results from
   extremely simple, as well as highly complex and many intermediate model
   types are drawn upon today for effective formulation and evaluation of
   climate policies. This paper discusses some of the important
   developments during the first 40 years of climate modelling from the
   first models of the global atmosphere to today's models, which typically
   consist of integrated multi-component representations of the full
   climate system. The pressures of policy-relevant questions more clearly
   underline the tension between the need for evaluation against quality
   data and the unending pressure to improve spatial and temporal
   resolutions of climate models than at any time since the inception of
   climate modelling. Copyright (C) 2001 Royal Meteorological Society.}},

Abstract = {{Economical changes and technical innovations are dramatically
   transforming the way consumers live. Homes that used to have one or two
   black telephones now have multiple computers, peripherals like printers
   and scanners, televisions, stereos, DVD players, VCRs, cordless
   telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other electronic
   devices. The necessity to interconnect these devices and to share common
   resources gives rise to the home networking concept.
   Connecting the home network to the Internet was the original rote of an
   emerging class of devices called residential gateway (RG). This concept
   will evolve over the next few years from devices that provide basic
   broadband access to complex integrated services gateways enabling
   integration of voice, video and data as well as other value-added
   services like remote management.
   This paper introduces the concept of the next generation RG and explains
   the opportunities and benefits that this new device class can bring to
   equipment manufacturers, service providers and consumers. Different
   evolution scenarios and architectures for the deployment of this new
   generation RG will be proposed and discussed as well as requirements in
   term of functional features such as quality-of-service (QoS)
   capabilities, media gateway, media gateway controller, NAT, DHCP,
   firewall, etc. for this next generation RG.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet has led to the widespread trade of digital information
   products. These products exhibit unusual properties such as high fixed
   costs and near-zero marginal costs. They need to be developed on
   compressed time frames by spatially and temporally distributed teams,
   have short lifecycles, and high perishability. This paper addresses the
   challenges that information product development (IPD) teams face.
   Drawing on the knowledge intensive nature of IPD tasks, we identify
   potential solutions to these problems that can be provided by a
   knowledge management system. We discuss a prototype Knowledge Management
   System (KMS) that supports linking of artifacts to processes, flexible
   interaction and hypermedia services, distribution annotation and
   authoring as well as providing visibility to artifacts as they change
   over time. Using a case from the publishing industry, we illustrate
   how-contextualized decision paths/traces provide a rich base of formal
   and informal knowledge that supports IPD teams. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Power management holds the key to over \$400 billion annual savings in
   electrical energy and is relieving critical bottlenecks in the Internet
   backbone, Internet appliances, and portable electronics. The latest
   analog integrated circuits and power semiconductors are enabling these
   improvements. This paper focuses on these leading-edge devices, used in
   conjunction with innovative architectures. We examine future trends in
   silicon-based power transistors and diodes and discuss how the changing
   requirements of end users are driving new analog ICs, as well as
   different power management architectures. Trends in architecture for
   de-de conversion and motion control set the stage for improvements
   needed and planned in the power management products over the next
   several years. We examine various technologies for analog ICs and their
   interface with the digital world, We also compare the pros and cons of
   different techniques and levels of ``power-plus-control integration.{''}
   The discussion on power MOSFETs (including IGBTs) focuses on performance
   and technology trends in de-de conversion and motion control.
   State-of-the-art and future device topologies are presented.
   The future of diodes is also discussed. DC-DC conversion and motion
   control is the context. State-of-the-art and future device topologies
   are presented.
   Less than 25\% of all the world's electricity is efficiently managed.
   Our roadmaps must focus not only on making our existing applications
   more efficient and cost-effective, bur also on enabling the new
   applications that can address the remaining 75\%.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the current socio-economic context, in which innovation is a
   key driving force for the sustainable development, which challenges are
   facing education and research to enhance and nurture innovation and
   better contribute to help developing and exploiting engineering,
   science, and technology? This broad question has motivated the work
   behind the present work, which reviews the strongest themes of the Third
   International Conference on Technology Policy and Innovation (ICTPI),
   which was held in Austin, TX, in August of 1999. Under the broad
   designation of ``creating value for the 21st century in the globalized
   learning economy,{''} the Conference brought together a range of experts
   to discuss technology policy and the management of innovation in a
   context much influenced by a dynamic of change and a necessary balance
   between the creation and diffusion of knowledge. While the idea of
   inclusive development developed in previous Conferences entails a
   process of shared prosperity across the globe following local specific
   conditions, it is crucial to understand both the features of
   knowledge-induced growth in rich countries, as well as the challenges
   and opportunities for late-industrialized and less developed countries.
   Thus, this special issue includes a set of extended contributions to the
   Austin conference that are largely grounded on empirical experiences of
   different regional and national contexts. The aim of this introductory
   paper is to set the stage for these contributions, with an original
   contribution on possible roles for science and technology policy in the
   globalized economy. While much attention has been devoted to digital
   technologies, a more fundamental change at the start of the new
   millennium is the increasing importance of knowledge for economic
   prosperity and the emergence of a learning society. The analysis shows
   that innovation should be understood as a broad social and economic
   activity within the framework of that society: it should transcend any
   specific technology, even if revolutionary, and should be tied to
   attitudes and behaviors oriented towards the exploitation of change by
   adding value. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of technology has been a central issue in the strategy and
   organizations Literature. However, the focus of much of this work has
   been on what is essentially the ``supply side{''} of technical
   change-the evolution of firm capabilities. We present a demand-based
   view of technology evolution that is focused on the interaction between
   technology development and the demand environment in which the
   technology is ultimately evaluated. We develop a formal computer
   simulation model that explicitly considers the influence of
   heterogeneity in market demand-the presence of consumers with different
   needs and requirements-on firms' innovation choices. The model is used
   to examine the dynamics of product and process innovation (Utterback and
   Abernathy 1975). The analysis reveals that demand heterogeneity offers
   an alternative to supply-side explanations of the technology Life cycle.
   Further, by considering the implications of decreasing marginal utility
   from performance improvements, the model highlights the role of
   ``technologically satisfied{''} consumers in shaping innovation
   incentives, and suggests a rationale for a new stage in the technology
   life cycle characterized by increasing performance at a stable price.
   The stage has not yet been treated formally in the Literature, but is
   widely observed, most prominently in digital and information-based
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the diffusion of digital switches from 1983 to 1996.
   It expands upon the existing literature by extending the data available
   back an additional six years and by adding independent companies such as
   Frontier, SNET and Cincinnati Bell. The data (graciously provided by
   DataQuest) indicate that: the early period of adoption, which previous
   papers have been unable to examine due to lack of data, is significantly
   different than the later period of adoption. In the early period the
   installed base and the ability of larger networks to internalize more of
   the total benefits are the primary determinants of adoption, while the
   distribution of population becomes important in the later period as
   firms finish building our their densest areas. Overall, independents
   adopted earlier than the RBOCs, although this difference appears to be
   driven by the fact that independents were still using primarily
   electromechanical switches in 1983, while RBOCs had already invested
   heavily in analog technology. The data suggest that new technologies
   such as internet telephony will be adopted most rapidly by newly built
   networks such as Qwest and Level 3.}},

Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{76-87}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A recently introduced wireline formation-testing tool incorporates new
   digital-control technology that significantly improves formation fluid
   sampling and pressure testing. A primary focus of the new technology is
   improving the quality of reservoir fluid samples. An innovative pumpout
   design using a digital-control feedback system enables the tester to
   continuously monitor the fluid sampled and to make precise adjustments
   to the rate and pressure at which the fluid is withdrawn from the
   formation and injected into a sample chamber. The tool design
   incorporates a powerful pumping-system motor and an efficient hydraulic
   system. Consequently, invaded fluids surrounding the probes, such as mud
   filtrate, can be flushed 50\% faster than other wireline test tools
   whose capabilities have been made public.(1,2) Faster flushing enables
   quicker sampling of virgin formation fluids. Sample chambers can be
   filled against hydrostatic pressure to help ensure that
   pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) characteristics of the samples are not
   corrupted. Furthermore, additional pressure can be applied to minimize
   phase changes that might otherwise occur because of temperature
   gradients in the borehole. The new system also can be used to perform a
   closed-chamber PVT test for the bubblepoint of the fluid sampled.
   Closely spaced dual probes are deployed simultaneously for pressure
   testing and fluid sampling. Besides increasing tool reliability through
   redundancy, the two probes allow for advanced pressure-testing
   techniques. For example, formation anisotropy can be determined with an
   interference test between the two probes. Alternatively, a new
   pressure-pulsing technique can be used, which uses time delays between
   the probes' measured pressures to determine additional
   hydraulic-diffusive properties of the formation. The drawdowns can be
   rate- or pressure-controlled from either probe.
   The new tester is combinable with existing openhole logging tools, and
   tester tool sections an interchangeable. This combinability permits a
   complete wireline tool string to be configured to meet particular
   openhole formation-evaluation and testing needs in a single trip into
   the well. Current tool sections for the new tester include a dual-probe
   section (DPS), flow-control pumpout section (FPS), precision quartz
   gauge section (QGS), chamber valve section (CVS) for two sample chambers
   (1 to 5 gallons), and a multichamber section (MCS) with 1,000-cm(3)
   chambers. The MCS chambers are compatible with hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
   with Natl. Assn. Of Corrosion Engineers-approved materials and have an
   exemption with the U.S. Dept. of Transportation (DOT) for common-carrier
   transportation.
   This paper details operational features of the new tester and introduces
   new pressure-testing and sampling-interpretation techniques. Field-test
   results are used to demonstrate these features and techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives. As the use of picture archiving and
   communication systems (PACS) expands and radiology departments become
   increasingly filmless, it will become increasingly necessary to teach
   physicians how to use PACS and download diagnostic images. The authors
   developed an instruction method in which medical students enrolled in a
   radiology clerkship were taught how to use the PACS, download digital
   images, and incorporate them into an electronic case presentation. The
   feasibility and potential benefits of this instructional method were
   studied prospectively.
   Materials and Methods. Between June and October 1999, all 36 medical
   students enrolled in Harvard Medical School's core radiology clerkship
   at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, were required to give an
   electronic radiology case presentation with images downloaded from the
   departmental PACS. They were taught how to download images, edit them,
   and then import them into PowerPoint software. They were also given
   access to the hospital information system to obtain pertinent clinical
   information. At the formal presentations, the images were displayed with
   a liquid crystal display (LCD) projector. The students were surveyed on
   the Ist and last days of the clerkship regarding their learning
   experiences.
   Results. Before the radiology clerkship, 81\% of the students had never
   given an electronic presentation with computer and LCD projector, 83\%
   had no PACS experience, and 56\% had no PowerPoint experience. All
   students learned to pre pare and deliver electronic presentations of
   radiologic cases downloaded from PACS. Their presentations were
   informative, innovative, and entertaining, and the images were well
   displayed. The students praised the instruction highly and thought their
   new skills would serve them well.
   Conclusion. Teaching medical students how to prepare and deliver
   electronic presentations of radiologic cases downloaded from PACS proved
   to be very feasible and well appreciated by the students.}},

Abstract = {{Architecture and circuit design techniques for VLSI implementation of a
   single-chip quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulator with
   frequency agility and antenna beamforming characteristics are presented.
   In order to achieve reliable wireless communication modem function, the
   single chip all-digital QAM modulator implements various features,
   including high data rates with bandwidth efficiency, flexibility,
   meeting a wide variety of user throughput requirements with variable and
   width and data rates in a multi-user system, and robustness,
   incorporating diversity and redundancy techniques to guarantee robust
   communication for various operating environments. The modulator
   components consist of several digital processing building blocks,
   including various finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters, an innovative
   variable interpolation filter, a four-channel frequency translator with
   quadrature mixer for antenna beamforming diversity, a quadrature direct
   digital frequency synthesizer (QDDFS), a numerically controlled
   oscillator (NCO), a QAM formatter, a pseudorandom noise (PN) generator,
   an x/ sin x filter, and a microcontroller interface. An optimized
   architecture and chip implementation for the variable modulator is
   derived and evaluated which will support symbol rates from 6 kBaud to
   8.75 MBaud continuously and digitally flexible IF frequencies up to 70
   MHz with four-channel antenna beamforming function.}},

Abstract = {{A new NbN multilayer technology has been developed on 3 inch diameter
   R-plane sapphire substrates, for combining on-chip fast RSFQ circuits
   with GHz bandwidth optical links. The circuits take advantage of two
   high quality (110) NbN layers sputtered epitaxially on sapphire at 600
   degreesC and selectively patterned: a 400 nm thick layer lambda
   (L)similar to 250 nm at 6K) acts for the ground-plane and microbridge
   photodetectors are made of a 3.5-8 nm thick NbN epilayer with T-c above
   11 K, Innovative dielectrics formed of 10 nm thick MgO sputtered on top
   of 200 nm SiO2 layers are found to improve significantly the
   superconductivity of NbN junction electrode lines deposited below 300
   degreesC. Good quality, hysteretic 2 mum(2) area, NbN/MgO/NbN junctions
   with high J(c) (up to 50 kA/cm(2)) are obtained with very large gap
   voltage (6.20 mV) and low sub-gap leakage current (V-m > 15 mV) at 4.2
   K, At 11 K such junctions are found self-shunted (J(c)similar to 10
   kA/cm(2)) with RnIc above 0.5 mV and with low J(c) spread in arrays.
   J(c) can be adjusted (reduced) without any detrimental effect on the
   junction quality or spread by annealing at 250 degreesC.}},

   industry - but unfortunately not seen as such by the stock market This
   makes it very important to understand the paper industry technology
   environment and the critical elements associated with its value
   creation. Due to the huge capital on ground the technical paper industry
   developments tend to be more conservative, projects mostly going after
   small incremental improvements not to endanger the needed high
   productivity rates. But the Media landscape is in a continuos change and
   the role (and value!) of paper can change very fast. Innovations and
   novel solutions by the paper industry are fueled on one side by the
   ,,enabling technology{''} suppliers and on the other side pulled by the
   media trends and electronic/digital system inventions. Such global
   technology is available to anybody and everywhere and does not
   differentiate to be successful ora looser. The value is created through
   the know-how and local competencies to implement the globally available
   technology into the best, most valuable local solution.
   The presentation is looking at elements of global technology, overviews
   global technology trends with particular insight into coating binders as
   well as outlining the critical elements of value creation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the effect of fixation shift on photoscreening
   crescents, the ability of human interpreters to detect fixation shift,
   and the potential improvement by image processing. Methods: MTI
   photoscreening (Medical Technologies \& Innovations, Inc, Lancaster, PA)
   images, measured at 11 positions of gaze, were obtained from 10 subjects
   (9 with refractive error warranting spectacle correction). Photographs
   were taken with subjects fixating at 20, 15, 10, and 5 cm to the left
   and the right of the camera fixation target (1 m distant); 5 cm above
   and below the camera fixation target; and on-axis. Photographs were
   inspected by 11 experienced raters, who indicated if the subject
   appeared to be looking directly at the camera. The photographs were
   digitized,, enlarged, contrast enhanced, and measured by 3 raters. For
   each photograph, distance from the corneal light reflex to the nasal
   limbus was measured and a measure of asymmetry computed. Results: Raters
   could reliably detect off-axis fixation greater than 10 cm away from the
   intended fixation target. Raters correctly identified on-axis subject
   viewing 73\% of the time. Crescents became larger when the fixation
   shifted off-axis for both the myopic and hyperopic subjects. Image
   analysis correctly classified 10 of 10 on-axis measurements and 34 of 39
   off-axis measurements. Conclusion: Direct inspection of photoscreening
   images by trained raters can result in the failure to detect small but
   relevant errors of fixation. These fixation shifts can cause crescents
   to become larger than expected, resulting in false-positive
   classification. Image analysis offers a potential improvement in the
   detection of off-axis fixation in MTI photoscreening images.}},

   can feed this information to a range of backend applications. A Fill

   magnetic fields in the vicinity of the line. We can decode this
   information by measuring the magnetic Fields and wire geometry at a
   position near the line. Initial applications include load recording and

   the Warfighter. Through it Advanced Concepts and Technology (ACT II)
   program Topic Number 99-CSS-08, Army outlined the requirements to

Abstract = {{The Packaging Research Center is working on novel System-on-a-Package
   (SOP) technology for next generation mixed-signal systems packaging. At
   the heart of the new SOP strategy is a fully integrated substrate with
   ultra-high density wiring and integrated passive and optoelectronic
   components. The two major goals of this substrate technology are highest
   level of integration incorporating added functionality to the substrate;
   and lowest cost. SOP integration research involves a number of unique
   testbeds that bring together the entire gamut of PRC research
   innovations into technology demonstration platforms. A global team of
   faculty, students, researchers and industry engineers at the PRC is
   developing these testbeds. The challenges in this integration process
   and the outcome from the test vehicles are utilized to generate new
   roadmaps and research projects to address these technical barriers. The
   PRC's latest SOP-3A substrate is a six metal layer structure using
   sequential build up processing on a high TgFR-4 or FR-5 laminate that
   includes embedded resistors, capacitors and inductors. Included in the
   six metal layers are four layers of high density wiring metallization
   and four micro via levels, and plated through hole (PTH) interconnects.
   SOP-3A testbed is the latest in the line of PRC mixed-signal integrated
   modules incorporating novel PRC research innovations into a large area
   300mm x 300mm, low-cost platform. The SOP-3A substrate consists of five
   test areas exploring various issues for SOP technology. This paper will
   present the electrical design of the SOP-SA test vehicle, followed by
   the materials and processes used for building the integrated substrate.
   High density wiring and microvia results will be discussed. Electrical
   test results from the test vehicle characterization, including high
   speed digital, RF/wireless, and optoelectronics applications will be
   discussed. Challenges for mixed-signal substrates including integration
   issues will be discussed. Future SOP test vehicles will include eight
   metal layers, where six of these layers will be high density
   interconnect metallization and six micro via levels, and incorporate
   high value R, L, C, and embedded diffractive optical elements.}},

Abstract = {{Polycapillary x-ray optics provide an innovative new way to control
   x-ray beams. Placing these optics after the object to be imaged provides
   very efficient rejection of Compton scatter, while allowing image
   magnification without loss of resolution, image demagnification, or
   image shaping to match with digital detectors. An extensive study of the
   effects of surface and profile defects have greatly enhanced the
   understanding of the manufacturing process and lead to improved
   reproducibility and manufacturability of the optics. Measurements were
   performed on magnifying tapers. The optics had measured primary
   transmissions greater than 50\% and scatter transmission of less than
   1\%. For a 5-cm thick Lucite phantom, this resulted in a contrast
   enhancement compared to a conventional grid of nearly a factor of two.
   The magnification from the tapered capillary optics improved the MTF at
   all frequencies out to 1.9 times the original system resolution.
   Increases below the system resolution are most important because
   clinically relevant structures generally occupy lower spatial
   frequencies.
   Alternatively, placing a collimating optic and diffracting crystal
   before the patient provides sufficient monochromatic beam intensity for
   medical imaging. Contrast, resolution, and intensity measurements were
   performed with both high and low angular acceptance crystals. At 8 keV,
   contrast enhancement was a factor of 5 relative to the polychromatic
   case, in good agreement with theoretical values. At 17.5 keV,
   monochromatic subject contrast was more than a factor of 2 times greater
   than the conventional polychromatic contrast. An additional factor of
   two increase in contrast is expected from the removal of scatter
   obtained from using the air gap which is allowable from the parallel
   beam. The measured angular resolution after the crystal was 0.4 mrad for
   a silicon crystal.
   The realization of these applications has been advanced by the recent
   marked improvement in available optic quality and reproducibility.
   Manufacturing progress has been assisted by the development of
   simulation analyses which allow for increasingly accurate assessment of
   optics defects. Optics performance over the whole range of energy from
   10 to 80 keV can often be matched with one or two fitting parameters.
   Continuing optics manufacturing challenges include the advance of
   applications at energies above 40 keV and the production of optics for
   imaging which are of adequate clinical size. Multioptic jigs designed to
   increase imaging area have been tested.}},

Abstract = {{Water-marking allows hiding information into digital objects such as
   images, videos, audio tiles and text pages. Hidden codes can be used to
   demonstrate the ownership of the digital objects in case of copyright
   infringement verification. Most of the commonly used applications of
   watermark are referred to color or b/w images. In this paper, an
   analysis of specific innovative techniques for watermarking music scores
   is presented. The analysis was performed on the basis of the
   requirements highlighted by the user group of the European Project
   WEDELMUSIC. The discussion reported in this paper has been performed
   taking into account the skills of musicians in detecting changes in the
   music sheets. This work can be useful for other researchers that would
   like to work in this area.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet is a critically important research site for sociologists
   testing theories of technology diffusion and media effects, particularly
   because it is a medium uniquely capable of integrating modes of
   communication and forms of content. Current research tends to focus on
   the Internet's implications in five domains: 1) inequality (the
   ``digital divide{''}); 2) community and social capital; 3) political
   participation; 4) organizations and other economic institutions; and 5)
   cultural participation and cultural diversity. A recurrent theme across
   domains is that the Internet tends to complement rather than displace
   existing media and patterns of behavior. Thus in each domain, utopian
   claims and dystopic warnings based on extrapolations from technical
   possibilities have given way to more nuanced and circumscribed
   understandings of how Internet use adapts to existing patterns, permits
   certain innovations, and reinforces particular kinds of change.
   Moreover, in each domain the ultimate social implications of this new
   technology depend on economic, legal, and policy decisions that are
   shaping the Internet as it becomes institutionalized. Sociologists need
   to study the Internet more actively and, particularly, to synthesize
   research findings on individual user behavior with macroscopic analyses
   of institutional and political-economic factors that constrain that
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of a programmable processor is
   the native language of the machine. It defines the set of operations and
   resources that are optimized for that computer, information appliance or
   server. It is based on the workload characterization of the types of
   software expected to run on that computer. Unfortunately, the workload
   characterization upon which microprocessor ISA choices have been made
   has not kept up with the changing nature of general-purpose computations
   and communications. This has resulted in a plethora of special-purpose
   hardware chips and boards for these new information processing
   paradigms, and a general misunderstanding that software running on
   programmable processors cannot achieve certain performance, cost or
   power levels. Microprocessors that attain high performance levels in the
   new processing areas tend to have complex microarchitecture and very
   fast cycle times, both of which result in high cost and power. Actually,
   much faster, lower cost and lower power computations can be achieved by
   optimizing the Instruction-Set Architecture of the processor for these
   new information-processing paradigms.
   In this talk, we discuss new ISA features, which address the increasing
   need for pervasive secure information processing and ubiquitous
   multimedia information processing. In particular, we discuss new
   arithmetic operations that are very useful for fast software
   cryptography or the processing of multimedia information. For example,
   we discuss novel permutation instructions and methodologies for
   achieving arbitrary permutations of bits and subwords in n-bit words.
   These are needed for fast symmetric-key cryptography and in multimedia
   applications. We also discuss interesting forms of saturation arithmetic
   and their applications, and other new types of computer arithmetic. The
   realization of these new arithmetic operations calls for innovative
   logic and circuit implementations of new functional units, or
   imaginatively enhanced adders, shifters and multipliers. These new
   computer arithmetic circuits can be used in microprocessors, media
   processors, cryptography processors, digital signal processors and
   programmable System-On-Chips.}},

Abstract = {{The digital interactive service industry has the potential to generate
   innovation and strategic advantage for existing business if the
   underlying dynamics of the emerging industry are fostered through
   appropriate understanding and strategic actions. This paper puts in
   perspective the fundamentals affecting the creation of new interactive
   services for building professions. The fundamentals reviewed include
   issues related to acquiring new skills as well as establishing market
   and user needs. In addition, recent advent of the industry has resulted
   in various new business models being utilised not only for business
   process improvement but also more strategically for market penetration
   and business expansion. Through the use of three examples viz.
   interactive content studio, content rights intermediary and virtual
   community, this paper investigates the current and potential impacts of
   these new models upon the businesses within the building sectors. (C)

Abstract = {{Virtual Reality (VR) technology is one of the most important innovations
   for research, development and industrial production. In dentistry, VR
   technology will be useful to provide better education by simulation as
   well as to enhance working procedures that conventionally are limited,
   as e.g. the mechanical articulator. It is the purpose of this paper to
   present concept and strategies for a future replacement of the
   mechanical articulator by a virtual one. This virtual articulator will
   significantly reduce the limitations of the mechanical articulator and,
   by simulation of real patient data, allow for analyses with regard to
   static and dynamic occlusion as well as to jaw relation. The main topics
   are
   implementing the virtual articulator with digitized models of lower and
   upper jaw
   matching of computer-aided registrations of jaw movements with the jaw
   models
   visualization of unusual views upon dynamic patterns of occlusion
   reduction of errors concerning the available materials to mount casts in
   correct relationship and orientation.}},

Abstract = {{The tremendous recent efforts to develop and deploy ubiquitous mobile
   communication possibilities are changing the demands but also
   possibilities for establishing new business and commerce relationships.
   Within this paper we show our innovative approach for integrating
   watermark and cryptography based methods within a framework of new
   application scenarios spanning a wide range from dedicated and user
   specific services, ``Try\&Buy{''} mechanisms to general means for
   long-term customer relationships. Based on a description of the
   challenges of the application domain and the existing work we show,
   which methods must be used for establishing services in a fast
   convenient and secure way for conditional access services. The paper
   closes with an overview of steps for practically establishing these
   concepts.}},

Abstract = {{The cornerstone of the all-digital simulation for the Javelin missile
   system is its accurately rendered high fidelity 8-12mum infrared imagery
   of targets, clutter, and countermeasure effects. The Javelin missile
   system is a medium range, manportable, shoulder-launched,
   fire-and-forget, anti-armor weapon system. Javelin has two major
   components: a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) and a missile sealed in
   a disposable launch tube assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated
   day/night sight and provides target engagement capability in adverse
   weather and countermeasure environments. The Javelin missile
   incorporates an imaging infrared seeker with a fire-and-forget tracker
   that allows the gunner to fire the missile and immediately take cover.
   The on-board tracker guides the missile to the target until impact. The
   tracker and its ability to maintain lock on the target throughout flight
   emerged as the most critical aspect of the Javelin system. A
   cost-effective way to develop and test new tracker algorithms became a
   necessity. Additionally, an innovative way to determine system
   performance of a fire and forget imaging infrared system was needed.
   From these requirements came the development of the Javelin Integrated
   Flight Simulation (IFS). The Javelin IFS is a high fidelity all-digital
   simulation whose primary functions are tracker algorithm development,
   flight test predictions and reconstructions, and system performance
   assessment. The IFS contains six models: environment model, seeker
   model, tracker model, autopilot, six degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) model,
   and gunner model. The most critical aspect of the IFS is feeding the
   tracker with as realistic imagery as possible. The seeker model working
   in conjunction with the environment model gives the IFS highly realistic
   and fully verified, validated, and accredited imagery of targets,
   terrain, and countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{A series of topographical surveys carried out during the past years in
   the Salto Valley (Rieti-Lazio), have provided much interesting data
   regarding local archaeological sites, particularly along the southern
   slopes of the Breccioso Hills which rise between the Corvaro and
   Spedinoplain. An interesting site has recently come to our attention at
   Colle Breccioso. However, the nature of the site was not clear and its
   structure is hazy, a consequence of the deterioration of the surrounding
   ground and increased vegetation coverage.
   The situation at the site suggested that a detailed survey of the
   southern incline and the plateau associated with the site would be
   valuable. The objective of the survey was to highlight topographic
   variation and to bring to light any traces of human construction or
   manipulation.
   The survey was carried out using a DGPS Leica SR 510, and a total
   station. The integration of these two instruments (which had both,
   differing and complementary capacities) produced satisfactory and
   innovative results. The processing of the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of
   the area highlighted several characteristics of the site and the
   consequent production of thematic maps from this data could be used to
   guide future excavations at the site.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years a fascinating evolution of different multicolor
   fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technologies could be
   witnessed. The various approaches to cohybridize multiple DNA probes in
   different colors opened new avenues for FISH-based automated karyotyping
   or the simultaneous analysis of multiple defined regions within the
   genome. These developments had a remarkable impact on microscopy design
   and the usage of highly sensitive area imagers. In addition, they led to
   the introduction of new fluorochromes with appropriate filter
   combinations, refinements of hybridization protocols, novel probe sets,
   and innovative software for automated chromosome analysis. This paper
   attempts to summarize the various multicolor approaches and discusses
   the application of the individual technologies. Copyright (C) 2001 S.

Abstract = {{The aim of ASTRON, which is an EC FPV activity (1999-2002), is to
   improve benefits from the use of space technologies and services in
   Europe by assisting in their integration within emerging digital
   interactive services. Those objectives are met through four sequential
   activities: ``communication{''} that leads to ``monitoring and
   analysis{''} that leads to ``development and demonstration{''} that
   leads to ``user up-take{''}. The project has close links with the
   European data and communication providers, space industry and space
   agencies as well as with other Directorates-General, namely DG TREN
   (Transport and Energy) and DG INFSO (Information Society) and DG ENTR
   (Enterprise). All potential applications have been grouped into four
   market segments, which have been studied by industrial teams, supported
   by ASTRON and will eventually lead to demonstration projects. The market
   studies results confirmed that the synergy between Earth observation,
   Telecommunications and Satellite Navigation could be effective in an
   innovative fashion in a number of application areas (i.e. personal
   info-mobility, safety of life and resources, big events or crisis
   situations, mobility). Demonstration projects, so called
   `proof-of-concept showcases', were initiated and are expected to be
   ready later in the current year. They aim to demonstrating the vision
   and opportunities arising from the synergy of space technologies and
   will focus on environment, security and info-mobility services. The
   first demonstration project targeted personal info-mobility and is
   entitled Personal Assistant (City Navigation).}},

Journal = {{EKONOMICKY CASOPIS}},

Pages = {{527-538}},
Abstract = {{One defines business environment as economic conditions and
   prerequisites of activities, which depend on economic and political
   measures of the state. These to a various extent and intensity affect
   the firms from the outside environment. Such conditions include phases
   of economic cycle, GDP growth rate, inflation rate, balance of payments
   level, the results of state budget management, interest rate, and
   unemployment level. These indicators reflect individual types of the
   economic policy of the state.
   The first prerequisite of the ample business environment is the
   stabilisation of economic conditions, which is reflected by the relative
   growth of GDP at the retention of inflation rate within one digit range.
   The second prerequisite of suitable business environment is the
   functional system of supporting institutions. The decision-making sphere
   together with specialised organisations forms this system.
   Global situation of the business environment in Slovakia is a standard
   one and comparable with advanced countries. The Constitution of the
   Slovak Republic and the following legislation safeguard the freedom of
   property, privacy rights implementation, liberty of a contract,
   respecting of a priority will of participants in business relations,
   standard norms of public law, tax laws, law on banks, law on economic
   competition, law on bankruptcy and compensation, contracts on the
   support and protection of investments etc.
   The scope of legislation changes is, however, enormous and is
   characterised by a non-conceptual approach. Large quantity of new laws,
   direct and indirect amendments, decrees and governmental regulations
   represent non-transparent system, where even professional lawyers hardly
   orient themselves. The changes are hardly predictable and thus strategic
   and scheduling decisions by individual subjects are difficult to be
   made.
   Financial burden of the entrepreneurs in the Slovak Republic compared to
   that in advanced countries is unfairly high. According to the analysis
   prepared by the Institute of Slovak and World Economics (1999), total
   burden amounted in Slovakia 58\%, in the EU countries (average) 39.5\%.
   In a medium-term horizon it is inevitable to stimulate by legislation
   the business environment for small and medium entrepreneurs and for
   tradesmen. As a starting point to do this there should be a definition
   of possible changes in business environment in a medium-term horizon.
   Significant contribution to that could be the preparation of the
   medium-term financial outlook, definition of some priorities of the
   economic policy and preparation of the medium-term currency and
   budgetary policy.
   Economic potential of Slovakia continues its orientation mostly at big
   enterprises.
   The decision-making sphere does not pay an adequate attention to the
   small and medium enterprises in spite of some verbal manifestos.
   Business environment in Slovakia is more favourable for big enterprises.
   This has been motivated by the aim to retain employment and solvency.
   One of the tasks of the policy of the government is to create business
   environment. The result of co-ordinated activities of the government and
   its specialised organisations are such social and economic conditions
   that enable permanent stimulation and revitalisation, formation and
   expiration of small, medium and big subjects. The function and
   responsibility of the decision-making sphere at optimising the business
   environment is motivated by the following demands:
   fast innovative adaptation of individual subjects,
   efficiency and competitiveness of individual subjects,
   retention and gradual employment increase.}},

Title = {{Globalization and global economy - Their influence on the development of
   the world economy}},
Journal = {{EKONOMICKY CASOPIS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1004-1029}},
Abstract = {{The paper is primarily focused on analysis of selected business factors
   and their position in the process of globalisation and their impact on
   the development of world economy. In a relevant context, the effects on
   international business are analysed, and taking the example of the South
   Korean economy, the authors points out the danger of underestimating the
   impact of globalisation of world markets in the process of adaptation of
   the Korean economy.
   This part of the article responds to the analysing of the influence of
   process of globalisation oil the international business, as a whole.
   There's stressed its role by changing of organisation there, production
   and selling of the products on international markets, whiling of new
   more effective inputs a various services from all regions of the world
   economy and creating of the new forms of business
   conglomerates-multinationals, joint ventures, international business
   networks, etc.
   The attack of these global influences on the traditional production and
   international business structures is increasing the level of
   interdependency on traditional business units.
   The authors concentrate on the analysis of the influence of two
   fundamental pillars of the globalisation process-the liberalisation of
   international business and growth of international interdependency,
   emphasizing there is a certain interlinking and coherence between these
   pillars. Considering economic development in USA, EU and Japan lead they
   to explain the influence of liberalisation's tendencies on the economic
   growth. Its following the acceleration of international business
   operations and presently the expansion of globalisation on all (most)
   parts of world economy. Other issues analysed are impacts of
   globalisation on international regionalism and on the level of openness
   of national economies.
   The liberalisation of the international Trade can open a new
   opportunities in the new markets, first of all for countries in
   transition and less developed ones.
   The globalisation in the sphere of international business is influenced
   by many other sub-factors, too. Its concerned:
   a) firstly the new role of technologies in the global economic growth
   b) secondly, global diversification in the wide since. It means in the
   area of production, trade and investment (foreign direct investment),
   etc.
   Past decades, and especially the late 90s have brought several
   significant changes that we are facing nowadays. These changes induce
   new challenges, higher level of risks but also new opportunities to
   succeed. Its consequences, literally said, influence our every day's
   life in various manners.
   First there was a digital revolution, going back to 50s when the first
   semiconductor was produced. In that time nobody could even imagine the
   commercial potential of semiconductors. Later on, with a wider spread of
   computers, mostly thanks to government investment. Since 70s we could
   see accelerating growth of investment to informational technologies.
   Last decade of 20(th) century became a real entry point for digital
   economy into commerciality. But globalisation's changes in second half
   of tine century have not influenced only ITT (Information and
   Telecommunication Technology) sector. Or. the contrary, growth drive so
   typical for ITT has brought new ``tools{''} also for other business
   sector, among which the most influenced had been commercial services and
   we could say that every business was somehow more or less influenced by
   the recent development in ITT. New forms of doing business worldwide
   emerged-strategic alliances, mergers acquisitions (M\&A) and networks
   instead of hierarchy just to mention a few of them. Behind all
   above-mentioned changes and challenges we could a massive ``wave{''} of
   globalisation, the process of creation of one world economy with one
   (relatively homogenous) global market and global competition as well:
   New challenges, new threats.
   As the authors stressed the global economy is all about constant
   business change. Only those able to adapt to the turbulent environment
   (not just in economic sense of word) are to succeed and survive. These
   are new winners. Others, not able to keep the step are going to lose.
   This is a simple rule of globalisation in the world economy. The source
   of adaptation is the innovation coming from constant exploration and
   exploitation of human's knowledge.
   The second part of the article is dedicated to the negative consequences
   of globalisation concerning less developed countries, increasing power
   of transnational corporations and existence of international
   institutions involved in resolving problems of national economies
   arising from globalisation. The authors of this paper are concentrated
   to most important aspects of the negative influences, as
   a) international economic environment and the chance for economic growth
   of LCD's
   b) influence of MNC's on the building of new positions in the world
   market
   c) role and competency of the state and international institutions by
   the eliminating of economic defects on the world markets, etc.
   It is clear that early stages of globalisation have brought benefits
   mostly to developed countries, due to its well-developed infrastructure
   as well awareness of coining challenges and opportunities. Nowadays we
   can witness that also less developed countries are getting drive in
   participation of global business. Also the problem of national and
   global governance emerges. There is a need to redefine the role of
   state/government so that the national economies could keep their
   competitiveness, especially facing the increasing power of MNCs.
   Moreover there is a problem of MNCs concerning the global rules for
   their worldwide activities, because they are supposed to misuse its
   positions and power which is mostly seen in LDCs. That is why stating
   the uniform rules would help avoiding these problems and encourage LDCs
   in increasing their involvement in global world.}},

Abstract = {{Today's increasing data rates in digital communication circuits are
   demanding higher speeds in the interchip communication. This throughput
   can be achieved using high rate serial links. Good noise inmunity can be

Abstract = {{Though the frequency measurement technique is well established,
   converting frequency to a digital world for real time systems is not an
   easy task. The task is further complicated by the absence of any
   standard peripheral integrated circuit chip for this application. The
   existing techniques of frequency measurement like direct frequency
   measurement and period measurement are not accurate at low and high
   frequencies respectively. This talk will elaborate the effort involved
   to realize a successful Frequency to Digital Converter (FDC) as an
   Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The chip adopts an
   innovative frequency measurement technique called the `hybrid
   technique'. The hybrid technique has the advantage of both the direct
   frequency and period measurement techniques and is found to be very
   accurate at both low and high frequencies. The chip was designed and
   fabricated with stringent specifications to meet military applications.
   Extensive software simulations were done to ensure the proper
   functioning of the chip. The chip was then tested extensively over all
   frequencies and was found to operate successfully meeting all the
   specifications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper I examine the geographical and organisational consequences
   of the emergence of a new technological assemblage within the music
   industry. This technological assemblage is organised around software
   formats and Internet distribution systems. The paper is concerned with
   the relationship between technological innovation, economic competition,
   and the contestability of markets for goods and services within an era
   of digital content. I begin by setting out two opposing discourses
   currently circulating within the music industry: one that denigrates the
   emergence of software formats, and another that celebrates it. Both
   discourses concur that this new technological assemblage will
   fundamentally reorganise the music industry as it is currently
   configured, with some doubt being cast over the long-term viability of
   the industry owing to the problems of protecting the intellectual
   property rights of music contained within open software formats. I
   provide a critical analysis of electronic markets and their impact upon
   economic organisation, and examine the impacts of digital content and
   electronic markets within the music industry through the concept of the
   musical network. Four networks with distinctive organisational and
   spatial characteristics are identified within the musical economy:
   networks of creativity, of reproduction, of distribution, and of
   consumption. I argue that all four networks are being reshaped as a
   result of the impact of software formats and Internet distribution
   systems. These developments are found to threaten the short-term
   profitability of some established firms within the industry, but I argue
   that the industry is already beginning to restabilise around a new
   technological and regulatory regime designed to protect copyrights in
   music in software formats.}},

Abstract = {{Tight Time-to-Market demands for System-on-Silicon (SoS) products
   require innovative measures to reduce the development time in each
   phase, in particular for test engineering which tends to be a bottleneck
   in the path to engineering samples for customers. Virtual Test (VT) is a
   new technique able to drastically reduce the gap between first silicon
   and the availability of a debugged test program. VT allows debugging
   digital and mixed-signal test programs in a simulation environment if a
   fast and sufficiently accurate IC model can be made available.
   Behavioural models of the chips under test turned out to be a very
   promising approach to cover both the needs of designers for the sign-off
   simulation on chip level and of test engineers for VT. In this paper we
   demonstrate that VHDL covers all requirements of VT from the functional
   point of view with acceptable simulation performance.}},

Abstract = {{Communication through making marks is a fundamental human instinct.
   Humans have always used the act of drawing as a means to express ideas,
   emotions and to record actions. Currently, the discipline of drawing is
   being profoundly influenced, and perhaps forever changed, by the
   proliferation of new drawing media, technologies, and diverse approaches
   to making marks through digital means. As such, the perception and
   understanding of what constitutes drawing is rapidly, expanding.
   Simultaneously, many graphic artists are expanding upon historical
   approaches to drawing. The early, twenty-first century is a time when
   the dialogue bem,een innovation and tradition has never been stronger.
   This paper seeks to explore this dialogue by embracing the breadth of
   what drawing is and to conjecture on where drawing might go in the
   immediate future by exploring the use of new technologies, elaborating
   the impact of continuing traditions of drawings, and to engage the
   expanding range of ideas that are brought to this basic form of human
   expression. As we enter into this new millennium the immediacy of
   drawing offers, as it always has, a profound mirror to the swift change
   that pervades global digital culture. The presenter invites all those
   involved in drawing, in whatever form, to be a part of this dialogue.}},

Abstract = {{In the emerging markets for digital content distribution, traditional
   models for content programming still predominate. But there is a large
   potential for innovation and improvement in content selection to better
   meet consumers' demand for entertainment and news. We have developed a
   new paradigm - and supporting technology - to customize audience content
   to their specific preferences.
   One can identify several selection models for groups of individuals with
   similar interests in music, video, or other multimedia content to
   jointly customize a distribution channel. Our approach represents a
   balance between the two most widespread models available today, namely
   broadcasting (in which a small group of people select content for a
   large, passive audience), and individual playback such as CD/DVD players
   (with its burden on the listener for content selection).
   Using technologies such as data mining, multicasting and smart players,
   our model gives listeners access to automatic shared playlists. This
   kind of customized narrowcasting is especially applicable to
   distribution of content for which there is high demand for repeat
   listening or viewing, while at the same time being very idiosyncratic.
   Our approach can provide significant advantages to consumers,
   distribution channels, content owners and advertisers alike.
   In this paper we present the basic collaborative content programming
   algorithms and describe initial experiences with this new paradigm.
   Specifically, we describe KARC, a prototype of an Internet multichannel
   virtual radio station environment deployed at the IBM Almaden Research
   Center.}},

Abstract = {{NTT has developed an asymmetrical multimedia computer network, combining
   satellite and terrestrial circuits. This system provides interactive
   communications between customer PCs and servers. The forward signals
   (from servers to customers) are transmitted by satellite circuits, the
   transmission rate is approximately 30 Mbit/s in each transponder, and
   the backward signals (from customers to servers) are transmitted by
   narrow band terrestrial circuits. This paper proposes two types of
   multiplex methods for the satellite circuit, one is the ATM multiplex
   method and the other is the MPEG multiplex method. The ATM multiplex
   method transfers different kinds of multimedia data such as IP packets
   and MPEG signals on ATM cells. We have obtained the IP packets
   transmission performances over ATM cells through experiments using the
   N-STAR satellite since the middle of 1996. The MPEG multiplex method can
   be used to transmit MPEG2 high-quality data as the innovative digital
   satellite broadcast systems. The hardware of MPEG2 decoding units is
   becoming economical as digital satellite broadcasts become popular. This
   multiplex method enables the transmission of ATM cells on the MPEG
   transport stream. The proposed multiplex methods are applied according
   to the customers requests for their applications.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, it seems, there are just two types of companies left in
   the world: dotcoms, born on the Internet, and ``wanna-dots,{''}
   established organizations that are seeking to incorporate the Internet
   into their businesses.
   Some wanna-dots manage the deep mind-shift required to cross the digital
   divide. These are the pacesetters-the first movers and fast followers
   that exhibit organizational curiosity and the desire to innovate. But
   most wanna-dots are laggards; they don't rise to the challenge with the
   same resolve.
   In a global research effort involving more than 800 companies, the
   author uncovered so many wanna-dots making the same kinds of mistakes
   that it almost seemed they were following a How Not to Change guide. In
   this article, Kanter creates just such a guide, offering ten pieces of
   antiadvice that expose the tendency of wanna-dots to make only cosmetic
   changes when deep transformation is required.
   Beyond delineating what not to do, Kanter serves up two examples of
   wanna-dots that got it right First, Williams-Sonoma, which successfully
   made up for a slow start to create a strong Web presence. Second,
   Honeywell, a pacesetter led by e-believers from the start, which still
   found the road to the Web a challenging one.
   For companies not born digital, the fundamental problem is change. And
   the real place to look for change is not on the Internet but inside your
   company-at your own organizational culture and your attitude toward
   change.}},

Abstract = {{We present a complete transistor-level layout flow, from logic netlist
   to final shapes, for blocks of combinational logic up to a few thousand
   transistors in size. The direct transistor-level attack easily
   accommodates the demands for careful custom sizing necessary in
   high-speed design, and is also significantly denser than a comparable
   cell-based layout. The key algorithmic innovations are (a) early
   identification of essential diffusion-merged MOS device groups called
   clusters, but (b) deferred binding of clusters to a specific shape-level
   layout until the very end of a multi-phase placement strategy. A global
   placer arranges uncommitted clusters; a detailed placer optimizes
   clusters at shape level for density and for overall routability. A
   commercial router completes the flow. Experiments comparing to a
   commercial standard cell-level layout flow show that, when flattened to
   transistors, our tool consistently achieves 100\% routed layouts that
   average 23\% less area.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative solution of the global multidimensional registration
   problem for a set of partial object models is introduced and explained.
   The method, based on the classical tie-point concept, is capable to
   directly and optimally align models indefinitely rotated, translated and
   scaled. The pre-registration is carried out in automatic way without the
   need of initial manual superimposition nor of approximate starting
   values of the transformation parameters. Registration algorithms
   implementing the singular value decomposition of matrix products of
   limited size are used in every step of the process.
   The procedure is based on the algorithms of the Procrustes analysis. One
   consequent advantage is that there are no space dimensions restrictions.
   This is particularly helpful for laserscanning and digital
   photogrammetry applications, where a set of attributes associated to the
   different tie-points (i.e. CYMK or RGB color components and intensity)
   can be used in conjunction with the corresponding Cartesian coordinate
   values. This connection can improve the registration reliability of
   range-colored images, matching simultaneously geometry, nature and
   aspect.
   The numerical experiments carried out confirm the advantages of the
   multidimensional approach proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increased number of fatal accidents caused by overweight
   trucks on interstate highways, a series of truck safety and weight
   enforcement facilities were developed by Wisconsin Department of
   Transportation. These facilities were designed to weigh and inspect
   trucks while they are in motion. The National Aeronautic and Space
   Administration (NASA) funded a project through the Affiliated Research
   Center (ARC) at university of Wisconsin-Madison to pilot innovation in
   geospatial visualization technology for comparing possible sites for a
   truck safety and weight enforcement facility. The optimal site selection
   study was conducted along the I-90 corridor between the
   Illinois/Wisconsin border and Madison, Wisconsin. To accomplish this
   project EOS-Era Landsat-7 satellite data was integrated and synthesized
   with digital elevation models (DEMs), aerial photography, and other
   geospatial data to represent current terrain and land cover. Application
   of innovative Visualization technology enabled the presentation of
   spatial information reflecting complex engineering, environmental,
   transportation and design issues in ways that were clear and
   understandable to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation and public
   stakeholders. Visualization of geospatial data technology and
   ``fly-through{''} simulation models will be presented to demonstrate the
   alternative scenarios for selecting an optimum site for the truck safety
   facility.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of power quality is becoming an impelling need in a
   deregulated electricity market where the sources producing distortion
   and disturbances are steadily increasing in number and power. The
   instruments for power quality measurement are based on complex digital
   processing of the input signals, whose waveforms are highly variable.
   The calibration of this kind of instruments is therefore an open topic,
   especially when the uncertainty propagation through the DSP algorithm is
   concerned. This paper proposes an innovative procedure that, starting
   from the determination of the probability density function of the
   uncertainty contribution of every device from the signal input stage to
   the Analog-to-Digital conversion stage, estimates the final measurement
   standard uncertainty, and the probability density function of the
   measurement results. The result of the experimental work done on a
   prototype of power quality measurement instrument is reported.}},

Abstract = {{The recent advances of sensor technologies have been powered by
   high-speed and low-cost electronic circuits, novel signal processing
   methods and innovative advances in manufacturing technologies. The
   synergetic interaction of new developments in these fields allow
   completely novel approaches increasing the performance of technical
   products. Innovative sensor structures have been designed permitting
   self-monitoring or self-calibration. The rapid progress of sensor
   manufacturing technologies allows the production of systems and
   components with a low cost-to-performance ratio. Among microsystem
   manufacturing technologies surface and bulk micromachining are
   increasingly winning recognition. The potential in the field of digital
   signal processing involves new approaches for the improvement of sensor
   properties. Multi-sensor systems can significantly contribute to the
   enhancement of the quality and availability of information. For this
   purpose, sophisticated signal processing methods based on data fusion
   techniques are more effective for an accurate computation of measurement
   values or a decision than usually used threshold based algorithms.
   In this state-of-the-art lecture we will give an overview of the recent
   advances and future development trends in the field of sensor
   technology. We will focus on novel sensor structures, manufacturing
   technologies and signal processing methods in individual and
   multi-sensor systems. The predominantly observed future development
   trends are: The miniaturization of sensors and components, the
   widespread use of multi-sensor systems and the increasing relevance of
   radio wireless and autonomous sensors.}},

   for the formation of the present and future generations of students and
   also, in our point of view, of teachers. One example of this effort can
   be seen in the Portuguese project ``A Journey to the Origins.
   Astrobiology in the Lab{''}, where secondary school students recreate
   experiments regarding the Origin of Life and Cellular Evolution. The
   work will be widened to the educational community through the carrying
   out of Open Laboratory Sessions, conferences and the drawing up of a
   digital portfolio compiling all of the material developed by students
   and teachers throughout the project. A proposal win be made to
   restructure the curriculum to include a new unit entitled ``Astrobiology
   and Cellular Evolution{''}. The repercussions of this innovative
   paradigm could be seen in the future, not only in the educational
   community, but also in the society in general.}},

Abstract = {{The National Technological University was created in 1984 as a
   cooperative effort by many major engineering and management colleges in
   the United States for the graduate and continuing education needs of
   busy, engineers, technical professionals and managers. Today, 52
   university campuses are linked by 16 channels of new MPEG2/DVB
   compressed digital video technology to workplaces in North America, and
   since 1995, to nine countries in the Asia Pacific region. NTU's vision
   is to enable working professionals and managers to share premier
   educational resources globally via telecommunications. NTU is a private,
   non-profit, accredited university although it has no direct faculty or
   campus student facilities, Today, NTU offers thirteen MS degrees and a
   MBA, nearly 500 academic courses each year. and more than 450 non-credit
   continuing education courses to a customer list of more than 250
   business and government organizations. NTU's brief history is punctuated
   with a number of innovations. These involve delivery technology, and
   more recently, the creation of a for-profit subsidiary for many support
   functions. This paper describes the organizational relationships with
   the 52 participating universities and their faculties. Academic program
   outcome measures are reviewed in depth. Current trends in continuing
   education service are described. The increasing role of the Internet and
   World Wide Web in all aspects of the operation is reviewed. NTU's latest
   delivery technology strategy is also highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1980s Japan was viewed as the world leader in high technology.
   Its superiority in electronics and other manufacturing sectors created
   the enigma of the Japanese management system and trade friction with the
   USA. Today the sharp decline in Japan's competitiveness has become
   another enigma and even a trouble in the world economy, This paper
   addresses the contrast between Japan's high-tech industry in the 1980s
   and that in the 1990s. The ascendance of Japanese high-tech industry up
   until the 1980s has been attributed to tacit knowledge and the
   organization of Japanese firms based on shared knowledge. The
   competitive decline during the 1990s has been viewed as a failure of the
   Japanese assembly industry to adapt to the change in explicit knowledge
   embodied in the digital revolution. In this paper the author produces a
   more comprehensive explanation for the decline in the competitiveness of
   the Japanese high-tech industry by introducing a comparison between
   science-driven sectors, which rely on the sharing of tacit knowledge,
   and engineering-driven sectors, which should rely more on explicit
   knowledge such as is found in strategic components. The author argues
   that different forms of organization are appropriate to different types
   of knowledge exchange. He concludes that current changes in the
   organization of Japanese firms and research will stimulate the
   science-driven sector of the country's high-tech industry.}},

Abstract = {{This article is illustrated by factual industrial cases and shows how
   influential the generalization of information digital exchange is on the
   innovation process regarding companies, from engineering design to
   commercialization of industrial products.
   Computer networks, either internal (Intranet), `private' external
   (Extranet) or `public' external (Internet) make a `digital chain' of
   information exchange which disrupts companies' innovation process. This
   `digital engineering design process' allows quicker innovation in a more
   creative way and favours direct commercialization of industrial products
   which may be kept virtual (in a digital form) throughout the design
   process. It allows for design as well as marketing of these industrial
   products thanks to electronic commerce. Thus toy manufacturers are
   asking themselves about the relevance of selling their products directly
   through the internet without any commercial retailer.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of set-top boxes, the convergence of TV (broadcasting)
   and PC (Internet) is set to enter the home environment. Currently, a
   great deal of activity is occurring in developing standards (TV-Anytime
   Forum) and devices (TiVo) for local storage on Home Media Servers (HMS).
   These devices lie at the heart of convergence of the triad:
   communications/networks - content/media - computing/software. Besides
   massive storage capacity and being a communications `gateway', the home
   media server is characterised by the ability to handle metadata and
   software that provides an easy to use on-screen interface and
   intelligent search/content handling facilities.
   In this paper, we describe a research prototype HMS that is being
   developed within the GigaCE(1) project at the Telematica Instituut(2).
   Our prototype demonstrates advanced search and retrieval (video
   browsing), adaptive user profiling and an innovative 3D component of the
   Electronic Program Guide (EPG) which represents online presence. We
   discuss the use of MPEG-7 for representing metadata, the use of MPEG-21
   working draft standards for content identification, description and
   rights expression, and the use of HMS peer-to-peer content distribution
   approaches. Finally, we outline explorative user behaviour experiments
   that aim to investigate the effectiveness of the prototype HMS during
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic commerce or business is more than just another way to sustain
   or enhance existing business practices. Rather, e-commerce is a paradigm
   shift. It is a ``disruptive{''} innovation that is radically changing
   the traditional way of doing business. The industry is moving so fast
   because it operates under totally different principles and work rules in
   the digital economy. A general rule in e-commerce is that there is no
   simple prescription and almost no such thing as an established business
   or revenue model for companies even within the same industry. Under such
   conditions, an analytical framework is needed to assist e-commerce
   planners and strategic managers in assessing the critical success
   factors when formulating e-commerce business models and strategies. This
   research develops an analytical framework based on the theories of
   transaction costs and switching cost. Both demand-side and supply-side
   economies of scale and scope are also applied to the development of this
   framework. In addition, e-commerce revenue models and strategies are
   also discussed. Based on the analytical framework developed by this
   research, this paper discusses the five essential steps for e-commerce
   success. They are: redefine the competitive advantage; rethink business
   strategy; re-examine traditional business and revenue models,
   re-engineer the corporation and Web site; and re-Invent customer
   service. E-commerce planners and strategic managers will be able to use
   the framework to analyze and evaluate the critical successful factors
   for e-commerce success.}},

Abstract = {{Significant challenges are facing the packaging business and DCP might
   be one of the answers.
   DCP is a new way of thinking for the print-buyers and the
   print-producers and will or better is already affecting the packaging
   industry. But there are still many inquiries to do.,
   First of all to understand the potential which this technology can offer
   and secondly to learn how to deal with it.
   All available systems on the market are not meeting the packaging
   requirements, yet.
   It was necessary to find partners which will share the interests to
   explore the suitability of the technology to develop a tailor made DCP
   process for the packaging industry.
   A lot of work has been investigated in the the workflow, print process
   and the toner requirements.
   Most of the printing problems caused by technical limitations, e.g., web
   guiding, fusing, feeding and finishing properties have to be solved.
   The packaging requirements are somewhat different as for papers
   therefore toner and material modifications are necessary.
   Together with software suppliers specific Colormanagement developments
   to improve print quality and also to simulate and transfer the different
   conventional print processes to a digital 4 color press have been
   started.
   DCP is a new business that opens markets with new rules and approaches
   and which is still in motion.
   Therefore we at LMPS believe to become an innovative and competend
   partner/supplier for our customers it is necessary to investigate in
   this technology the future.}},

Abstract = {{The Digital printing revolution continues to take ink jet technologies
   into new industrial printing markets. The new products and concept
   printing systems recently introduced over the past couple of years,
   especially at DRUPA 2000 and other recent industry trade shows,
   exemplify this point as well as the convergence with conventional print
   applications. The digital market is seeing the emergence of new
   innovative ink applications, which are traditionally supported by
   conventional ink manufacturers, like Flint Ink. An example of this is
   the use of UV curable ink jet inks. The reason for the development of
   newly innovative inks is that end users are demanding to be able to
   print on more difficult substrates such as chrome and UV coated paper
   stocks, vinyls, polycarbonates, polypropylenes, polyethylenes, and
   glass. These new requirements are also making it more challenging since
   most of the substrates do not have an ink jet receptive coating on its
   surface. This makes the ink formulator's job more challenging. This
   paper discusses some of the recent and emerging industrial applications
   utilizing ink jet printing technologies, target substrates, and types of
   inks suitable for each application.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the inkjet technology has made great strides in the
   print quality. By introducing fine droplets, deep and light color inks,
   optimized media, and advanced color and image processing, the latest
   inkjet printers can produce photo-quality prints. Of these many
   improvements, the most contributive one is that the innovative
   piezoelectric print head has reduced the ink droplet size by a factor of
   ten in the latest five years. This innovation has been accomplished by
   optimizing head dimensions and driving signals as well as improving the
   manufacturing and assembling process. The piezoelectric actuator driven
   by the signal, optimized for the particular print head model, can
   precisely control the unrestrained ink meniscus vibration at the nozzle
   openings to achieve multi-sized droplets ejection in a sequent manner as
   well as stabilized droplet ejection up to the extremely high ejection
   repetition frequency. This Variable-Sized Droplet Technology (VSDT) has
   made it possible to introduce the digital photo-printers to the market
   without trading off the throughput. This paper shows how the
   piezoelectric inkjet technology has been improved and how much
   flexibility it has for particular use in home, office and industry.}},

Abstract = {{The world of textile printing is rapidly changing. Customers are
   demanding a greater variety of color and design. Responding to this
   demand is a necessity in today's marketplace. Printers are forced to
   find new and innovative ways to provide printed samples while minimizing
   cost and waste. Digital printing technology allows customers to
   streamline the entire design, sampling, and production process.
   The majority of all textiles are printed using rotary screen print
   machines. While this technology offers high speed and inexpensive
   output, there are many drawbacks. The average order size is rapidly
   decreasing, and textile companies are printing shorter runs. Rotary
   screen technology offers obvious benefits during long runs, but does not
   provide economical short run production. Again, the answer lies in
   digital printing. Unfortunately, production digital printing of textiles
   was not a possibility...until now.
   When it comes to true inkjet production for textiles, there are not many
   choices. Most of the current inkjet printers were designed for graphic
   arts printing, not fabric. Several companies have begun addressing these
   problems, and the future of digital printing of textiles is beginning to
   take shape. Targeted to hit the market in 2001 are printers with speeds
   up to 50 m(2)/hour for direct textile printing and up to 200 m(2)/hour
   for transfer printing. In addition, most of the machines currently being
   developed for textiles are based on existing print machines and material
   handling systems. These printers will be capable of multiple ink
   chemistries and will print both knitted and woven fabrics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper gives an overview on the state of the art in print production
   systems and methods, applied printing technologies and their positioning
   within the graphic arts, communication. and media/multimedia industry
   including the description, of trends. for further developments (figs. 1,
   4, 10, 23, 24, 25;:26, 27, 28).
   Digitalization allows the linking of the production/workflow sections
   prepress, press and postpress and can lead to print production systems,
   which include all these three conventional sections (figs. 8 15,23).
   The high quality of print media and, their economical production. is
   based on powerful printing technologies and systems. Conventional
   printing technologies, for high productivity which use plates (figs. 1,
   2, 5) as well as masterless NIP (non-impact printing) technologies
   (figs. 1, 3, 15, 16, 25) are realized in commercial systems. The
   combination of several different printing processes (Figure 11) leads to
   hybrid printing systems which are optimized for special applications and
   versions for print media (e.g. offset and ink jet, Figure 13) for
   personalization/customization and print quality improvements etc. (figs.
   2, 12, 14).
   New technologies make distributed, print on demand production and fully
   variable printing page per - page possible and economical (figs. 9, 10).
   The driving force for doing this was the digitalization in prepress,
   digitalization of workflow, equipment, processes and tools to describe
   the print product to be produced completely with one data file (Figure
   22), as well as advanced printing and finishing systems, networking
   (Figure 8) and the communication techniques (Figure 35) which are
   available. Printing via the net, measurement and automation control
   techniques and systems, remote proofing, all the computer to.
   technologies (Figure 4, 32) for digital print production and the
   production of multimedia products (Figure 23), are established and
   secure high quality multicolor print media (figs. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21)
   within the world of E-commerce and global communication.
   All in all, print media do not compete with electronic media, only some
   partial replacement effects for special print products and applications,
   e. g. dictionaries, can be observed; the synergy effects between both
   kind of media support each other and lead also to cross-publishing and,
   multimedia products (Figure 37). The demand for print media-is growing
   continuously, also as an effect of the high growth rate of electronic
   media (Figure 24). Premedia as, a new section in the workflow - in front
   of prepress 7 Creates and provides a digital, master for producing
   printmedia and/or electronic media (Figure 23). A hybrid / multimedia
   product is, for example, a conventional book which includes a CD-ROM,
   especially with search functions. and animations added to the file,
   describing the content of the book itself.
   The power of print can be clearly, recognized by the high quality which
   is available at relatively low costs, the great volume and demand of
   printed products and their high variety (figs. 25, 26,33, 34). The power
   of print is,also confirmed by the innovations in technologies, systems
   and applications, with realization and the strong demand for different
   systems for digital printing (Figure 28).
   Synergies and innovations allow the creation of new components within a
   printing system. and continuous improvements. Image processing, new
   materials, optoelectronic and micromechanical components are being
   developed in the labs worldwide and used in improved or new systems.
   Short comments/information about `'X''-graphy (Figure 1) - new
   NIP-technologies like Elcography, TonerJet, Direct Imaging Printing,
   Zurography and ``Ink mist jetting{''} are given.
   There is a wide field of interest in interdisciplinary scientific,
   research, engineering, system and product design and for
   customer-friendly solutions and applications within the graphic arts and
   communication industry; these are challenges and chances to enter the
   market with new ideas and systems in time, successfully for all partners
   - users, suppliers and customers (Figure 39).
   The presentation covers this wide field of subjects and gives an
   overview on the state-of-the-art status and the future trends (figs. 24,
   25, 27, 33, 34, 38). A selection of examples are shown and explained.
   for the different printing and production systems optimised for several
   applications. This especially for offset and flexographic printing
   including direct imaging techniques (figs. 2, 51 6, 13) as well as for
   the leading NIP-technologies electrophotography and ink jet (figs. 3,
   14, 15, 16, 25).
   Examples for innovative new technologies and product concepts which are
   `'on the road'' to be checked and used in practice are mentioned like
   E-book, E-ink, E-paper (figs. 29, 30, 31), erasable and rewritable
   substrate/surfaces with storage capability (fig. 6, 7), OLEDs, MEMSs
   (e.g. digital micro mirror devices) and PLZT-light valves for designing
   new imaging systems, etc. as well as improved and new print production
   techniques and systems.
   The following list of figures (mostly based on Ref. 1) should be like a
   `'red line/road map'' through the evolution and world of print media
   production , provide summarized key messages and information and
   desribes the content of the presentation:.}},

Abstract = {{SIREV (Sector Imaging Radar for Enhanced Vision) is an innovative radar
   system which can supply high-quality images of a sector in front of an
   aircraft under almost every weather condition. In contrast to synthetic
   aperture radar (SAR) systems, no relative motion between sensor and
   targets is required in SIREV. The high frame repetition frequency in
   SIREV allows to detect even very rapid changes in the imaged scenes.
   Besides a map of the earth's surface, the complex-valued radar images
   can be further processed to supply additional information about the
   topography and objects in the field of view. A fast processing algorithm
   has been developed for SIREV which allows a very accurate, phase
   preserving and efficient image formation. Raw data were obtained by a
   first demonstration flight using a helicopter as a platform and the data
   processing results show good agreement with the theory. Motion errors of
   the platform could be extracted from the range compressed raw data
   avoiding the need of an inertial navigation system. After the image
   formation, coherent and incoherent image averaging processes have been
   applied to improve the image quality. The evaluation of the
   computational effort shows that a real-time hardware realization can be
   carried out using off-the-shelf digital components.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays the all digital solution in hospitals is becoming widespread.
   The formidable increase of medical data amount to be processed,
   transmitted and stored, requires some efficient compression systems and
   innovative tools to improve data access, while ensuring a sufficient
   visualization quality for diagnosis. Medical image sequences can benefit
   from advanced video coding techniques when adapted to their specific
   constraints. Scalability, or the capability to partly decode a video
   bitstream and to get a reconstruction quality proportional to the
   decoded amount of information, is a key functionality.
   We have developed a video codec based on a 3D Motion-Compensated subband
   decomposition, which provides a combination of temporal, spatial and SNR
   scalabilities together with a very competitive compression ratio. We
   show that, when applied to medical sequences, it outperforms JPEG-2000
   on coding efficiency aspects and offers new functionalities.}},

   Internet standards) and increasing homogeneity of regulation has
   strongly affected the environment, financial services companies are
   operating in. Given these changes on the market, innovation is not a
   choice, but a necessity to survive. Observable today, however, are
   defensive strategies and poor service quality. In this paper based on
   investments in trust relationships with customers we propose
   Sophistication (fit) Banking enabled by IT and qualified staff and show
   first steps towards the implementation of a sophistication banking
   strategy. While traditional markets are characterized by shrinking
   margins and declining shareholder values, which can easily be explained
   considering the digital character of financial products, new
   intermediaries for customer-centered Sophistication (fit) Banking have
   the opportunity of becoming spiders in the web and increasing

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, technology drivers for microprocessors have
   changed significantly. Media data delivery and processing - such as
   telecommunications, networking, video processing, speech recognition and
   3D graphics - is increasing in importance and will soon dominate the
   processing cycles consumed in computer-based systems. This paper
   presents the architecture of the VASP-4096 processor. VASP-4096 provides
   high media performance with low energy consumption by integrating
   associative SIMD parallel processing with embedded microprocessor
   technology. The major innovations in the VASP-4096 is the integration of
   thousands of processing units in a single chip that are capable to
   support software programmable high-performance mathematical functions as
   well as abstract data processing. In addition to 4096 processing units,
   VASP-4096 integrates on a single chip a RISC controller that is an
   implementation of the SPARC architecture, 128 Kbytes of Data Memory, and
   I/O interfaces. The SIMD processing in VASP4096 implements the ASProCore
   architecture, which is a proprietary implementation of SIMD processing,
   operates at 266 MHz with program instructions issued by the RISC
   controller. The device also integrates a 64-bit synchronous main memory
   interface operating at 133 MHZ (double-data rate, DDR), and a 64-bit 66
   MHz PCI interface. VASP-4096, compared with other processors
   architectures that support media processing, offers true performance
   scalability, support for deterministic and non-deterministic data
   processing on a single device, and software programmability that can be
   re-used in future chip generations.}},

Abstract = {{UCLA is in the process of building a new acute-care hospital due to open
   in 2005 with the intent to operate fully digitally. The strategic
   planning for this hospital is based on a set of new paradigms: wider and
   more efficient access to all information sources, enterprise-wide data
   repository, usage of thin-client technology and wide usage generic
   information-appliances and wireless devices allowing access to
   information from anywhere in the hospital. These new paradigms required
   significant changes from traditional information technology architecture
   in particular in workflow management of large quantities of imaging
   data. We elected to adopt an enterprise-wide data repository strategy
   where images would reside in local PALS archive storage for limited time
   and then migrate to generic data archive that can be decentralized or
   eventually even outsourced to data-warehousing companies. The other
   technical innovation is the adoption of display devices that will be
   available across the enterprise allowing users to review patient records
   as well as other types of medical and technical information from a
   variety of sources using a similar paradigm as today's web-based
   technology. The emerging technology referred to as ``information
   appliances{''} consisting of devices that can be portable or
   wall-mounted and will allow to navigate though different data while
   being driven by handheld devices similar to today's palm computers.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims at developing innovative algorithms and tools for
   summarizing echocardiogram videos. Specifically, we summarize the
   digital echocardiogram. videos by temporally segmenting them into the
   constituent views and representing each view by the most informative
   frame. For the segmentation we take advantage of the well-defined
   spatio-temporal structure of the echocardiograin videos. Two different
   criteria are used: presence/absence of color and the shape of the region
   of interest (ROI) in each frame of the video. The change in the ROI is
   due to different modes of echocardiograms present in one study. The
   representative frame is defined to be the frame corresponding to the
   end-diastole of the heart cycle. To locate the end-diastole we track the
   ECG of each frame to find the exact time the time-marker on the ECG
   crosses the peak of the R-wave. The corresponding frame is chosen to be
   the key-frame. The entire echocardiogram. video can be summarized into
   either a static summary, which is a storyboard type of summary and a
   dynamic summary, which is a concatenation of the selected segments of
   the echocardiogram video. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first automated system for summarizing the echocardiograin videos based
   on visual content.}},

Abstract = {{Most physicians and other health care providers share/access patient
   information via hard copy chart records, telephone conversations, or
   through hospital computer networks. These modalities are cumbersome when
   physicians are away from the hospital and ground wiring infrastructure
   is not readily available. in a prior study, we used wireless in-flight
   telephony and the Internet to transmit vital signs from an airborne
   Boeing 757 to three remote locations on the ground. However, because all
   recipient stations relied on an institutional network to receive the
   information, it was not possible to transfer data to a given location
   beyond the hospital campus. We now propose an innovative system capable
   of transmitting telemetry information from any location in the globe to
   a single portable computer using Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)
   technology for the Internet. Medical data including blood pressure,
   pulse, respiratory rate, end tidal CO2, oxygen saturation and EKG
   tracings were transferred from a G2 (digital cellular) phone linked to a
   hand held computer to a remote hand held device and were viewed in real
   time using customized software. Cellular Digital Packet Protocols (CDPD)
   enabled data transfer speeds up to 19,200 bps. Advances including the
   Internet and wireless computer technology may revolutionize the way
   medical information is shared, making it possible for physicians and
   health allies to directly access patient data from anywhere at any time.}},

Abstract = {{Internet2 is a consortium of leading U.S universities working in
   partnership with industry and the U.S. government's Next Generation
   Internet (NGI) initiative to develop a faster, more reliable Internet
   for research and education including enhanced, high-performance
   networking services and the advanced applications that are enabled by
   those services {[}1]. By facilitating and coordinating the development,
   deployment, operation, and technology transfer of advanced,
   network-based applications and network services, Internet2 and NGI are
   working together to fundamentally change the way scientists, engineers,
   clinicians, and others work together.
   The NGI Program has three tracks: research, network testbeds, and
   applications. The aim of the research track is to promote
   experimentation with the next generation of network technologies. The
   network testbed track aims to develop next generation network testbeds
   to connect universities and federal research institutions at speeds that
   are sufficient to demonstrate new technologies and support future
   research. The aim of the applications track is to demonstrate new
   applications, enabled by the NGI networks, to meet important national
   goals and missions.
   The Internet2/NGI back-bone networks, Abilene and vBNS (very high
   performance Backbone Network Service), provide the basis of
   collaboration and development for a new breed of advanced medical
   applications. Academic medical centers leverage the resources available
   throughout the Internet2 high-performance networking community for
   high-capacity broadband and selectable quality of service to make
   effective use of national laboratories, computational facilities, and
   large data repositories.
   The Internet2 Health Sciences Initiative enables a new generation of
   emerging medical applications whose architecture and development have
   been restricted by or are beyond the constraints of traditional Internet
   environments. These initiatives facilitate a variety of activities to
   foster the development and deployment of emerging applications that meet
   the requirements of clinical practice, medical and related biological
   research, education, and medical awareness throughout the public sector.
   Medical applications that work with high performance networks and
   supercomputing capabilities offer exciting new solutions for the medical
   industry. Internet2 and NGI strive to combine the expertise of their
   constituents to establish a distributed knowledge system for achieving
   innovation in research, teaching, learning, and clinical care.}},

Title = {{Impact of the digital filter as a weak constraint in the preoperational
   4DVAR assimilation system of Meteo-France}},
Journal = {{MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW}},

Volume = {{129}},

Pages = {{2089-2102}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a weak constraint formulation of the digital filter based
   on the Dolph-Chebyshev window is introduced in a preoperational version
   of the 4DVAR analysis of Meteo-France. The constraint is imposed only on
   the analysis increments to damp spurious fast oscillations associated
   with gravity-inertia waves. In the incremental formulation of 4DVAR, the
   analysis increments are obtained from a global model at a uniform low
   resolution with a simplified set of physical parameterizations, while
   the high-resolution forecast is obtained with a model that uses a
   variable-resolution grid having a higher resolution over France and the
   complete set of physical parameterizations. Both models have the same
   vertical resolution. In a set of preliminary experiments using the same
   background field and the same set of observations, it is shown that the
   weak constraint imposed only on the low-resolution increments manages to
   control efficiently the emergence of fast oscillations in the resulting
   high-resolution forecast while maintaining a closer fit to the
   observations than is possible if the digital filter initialization is
   applied externally on the final analysis increments. It is also shown
   that this weak constraint does not add any significant computer cost to
   the 4DVAR analysis. Finally, 4DVAR has been cycled over a period of 2
   weeks and the results show that, compared to 3DVAR, the initial
   dynamical imbalances are significantly less in 4DVAR even if no
   constraint is imposed at all. However, it has been noted that the
   innovation statistics show a positive impact when a constraint is
   applied.}},

Abstract = {{The analog-to-digital (A/D) interface is generally considered to be the
   most critical part of any signal acquisition and processing system.
   Because of the difficulty in achieving high-resolution and high-speed
   A/D converters, this A/D interface has been and continues to be a
   barrier to the realization of high-speed, high-throughput system.
   Recently, there has been a renewed interest in new and innovative
   approaches to A/D conversion, with a significant emphasis on photonic
   techniques. Interleaving is a common approach applied to high-speed
   photonic A/D conversion which reduces the wide-bandwidth input signal to
   one which can be converted using conventional high-speed A/D converters.
   The high-speed sampled input is interleaved to N individual channels
   with each channel operating at 1/N of the sampling rate. These
   channelization techniques are known to suffer from performance
   degradations due to channel-to-channel mismatch. Within the electronic
   A/D converter community, temporal oversampling and spectral noise
   shaping have become common practice in high-fidelity audio applications.
   Here, a low-resolution quantizer is embedded in a feedback architecture
   in an effort to reduce the quantization noise through spectral noise
   shaping. A large error associated with a single sample is diffused over
   many subsequent samples and then linear filtering techniques are applied
   to remove the spectrally-shaped noise thereby improving the overall SNR
   of the converter. The approach to wideband photonic A/D conversion
   described here leverages the 2-D nature of an optical architecture to
   extend the concept of spectral noise shaping to include 2-D spatial
   noise shaping. The proposed approach uses a mode-locked laser to
   generate the optical sampling pulses, an interferometer to modulate the
   electronic analog signal onto the optical pulses, and a 2-D smart pixel
   hardware implementation of a distributed error diffusion neural network.}},

Abstract = {{The Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) in Wilmington, North Carolina is an
   important habitat for bottlenose dolphins year round. However, little is
   known about the levels of physical, biological, and anthropogenic noise
   to which dolphins are exposed In this habitat. We are utilizing a
   digital signal acquisition system linked to a moored hydrophone (-170.1
   dB re 1V/uPa) In the ICW in order to characterize and quantify ambient
   sea noise and the factors affecting it. In particular, we are
   quantifying the contribution of anthropogenic noise from recreational
   boats and personal watercraft to total environmental sound levels.
   Surveillance video of the ICW Is captured by a computer stored in a
   weatherproof container at the end of the Center for Marine Science pier,
   a structure that extends Into the ICW. Audio output from the hydrophone
   is amplified and filtered before being digitized by an analog-to-digital
   converter, sampling at rate of 75 kHz. The digitized signal is acquired
   continuously in 30-second time-stamped AIFF files. Both audio and video
   files are transferred to a second computer located within the Center for
   Marine Science building via a fiber optic cable which runs the length of
   the dock. Video files are annotated for boat activity. Audio files are
   used to generate one spectrogram from each second of waveform data.
   Spectral data are stored on with raw waveform data and video data on
   20GB Digital Audio Tapes. Using this innovative system, we will map
   levels of total sound exposure over time to determine if bottlenose
   dolphins are being subjected to acoustic harassment (both as that term
   has been defined In the literature, and how that term may soon be
   defined by the National Marine Fisheries Service) by exposure to high
   levels of anthropogenic noise, and if so, how often. Comparative spectra
   generated during different times of day and across seasons will provide
   a comprehensive picture of the acoustic environment experienced by this
   group of bottlenose dolphins. This study promises to provide one of the
   first quantitative assessments of the potential impacts of anthropogenic
   noise on bottlenose dolphins.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development in progress of a simulation tool to
   model acoustic digital communication over time-varying channels. Based
   on a modular structure, this tool is constituted by the description of
   an emission, channel and reception part. Physical parameters
   characterize time varying channels by integration of static parameters
   (kind and form of sea surface or sea bed) and variable ones (celerity,
   receiver moves...). This software is suitable for testing all
   configurations (provided rays propagation is available) and signal
   processing techniques for message recovery and is able to deal with time
   variant impulse response. Performances of acoustic link could be
   evaluated on the one hand from a statistical point of view by simulation
   of representative series of symbols. On the other hand, the quality of
   the link can be visualized by transmission of pictures, sounds or text
   files. Results are suitable by conventional tools (eye-pattern, I-Q
   constellations, BER, SER or display of decoded symbols).}},

Abstract = {{Current manufacturing processes require rapid, reliable methods and
   compact, user-friendly, elegant devices capable to work even in
   unpromising environment. innovative user-friendly methods and techniques
   as well as small holographic and speckle interferometers are presented
   in this paper. The devices are very compact, easy to operate,
   incorporate semiconductor laser sources and do not require personnel
   skilled in optics.
   Miniature semiconductor laser sources were successfully used in
   holography and laser speckle metrology for the tasks of 3-dimensional
   data acquisition, storage and display. Semiconductor lasers enable
   compact recording and display devices which are easy in operation and
   well fitted to practical industrial environments.
   Novel inspection methods and compact devices incorporating miniature
   semiconductor laser sources can be applied for automated inspections and
   optical precision measurements in optomechatronic systems. They fit well
   for real time monitoring of local deformations. Presented devices and
   techniques meet modem industrial requirements and permit to work in
   unpromising environment, perform in situ checks of products and
   components. Vast experimental data are given and the possibilities of
   innovative devices and techniques are properly illustrated in multiple
   practical examples. Photographs from holograms and holographic
   interferograms recorded with semiconductor lasers and successive sets of
   snapshots during real time monitoring of thermal fields are presented.}},

Abstract = {{During the development and integration of a chipset prototype for a
   W-CDMA third-generation (3G) IMT-2000/UMTS FDD Mode mobile device,
   intermittent noise spikes and glitches were observed. A major challenge
   for the 3G team was the robust design of the modem's digital hardware
   and DSP firmware for tolerance to these problems and non-fatal
   recoverability. This paper will describe how the system noise problems
   affect the WCDMA modem, and the innovative design considerations for
   robust modem hardware and firmware that were made to address these
   problems. The focus will be on the receiver, since this is where the
   problems caused by glitches manifest themselves most clearly, usually in
   the form of complete loss of system synchronization (i.e. dropped call).}},

Abstract = {{As electro-optic sensors increase in size and frame rate, the data
   transfer and digital processing resource requirements also increase. In
   many missions the spatial area of interest is but a small fraction of
   the available field of view. Choosing the right region of interest,
   however, is a challenge and still requires an enormous amount of
   downstream digital processing resources. In order to filter this
   ever-increasing amount of data, we look at how nature solves the
   problem. The Advanced Guidance Division of the Munitions Directorate,
   Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNG) at Eglin AFB, Florida, has been
   pursuing research in the area of advanced sensor and image processing
   concepts based on biologically inspired sensory information processing.
   A summary of some vertebrate and invertebrate inspired
   ``neuromorphic{''} processing efforts will be presented along with a
   seeker system concept utilizing this innovative technology. Concepts and
   requirements for future such efforts will also be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Electronics, broadly defined here as that corpus of knowledge amassed
   particularly since WW-2 days about signal generation, processing and
   display using low-inertia electrical elements, is at a critical turning
   point. We are immersed in two paradigm shifts simultaneously.
   First is the transformation of this entire field, but especially the
   classical analog circuit domain, from a largely technological craft into
   a commodity business. Design - the choice of form and features, the
   introduction of key innovative advances, and the optimization of our
   products through a succession of expert trade-offs while grudgingly
   recognized as necessary, is increasingly perceived as just a subservient
   aspect of the struggle to greater competitiveness, profitability and
   shareholder value. The prevailing view is that time to market and cost
   are more important than elegance and finesse. This shift in priorities
   portends the demise of the custom-designed product, to be replaced by
   Lego-block systems implemented by the re-use of standard analog cells in
   just the same way as has happened in the digital field.
   The second paradigm shift is the ascendancy of the Bit and the common
   expectation of a digital solution for every problem and an inherently
   better solution, just by being digital. The stunning successes of the
   past decade amply prove that. It logically follows that the future world
   is a place of digital everything. And anyway, putting reason aside, the
   learned articles in Newsweek and Forbes agree: all that old-fashioned
   analog stuff is not simply on its way out: its practically stone dead.
   Are these assertions about the future shape of our industry really true?
   This paper will answer that the first is an oversimplification, and that
   the second is a sheer miscalculation. The analog residue, if it pleases
   the pundits to think of that way, will continue to be a vital, essential
   and innovation-rich part of the electronics of the twenty-first century.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional range data acquired through digital scanning of
   anatomical surfaces are used in this study as test material for the
   validation of an innovative approach for the reconstruction of closed
   surfaces. Although based on a straightforward theoretical approach, the
   proposed method exhibits an extreme accuracy in the reconstruction of a
   variety of target surfaces of different topologies. The method does not
   require any additional information about the target surface than the raw
   range data and is robust to noise. A triangular mesh approximates the
   target surface. Also, a few examples on the possible biomedical
   applications of the reconstructed surface are provided in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys the most recent development in the PDE method for
   image inpaintings. Image inpainting is essentially an image
   interpolation problem, with wide applications in film and photo
   restoration, text removal, special effects in movies, disocclusion,
   digital zoom-in, and edge-based image compression and coding. Bertalmio,
   Sapiro, Caselles, and Ballester (2000) {[}2] first innovatively
   introduced the PDE method for the inpainting problem. Ever since, the
   authors of the present paper have worked along this line and developed
   the PDE method, as inspired by the Bayesian method and variational
   method. This paper summarizes the most recent results and applications.}},

   digital radiotherapy image network. The acquired pictures from the image
   intensifier (II), live movies and still captures can be overlaid and
   compared with portal images, DRRs, scintigrams or reconstructed PET
   images. The images can be used as a working, basis to define beam
   apertures or blocks. As an innovative feature, we developed software
   that enables us to overlay the projection of CT demarcated volumes from
   the outline of transversal slices on the actual (online) X-ray image of
   the living patient on the simulator's couch. This method combines the
   advantages of both imaging modalities by means of a direct fusion (3D CT
   data + 2D simulator image data).}},

Abstract = {{Review of current and emerging methods of holography and speckle
   metrology is given. Onboard research by means of holography and speckle
   metrology is analysed. Advanced holographic rapid access system (RAS) is
   presented. It is very simple, compact, portable, user-friendly and
   requires minimal hardware. Holographic RAS has several modifications and
   spin-offs. Ultra high resolution silver halide media are used in this
   RAS, The unique features of holographic RAS enable the possibility to
   avoid any liquid baths for photoprocessing of the medium and to work in
   real time in situ. It is possible to work practically in any brightly
   lit environment, including sunlit environments. In principle dark
   environments for hologram production become avoidable. Holographic RAS
   ensures proper colour response, ie bright holographic reconstructions
   exactly at the wavelength of recording. Colour shifts are eliminated.
   Novel techniques permit to perform colour coding and decoding of
   holograms and holographic interferograms. The first RAS of laser speckle
   photography was introduced as one of the spin-offs of the rapid
   holographic system. For the first time it is possible to obtain
   holograms, holographic interferograms and specklegrams outdoors. These
   RAS are well suited for various practical applications. They are very
   cheap and require minimal holographic hardware, Novel very small
   holographic device is presented. It is portable device with no lenses
   and no alignment problems enabling holograms and holographic
   interferograms with monochrome or colour data output. This device is so
   simple that it can be operated by an astronaut having practically no
   skill in optics. Experimental data properly illustrating novel vast
   possibilities for onboard space research are presented.
   Holographic RAS can work outdoors and in other unpromising environments
   including microgravity conditions. Numerous photographs from holographic
   interferograms and holograms are shown. Holographic image obtained in
   extremely unpromising outdoor environment is given. The innovative
   holographic RAS is elegantly devised and suits ideally for testing of
   MEMS in microgravity. One of the early variants of holographic RAS
   invented by this author was used to obtain the first ever holograms and
   holographic interferograms of different physical phenomena aboard
   navigating spacecraft.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative technologies are being developed within the SHYLOC project,
   which is partly funded by the European Commission's Space Technology
   programme under the 4th Framework Programme, to provide improved tools
   for wetland modelling and satellite-derived information for wetlands
   that can be used for calibrating hydrological models. The project
   comprises three main components: (a) a software tool, SHYLOC, that uses
   a unique method to combine Landsat-TM images with digitized drainage or
   irrigation ditch networks to determine surface water storage; (b) a
   coupled hydrological and hydraulic modelling system that can incorporate
   hydraulic boundary conditions commonly associated with wetlands; and (c)
   a comprehensive hydro-meteorological database for four wetland sites in
   England and Greece. Preliminary results are promising. The SHYLOC
   software and the coupled hydrological/hydraulic modelling package have
   been completed and are being applied to the project test sites. There is
   a correlation between space-borne and ground based measurements of ditch
   water levels, and water balances are being prepared for two of the
   wetland sites.}},

Abstract = {{MARSCHALS (Millimetre-wave Airborne Receivers for Spectroscopic
   CHaracterisation in Atmospheric Limb Sounding) is being developed with
   funding from the European Space Agency as a simulator of MASTER
   (Millimetre-wave Acquisitions for Stratosphere Troposphere Exchange
   Research), a limb sounding instrument in a proposed future ESA Earth
   Explorer Core Mission. The principal and most innovative objective of
   MARSCHALS is to simulate MASTER's capability for sounding O-3, H2O and
   CO at high vertical resolution in the upper troposphere (UT) using
   millimetre wave receivers at 300, 325 and 345 GHz. Spectra are recorded
   in these bands with 200 MHz resolution. As such, MARSCHALS is the first
   limb-sounder to be explicitly designed and built for the purpose of
   sounding the composition of the UT, in addition to the Lower
   Stratosphere (LS) where HNO3, N2O and additional trace gases will also
   be measured.
   A particular attribute of millimetre-wave measurements is their
   comparative insensitivity to ice clouds. However, to assess the impact
   on the measurements of cirrus in the UT, MARSCHALS has a near-IR digital
   video camera aligned in azimuth with the 235mm limb-scanning antenna. In
   addition to UT and LS aircraft measurements, MARSCHALS is capable of
   making mid-stratospheric measurements from a balloon platform when
   fitted with a 400mm antenna. Provision has been made to add further
   receiver channels and a high resolution spectrometer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new and innovative semi-active variable stiffness
   tuned mass damper (SAIVS-TMD). The system has the distinct advantage of
   retuning in real time thus making the system robust to changes in
   building stiffness and damping, whereas the passive tuned mass damper
   (TMD) can only be tuned to a fixed frequency. The SAIVS-TMD is based on
   a novel semi-active variable stiffness control (SAIVS) device. SAWS
   system requires nominal power for operation as compared to active tuned
   mass dampers. The SAIVS-TMD is retuned using a new control algorithm
   based on instantaneous frequency estimation using Hilbert transform and
   short-time Fourier transform (STFT). An analytical model of a
   three-story structure with SAIVS-TMD is developed. Numerical simulations
   are performed using the analytical model. The system is implemented in a
   1:10 scale three-story scale model in real time using a digital signal
   processing system and controller. Shake table test results of the system
   with the SAIVS-TMD are presented. It is shown that the SAIVS-TMD is very
   effective in reducing the response and providing retuning capability
   when the building stiffness changes, whereas the TI M is mistuned and
   loses its effectiveness. Analytical modeling and comparisons between
   analytical and experimental results are also presented.}},

   the relative positions of objects in 3-dimensional space is critical, by
   providing visual cues along the sight axis. Applications such as
   tele-medicine, remote surveillance, tele-education, entertainment and
   others could benefit from such a system since it conveys an added
   viewing experience. For simplicity and cost efficiency the system is
   kept as simple as possible while offering a certain degree of control
   over the encoding and decoding platforms. Data exchange is done with
   TCP/IP for control between the server and client and with UDP/IP for the
   MPEG-2 transport streams delivered to the client. Parameters such as
   encoding rate can be set independently for the left and right viewing
   channels to satisfy network bandwidth restrictions, while maintaining
   satisfactory quality.
   Using this system, transmission of stereoscopic MPEG-2 transport streams
   (video and audio) has been performed over a 155 Mbps ATM network shared
   with other video transactions between server and clients. Preliminary
   results have shown that the system is reasonably robust to network
   impairments making it useable in relatively loaded networks.
   An innovative technique for broadcasting Standard Definition Television
   3-D video using an ATSC compatible encoding and broadcasting system is
   also presented. This technique requires a simple video multiplexer
   before the ATSC encoding process, and a slight modification at the
   receiver after the ATSC decoding.}},

Abstract = {{The definition of a restoration project for a historical-artistic
   building is a high-skill operation. The preliminary survey and the
   following graphic representation of the artefacts, in particular, are
   two critical phases for good final results. The representation
   techniques called vectorial, including also the analytic photogrammetry,
   are nowadays surpassed by the wide introduction of digital techniques
   like the digital photogrammetry because of to excellent reproduction and
   low cost. Our paradigm for building restoration starts with a
   three-dimensional model of an edifice extracted from a set of
   2-dimensional image using specific Image Assisted Modelling software.
   This digital model represents the artefacts both in its metric and
   morphologic complexity. Basically the result is a fully
   three-dimensional wireframe model with dimensional information while the
   appearance features are defined as a collection of bi-dimensional
   textures attached to the faces of the model. The most innovative aspect
   is the possibility to simulate the restoration process in two separate
   streams. On one side it is possible to adjust the original textures
   using common bi-dimensional digital painting software or specific tools
   that allow the user to interact with a three-dimensional image. On the
   other side virtual environments permit to modify the model defining the
   dimension according to the desiderate restoration goal. We propose a new
   restoration project paradigm that integrates these innovative tools
   where artists and engineers work together and interactively. The
   restoration process is visualized in a specific immersive virtual
   environment developed by the authors in the VR3lab at Polytechnic of
   Bari-Italy. This is definitively an efficient way for designers, control
   agencies and building companies to immediately evaluate different
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in digital technology have substantially reduced the costs of
   reproducing and distributing digital information goods such as computer
   programs and games, documents, and works of music. Yet while abuses of
   intellectual property rights are difficult to trace, and infringement
   suits are expensive and uncertain to prosecute, innovation in these
   goods has continued unabated. This paper asks: How do firms appropriate
   the rents from their investments in R\&D in digital information goods?
   To a certain extent, developments in digital technology fundamentally
   challenge commonly accepted precepts of how firms profit from
   investments in R\&D. Yet software firms have made extensive use of
   traditional intellectual property rights like patents, copyrights, and
   trademarks. They have also adopted other approaches to appropriability,
   including cooperation with academic researchers, first-mover advantages,
   technical methods to restrict access such as encryption,
   cross-subsidization, price differentiation, and exploiting network
   externalities. Given the complexity of appropriating the rents from
   digital information goods, how effective are the different approaches,
   and what is the role of intellectual property rights?.}},

   Business modeling is not enough. Brainstorm sessions about the

Abstract = {{The increasing prominence of wireless multimedia systems and the need to
   limit power capability in very-high density VLSI chips have led to rapid
   and innovative developments in low-power design. Power reduction has
   emerged as a significant design constraint in VLSI design. The need for
   wireless multimedia systems leads to much higher power consumption than
   traditional portable applications. This paper presents possible
   optimization technique to reduce the energy consumption for wireless
   multimedia communication systems. Four topics are presented in the
   wireless communication systems subsection which deal with architectures
   such as PN acquisition, parallel correlator, matched filter and channel
   coding. Two topics include the IDCT and motion estimation in multimedia
   application.
   These topics consider algorithms and architectures for low power design
   such as using hybrid architecture in PN acquisition, analyzing the
   algorithm and optimizing the sample storage in parallel correlator,
   using complex matched filter that analog operational circuits controlled
   by digital signals, adopting bit serial arithmetic for the ACS operation
   in viterbi decoder, using CRC to adaptively terminate the SOVA iteration
   in turbo decoder, using codesign in RS codec, disabling the processing
   elements as soon as the distortion values become great than the minimum
   distortion value in motion estimation, and exploiting the relative
   occurrence of zero-valued DCT coefficient in IDCT.}},

Abstract = {{In order to facilitate a meaningful transdisciplinary discussion of
   human-machine interaction with a special focus on music. it is necessary
   to begin to standardize what is meant by ``interaction{''} given the
   various ways in which the term is used and perceived. In October 1999.
   the first ``Interactive Music Xpo{''} was held at the Jacob Javits
   Center in New York City. When I asked David Zicarelli, co-developer of
   the MAX interactive music programming language and the developer of MSP
   (Max Signal Processing). if he was going to participate in the
   conference. he stated. ``Their type of interaction is not my kind of
   interaction.{''} This conversation initiated my current research on
   senses of interaction. What are the ways in which the various
   disciplines of music use the term? How do definitions of interactivity
   in music compare? At the Interactive Music Xpo. interactivity in music
   often meant nothing more than a simple download of an mp3 file. A
   variety of commercial-based music industries were represented. including
   the computer game industry. DJs, software companies. record producers,
   and digital content clearing houses. When I asked Brian Schmidt. Program
   Manager of Consumer Windows Division for the Microsoft Corporation.
   ``What does interactivity mean?{''} we only agreed that the term
   continues to evolve. In this paper I propose to summarize the different
   senses of interaction offered in interviews with individuals from a
   variety of music and non-music disciplines. and attempt to synthesize a

Title = {{Bundling and competition on the Internet}},
Journal = {{MARKETING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-82}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{The Internet has significantly reduced the marginal cost of producing
   and distributing digital information goods. It also coincides with the
   emergence of new competitive strategies such as large-scale bundling. In
   this paper, we show that bundling can create ``economies of
   aggregation{''} for information goods if their marginal costs are very
   low, even in the absence of network externalities or economies of scale
   or scope.
   We extend the Bakos-Brynjolfsson bundling model (1999) to settings with
   several different types of competition, including both upstream and
   downstream, as well as competition between a bundler and single good and
   competition between two bundlers. Our key results are based on the
   ``predictive value of bundling,{''} the fact that it is easier for a
   seller to predict how a consumer will value a collection of goods than
   it is to value any good individually. Using a model with fully rational
   and informed consumers, we use the Law of Large Numbers to show that
   this will be true as long as the goods are not perfectly correlated and
   do not affect each other's valuations significantly. As a result, a
   seller typically can extract more value from each information good when
   it is part of a bundle than when it is sold separately. Moreover, at the
   optimal price, more consumers will find the bundle worth buying than
   would have bought the same goods sold separately. Because of the
   predictive value of bundling, large aggregators will often be more
   profitable than small aggregators, including sellers of single goods.
   We find that these economies of aggregation have several important
   competitive implications:
   1. When competing for upstream content, larger bundlers are able to
   outbid smaller ones, all else being equal. This is because the
   predictive value of bundling enables bundlers to extract more value from
   any given good.
   2. When competing for downstream consumers, the act of bundling
   information goods makes an incumbent seem ``tougher{''} to
   single-product competitors selling similar goods. The resulting
   equilibrium is less profitable for potential entrants and can discourage
   entry in the bundler's markets, even when the entrants have a superior
   cost structure or quality.
   3. Conversely, by simply adding an information good to an existing
   bundle, a bundler may be able to profitably enter a new market and
   dislodge an incumbent who does not bundle, capturing most of the market
   share from the incumbent firm and even driving the incumbent out of
   business.
   4. Because a bundler can potentially capture a large share of profits in
   new markets, single-product firms may have lower incentives to innovate
   and create such markets. At the same time, bundlers may have higher
   incentives to innovate.
   For most physical goods, which have nontrivial marginal costs, the
   potential impact of large-scale aggregation is limited. However, we find
   that these effects can be decisive for the success or failure of
   information goods. Our results have particular empirical relevance to
   the markets for software and Internet content and suggest that
   aggregation strategies may take on particular relevance in these
   markets.}},

Abstract = {{Tunnel diode oscillators have been used in many types of experiments
   that measure the properties of materials. We present the details of an
   apparatus that extend these tunnel diode techniques to measure the
   properties of materials in pulsed magnetic fields. In the most common
   version of this method, a sample is placed in the inductor of a small rf
   tank circuit powered by a tunnel diode and the conductivity,
   magnetization, or penetration depth is measured. We explain in this
   article how the sample and configuration of the radio frequency fields
   determine which property is measured. Our major innovations are to
   stabilize the tunnel diode oscillator during a magnet pulse by using
   compensated coils in the tank circuit and the development of two
   methods, one digital and one analog, to measure the frequency and
   amplitude shifts in the oscillator during the short (10 s of ms) magnet
   pulse. We illustrate the power of this new measurement method by showing
   preliminary results of the superconducting transition and the
   Shubnikov-de Haas effect in the organic conductor
   kappa-(ET)(2)Cu(NCS)(2). The Shubnikov-de Haas effect shows particularly
   high amplitude oscillations due to magnetic breakdown orbits. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The semiconductor industry has seen a remarkable miniaturization trend,
   driven by many scientific and technological innovations. But if this
   trend is to continue, and provide ever faster and cheaper computers, the
   size of microelectronic circuit components will soon need to reach the
   scale of atoms or molecules-a goal that will require conceptually new
   device structures. The idea that a few molecules, or even a single
   molecule, could be embedded between electrodes and perform the basic
   functions of digital electronics-rectification, amplification and
   storage-was first put forward in the mid-1970s. The concept is now
   realized for individual components, but the economic fabrication of
   complete circuits at the molecular level remains challenging because of
   the difficulty of connecting molecules to one another. A possible
   solution to this problem is `mono-molecular' electronics, in which a
   single molecule will integrate the elementary functions and
   interconnections required for computation.}},

Abstract = {{My decision about whom to select as the Academy of Management's
   Executive of the Year revolved around the concept of values. I wanted to
   showcase a leading CEO who has been successful in creating an innovative
   and highly profitable company, and who has done so based on a strongly
   held system of personal values that permeate the organization and
   everyone in it. In making my selection, I enlisted the help of Professor
   Andre Delbecq, director of the Institute for Spirituality of
   Organizational Leadership at the University of Santa Clara. The
   executive he recommended, Hatim Tyabji, fulfills these criteria in
   outstanding ways. Mr. Tyabji has herd a significant impact on the
   telecommunications industry. In 1998, he founded Saraide to drive the
   convergence between the Internet and wireless communications, The
   company delivers a wide range of wireless Internet services to customers
   around the world. In 1999, he negotiated the sale of 80 percent of
   Saraide to InfoSpace.com, a leading Internet information and commerce
   infrastructure provider, creating the largest global alliance in the
   wireless Internet services market. As a result, customers using pagers,
   cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or television-set-top
   boxes can access ct wide range of wireless services, including address
   books and calendars, stock quotes, travel information, local business
   locator services, personal banking, price comparison shopping, and
   purchasing By combining Infospace.com's leadership in Internet-based
   information services and Saraide's leadership in sophisticated wireless
   data services, the notion of ``the web in your pocket{''} is rapidly
   becoming a compelling solution for commerce, communication, and
   collaboration.
   Hatim Tyabji was born in Bombay, India, in 1945, moved to the U.S. in
   1967, and became a naturalized citizen. He holds a B.S. from the College
   of Engineering in Poona, India, an MS. from the State University of New
   York at Buffalo, and an MBA in international business from Syracuse
   University. From 1986 to 1998, he was the founding chairman and CEO of
   VeriFone, Inc., and held executive positions at Sperry from 1973 to
   1986. He is a member of the board of the Leavey School of Business at
   Santa Clara University The following pages record a conversation that I
   asked Andre Delbecq to conduct at the 2000 Academy of Management
   meetings in Toronto, Canada.}},

Title = {{Multi-rate suboptimal digital redesign of a cascaded continuous-time
   input time-delay system}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{401-421}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new multi-rate control scheme for optimal
   digital-redesign approach of the input time-delay continuous-time
   cascaded system. It shows that the states of the multi-rate sampled-data
   system with the digitally redesigned control law closely match those of
   the original cascaded continuous-time closed-loop system with analogue
   control law at any instant between sampling periods. Moreover, the
   developed digital control law can be implemented using low-cost
   microcomputers with a relatively longer sampling period. Also, it
   utilizes the innovative one-duration description of input time-delay
   sampled-data system which is suitable for any value of input time delay,
   even larger than one sampling period. As a digitized continuous-time
   system with a very small sampling period may become an unstable and/or
   non-minimum phase model, even if the original system is stable and/or
   minimum phase. A new method, with different sampling rates, suboptimal
   digital-redesign of a cascaded continuous-time system with different
   input time delays is accessible in this paper. An illustrative example
   is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design
   methodology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   containment. At the same time, the new digital environment may
   facilitate innovations intended to inform and expand consumer choice and
   to improve quality. The new environment elevates ``transparency{''} to a
   guiding principle. Health informatics has long been peripheral to reform

Abstract = {{With the rising innovative antigens (such as intruders and viruses)
   through Internet, reliable security mechanisms are required to
   perceptively detect and put them down. However, defense techniques of
   the current host system over Internet may not properly analyze Internet
   antigens, because trends of attacks are unexpectedly shifted. In this
   paper, we introduce an Antibody Layer that mediates proper security
   services based on the biological mechanism to rapidly disclose and
   remove innovative antigens. The proposed Antibody Layer also employs a
   new topology called antibody cooperation protocol to support real-time
   security QoS for one host as well as host alliance.}},

Abstract = {{The celebrated information technology (IT), has been a phenomenal
   success. But, it is a narrow one. It has marched along a one-dimensional
   path of information processing and transmission, but extended little to
   the left - acquiring information, or to the right executing on
   information.
   It is in the tremendous space and potential to the left and right of the
   evolution path that plastic electronics is envisioned as an enabling
   technology. Complementing the ever more powerful microelectronics, it
   has the potential to be a disruptive technology to microelectronics.
   While this has always been a distant possibility in the past, the time
   for a major breakthrough is now within sight. This has much to do with
   the state of microelectronics and with the recent profound progress in
   developing organic electronic materials.
   Microelectronics, as the engine driving today's IT advances, has come to
   a crossroads. On the road to nanoelectronics, one sees exponentially
   increasing cost and diminishing return with billion dollar IC fab cost
   doubling every generation. The high cost is, on the one hand, squeezing
   out all but the largest players and on the other, slowing down
   innovation from within. Troubles at the physical foundation of today's
   microelectronics are of as much concern, if not more so. The wiring
   challenge and the power dissipation crisis are only going to get worse
   with each further step of miniaturization. These problems are deeply
   rooted in the much-hyped digitalization, i.e. the paradigm of binary and
   serial signal processing. In this state of microelectronics, the
   opportunities for alternative technologies are emerging, and will be
   best pursued if not by our own initiatives then maybe by the movement of
   investors' dollars to areas of greater return.
   At the crossroads, microelectronics can go down to nanoelectronics. But,
   it can also move up to macroelectronics, and can extend to the left and
   to the right, where plastic electronics enters as an enabling base
   technology. In contrast to silicon microelectronics, plastic electronics
   can be large-area (macrosize IC, display, memory films), large critical
   feature size (macro linewidth), and compatible with a continuous rotary
   fabrication (printing) process rather than the batch (lithographic)
   fabrication.
   The performance of individual plastic electronic devices or ICs is
   unlikely to march the silicon counterparts - now or ever - one might
   say. But disruptive technologies do not have to satisfy the same
   performance criteria as existing ones because they address new products
   and new markets, as the Harvard Business School teaching goes. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The digital age isn't all it's cracked up to be, Albrecht and Gunn
   suggest. Not everyone is thrilled by the changes it has brought, but
   many people fear speaking out against the dominant code of beliefs-what
   the authors term the Digital Doctrine-that has been pushed on society by
   ``techno-Nazi{''} ideology. The tenants of the Digital Doctrine:
   Technology is an all-encompassing force rather than a choice people
   make.
   Any innovations in technology that can be implemented must be
   implemented.
   The Wired World is our destiny. You must embrace it or be left out.
   The people who don't ``get it{''} must be helped to understand.
   The ``invading cyber-Vikings{''} who push that ideology on the rest of
   us have also created their own business process es and vocabulary,
   thinking that the old rules no longer apply. Actually, Albrecht and Gunn
   say, the Internet will only evolutionize, not revolutionize, business.
   Companies that are proving to be most successful in the New Economy are
   the established leaders in the Old Economy that incorporate online
   technology into their businesses.
   The authors predict that almost all Internet-only businesses will fail
   because they burn through investors' money without accumulating enough
   sales to cover operating expenses. As these companies collapse in
   droves, say Albrecht and Gunn, the interest and money for all things
   digital will turn to ``Internet Fatigue.{''} Users of Internet
   technology will level off, following the universal S-curve principle.
   But what if the interest in all things tech has already plateaued?
   Two-thirds of the world has never used a telephone. The belief that all
   we have to do to bring disadvantaged people into the digital age is to
   give them a computer is distinctly American upper-middle-class thinking,
   say the authors.
   What will be the consequences of not balancing technology and human
   concerns? Albrecht and Gunn remind us that technology should exist
   primarily as a tool to serve humans.}},

Abstract = {{The CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter is a high-precision detector
   demanding innovative solutions in order to cope with the high dynamic
   range and the extreme high resolution of the detector as well as with
   the harsh environment created by the high level of radiation and the 4T
   magnetic field. The readout system is partly placed within the detector
   and partly in the adjacent counting room. As the on-detector electronics
   must cope with the harsh environment the use of standard components is
   excluded for this part of the system. This paper describes the solutions
   adopted for the high-precision analogue stages, the A-D conversion, the
   optical transfer of the raw data from the on-detector part to the
   so-called Upper Level Readout, placed in the counting room, and the
   functionality of the latter. The ECAL is instrumental in providing
   information to the first-level trigger process and the generation of
   this information will be described. Also, the problem of reducing the
   raw data volume (6 x 10(12) bytes/s) to a level that can be handled by
   the central DAQ system (10(5) bytes/s) without degrading the physics
   performance will be discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Scholars have advanced various theories to explain the common failure of
   market leaders in the face of revolutionary technological change. The
   history of NCR Corporation provides an instructive exception to that
   general pattern. This paper examines how NCR addressed the introduction
   of electronics to the field of business equipment and the advent of
   digital computers to widespread use. It describes NCR's entry into the
   computer industry in the 1950s and its commitment to evolutionary
   adaptation of its core products. It shows how persistence in old modes
   of practice led eventually to a crisis, which was resolved favorably
   when new management and fundamental organizational transformations
   reversed adverse trends and restored robust profitability.
   While established academic theories can help to explain aspects of the
   story, no single theoretical perspective is sufficient to explain the
   path of NCR's behavior. NCR survived, we conclude, because new
   leadership provided the impetus to actualize latent dynamic
   capabilities. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{There is empirical evidence that established firms often have difficulty
   adapting to radical technological change. Although prior work in the
   evolutionary tradition emphasizes the inertial forces associated with
   the local nature of learning processes, little theoretical attention has
   been devoted in this tradition to understanding how managerial cognition
   affects the adaptive intelligence of organizations. Through an in-depth
   case study of the response of the Polaroid Corporation to the ongoing
   shift from analog to digital imaging, we expand upon this work by
   examining the relationship between managers' understanding of the world
   and the accumulation of organizational capabilities. The Polaroid story
   clearly illustrates the importance of managerial cognitive
   representations in directing search processes in a new learning
   environment, the evolutionary trajectory of organizational capabilities,
   and ultimately processes of organizational adaptation. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Recent developments in digital signal analysis have allowed substantial
   progress in the field of impulse excitation techniques (IET), i.e. the
   mechanical-spectroscopic analysis of `impulse excited' resonant
   vibrations. The new IET-devices determine several impulse excited
   resonance frequencies simultaneously. Upon each single impulse
   excitation, the internal friction corresponding to each of the analysed
   frequencies is deduced from the exponential decay of the vibration
   amplitude. In this paper, data obtained with a resonance frequency and
   dumping analyser (RFDA) which is linked to two furnaces, are presented.
   One of the furnaces can reach temperatures up to 1100 degrees C in air.
   This furnace was used to characterise phase transformations and point
   defect relaxations in yttria-stabilised polycrystalline zirconia (Y-TZP)
   ceramics. Subtle differences in composition affect the measured internal
   friction spectrum. A second furnace is graphite heated and is used for
   measurements in inert atmosphere up to 1750 degrees C. In this furnace a
   sintered silicon nitride was tested to investigate the glass transition
   and crystallisation of an intergranular amorphous phase. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Objective-To compare fit and geometry of reconstruction of femoral
   components of 4 canine cemented total hip replacement implants and
   determine which implants are most compatible with current principles of
   cemented arthroplasty.
   Sample Population-Paired femurs from 16 adult mixed-breed dogs.
   Procedure-Femurs were prepared for femoral stem implantation of either
   the Bardet, BioMedtrix, Mathys, or Richards II implant. Mediolateral and
   craniocaudal radiographs were obtained with femoral components in situ.
   Cross-sectional analysis of implant fit was performed on transected
   cemented specimens, Computer-aided analyses of digitized images were
   performed.
   Results-The Bardet and Richards II implants reconstructed the original
   femoral head position significantly better than the other 2 implants.
   None of the implants allowed neutralization of the implant axis in the
   sagittal plane or were routinely centralized in the femoral canal. The
   Bardet implant had the smallest minimum distal tip offset in the
   sagittal plane. Greatest tip to cortex distance was provided by the
   Richards II implant in the transverse plane and the Mathys implant in
   the sagittal plane. The thinnest cement mantle regions for all implants
   were in the central longitudinal third of the femoral stem.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The Bardet and BioMedtrix implants
   had stem design characteristics that were most compatible with
   principles of cemented stem fixation. None of the implants completely
   satisfied the theoretically optimal conditions of centralization and
   neutralization of the femoral stem. Innovative design modifications,
   therefore, may be needed if these conditions are important to the
   longterm success of canine total hip replacement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is about the ``Computer Integrated Road Construction{''}
   (CIRC) project, which is a Brite-EuRam III funded project, lasting
   1997-1999, aiming at introducing a new generation of control and
   monitoring tools for road pavements construction. These new tools are
   designed to bring on the sites significant improvements by creating a
   digital link between design office and job site, The first part of the
   paper describes the background of the project, which gathers seven
   European partners from five different countries, and gives the
   objectives of the project, in general and for each of the two targeted
   products: one for the compactors (CIRCOM) and one for the asphalt pavers
   (CIRPAV). Then, the two prototypes are described, each of them being
   broken down into three main sub-systems: the ground sub-system (GSS),
   the on-board sub-system (OB) and the positioning sub-system (POS). The
   expected benefits for the different users are also presented and
   quantified. The central part of the paper is devoted to the main
   technical innovations that have been developed in the frame of the
   project: universal vector database for road equipment guidance,
   multi-machine functionalities of CIRCOM and the two positioning systems
   which are actually the technological keys of the systems. Finally, the
   state of progress of the developments of the two CIRC products and the
   first commercial success achieved in parallel are presented. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Networking home entertainment devices such as digital television
   receivers facilitate resource sharing and information exchange so that
   new applications can coordinate the control of several devices
   simultaneously. The increasing connectivity of home audio-video devices
   requires interoperability so that products from different vendors can
   comply with well-defined connection and communication protocols.
   The home audio/video interoperability (HAVi) architecture is a set of
   application programming interfaces (APIs), services, and an on-the-wire
   protocol specified by an industry initiative. HAVi facilitates
   multivendor interoperability between consumer electronics devices and
   computing devices, and simplifies the development of distributed
   applications on home networks.
   The HAVi architecture, discussed and explained in this article, also
   facilitates the innovation and introduction of new features or
   refinements. A key feature is that each physical device has an
   associated software proxy, Adding new proxies to a home system makes new
   features or devices accessible even to applications running on older
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Using data for U.S. metropolitan statistical areas, an earlier study of
   aggregate local geographic research spillovers generated by universities
   (Anselin et al.1997) was extended to a sectorally disaggregated level.
   These findings suggest the existence of significant sectoral variation
   with respect to local university effects on innovation. Apparent
   differences were found across sectors with respect to the ``mix{''} of
   applied local knowledge inputs in general, and the extent to which
   university research plays a role in innovation in particular. The main
   conclusion is that local university spillovers seem to be specific to
   certain industries, such that at the two-digit SIC level, no university
   spillover effects are at work in the Drugs and Chemicals (SIC28) and in
   the Machinery (SIC35) sectors. On the contrary, very strong and
   significant university research spillovers are evidenced in the
   Electronics (SIC36) and the Instruments (SIC38) industries. These
   spillovers extend beyond the boundary of the MSA within a 75-mile range
   from the central city.}},

Abstract = {{A technique is presented to differentiate hills from valleys, using a
   contour map. Unlike previous classification techniques based on a
   gridded representation of terrain, the new method is based on the
   containment relationship of nested contours. The primary contribution of
   this paper is an innovation to accommodate contours that leave the edge
   of the map. Because these contours are ambiguous with respect to
   interior and exterior, they warrant special treatment during containment
   testing operations. Their proper interpretation results in a more
   comprehensive classification product. Hills are constructed from the top
   down, by starting with a summit contour and incrementally annexing
   contours at lower elevations that contain the summit. Conversely,
   valleys are built from the bottom up, by annexing contours at high
   elevations that contain the basin contour Construction of hills and
   Valleys terminates when containing contours cease to exist.}},

Abstract = {{While effective therapies exist for health conditions that diminish the
   quality of life, there remain hurdles in healthcare delivery that may
   limit access to such therapies for individuals who would benefit from
   them. Limited company resources coupled with double-digit increases in
   pharmaceutical costs-frequently designated as the ``culprit{''} behind
   recent increases in medical expenditures-may not allow health plans to
   cover every effective drug in every clinical circumstance for every
   affected individual. Managed care companies currently employ several
   mechanisms to counter runaway pharmaceutical costs, such as excluding
   some drugs from coverage, imposing significant limitations, or requiring
   higher copayments through tiered pharmaceutical coverage structures. The
   trend toward greater patient contribution for indicated agents could
   well invoke cries of bias, in that a tiered copayment system may
   discriminate based on income and ability to pay. The practical inability
   within the healthcare community to compare healthcare interventions such
   as treatments for erectile dysfunction with those for asthma,
   hypertension, or other conditions prevents the optimal allocation of
   healthcare services.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative alternative to estimate parameters of
   a system for which a dynamic model is known. The focus Of this paper is
   the estimation, of the armature circuit parameters of large utility
   generators using real time operating data. Other applications are
   possible. The alternatives considered are the use of orthogonal series
   expansions, in general, and the Hartley series, in particular. The main
   idea considers the use of orthogonal series expansions for fitting
   operating data (e.g., voltage and currents measurements). This allows
   writing a set of linear algebraic equations that can be ``solved{''} in
   the least squares sense for the unknown parameters. The method shown
   utilizes the pseudoinverse in the solution. The essence of the approach
   is linear state estimation. Several alternative types of orthogonal
   expansions are briefly discussed. Although solutions are the same in all
   domains, one wishes to employ the expansion that gives the most
   efficient computation. The approach may be used for static as well as
   dynamic problems. The approach is tested for noise corruption likely to
   be found in measurements. The method is found to be suitable for the
   processing of digital fault recorder data to identify synchronous
   machine parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper documents the case of the aircraft engine control system. It
   aims to offer a detailed picture of the dynamics of the technological
   capabilities of aircraft engine manufacturers in relation to a specific
   and increasingly important engine subsystem, namely the control system.
   It draws on a combination of detailed qualitative and quantitative data
   to construct two measures of firms' technological capabilities, namely
   breadth and depth. The paper shows that engine manufacturers develop and
   maintain a broad and deep range of capabilities in-house in order to
   retain their systems integration capabilities over time. In particular,
   as regards the breadth, the paper shows how engine makers have responded
   to the shift in technologies underlying the control system by enlarging
   their breadth of capabilities through dedicated in-house investments, as
   well as by forging links with universities and specialised suppliers. As
   regards the depth, the paper shows that engine makers do not only focus
   their capabilities on the architecture of the engine control system, but
   they deepen them also in component technologies. The paper argues that
   engine manufacturers need a deep understanding of components' inner
   functioning in order to be able to specify, assess, test and integrate
   components produced externally into the engine, as well as to coordinate
   and benefit from changes arising from fast-moving technological fields,
   such as digital electronics. On the basis of these results, it is argued
   that there is no perfect overlap between the technological boundaries
   and the production boundaries of firms developing complex,
   multitechnology products, such as aircraft engines. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   chosen to focus on the consumer electronics industry, taking as our case
   studies three producers of revolutionary products such as Sony's video
   camera, Sharp's PDA (Personal Digital Assistance) and Toshiba's notebook
   personal computer. These examples have the virtue of encompassing both
   visual and text-based data transmission devices, as well as hand-script
   input and keyboard input methods. The main point we shall consider here
   is the stage that takes place before product innovation occurs, the
   process that we have termed ``institutional inducement{''}. which forms
   part of the feedback loop between the market, or environment, and the
   producer. Because this process is ``a flow of information and
   knowledge{''} we have structured it using a semiotic methodology, which
   has led us to conclude that product innovation is induced by the
   creation of new product concepts. In accordance with this, we propose
   that the evolutionary, dynamic pattern of product innovation is linked
   to the institutional trajectory. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An improved quality of life through education and developmental
   communication is an important necessity of societal up-liftment in the
   new millennium, especially in the developing nations. The population
   explosion and the associated pressure on the scarce resources to meet
   the basic necessities have made it more or less impossible for most of
   the nations to invest reasonable resources in realizing adequate
   channels of formal education. Thank to the developments in satellite
   communication and associated technologies, new vistas are available
   today to provide education and developmental communication opportunities
   to millions of people, spread across the globe. Satellite based Digital
   Audio and Multimedia Broadcasting is one such new development that is
   being viewed as an innovative space application in the coming decades.
   The potential of DAB technology to reach education, information and
   entertainment directly to the user through a specially designed receiver
   could be efficiently utilized by the developing nations to overcome
   their difficulties in realizing formal channels of education and
   information dissemination.
   WorldSpace plans to launch three geo-stationary satellites that would
   cover most of the developing economies in Africa the Mediterranean, the
   Middle East, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. Apart from a variety
   of digital, high quality audio channels providing news, views, education
   and entertainment opportunities the end users can also: get a responsive
   multimedia. The multimedia is being planned as a specially packaged
   offering that can meet the demand of students, professionals as well as
   certain special groups who have certain specific data and information
   requirements. Apart from WorldSpace, renowned agencies/firms from
   different parts of the world shall provide the required content to meet
   these requirements. Though the Internet option is available, higher
   telephone charges and the difficulty in getting access have made this
   option less interesting and unpopular in most of the developing
   countries. The proposed digital audio and multimedia offering from
   WorldSpace to millions of consumers spread across more than 120
   countries is considered as a unique tool for education and development,
   particularly in the developing nations. In this paper, an attempt is
   made to briefly describe the issues associated with education and
   development in developing countries, the WorldSpace offering and how a
   developing nation can benefit from this offering in the coming decades.

Abstract = {{The second part of this article contains the continued survey of the
   advanced development of measures of engineered safeguards and facilities
   for accident management, referring in greater detail to digital safety
   and instrumentation and control systems,, studies carried out at
   national research centers, and new facilities. Another topic considered
   in a separate chapter is the mitigation of the consequences of severe
   accidents.
   Irrespective of numerous improvements in accident prevention, reactor
   safety research in the past decade was characterized by its
   concentrations on severe accidents. The objective of restricting the
   consequences of hypothetical severe accidents to the plant building was
   approached in mitigating emergency measures developed and, in some part,
   also implemented. In addition, analytical methods in the field of severe
   accidents were expanded, and technologies were developed and validated
   which seek to stabilize the core melt and to control the phenomena
   associated with core meltdown.
   On the whole, light water reactors incorporating the innovations
   mentioned above attain a safety level which, combined with corresponding
   efforts in the economic sector, is a prerequisite of the renaissance of
   nuclear technology in the beginning century.}},

Abstract = {{The success of innovative engineering processes depend on short and
   iterative development cycles which offer the possibility of high quality
   products, cost-efficient on the market and thus to stand up to today's
   tough competitive pressure. All these new methods are subsumed under the
   term ``Rapid Product Development'' (RPD). Research focuses attention not
   only on the products, but also their development process. By pursuing
   several variants with modern methods the optimal solution can be found.
   In order to guarantee the continuity of the whole product development
   process, organisation structure, process and resources have to be
   connected ideally. Enhancing the Simultaneous Engineering approach, RPD
   is an interdisciplinary evolutionary methodology to combine all
   influences of an engineering process to an iterative product
   development.
   To shorten the development process several tools are available: physical
   and digital prototypes for the early and cost-efficient evaluation of
   different alternatives, the representation of knowledge for different
   experts by means of an Active Semantic Network (ASN) for the integration
   of interdisciplinary teams, technical support of communication and
   cooperation within the team by adequate synchronous and asynchronous
   media. The Engineering Solution Center (ESC) demonstrates the
   realization of these technologies and methods in detail. Published by

Abstract = {{This contribution presents a methodological framework and solutions for
   optimum control problems on regionalised agroecological models. The
   focus is laid on the estimation of optimum fertiliser input and crop
   rotation schemes as a dynamic control problem with different time
   scales. Beside the solution of the optimum control problems, which was
   presented in a former paper, this contribution focuses on the
   regionalisation of the optimum control problem. The task is solved by
   the identification of homogeneous units in the observed region by a
   geographic information system (GIS) using digital maps. These maps are
   set up by a vector-orientated database. The second innovative topic,
   which enables a regionalised solution of the optimum control problem, is
   the estimation of families of optimum solutions parameterised by spatial
   properties, e.g. soil parameters. Technical problems concern an
   efficient database access, which is solved within the GIS Arc/INFO,
   ArcView. Several solutions are presented for different regionalisation
   scenarios for a German investigation site. The proposed methodology
   supports the step of decision support in precision farming. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{During the last two decades there has been a great deal of research on
   renewable energy technologies. It is commonly thought that very little
   has come out of this research in terms of commercially interesting
   technologies. The first objective of this paper is to demonstrate that
   this perception is no longer entirely correct; in the 1990s there has
   been a double-digit growth rate in the market for some renewable energy
   technologies. The consequent alteration in the energy system, is,
   however, a slow, painful and highly uncertain process. This process, we
   argue, needs to be studied using an innovation system perspective where
   the focus is on networks, institutions and firms' perceptions,
   competencies and strategies. The second objective of the paper is
   therefore to present the bare bones of such an analytical framework. A
   third objective is to identify a set of key issues related to the speed
   and direction of that transformation process which needs to be studied
   further. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Programmable media processors have been emerging to meet the
   continuously increasing computational demand in complex digital media
   applications, such as HDTV and MPEG-4, at an affordable cost. These
   media processors provide the flexibility to implement various image
   computing algorithms along with high performance, unlike the hardwired
   approach that has provided high performance for a particular algorithm,
   but lacks flexibility. However, to achieve high performance on these
   media processors, a careful and sometimes innovative design of
   algorithms is essential. In addition, programming techniques, e.g.,
   software pipelining and loop unrolling, are needed to speed up the
   computations while the data flow can be optimized using a programmable
   DMA controller. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for
   two-dimensional convolution, which can be implemented efficiently on
   many media processors. Implemented on a new media processor called the
   MAP1000, it takes 7.9 ms to convolve a 512x512 image with a 7x7 kernel,
   which is much faster than the previously reported software-based
   convolution and is comparable with the hardwired implementations. High
   performance in two-dimensional convolution and other algorithms on the
   MAP1000 clearly demonstrates the feasibility of software-based solutions
   in demanding imaging and video applications. (C) 2000 SPIE and IS\&T.

Abstract = {{The sphere of communications is changing rapidly. Two different `worlds'
   exist-telecommunications and computer networks. These worlds are
   converging, each of them pushing its technologies. The integrated
   services digital network (ISDN) (most matured telecommunications
   network) is based on circuit-switching transfer mode. It offers services
   with guaranteed quality of service (QoS). Internet protocol networks
   (most common data networks) are based on packet-switching transfer mode.
   At present, it does not explicitly guarantee QoS parameters. IP networks
   are capable of transferring services that are similar to ISDN network
   services. QoS parameters are crucial for the success of communication
   services. The meaning of the term QoS in ISDN and IP networks is
   significantly different. At the end of this paper QoS parameters of ISDN
   and IP networks are compared. IP networks are being innovated; further
   improvements of their QoS parameters are expected.}},

   requiring about two thousand times fewer pixels than a 2-D panel and
   about one thousand times lower bandwidth than a scanned-spot approach
   for HDTV display. A 1080p projection display prototype based on this
   architecture has been developed, which displays 1920 x 1080 resolution,
   30-bit color (10 bit/channel RGB) and up to 120-Hz refresh. The system
   receives 1080p video data at 24 or 30 frames/sec via a standard SMPTE
   292M serial digital interface, While leveraging many traditional
   realtime video-processing techniques, several processing steps that are
   unique to the scanned linear architecture have been developed, including

Abstract = {{In this paper, the development of a multiple-sensor coordinate measuring
   system is introduced and its applications to automated part localization
   and rapid surface digitization are experimentally demonstrated. The
   developed multiple-sensor coordinate measuring machine (CMM) is
   characterized by an integrated use of a high-precision CMM equipped with
   a motorized touch probe, and a three-dimensional (3-D) active vision
   system, advanced computational software, and the associated electronics.
   The 3-D active vision system consists of three components: a
   charge-coupled device camera, a digital light professing (DLP)
   projector, and a personal computer with an image processing board. The
   DLP projector is based on the innovative digital micro-mirror device,
   which can be controlled by the personal computer to project various
   structured light patterns. With the flexibility of the DLP projector,
   the orientation, range, density, and colors of the structured light
   patterns are programmable and adaptable to different needs.
   Consequently, the active vision system is capable of digitizing surface
   coordinates of objects having multiple features. With the coordinate
   data acquired using the 3-D active vision system, intelligent feature
   recognition algorithms can be applied to extract the global surface
   information of the object. The obtained information can be subsequently
   used to automatically guide the touch probe for rapid coordinate data
   acquisition and to strategically control the coordinate measuring
   machine for high precision sampling of critical surface area. In this
   paper, the information automation for the multiple-sensor integrated
   system is demonstrated in part localization when computer-aided design
   models are available, and rapid and high-precision surface digitization
   in reverse engineering. By integrating the developed technology with the
   state of the art equipment, a highly automated high-speed high-precision
   3-D coordinate acquisition system can be developed. It has potential
   applications in a whole spectrum of manufacturing problems with a major
   impact on metrology, inspection, and reverse engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Current large-scale information sources are designed to support general
   queries and lack the ability to support scenario-specific information
   navigation, gathering, and presentation. As a result, users are often
   unable to obtain desired specific information within a well-defined
   subject area. Today's information systems do not provide efficient
   content navigation, incremental appropriate matching, or content
   correlation. We are developing the following innovative technologies to
   remedy these problems: 1) scenario-based proxies, enabling the gathering
   and filtering of information customized for users within a pre-defined
   domain; 2) context-sensitive navigation and matching, providing
   approximate matching and similarity links when an exact match to a
   user's request is unavailable; 3) content correlation of documents,
   creating semantic Links between documents and information sources; and
   4) user models for customizing-retrieved information and result
   presentation. A digital medical library is currently being constructed
   using these technologies to provide customized information for the user.
   The technologies are general in nature and can provide custom and
   scenario-specific information in many other domains (e.g., crisis
   management).}},

   might be inadequate in shaping appropriate insights for contemporary
   practice. This essay seeks to direct research attention toward the
   following question: How should firms organize their IT activities in
   order to manage the imperatives of the business and technological
   environments in the digital economy? We articulate the platform logic as
   a conceptual framework for both viewing the organizing of IT management
   activities as well as for framing important questions for future
   research. In articulating this logic, we aim to shift thinking away from
   the traditional focus on governance structures (i.e., choice of
   centralized, decentralized, or federal forms) and sourcing structures
   (i.e., insourcing, outsourcing) and toward more complex structures that
   are reflective of contemporary practice. These structures are designed
   around important IT capabilities and network architectures.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on electronic commerce and electronic marketplaces has
   long recognized the importance of intermediaries and the functions they
   serve. The Internet is most often discussed in connection with digital
   intermediaries as the displacement of traditional intermediaries. This
   article proposes a new conceptual framework For understanding how
   competition in business-to-business (B2B) electronic commerce in the
   presence of information technology (IT) innovations changes firm-level
   strategy choices and the structure of the marketplace. It also
   identifies and discusses the economic forces that lead to these changes,
   and in this context describes a recurring pattern of intermediation,
   disintermediation, and reintermediation through an ``IDR Framework.{''}
   The article explains the impetus for technological reintermediation,
   where a disenfranchised traditional player is able to compete again by
   leveraging technological innovations with cospecialized assets. This
   perspective is built with the support of relevant literature from severe
   I reference disciplines and with evidence from a field study of
   intermediation on the Internet in the corporate travel industry. The
   analysis reveals that traditional travel firms have access to a range of
   strategies that enable them to avoid disintermediation and retain highly
   profit able central roles in the marketplace in the long run.}},

Abstract = {{Through the adoption of recent innovations in automation in vision
   metrology, it can be demonstrated that rigorous, yet user-friendly
   digital photogrammetric processes of calibration and
   orientation/triangulation can be incorporated into a computational
   scheme which is on the one hand capable of meeting the demands of high
   metric quality. while on the other offering the facilities necessary to
   support wider application by non-specialist users. The software system
   Australis, developed for image mensuration and restitution of off-line
   close-range photogrammetric networks, is featured to illustrate these
   processes and procedures. By describing the structure and components of
   Australis, the authors aim to demonstrate that many processes which have
   on occasion been viewed to be the exclusive province of automated,
   high-precision vision metrology are indeed suited to more general
   application across a broad range of fields which involve 3D object
   recording via close-range imagery. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Although clinical photography is not new, the incorporation of digital
   wound images into computerized patient records is an innovation recently
   developed in nursing practice. At the Washington, DC Veterans Affairs
   Medical Center (Washington DC VAMC), a nurse imaging program is being
   developed through a unique partnership between a clinical nurse
   specialist and a nurse informaticist. Digitized images are stored as
   parts of the ViastA computerized patient record system, making them
   immediately available throughout the entire medical center, on moro than
   1500 computers in the clinical environment. Any patient condition that
   can be represented visually, for example, pressure ulcers, which are the
   most frequently imaged, can be placed into the medical record. The major
   benefit of this nurse imaging program is that the status of wound
   healing can be tracked visually over time, from acute care to the clinic
   setting, and to the home. Progression from the problem, as originally
   defined, through the innovation process, and a statement of future plans
   are presented in the article.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},

Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing the propagation delay in a chain of logic elements to digitize
   short time intervals has a high potential in various applications
   because the method has an ultrashort measurement ``dead time{''} and its
   complete timing circuit can be easily integrated in a single
   semiconductor chip. However, the existing single-lined chain suffers
   from serious nonlinearity due to the longer path lengths at the foldings
   which are unavoidable when the number of delay elements is large as high
   time resolution requires. We propose a new configuration in which the
   delay chain is branched. The delay elements of each branch evenly
   subdivide the corresponding larger folding path so all units have the
   same delay time. The proposed time-to-digital converter with an
   81-delay-unit branched chain and a built-in calibration circuit has been
   implemented on a commercial programmable logic device. It is used to
   interpolate different time durations within the 100 ns period of a
   standard 10 MHz clock. The digital time deviates less than 0.3 ns
   throughout the entire range. A similar single-lined delay chain,
   constructed for comparison, exhibits timing error up to 32.7 ns. A major
   improvement in linearity has been achieved by our device. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We are experiencing the beginning of a whole wave of changes, which will
   seize us all. Europe must accept this challenge, must face it on the
   highest political level. A long term socio-economic strategy must be
   developed for the transition into a new economic world. The success of
   this strategy will decide on whether Europe will lag behind the
   development or whether it will be found at its head. The future of
   Europe's social model depends on this.
   Europe is in dire need of enterprising people with a spirit for business
   and the readiness to take a risk, to found small and medium-sized
   businesses and let these flourish. On the other hand, the basic
   conditions for these must be made easier in order to remove the reasons
   for inhibitions. Besides the economical aspects education and job
   training are of great importance in our digital age. It must be
   understood in European economics that the new technologies are already
   available and that the policy of wait-and-see must be given up. The
   European Commission demands a dynamic European Enterprise, which must be
   built up by the year 2005. The readiness to take risks and innovation
   are to be supported within these surroundings. Not only the European
   institutions carry this responsibility but also the member states. They
   must learn from each other and constantly strive for the best methods
   and concepts to which they must be ready to adapt.}},

Abstract = {{The Regional and Mesoscale Meteorology (RAMM) Advanced Meteorological
   Satellite Demonstration and Interpretation System (RAMSDIS) was
   developed as part of an effort to get high quality digital satellite
   data to field forecasters prior to the deployment of the satellite
   component of the National Weather Service (NWS) Modernization Program.
   RAMSDIS was created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data and
   Information Service RAMM Team. RAMSDIS has made significant
   contributions to NOAA's satellite training and technology transfer
   program. The project has had a major impact on the utilization of
   digital satellite data, both nationally and internationally, providing
   the sole source for high-resolution digital satellite data at some NWS
   Forecast Offices (FOs) since 1993. In addition to its use in the FO,
   RAMSDIS has also provided data distribution and research capabilities on
   a common platform to several NOAA laboratories, allowing for more
   efficient collaboration on digital satellite data applications and
   analysis tools, and has been used by the World Meteorological
   Organization in an effort to provide digital satellite data to
   developing countries in Central America and the Caribbean.
   The RAMSDIS project was innovative for many reasons. This article
   describes the unique approaches that made the project a success and
   details RAMSDIS utilization within the NWS and NOAA. The next phase of
   RAMSDIS implementation in the international meteorological community is
   also described.}},

Abstract = {{In December 1996, JR East introduced ``ATOS{''} the latest Autonomous
   Decentralized System, on its Chuo Line. This system, named after Athos,
   the mountain which is sacred to the Greek Orthodox Church, is considered
   as a sanctuary of the railway technology in the current information
   society. ATOS or the Autonomous Decentralized System is not only an
   application, on a huge scale, of the concept of an epoch making network
   computing to the downsizing, but is also highly innovative in terms of
   the diversity and complexity of the technology applied, of its capacity
   for expansion, and of its complementary functions. The system not only
   controls the day-to-day operation of 6,200 trains over 1,100 kilometers
   of track, delivering information which is essential to the company's
   passengers and work force, but also serves as a safety system covering
   maintenance work, including track repairs and the inspection of
   electrical facilities. Total investment in ATOS is expected to reach
   \$360 million. This railway operation control system, which is a
   comprehensively revamped version of the CTC system used on many lines
   including the Shinkansen, is a digital application of analog technology
   at its best. It is among the most sophisticated and interesting
   applications of an autonomous decentralized system in the industry.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless local loop (WLL) denotes an access system that uses a wireless
   link to connect a subscriber's terminal station to the line terminating
   equipment (local exchange or distribution node) in place of conventional
   copper cable. Many technical advances in transceiver component design
   have managed to cut down the overall cost and increase the efficiency of
   wireless systems making them competitive for the local loop. The
   technical requirements of a WLL system vary according to the market
   segment, geographical area and services available or scheduled by the
   wireline counterpart. Hence, WLL is not described exclusively by a
   single technology but many technologies have been utilized as wireless
   local loop systems. These are cellular, cordless, satellite broadcasting
   or terrestrial microwave distribution technologies that were
   conceptualized for different market needs. The competition is going to
   be in service quality, data rate per channel and supplementary services
   such as videoconference, teleshopping, teleworking, Internet access,
   etc. However, given the availability of radio frequency spectrum, the
   declining cost, the speed of installation and the flexibility of
   technology, wireless local loop tends to become the prevalent solution
   in telephone network access provision. In this paper, we review the
   requirements of WLL systems and the technological innovations applicable
   to wireless transceivers. We also cover various multiple-access systems
   already implemented in other applications as candidates to offer WLL
   services. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This article shows a spiral-grooved turbobooster pump, which has a
   momentum transfer-type vacuum pump function, and is capable of operation
   in a discharge pressure range up to 1000 Pa. Transitional flow pumping
   speeds are improved by a well-designed midsection clement. Pumping
   performance of this new pump is predicted and examined by both of the
   computational fluid dynamics method and the direct simulation Monte
   Carlo method. These two complementary approaches are successfully being
   used to investigate the whole pumping speed curve from the viscous
   high-pressure to the molecular low-pressure range. Also, the developed
   Dump is tested on an evaluation system constructed according to JVIS-005
   standard. Good agreement between analytical results and experimental
   data are shown. Furthermore, to achieve a clean, safe, and reliable
   pumping process, this pump is designed with and operated by an
   innovative digital magnetic-bearing system. (C) 2000 American Vacuum

   Paper, USA, produces woodfree Fine- and Specialty papers in two mills
   (Gohrsmuhle mill in Bergisch Gladbach and Reflex mill in Duren). That
   includes coated and uncoated papers for all usual printings as well as
   for special applications like laser printer or photolike inkjet (digital
   imaging papers). Most of the production lines are characterized by high
   flexibility, lots of grade changes and big ranges of baseweights. On
   some papermachines it is necessary to produce coated papers as well as
   carbonless papers, art papers and different specialty papers. That
   requires having different brightnesses, sizing technologies refining
   targets and processes on the same papermachine.
   It is a special challenge to produce all these papers only on some lines
   and to combine quality, product innovation and effective, low cost
   processes.

Abstract = {{Continuing evolution of computer-based multimedia technologies has
   produced QuickTime(R), a multiplatform digital media standard that is
   supported by stand-alone commercial programs and World Wide Web
   browsers. While its core functions might be most commonly employed for
   production and delivery of conventional video programs (e.g., lecture
   videos), additional QuickTime VR ``virtual reality{''} features can be
   used to produce photorealistic, interactive ``non-linear movies{''} of
   anatomical structures ranging in size from microscopic through gross
   anatomic. But what is really included in QuickTime VR and how can it be
   easily used to produce novel and innovative visualizations for education
   and research? This tutorial introduces the QuickTime multimedia
   environment, its QuickTime VR extensions, basic linear and non-linear
   digital video technologies, image acquisition, and other specialized
   QuickTime VR production methods. Four separate practical applications
   are presented for light and electron microscopy, dissectable preserved

Abstract = {{The benefit of innovative hearing aid technology can be evaluated in
   clinical trials. The present study describes the comparison of a new
   digital hearing aid with an analogue device serving as a reference. The
   tests were carried out with 15 experienced hearing aid wearers. To
   prevent the influence of different fitting algorithms such as
   prescriptive or loudness-based the digital devices were not renewed
   fitted but their level- and frequency-depending gain was adjusted to
   that of the reference. Different tests concerning loudness perception
   (category loudness seating) speech discrimination in noise (the
   Gottingen sentence test) and self-assessment of the benefit by
   questionnaires were performed. All tests yielded slightly better results
   for the digital hearing aid. The speech audiometric evaluation showed
   somewhat better discrimination far the test-device. The questionnaires
   yielded a marked preference for the digital device. Because the study
   was not blinded influences due to the knowledge of the subjects of
   testing a new technology generally can occur. On the other hand, the
   question arises whether present audiometric tests sufficiently consider
   signal processing of modern hearing systems. Furthermore, one has to
   take into account that only a few of the features of digital technology
   such as noise-reduction and feedback-cancellation were considered in
   this study to allow for a sensible comparison. Because of the large
   number of possibilities offered by digital technology additional benefit
   by the hearing aid can be expected.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, librarians, museum curators and archivists have responded
   to ICT developments by adapting them to traditional working practices
   such as cataloguing. Recent developments are creating new pressures,

   The most radical innovation is that of the Internet, and it may no
   longer be appropriate to think in traditional terms to exploit this new
   medium to the full. The Internet offers remote access and digitisation
   programmes an being designed to make use of that. So far, these
   programmes have concentrated on the digitisation of finding aids or of
   selected primary source materials, but there is also a need for other
   programmes ('digital exhibitions') to be developed with a greater
   emphasis on collaboration and interpretation, aimed at the non-academic,
   or casual user. In this way librarians, museum curators and archivists
   can demonstrate their readiness to embrace the visions of such

   (SBIR) contract to develop a versatile, high-performance photon (or
   particle) counting detector combining recent technical advances in all
   aspects of Microchannel Plate (MCP) detector development in a low cost,
   commercially viable package that can support a variety of applications.
   The detector concept consists of a set of MCPs whose output electron
   pulses are read out with a crossed delay line (XDL) anode and associated
   high-speed event encoding electronics. The delay line anode allows
   high-resolution photon event centroiding at very high event rates and
   can be scaled to large formats (> 40 mm) while maintaining good
   linearity and high temporal stability. The optimal sensitivity
   wavelength range is determined by the choice of opaque photocathodes.
   Specific achievements included: spatial resolution of < 25 mu m FWHM;
   formats from 25 to 40 mm with digitized pixel sizes of similar to 3 mu
   m; total detector rates of > 200 000 events s(-1); local rates of > 100
   events s(-1) per resolution element; event timing of < 1 ns; and low
   background counting rates (< 1 event cm(-2)s(-1)). (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the link between

   this article, the authors apply a problem-solving perspective to the
   management of product development and suggest how shifting the
   identification mid solving of problems-a concept that they define as
   front-loading-can reduce development time and cost and thus free up
   resources to be more innovative in the marketplace.
   The authors develop a framework of front-loading problem-solving and
   present related examples and case evidence front development practice.
   These examples include Boeing's and Chrysler's experience with the use
   of ``digital mock-ups{''} to identify interference problems that are
   very costly to solve if identified further dol downstream-sometimes as
   late as during or-after first frill-scale assembly.

   projects by transferring problem and solution-specific information to
   new projects; and (2) rapid problem-solving-leverage advanced
   technologies and methods to increase the overall rate at which
   development problems are identified and solved. Methods for improving
   project-to-project knowledge transfer include the effective use of
   ``post-mortems,{''} which are records of post-project learning and thus
   carl be instrumental in carrying forward the knowledge front current and
   past projects. As the article suggests, rapid problem-solving carl be
   achieved by optimally combining new technologies (such as computer
   simulation) that allow for faster problem-solving cycles with
   traditional technologies (such as late stage prototypes), which usually
   provide higher-fidelity.
   A field study of front-looking at Toyota Motor Corporation shows how ct
   systematic effort to front-load its development process has, iii effect,
   shifted problem-identification and problem-solving to earlier stages of
   product development. They conclude the at-tide with a discussion of
   other approaches to front-load problem-solving in product development
   and propose how a problem-solving perspective cart help managers to
   build capabilities for higher development performance. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Unified Power Plow Controller (UPFC) is a flexible AC Transmission
   System (FACTS) device capable of controlling line flows and terminal
   voltage. In order to analyze its true effects on power systems, it is
   important to model its constraints due to various ratings and operating
   limits.
   Innovative techniques are introduced in this paper for fast power flow
   convergence with various UPFC control modes and simultaneous multiple
   limits enforcement, while the line side bus remains explicitly
   accessible. An efficient algorithm is developed for applying the line
   side voltage limits, which avoids the possible hunting between shunt and
   series converters of UPFC.
   Control models with similar constraints are also developed for stability
   studies. Simulations are performed using EPRI's Power Ssystem Analysis
   Package (PSAPAC).}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing scheduling is an important but difficult task. In order to
   effectively solve such combinatorial optimization problems, this paper
   presents a novel Lagrangian relaxation neural network (LRNN) for
   separable optimization problems by combining recurrent neural network
   optimization ideas with Lagrangian relaxation (LR) for constraint
   handling. The convergence of the network is proved, and a general
   framework for neural implementation is established, allowing creative
   variations. When applying the network for job shop scheduling, the
   separability of problem formulation is fully exploited, and a new
   neuron-based dynamic programming is developed making innovative use of
   the subproblem structure. Testing results obtained by software
   simulation demonstrate that the method is able to provide near-optimal
   solutions for practical job shop scheduling problems, and the results
   are superior to what have been reported in the neural network scheduling
   literature. In fact, the digital implementation of LRNN for job shop
   scheduling is similar to the traditional LR approaches, The method,
   however, has the potential to be implemented in hardware with much
   improved quality and speed.}},

Abstract = {{Small-tilt micromirror-based 2x2 fiber optic switch array structures are
   proposed using fixed mirrors and fiber interconnections. A
   multiwavelength 2x2 fiber optic switch based on this small-tilt
   micromirror is experimentally demonstrated. The key innovation in this
   architecture is the use of a specially located fixed mirror to form a
   symmetric 2x2 retroreflective switching structure. These 2x2 fiber optic
   switch structures can also provide a fault-tolerant design using a
   macropixel approach. A two-dimensional digital micromirror device
   (2D-DMD) from Texas Instruments (TI) designed to operate in the visible
   band is used to represent the small-tilt micromirrors in our
   experimental demonstration. Multiwavelength switch operation is
   characterized by changing the operating wavelength of the tunable laser.
   The measured average optical coherent crosstalk is -22 dB with +/-0.9 dB
   fluctuation over 40 nm, limited by the on-off ratio of the 2D-DMD. The
   measured average optical loss is 14.8 dB at a 1.55-mu m operating
   wavelength, limited by the visible wavelength design TI 2D-DMD,
   three-port optical circulators, fiber adapters, and free-space-to-fiber
   coupling efficiency. (C) 2000 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{Aim: Prostate tumours are often of harder consistency than the
   surrounding tissue. During digital rectal examination, this fact can be
   used not only to detect hypertrophy but also localized hardenings. The
   examination by digital palpation is inaccurate and, even in combination
   with PSA-value and a transrectal ultrasonic examination, the result is
   often not reliable. Ultrasound elastography enables us to measure and
   visualize the elastic properties of a tissue region and is a useful
   supplement to the examination by digital palpation. Ultrasound
   elastography is able to measure and visualize the elastic properties of
   a tissue region, therefore it is a useful supplement to commonly used
   diagnostic procedures. Method: We have developed a new system for
   elastographic prostate diagnosis which can be used during the
   transrectal ultrasonic examination. During the examination a sequence of
   ultrasonic images is acquired while the organ is slightly compressed by
   the ultrasound probe. Using numerical analysis of image pairs for the
   acquired sequence we calculate the tissue strain which represents the
   spatial elasticity distribution of a specific cross-section of the
   organ. This enables us to distinguish hard areas in the tissue. Image
   artifacts resulting from lateral motion components, i.e., orthogonal to
   the direction of the applied force, are compensated for by a special
   approach. Results: We present results obtained from a typical
   elastography phantom and also the first in vivo images from patients who
   were undergoing radical prostatectomy. Our images prove that ultrasound
   elastography has the potential to detect malignant tissue areas, which
   are inconspicuous in the B-mode image. Our findings are confirmed by the
   corresponding histological specimens.}},

   improving the digitized, grey-level outputs produced by a host of
   iterative geometric diffusion methods. By replacing standard,
   central-difference estimates of discrete spatial gradients with
   alternating image derivative estimates that are offset by known,
   complementary biases, errors accumulated during iteration are reduced
   and the quality of geometric diffusions is improved. This unexpected
   synergy occurs at no added computational cost over central difference
   methods. Very simple to implement, the innovation is introduced at the
   level of spatial derivatives; hence, for a given process, any derived
   higher level mathematical properties-for example, group invariance or
   scale-space properties-can be preserved.}},

   dependant on the scale of observation. This has the consequence that
   optical devices in the sub-millimeter range must be understood and
   conceived differently. Similar considerations are sound for devices
   making use of interactions of photons with biological matter, at the
   cellular and tissue scale, In biological tissues, propagation of light
   is different at the micro- than at the millimeter or centimeter scale.
   This has the advantage that several innovative instruments are presently
   in development which make use of this specific properties of light
   propagating at small scale. The examples of micro-endoscopy and
   micro-holography for tissue imaging and diagnosis are given.}},

Abstract = {{Clayton Christensen's (1997) book The Innovator's Dilemma documents many
   cases of prominent firms failing to adapt to disruptive technological
   innovations. The history of the computer industry is largely a story of
   companies who fail to make such a shift to new technology. Of the
   original mainframe computer manufacturers, GE, RCA, Control Data, and
   Honeywell exited the business while Burroughs and Sperry Univac merged
   into Unisys (a relatively weak player) and NCR went through a tumultuous
   acquisition and later divestiture by AT\&T. In the minicomputer market,
   the leaders were Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC), Data General, Prime,
   Hewlett-Packard, and Texas Instruments, of which only HP remains as an
   independent force in the industry. The original pioneers in personal
   computers were Apple, Tandy Corp., Atari, Commodore, and Texas
   Instruments with Apple being the only remaining manufacturer (with a
   market share under 5\%).}},

Abstract = {{Phase conjugation is a process whereby waves may be focused in an
   inhomogeneous and poorly characterized medium. Its application in
   underwater acoustics offers innovative solutions to active transmission
   problems, such as underwater digital communications. In this paper, the
   operation of a phase conjugate array is examined under simplified
   conditions, so that closed-form expressions for the pressure field may
   be obtained. These provide both insight into the energy focusing effect,
   and guidelines for designing actual arrays. Numerical results show that,
   from a communications perspective, signal regeneration at the focus
   offers significant intersymbol interference reduction. Equalization
   requirements at the receiver may therefore be substantially relaxed.}},

   This paper classifies digital libraries by looking at the social impact
   of information artifacts, using data on the amount of information
   produced annually in different storage formats, as well as concepts
   derived from the sociology of innovation. At least four types of digital
   libraries can be derived by this method: (1) digitized documents from

Abstract = {{Current large-scale information sources are designed to support general
   queries, and lack the ability to support scenario specific information

   content navigation, incremental appropriate matching, or content
   correlation. We are developing the following innovative technologies to
   remedy these problems: (1) Scenario-based proxies, enabling the
   gathering and filtering of information customized for users. within a
   pre-defined domain; (2) Context- sensitive navigation and matching,
   providing approximate matching and similarity links when an exact match
   to a riser's request is, unavailable; (3) Content correlation of
   documents, creating semantic links between documents and information
   sources; (4) User models for customization of retrieved information and
   result presentation; and (5) Phrase Indexing for Document Retrieval and
   Summarization. A digital medical library is currently being constructed
   rising these technologies to provide customized information for the user
   {[}5]. The technologies are general in nature and can provide custom and
   scenario-specific information in mangy other domains, such as crisis

Abstract = {{In the early 1960's the first ideas were developed by leading companies
   in Germany (Siemens, Wachtel, etc) to design an intrusion detection
   system following a capacitance measurement principle. The first
   detection electronics \& set-ups were designed for indoor use (jewellery
   shops, museums, etc..) but in 1964 the first capacitive detectors for
   outdoor use i,e, perimeter security systems appeared on the market with
   very poor performance results.
   During the 1970's \& 80's and sometimes over very long periods, several
   world wide electronic companies tried to create good working solutions
   using simple and inexpensive hardware for outdoor use. Sometimes
   excellent ideas were integrated in the electronic design but generally
   any investment in a innovative hardware design such as (Insulators,
   wiring, etc...) were poorly supported.
   In 1982 Siemens he was the first company in this market which analysed
   all outdoor influences and who recognised the essential problems which
   cause any classic capacitive or electrostatic detector suffering from
   high unwanted false alarm rates. This was even if the newest
   sophisticated digital electronics and algorithms were used.
   The result was that already in 1984 a complete new peripheral hardware
   design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was
   created and patented by Siemens AG which remains state of the art even
   now and which is making capacitive detectors work under most of all
   environmental conditions.
   Nevertheless even if this high-grade material is installed, it can
   happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences
   are the cause of important electrical effects, These effects change the
   field, periodically generating very high false alarm rates which are
   extremely difficult to detect and to measure. The reason is that the
   false alarm rate is specific to a site and as such is difficult to
   identify. It is a fact that even well trained system engineers have
   difficulty in solving such problems.
   This paper describes a practical case experienced in 1999 where a
   coincidental combination of a sea side conditions and a total desert
   wind strongly interfered in the physics of a capacitive i.e.
   electrostatic field detector and where trivial (but expensive) measures
   needed to be taken to finally solve the problem.}},

Abstract = {{A potentially serious problem with current digital signature schemes is
   that their underlying hard problems from number theory may be solved by
   an innovative technique or a new generation of computing devices such as
   quantum computers. Therefore while these signature schemes represent an
   efficient solution to the short term integrity (unforgeability and
   non-repudiation) of digital data, they provide no confidence on the long
   term (say of 20 years) integrity of data signed by these schemes. In
   this work, we focus on signature schemes whose security does not rely on
   any unproven assumption. More specifically, we establish a model for
   unconditionally secure digital signatures in a group, and demonstrate
   practical schemes in that model. An added advantage of the schemes is
   that they allow unlimited transfer of signatures without compromising
   the security of the schemes. Our scheme represents the first
   unconditionally secure signature that admits provably secure transfer of
   signatures.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of pathology services differs greatly in our
   environment. Although pathology would be especially suitable for being
   practised at a distance by transporting digital image information, the
   spread of telepathology into everyday work still is relatively slow.
   The article describes the situation of diffusion of this innovative
   technology by reviewing the literature and discussing this in context to
   data based on questionnaires dealing with the acceptance of
   telepathology. The current situation of telepathology can be discussed
   by five items for innovation spead: (1) communication and influence; (2)
   economic costs and benefits; (3) knowledge barriers and learning; (4)
   feasibility of techniques offered for the demands of the users; (5)
   clarification of the legal status and other factors concerning
   international collaboration. All these head lines do not represent
   realistic obstacles for the more widespread use of telepathology. The
   real drawbacks may therefore be found behind certain professional habits
   of pathologists. The most important causes may be that (a) telediagnosis
   is not as easy as it may seem at the first glance; (b) telepathology is
   seen as a potential highway to a world-wide competition of pathology
   service providers. As soon as these mostly unjustified prejudices are
   corrected and telepathology is percepted as additional technique in
   pathology, it will become a diagnostic tool as common and as useful as
   the telephone.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing competitiveness in the manufacturing industry forces
   companies to reduce development costs and time, and to increase product
   innovation, quality and flexibility, to react quickly to new customers
   requirements. In this context, one of the main objectives is to replace
   a great part of physical mock-ups with digital models - the so called
   Digital Mock-ups -, Due to the fact that a considerable part of
   resources are invested in the early phases of the product development
   process to verify and planned assembly and maintenance processes, a
   research project has been establish in order to investigate the
   potential use of Virtual Reality (VR) techniques within this processes.
   The use of VR for this propose is normally called Virtual Prototyping
   (VP).
   This paper presents two different aspects that need to be considered
   and/or fulfilled, in order to achieve a significant added value and
   degree of integration: first, the requirements of the business process,
   in this case mainly assembly and disassembly processes and second,
   requirements of the system integration of design and virtual reality.
   In this case, the goal of the system integration of design and VR is not
   to develop a new CAD system having a broader range of VR functionalities
   to support, for example, the verification of assembly and disassembly
   processes, but the goal is the integration of VR techniques with an
   existing CA infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{At AP-HP (regional university hospital group for Paris area, 50
   hospitals), the CEDIT is in charge of technology assessment and
   diffusion of medical innovations. Digital radiography was considered for
   the replacement of obsolete conventional radiography systems as well as
   in the set-up of a new filmless hospital. The first step of our work was
   to synthesize existing data on the technical, medical, economic,
   organizational and ethical issues of the technologies. In the meantime,
   experts advice was sought. At the time of the expertise, most of the
   literature concerned prototypes of small fields flat panels. The only
   one with full field detector concluded that image quality was equivalent
   at equal dose. No study compared screen-film to soft copy display of
   digital flat panel images. Economic analysis showed that investment
   additional costs exceeded the expected gains. Literature evidence being
   not sufficient to make a recommendation on the diffusion, further
   evaluations were designed.
   Diffusion of flat panel detectors will depend on the results of clinical
   evaluations, investment costs and feasibility of existing equipment
   upgrade, diffusion of image networks. By taking into account other
   aspects than the technical efficacy, technology assessment provides an
   aid to decision-making on the appropriateness and optimal conditions of
   diffusion.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence in Chesapeake Bay suggests that the majority of the
   tidal marsh acreage has been negatively affected by sea-level rise in
   recent years. The ultimate impact, total marsh loss, centers on
   Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) which has encountered
   particularly high rates of land subsidence in the twentieth century.
   Analysis using digitized photography has revealed that marshes are being
   lost more rapidly in the northern than southern sections of Blackwater.
   The former is closest to the center of a large cone of depression in the
   most important underlying aquifer in the region. The groundwater
   withdrawals at Cambridge correspond to a rapid rise in sea level which
   appears to be two to three times the present global rate of 1 to 2 mm
   y(-1). The declining health of the marshes, reflected in reduced
   productivity, canopy thinning, channel enlargement, rotten spots and
   salt pans as well as ultimate conversion to mudflat and open water, can
   be tracked using satellite imagery. Although not as dramatic as marsh
   conversion to open water at Blackwater NWR (over 50\% during the 20th
   century), other marshes on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland show
   clear signs of incipient change. Past attempts at restoring Blackwater
   marshes have not been successful due in part to the combination of
   excessive grazing by muskrats and nutria as well as anthropogenic
   influences (reduced diel tidal amplitude because of road building,
   increasing salinity because of canals, and possibly large-scale
   burning). Ultimately, restoration efforts depend on the maintenance of
   groundwater pressure and/or on supplementation of the system with
   sediment from other sources to keep them abreast of rising sea level.
   Restoration efforts will depend not only on controlling groundwater
   withdrawals, but possibly in revitalizing existing marshes by promoting
   rhizosphere oxygenation. Where these strategies are not practical, more
   innovative approaches may be be necessary such as the use of highly
   productive species (e.g., Phragmites australis) that appear to be more
   efficient in promoting sedimentation and long term accretion than other
   marsh species.}},

Abstract = {{The launching of Multimedia Supercorridor (MSC) in Malaysia represents a
   bold effort to achieve the goals of Vision 2020 and to attain a
   leadership in the Information Age. As an R \& D institution, FRIM
   realises the compelling importance of IT, not only for research
   activities, but more so for creating innovative IT applications for
   forest based industries. In this regard, FRIM has formulated its own IT
   Policy to spearhead the implementation of IT programmes and plans for
   the benefit of staff as well as clients. FRIM's IT Polity addresses
   three inter-related objectives including optimisation of the use of IT
   in R \& D activities, to provide an an-line or digital access to
   information and services, and to support indigenous content development
   of IT. These objectives augur well with the current emphasis of the
   Government to implement electronic government in the country.: Towards
   achieving these objectives, important milestones and targets have been
   set so that necessary follow-up actions could be streamlined and
   monitored accordingly. In realising these targets, several IT
   applications have been identified and are being undertaken. One of such
   applications is to provide online or digital access to information on
   forestry and timber products to clients. Examples of such applications
   will be discussed here.}},

Abstract = {{Performance test of the generator and excitation system is becoming
   increasingly important to provide reliable and continuous power to the
   user. Increased awareness for an optimally tuned excitation system has
   become very important as consumer power demand continues to escalate
   with limited generation. Additionally, limited manpower in generation
   plants emphasizes the need for excitation systems to be user-friendly
   and accessible to the commissioning engineer for easy and expedient
   setup.
   In many power plants, poor performance, typical of older excitation
   systems, can lead to sluggish terminal voltage recovery that can affect
   motor starting, and breaker coordination {[}1]. Historically, tuning the
   analog excitation system would involve the lengthy process of trial and
   error and possibly adding external stability networks to obtain desired
   system performance. Digital excitation systems today offer innovative
   methods to quickly calibrate the excitation system, and provide analysis
   to make commissioning fast and performance predictable {[}2].
   This paper will address the features in new excitation control that will
   speed commissioning and offer a greater variety of tuning tools to
   ensure a desired performance to a specific plant.}},

   interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) designed at Sandia
   National Laboratories. This paper will outline the design of the system
   and its performance, and show some recent flight test results.
   The RTV IFSAR will meet DTED level III and IV specifications by using a
   multiple-baseline design and high-accuracy differential and
   carrier-phase GPS navigation. It includes innovative near-real-time DEM
   production on-board the aircraft. The system is being flown on a
   deHavilland DHC-7 Army aircraft.}},

   in the switching history are delineated: electromechanical, digital and

   more standardized interfaces and components, making the technologically
   separable interface increasingly small. The period of the future -
   Internet Protocol - will further accentuate this condition. A case study
   of AT\&T's governance structure suggests a trend towards disintegration,
   related to the trend of increasing technologically separable interfaces

Abstract = {{Joint Mine Detection Technology (JMDT) is a Navy/Marine Corps 6.2
   Exploratory Development program that is closely coordinated with the 6.4
   Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) acquisition
   program. The objective of the program is to develop innovative science
   and technology to enhance future mine detection capabilities. Prior to
   transition to acquisition, the COBRA Advanced Technology Demonstration
   (ATD) was extremely successful in demonstrating a passive airborne
   multispectral video sensor system operating in the tactical Pioneer
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), combined with an integrated ground
   station subsystem to detect and locate minefields from surf zone to
   inland areas. JMDT is investigating advanced technology solutions for
   future enhancements in minefield detection capability beyond the current
   COBRA. ATD demonstrated capabilities. JMDT has recently been delivered
   next-generation, innovative hardware which was specified by the Coastal
   Systems Station and developed under contract. This hardware includes an
   agile-tuning multispectral, polarimetric, digital video camera and
   advanced multiwavelength laser illumination technologies to extend the
   same sorts of multispectral detections from an UAV into the night and
   over shallow water and other difficult littoral regions. One of these
   illumination devices is an ultra-compact, highly-efficient (currently a
   single wavelength) near-IR laser diode array. The other is a
   multi-wavelength range-gateable laser. Additionally, in conjunction with
   this new technology, algorithm enhancements are being developed in JMDT
   for future naval capabilities which will outperform the already
   impressive record of automatic detection of minefields demonstrated by
   the COBRA ATD.}},

Abstract = {{The paper outlines results of feasibility experiments with new functions
   for a local version of the digital city, performed under a collective
   name `Engineering City Oulu' (ECO). We investigated design and
   implementation options supporting engineering services in the digital
   city. The options were oriented towards local needs and potentials of
   the Oulu economic area. Many technologies can be used to support user
   interaction in digital city systems, such as 3-d imaging, on-line
   sensory data, culture-sensitive instruction, etc. We focused on
   supporting engineering - a fundamental activity of real city users. In
   the experiments we emphasised conditions for active participation of
   users ('digital citizens') in the community decision making. A broad
   classification of engineering support in digital cities is introduced
   followed by motivation of the feasibility studies. Then the requirements
   for an innovative digital city are discussed. The main feasibility
   results are then presented including a selection of basic engineering
   models and an outline of the experiments new software, applicable in
   digital cities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that the digital library is not inevitable. Indeed it
   is certain that libraries will be a mix of digital and paper for many
   years to come - and probably indefinitely. The degree to which the
   balance will shift from paper to digital depends on a number of factors:
   principally - infrastructure costs, legal constraints, publisher
   pricing, end user WWW publishing, end user attitudes, scale of knowledge
   generation, library budgets and technical innovation.
   These factors are analysed and evaluated. The conclusion is that
   contrary to popular myth the transition to the digital future is slower
   than was predicted and is by no means inevitable. Thus librarians will
   be faced with managing multiple resources, both electronic and paper
   held both locally and remotely. End user expectations will change and
   become more demanding especially for speed and simplicity of access.
   Managing this mix will test librarians in new and challenging ways.}},

Abstract = {{The use of fluorescent detection methods in association with digital
   microscopy technologies is an innovative approach for tissue
   localisation of messenger RNA. The success of such methods relies on the
   tissue preservation, local availability of the probe and on the
   existence of high resolution tridimensional analysis systems. Cryostatic
   sections, mild denaturation, short oligonucleotide probes (20mer) and
   confocal laser scanning microscopy allow the fullfillment of all these
   conditions avoiding photobleaching and tissue autofluorescence. In this
   paper, we describe in detail a method for in situ hybridisation set up
   with digoxigenin-coupled oligonucleotide complementary to p-actin mRNA
   as a probe and an anti-hapten fluorescent antibody as second step for
   detecting specific hybridisation. Fluorescence was analysed by means of
   a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) that provides images with
   low out-of-focus blurring also with relatively low numerical aperture
   (NA) objectives. We propose also an easy method to perform
   semi-quantitative thresholding analysis which allows to discriminate
   between background and specific signal.}},

Abstract = {{The Automated Rendezvous and Capture (AR\&C) system was designed and
   tested at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to demonstrate
   technologies and mission strategies for automated rendezvous and docking
   of spacecraft in Earth orbit. The system incorporates some of the latest
   innovations in Global Positioning System (GPS) space navigation, laser
   sensor technologies and automated mission sequencing algorithms. The
   system's initial design and integration was completed in 1998 and
   underwent testing in 1999. This paper describes the major components of
   the AR\&C system and presents results from the official system tests
   performed in MSFC's Flight Robotics Laboratory with digital simulations
   and hardware in the loop tests. The results show that the AR\&C system
   can safely and reliably perform automated rendezvous and docking
   missions in the absence of system failures. When system failures were
   included, the system used its automated collision avoidance logic to
   recover in a safe manner. The primary objective of the AR\&C project is
   to prove that by designing a safe and robust automated system, mission
   operations cost can be reduced by decreasing the personnel required for
   mission design, preflight planning and training required for crewed
   rendezvous and docking missions.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated, high-speed photographic system combining a
   high-repetition rate, pulsed ruby laser and a high-framing rate CCD
   camera has been demonstrated. Individually, the laser and camera have
   been discussed previously and each was developed under the Small
   Business Innovative Research (SBIR) sponsorship through the Air Force
   Research Lab (AFRL). This paper presents for the first time digital
   images of dynamic ballistic events captured at 500 kHz using the two
   elements integrated as a high-speed digital imaging system.
   The laser is capable of generating a train of 65 pulses at 500 kHz
   operation with micropulse energy of (350 mJ each ((25 J for the
   macropulse). The test range clock controls the master timing with the
   laser slaved to the fire sequence and the camera slaved to the laser.
   Due to the high precision with which the laser pulses can be located in
   time and due to recent advances in the camera triggering circuit, the
   laser and camera were fully synchronized at 500 kHz, for the first time.
   This paper details the event synchronization and presents the dynamic
   ballistic impact images. The tests described herein took place in the
   Bay-10 Dynamic Event Imaging Facility at Eglin AFB, FL.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency and properties of nonlinear digital filters are difficult
   to quantify with formal methods. Therefore, determing the effects of a
   nonlinear digital filter on overall system performance often requires
   simulations or prototyping. This paper presents a fast way to design a
   configurable order statistic filter with field programmable gate arrays
   (FPGAs) in a unified computer-aided design environment. Based on an
   innovative architecture, a window size nine, eight-bit filter fits in a

Abstract = {{This paper describes in detail the design of an innovative fuzzy-based
   adaptive digital Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) controller
   for a three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) in-parallel actuated manipulator.
   Conventionally, tuning the gains of the PID controller requires
   experiences and know-how, and has to be performed experimentally. The
   proposed innovative fuzzy-based PID automatic adjustment scheme is an
   adaptive approach that is capable of self-tuning the controller to
   satisfy with a control locus on an operating condition and disturbance
   without the mentioned overheads.
   A prototype controller, using a MOTOROLA MC68HC16 microcontroller, was
   built and tested on a 3-DOF in-parallel actuated manipulator. The
   laboratory setup of the manipulator with the developed fuzzy-based
   controller, which serves as the motion platform of a flight simulator,
   is also demonstrated in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{As 2(nd) and 3(rd) generation Focal Plane Arrays (FPA) become more
   complex, the readout integrated circuit (ROIC) has emerged as a major
   discriminator in system performance. The focus of development and
   advancement has traditionally involved the detector technology. Early
   ROICs were simple multiplexers that performed little if any signal
   processing on the detector diode signal. Advances in silicon fabrication
   processes for analog integrated circuits have opened a new era in IRFPAs
   where signal digital functions can be achieved on the focal plane.
   We present an overview of significant advances in the area of mixed mode
   ROIC designs that enable greater functionality and performance of the
   sensor chip assembly. Innovations, continuing progress in CMOS
   technology, and greater foundry access have allowed enhancements in
   practically every aspect of the ROIC, from sophisticated unit cells to
   lower noise and lower power signal paths to highly programmable digital
   support circuitry. Denser detector input circuits with active amplifiers
   (FEDI or CTIA) have been implemented in unit cells as small as 27 mum x
   27 mum. In addition, multiple gain, temporal filtering, or spatial
   filtering capabilities have been incorporated into these small unit
   cells. Significant reductions in focal plane power have been fabricated
   and demonstrated enabling a factor of 2 increase in frame rates for very
   large staring FPAs and a factor of 4 increase in line rates for scanning
   FPAs. Other developments include, but are not limited to, alternative
   schemes for time-delayed integration (TDI) and breakthroughs for
   uncooled applications. As the chip designs increase in capability,
   greater systems on a chip are feasible, especially with more
   programmable features provided by the on-chip digital circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{There are serious limitations of existing - mostly meteorological -
   satellite sensors used so far to provide data for spaceborne based fire
   product generation especially in case if accurate geophysical parameters
   have to be obtained. The limitations are given by e.g. partly channel
   saturation not allowing high temperature event discrimination, and
   spatial resolution worse than 1 km.
   Solid state detector arrays and adaptive high dynamic front end
   electronic with digital signal processing are the key elements of
   imaging IR sensors for spaceborne fire detection and fire parameter
   analysis. A quantitative and geophysical variable related determination
   of such fire parameters as fire temperature and burning area can be
   retrieved by a bi-spectral method, using a Mid IR channel at 3 - 5 mum
   (MIR) and a Thermal LR channel at 8 - 10 pm (TIR).
   The German Aerospace Center (DLR) and its industrial partners are
   working on two new spaceborne fire missions: 1) the Bi-spectral IR
   Detection small satellite mission (BIRD) to be launched in autumn 2000,
   and 2) the Innovative Infrared Sensor System FOCUS to be flown as an
   early external payload of the International Space Station (ISS).
   Both BIRD and FOCUS will use MIR/TIR solid state pushbroom imagers with
   real time digital signal processing providing an adaptive and very high
   dynamic range in radiometry.
   Promising results are obtained with the BIRD Airborne Simulator (BAS)
   which has been flown at DLR in several airborne campaigns since 1997.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the inkjet technology has made great strides in the
   print quality. By introducing fine droplets, deep and light color inks,
   optimized media, and advanced color and image processing, the latest
   inkjet; printers can produce photo-quality prints. Of these many
   improvements, the most contributive one is that the, innovative
   piezoelectric print head has reduced the ink droplet size by a factor of
   ten in the latest five years. This innovation has been accomplished by
   optimizing head dimensions and driving signals as well as improving the
   manufacturing and assembling process. The piezoelectric actuator driven
   by the. signal, optimized for the particular print head model, can
   precisely control the unrestrained ink meniscus vibration at the nozzle
   openings to achieve multi-sized droplets ejection in a sequent manner as
   well as stabilized droplet ejection up to the extremely high ejection
   repetition frequency. This Variable-Sized Droplet: Technology (VSDT) has
   made it possible to introduce the digital photo-printers to the market
   without trading off the throughput. This paper shows how the
   piezoelectric inkjet technology has been improved and how much
   flexibility it has for particular use in home, office and industry.}},

Abstract = {{The dominant digital printing technologies today and for the near future
   are based either on toner - delivered: by electrophotography,
   magnetography or electron I beam imaging - or ink jet processes using
   liquid or solid inks. All of these technologies have various
   shortcomings, both technical and cost limitations, leaving room for
   potential new technologies.
   But can any new technology emerge and be successfully exploited now, or
   will we just see. incremental development of existing technologies? The
   industry is littered with novel, innovative yet unexploited techniques
   that never quite made it. Has the shake-out of mainstream technologies
   already occurred or is there scope for new ones? Success requires that a
   new technology be both technically feasible and financially viable and
   any new technology would need significant advantages over existing ones.
   Can existing companies with well entrenched and successful technologies
   adopt new ones, or is it only newcomers and upstarts who can succeed?
   This paper reviews the shortcomings of existing technologies, considers
   whether any new printing or marking applications exist, reviews some of
   the emerging yet still to be exploited technologies - such as ToneJet,
   TonerJet, AIP, Elcorsy, Direct Imaging, microfluidics and reusable
   paper, and assesses what the scope might be for these and other
   currently invisible contenders.}},

Abstract = {{Since ink jet printing on textile is currently limited in sampling and
   small lot production with far slower speed (2m(2)/min) than conventional
   textile printing (50 m(2)/min) in average, screen, printing will be
   applied for ``large lot{''} production in the industry before the
   complete domination by the digital process. The colors presented with
   dots by digital ink-jet machines should be made equivalent to those with
   blocks by conventional textile printers. The color matching between the
   sampling and the industrial production can be achieved by mixing colors
   for ink elements to make the color difference (DeltaE) < 1. The
   technology of mixing colors in this article involved the ink formulation
   which imparted the stability and compatibility of colorants, and the
   color management on customer demand. With the arising appeal for the
   cleaner production process, advanced pretreatment with no wash-off step
   on fabrics were investigated with the application of hydrophilic
   copolymers to present better ink-textile interactive performance
   (sharpness, color yield, etc.) and good durability. With the benefit of
   modified color system and effective fabric treatment will promise the
   quick response manufacturing linked to near-future innovation, e.g.,
   body-scanning, CAD tailoring, and internet ordering workshop.}},

   filter transforms the digitized kinetic signal into a sequence of
   innovations which is examined for possible change-points by a

Abstract = {{Few information systems today offer a clear and flexible means to define
   and manage the automated part of radiology processes. None of them
   provide a coherent and scalable architecture that can easily cope with
   heterogeneity and inevitable local adaptation of applications. Most
   importantly, they often lack a model that can integrate clinical and
   administrative information to aid better decisions in managing
   resources, optimizing operations, and improving productivity. Digital
   radiology enterprises require cost-effective solutions to deliver
   information to the right person in the right place and at the right
   time.
   We propose a new architecture of image information management systems
   for digital radiology enterprises. Such a system is based on the
   emerging technologies in workflow management, distributed object
   computing, and Java acid Web techniques, as well as Philips' domain
   knowledge in radiology operations. Our design adapts the approach of
   ``4+1{''} architectural view.
   In this new architecture, PACS and RIS will become one while the user
   interaction can be automated by customized workflow process. Clinical
   service applications are implemented as active components. They can be
   reasonably substituted by applications of local adaptations and can be
   multiplied for fault tolerance and load balancing. Furthermore, it will
   provide powerful query and statistical functions for managing resources
   and improving productivity in real time. This work will lead to a new
   direction of image information management in the next millennium. We
   will illustrate the innovative design with implemented examples of a
   working prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of computer chip technology has been marked by a steady
   progression toward higher performance which will soon be Limited by the
   time delay associated with interconnects. This has led to consideration
   of alternate interconnect methods to complement or replace conventional
   metal/dielectric architectures for both intra-chip and chip to chip
   communications. Among the proposed alternatives is an optical approach
   using new, massively parallel arrays of emitters and detectors. The
   interconnect medium for this approach, however, is still under
   conceptual design and has spawned many candidates. Various
   configurations of static micro-optic arrays have been developed however,
   recent consideration has been given to active, reconfigurable optics
   based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies. These
   Optical-MEMS or MOEMS have enabled innovative devices which can control
   phase, amplitude and direction of input light beams. One area which has
   recently received much attention is the creation and use of both
   reflective and diffractive arrays.
   This paper will present the development and use of active,
   reconfigurable MOEMS prototypes applied to proof of principle optical
   interconnect systems. We have been studying several array architectures
   consisting of gratings, columnar reflectors and micromirrors. For
   example, the patented MEMS-based Compound Grating (MCG)(1) is currently
   being developed to enable a new class of diffractive arrays which can be
   used as a massively parallel switch. The MCG is a device which is a
   superposition of two or more diffraction gratings whose surface topology
   can be controlled. Various prototype arrays of these MCG devices have
   been designed, modeled, fabricated and tested. Initial results of these
   studies will be presented. In addition, application of the Digital
   Micromirror Device (DMD(TM), Texas Instruments, Inc.) to this problem
   will also be discussed Using a custom control software and optical
   setup, preliminary results from the integration of a DMD into an optical
   interconnect test stand will be presented.}},

Abstract = {{The primary focus of the Digital Cultural Heritage Community Project is
   the digitization of materials from local area museums, archives and
   libraries for elementary grades' social science curricula. Using
   teachers' curriculum units and the Illinois Learning Standards for
   direction, primary source materials are identified by curators and
   librarians for inclusion in a digital repository. The repository
   metadata must be complex enough to easily integrate the different forms
   of metadata currently used by each institution, while, at the same time,
   being simple enough for facilitation by the elementary school users.
   Simultaneously, a collaborative agreement was developed to include a set
   of terms and conditions for digital access to collections, the right to
   distribute materials and permissions to host materials. We have thus far
   learned that each school district's interpretation of the state learning
   standards necessitated additional review of local standards to insure
   that the project addressed goals and objectives that were pertinent on a
   local as well as a state level. Curators and librarians have had to be
   innovative when choosing items to digitize, and teachers must be able to
   make use of materials in imaginative ways, as it was often apparent that
   there might, not always be a good fit between curriculum needs and the
   local area museum and library collections. Finally, we are developing a
   set of guidelines and standards to enable the creation of a consistent
   database, easily mapping between different controlled vocabularies and
   organizational data.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1996, Canada's Digital Collections (CDC), a federal government
   program, has been helping organizations across Canada build a stock of
   high-quality Canadian content on the Internet. The central focus of the
   program has been to provide on-the-job experience in information
   technology for young Canadians. Using an innovative approach to youth
   skills development and employment in the information technology sector,
   CDC provides funds to museums, libraries, archives, firms, schools and
   other organizations to hire teams of youth to digitize significant
   Canadian holdings and create dynamic multimedia web sites. One of the
   most important sources of Canadian content on the Internet, Canada's
   Digital Collections currently houses over 350 web sites. Subjects range
   from treasures of Canadian institutions, such as the National Library,
   the National Archives and the Museum of Civilization to the local
   histories and way of life of Canadian communities. Visitors to the CDC
   web site use materials from the collections at a rate of one and a half

   This paper will present an overview of Canada's Digital Collections as a
   model for digitization of museum holdings and materials. Three key
   aspects will be highlighted in particular: the use of alternative fiscal
   resources (youth employment-allocated funds) as a means funding of
   digitization projects; the development of an accountable and economical
   program design to facilitate digitization; and the fostering of
   partnerships among governments, cultural institutions and
   entrepreneurial youth as a means of leveraging value-added results in
   digitization. Examples are also provided to demonstrate successful new
   programs created from the CDC model.}},

Abstract = {{Vibrations from construction activities can affect infrastructure
   projects in several ways. Within the general vicinity of a construction
   site, vibrations can result in damage to existing structures,
   disturbance to people, damage to sensitive machinery, and degraded
   performance of precision instrumentation or motion sensitive equipment.
   Current practice for monitoring vibrations in the vicinity of
   construction sites commonly consists of measuring free field or
   structural motions using velocity transducers connected to a portable
   data acquisition unit via cables. This paper describes an innovative way
   to collect, process, transmit, and analyze vibration measurements
   obtained at construction sites. The system described measures vibration
   at the sensor location, performs necessary signal conditioning and
   digitization, and sends data to a Web server using wireless data
   transmission and Internet protocols. A Servlet program running on the
   Web server accepts the transmitted data and incorporates it into a
   project database. Two-way interaction between the Web client and the Web
   server is accomplished through the use of a Servlet program and a Java
   Applet running inside a browser located on the Web client's computer.
   Advantages of this system over conventional vibration data logging
   systems include continuous unattended monitoring, reduced costs
   associated with field data collection, instant access to data files and
   graphs by project team members, and the ability to remotely modify data
   sampling schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in several genome-sequencing projects have
   stimulated an enormous interest in microarray DNA chip technology,
   especially in biomedical sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The DNA
   chips facilitated the miniaturization of conventional nucleic acid
   hybridizations, by either robotically spotting thousands of library
   cDNAs or in situ synthesis of high-density oligonucleotides onto solid
   supports. These innovations have found a wide range of applications in
   molecular biology, especially in studying gene expression and
   discovering new genes from the global view of genomic analysis. The
   research and development of this powerful tool has also received great
   attentions in Taiwan. In this paper, we report the current progresses of
   our DNA chip project, along with the current status of other biochip
   projects in Taiwan, such as protein chip, PCR chip, electrophoresis
   chip, olfactory chip, etc. The new development of biochip technologies
   integrates the biotechnology with the semiconductor processing, the
   micro-electro-mechanical, optoelectronic, and digital signal processing
   technologies. Most of these biochip technologies utilize optical
   detection methods for data acquisition and analysis. The strengths and
   advantages of different approaches are compared and discussed in this
   report.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the implementation of a fuzzy logic controller on an
   automated machine for mechanical processing of salmon. The prototype
   machine, as developed in The Industrial Automation Laboratory, is an
   innovative and automated version of a fish cutting machine, It is able
   to considerably reduce wastage of fish meat during processing, by
   automatically adjusting the position of the blade of the cutter with
   respect to the fish that is being processed. The machine consists of an
   intermittent-motion conveyor system to move the fish forward, a
   pneumatically activated guillotine-type blade that operates in the
   vertical direction, an X-Y horizontal table which carries the cutting
   blade assembly and is driven by two hydraulic actuators, and a digital
   CCD camera that takes the image of a fish for geometric sensing before
   it is cut. A Proportional-plus-derivative (PD) type fuzzy logic
   controller is developed and implemented successfully for driving the
   cutter assembly. The performance of the fuzzy logic controller is
   investigated, with respect to the control specifications for the
   machine. The real time controller operates in sampling periods of 1ms;
   consequently, the membership functions are designed so that only four
   rules are fired at each sampling period, thereby enabling real time
   processing. Processing stability of the controller may be adjusted by 9
   central rules. Criteria for choosing the membership functions of inputs
   and output are discussed.}},

   used to match the before and after image subsets with the help of
   genetic algorithms to search for the optimal match. Some potential

Abstract = {{ASTRON aims to investigate the synergies between the three space
   technologies with the aim to introduce innovative and sustainable
   services and applications based on the convergence of digital
   information from satellites. This project was conceived and initiated
   based on the observation that a number of applications and user groups
   could benefit from the combined use of satellite technologies. As part
   of the European Commission's (EC) Fifth Framework RTD Programme, the
   ASTRON project formally started in 1999. ASTRON is supported under the
   `Underpinning European Competitiveness' line of the work programme of
   the Joint Research Centre of the EC and aims therefore to underpin
   European competitiveness through the support of space industry by
   identifying new users and innovative applications. For the entire period
   1999-2002, the activities of ASTRON are supporting and coordinated with
   the other relevant activities of the EC, such as User-friendly
   Information Society - Systems and Services for the Citizen, and
   Promoting Competitive and Sustainable Growth - Sustainable Mobility and
   Intermodality. A development model was perceived based on four
   activities, namely communication, monitoring and analysis, development
   and demonstration, and user up-take. There are currently (first semester
   2000) four ongoing market studies in key areas whereas demonstration
   projects will be initiated.}},

   realization of realistic product development. In this paper, we analyze
   its connotation and its characteristics. By allowing all product
   development activities being done before a hard prototype is made,
   Internet/Intranet based VPD accommodates the diversity of customer
   expectation and the rapid product introduction requirements, and
   facilitates Concurrent Engineering and Green Manufacturing. After that,
   a framework of Internet/Intranet based VPD is described and the key
   techniques of Internet/Intranet based VPD are discussed at the last part
   of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient machining of non-circular body of revolution required a
   set of feed drive which actuates the tool-frame to make reciprocating
   motion. An innovative feed drive actuated by the stepper motor is
   introduced for the purpose. To eliminate quantitative error, the stepper
   motor is controlled under the continual mode. It is achieved with a
   micro-controller system and a built-in control algorithm program, called
   ``tracking algorithm{''}. Within each sampling cycle, the
   microcontroller will sample the input signal and the time interval will
   be divided into two parts according to the relative position between two
   adjacent stepping points. The phase coils correspondent to the two
   adjacent stepping points are energized respectively with calculated time
   duration. In the way, the motion of the tool frame smoothly tracks the
   input signal.
   This paper presents theoretical analysis and experimental study of
   dynamic characteristics of the proposed drive. Experimental results
   display that the bandwidth of the feed drive system exceeds 200Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Global competition, short innovation cycles and constant pressure due to
   mergers and acquisitions force high-tech companies to preserve and

   represents the critical factor for competitiveness. Therefore, the
   advances in information technology will have a big impact on the
   evolution of the designer's and engineer's ``future{''} workspace.
   In this paper, we introduce the concept of knowledge applets, small
   web-based programs that bring information to the engineer's workspace by
   integrating and accessing heterogeneous data sources like corporate
   memories, collections of tacit knowledge like lessons learned and best
   practices, document archives, relational databases, digital libraries
   and so forth.
   The overall goal is to reuse experience and lessons learned and deliver

Abstract = {{A significant part of the burgeoning commercial space industry is
   placing an unprecedented number of satellites into low earth orbit for a
   variety of new applications and services. By some estimates the
   commercial, space industry now exceeds that of government space
   activities. Yet the two markets remain largely separate, with each
   deploying dedicated satellites and infrastructure for their respective
   missions. One commercial space firm, Final Analysis, has created a new
   program wherein either government, scientific or new technology payloads
   can be integrated on a commercial spacecraft on commercial satellites
   for a variety of mission scenarios at a fraction of the cost of a
   dedicated mission. NASA has recognized the advantage of this approach,
   and has awarded the Quick Ride program to provide frequent, low cost
   flight opportunities for small independent payloads aboard the Final
   Analysis constellation, and investigators are rapidly developing science
   programs that conform to the proposed payload accommodations envelope.
   Missions that were not feasible using dedicated launches are now
   receiving approval under the lower cost Quick Ride approach. Final
   Analysis has dedicated ten out of its thirty-eight satellites in support
   of the Quick Ride efforts.
   The benefits of this type of space access extend beyond NASA science
   programs. Commercial space firms can now gain valuable flight heritage
   for new technology and satellite product offerings. Further, emerging
   international space programs can now place a payload in orbit enabling
   the country to allocate its resources against the payload and mission
   requirements rather than increased launch costs of a dedicated
   spacecraft. Finally, the low cost nature provides University-based
   research educational opportunities previously out of the reach of most
   space-related budgets.
   This paper will describe the motivation, benefits, technical features,
   and program costs of the Final Analysis secondary payload program.
   Payloads can be accommodated on up to thirty-eight separate satellites.
   Since the secondary payloads will fly on satellites designed for global
   wireless data services, each user can utilize a low-cost communication
   system already in place for sending and retrieving digital information
   from its payload.}},

   maintaining geodata and describe the basic concept of MW (Marche World)
   and one of its groupware applications. Its ideas of spatial information
   headers and a floating coordinate system conform to the access control
   architecture for charging for spatial contents and enable the innovative
   utilization of geodata. Charging contents could not only reduce the
   initial installation cost, but could also continuously charge various
   users an appropriate price. We developed a prototype system for a police
   traffic department. Its multi-resolution data of drawings, photos and
   maps is shared and kept alive among a variety of organizations by the

   ingredient S-metolachlor, the more active S-isomers of metolachlor.
   GARDO GOLD at 4.0 l/ha use rate controls in maize all important annual
   millets (Echinochloa crus-galli L., Digitaria spp., Setaria spp.),
   annual meadow-grass (Poa annua L.), silky bent grass (Apera spica-venti
   L.) and a broad spectrum of annual broad-leaved weeds, excluding
   triazine-resistant biotypes. Due to its excellent crop tolerance GARDO
   GOLD can also be used in sweet maize and inbred lines for seed
   production. GARDO GOLD can be applied pre-emergent as well as early
   post-emergent to weeds and crop. For efficient millet control, the
   application should not occur beyond the 2-leaf-stage of the millets.
   GARDO GOLD is useful as a residual component for combination with
   foliar-active herbicides in tank mixtures and sequential applications.
   Its reliable duration of soil activity to maintain control of late
   germinating weed flushes - as shown in greenhouse replanting trials -
   demonstrates its value in complementing the use of non-residual foliar
   herbicides in both conventional and new herbicide-resistant maize

Abstract = {{Rapid and substantial advances in imaging methods and technology have
   not always been expediently or adequately communicated to the practicing
   orthodontist. In this review we highlight contemporary imaging
   techniques and innovations in imaging that, in the future, are likely to
   greatly improve the depiction of craniofacial structures for use in
   diagnosis and treatment planning. In order to provide an appropriate
   background for this topic, we first discuss the evolution of
   craniofacial imaging in orthodontics and review the limitations of
   current methods, including the two-dimensional representation of
   three-dimensional anatomy, depiction as a patchwork of site-specific
   images, associated geometric errors, and images that have a limited
   point of view and are static in space and time. Three-dimensional
   computed tomography can be considered a partial solution to these
   limitations, but imaging costs, radiation exposure, and lack of soft
   tissue representation may make it unacceptable for routine orthodontics,
   A more complete solution might be achieved through digital processing of
   contemporary imaging technologies that would extend their capabilities,
   overcome many of their limitations, and result in an increase in the
   amount of relevant information obtained. Digital processes are currently
   being developed that create accurate multidimensional models that
   integrate form and function. These models will be interactive, linked to
   knowledge databases, and will provide the clinician with answers to
   pertinent questions. These advances in imaging are likely to enhance the
   accuracy and reliability of orthodontic diagnosis and treatment
   planning, and will be of importance in both clinical practice and
   research.}},

   Internet kiosks, community centres, wireless delivery and non-PC
   devices, but much innovation and investment is still called for here.
   From the ability to improve software and education to boosting

   the instruments (voltage, current sensors, volt and current meters)
   employed are addressed. A 25kVA, 7200/240V single-phase transformer has
   been loaded with either three diode-bridge rectifiers and/or a
   thyristor-bridge rectifier at varying total harmonic voltage and current
   distortions, such that at the maximum permissible apparent power, losses
   are identical to the rated losses. The maximum errors of losses are
   acceptably low if voltage (dividers) and current (shunts) sensors with
   2\% and digital instruments with 0.1\% errors are used. The derating
   under nonlinear loads is measured as a function of dominant 3rd and 5th
   current harmonics. The influence of voltage distortion is studied. The
   total harmonic distortion of the current (THDi) was varied greatly from
   0 to 90\%, and the resulting voltage THDv values were below 6\% for the
   given power system impedance. At large THDi values (e.g. 90\%), the
   reduction in apparent power rating (RAPR) is not very large (congruent
   to 10\%). However, the real power capability (RPC) of the transformer is
   severely restricted: for example, at THDi = 90\% the RPC is about 0.5pu.
   For this reason it might be advisable to define derating in terms of the
   reduction in real power capability and not in terms of RAPR.}},

Abstract = {{An instrument has been developed that measures finescale velocity and
   vorticity in seawater based on the principles of motional induction.
   This instrument, the electromagnetic vorticity meter (EMVM), measures
   components of the gradient and Laplacian of the electrostatic potential
   held induced by the motion of seawater through an applied magnetic
   field. The principal innovation described here is the development of a
   sensor for measuring small-scale vorticity, The sensor head consists of
   a strong NdFeB magnet, a Ave-electrode an ay, low-noise preamplifiers,
   and 20-Hz digitizers. The main electronics includes attitude sensors,
   batteries, a microprocessor, and a hard disk. The vorticity sensors are
   usually carried on a heavy towed vehicle capable of vertically profiling
   to 200 m and at tow speeds of several knots.
   The theoretical response functions of the EMVM are evaluated for
   velocity and vorticity. Extensive measurements were obtained in
   Pickering Passage, Washington, as the sensor vertically profiled in an
   unstratified tidal channel. During periods of strong flow, the vertical
   structure of all properties confirmed expectations for a fully developed
   turbulent bottom boundary layer. EMVM observations of velocity and
   vorticity are shown to be in agreement with the theoretical response
   function for isotropic turbulence. A principal result is that the
   vertical flux of spanwise vorticity (i.e., <(w'omega(y)')over bar>) is
   positive (i.e., flux is away from seabed) and vertically uniform. The
   vertical eddy diffusivity for vorticity is about 5 x 10(-2) m(2) s(-1),
   which is about the same value as for momentum.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH POLICY}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{833-851}},

Abstract = {{In the article we describe how the digital computer regime grew out of
   existing computing regimes through a process of transformation. This
   transformation is conceptualised as a regime shift: a change in the rule
   set that underpins technical change, guiding innovative activity and
   output into particular directions. Examples of such rules are technical
   standards, product standards, user requirements, design rules and
   organisational rules of how to produce, what to produce. The paper
   describes how the new digital computer regime had to start from
   structures of the old regimes, and only later on developed its own
   distinctive elements. It describes how specific changes in the existing
   computing regimes, particularly the increasing division of labour, the
   growing schematisation of computing activities and the development of
   more sophisticated punch card machinery, contributed to the design and
   programming methods of the digital computer. How the old programming
   methods constrained the development of the new regime is also discussed.
   The article does not go into the actual processes of diffusion of
   digital computers into specific domains. It does however discuss the
   role of market demand dynamics for the evolution of digital technology,
   which too often is portrayed as a technology/science push phenomenon.

Abstract = {{Mid-entry strategy is an R\&D strategy designed for an efficient
   utilisation of scientific and technological resources across the
   nations. It chooses the entry point of R\&D projects in the mid-stage of
   technical development. The technological situation of developing
   countries compels them to choose the mid-entry strategies tailored to
   specific technologies. The development of the CDMA (Code Division
   Multiple Access) based digital cellular mobile communication system by
   ETRI, Korea's government-sponsored research institute, is an example
   showing the application of this strategy. ETRI utilised scientific
   resources owned by US based Qualcomm Ltd and co-operated with local
   companies for the development. In the first half of 1996 the successful
   commercialisation of the CDMA digital cellular telephone service was
   launched in Korea, ahead of all other countries. Two Korean mobile
   communications providers have adopted the system.}},

Abstract = {{The recent unprecedented growth of information in digital form advocates
   the need for better ways to interact with this vast amount of
   richly-conveyed information. This paper reviews and analyses the design
   considerations of an advanced information environment for users to
   interact in novel manners with online documents such as electronic
   journals. The interaction environment is also intended to support
   value-adding of electronic documents. The design is inspired by analyses
   of user requirements in interacting with information, by advances in the
   electronic information would, and by innovations in human-computer
   interaction. These led to the derivation and proposal of a set of
   properties in both the interaction environment and the information
   objects within the environment The environment is a visually-rich,
   interactive information environment based on user-controlled
   malleability and integration with various interaction tools. The
   information objects within the environment are fractionally structured,
   contextualized and explicable, queriable and navigable at multiple
   levels of granularity, and associated with layers of additional

Abstract = {{This paper describes the implementation of the 30 variational (3D-var)
   analysis in the Regional Data Assimilation System (RDAS) of the Canadian
   Meteorological Centre. The RDAS, a 12-h data assimilation cycle, is nm
   twice daily to provide analyses to the variable resolution Global El
   Environmental Multi-scale (GEM) model The same incremental 3D-var
   algorithm is used for both the regional and global data assimilation
   systems. In this algorithm, the innovations are calculated with respect
   to the full-resolution model while the analysis increments are
   calculated at a lower resolution on a Gaussian grid
   Background,and error correlations for the global and regional data
   assimilation systems are examined. It is shown that the resolution of
   the analysis increments is determined to a great extent by the
   horizontal correlation lengths. Although the horizontal resolution of
   the regional model is three times higher than the global model, the
   correlation lengths for both models are similar. Consequently the same
   horizontal resolution for the analysis increments is used in both data
   assimilation systems.
   A pre-implementation evaluation showed that the RDAS maximises the
   coherence between the analysis and the forecast model This results in a
   higher-resolution and more consistent analysis with respect to the
   regional model. The forecasts issued from the RDAS are generally
   improved especially the temperature and the geopotential above 300 hPa.
   The RDAS also reduces the precipitation spin-lip observed during the
   first 12 hours when initiated with an analysis from the global data
   assimilation system. Finally the impact of the digital filter on the
   analysis from the RDAS is small, indicating that the regional analysis
   is already well balanced.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to conventional hardware where the structure is irreversibly
   fixed in the design process, evolvable hardware (EHW) is designed to
   adapt to changes in task requirements or changes in the environment,
   through its ability to reconfigure its own hardware structure
   dynamically and autonomously. This capacity for adaptation, achieved by
   employing efficient search algorithms based on the metaphor of
   evolution, has great potential for the development of innovative
   industrial applications. This paper introduces EHW chips and sis
   applications currently being developed as part of MITI's Real-World
   Computing Project; an analog EHW chip for cellular phones, a
   clock-timing architecture for Giga hertz systems, a neural network EHW
   chip capable of autonomous reconfiguration, a data compression EHW chip
   for electrophotographic printers, and a gate-level EHW chip for use in
   prosthetic hands and robot navigation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe the design of the re-configurable front-end
   boards (BORA boards) for the 82944 channel RICH-1 (Ring Imaging
   CHerenkov) of the Compass Collaboration (NA58). The front-end
   electronics controls the sample-and-hold operation after the arrival of
   an event trigger, acquires the analog voltages from the pre-amp VLSI and
   converts them into 10 bits at a rate of 20 Ms/s per analog channel. The
   digitized analogue values are then written into FIFOs. A subsequent
   operation compares the readings of each and every channel with
   corresponding programmable thresholds, and transmits those values larger
   than the threshold, together with the channel number, through an optical
   fiber to subsequent processing stages of the acquisition system. The
   overall operation of the board is controlled and supervised by a fast
   DSP. The availability of local intelligence allows the board to present
   innovative features such as: to be part of a computer network that
   connects several similar boards of the detector with a PC. The presence
   of the DSP allows testing the operability and linearity of the analog
   channels; and creating engineering frames containing local temperatures
   and voltages and transmitting the results through the network. The
   operator can reconfigure the hardware and software of the board by
   downloading programs from the PC. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Radiographic monitoring of marginal peri-fixture bone is mandatory
   during prospective evaluation of different dental implant systems.
   Unyielding, uni-directional focus towards identifying the credibility of
   implant-supported overdenture therapy for the management of the
   edentulous predicament, has often neglected correct standardization of
   follow-up radiographs. Techniques for truly accurate location of
   film-holding devices have often not been applied to both unicentre and
   multicentre reports on mandibular implant-supported overdentures using
   Branemark implants. An innovative improvement on existing methods using
   conventional and custom-made components, shows a procedure to accurately
   and simply standardize follow-up radiographs, for both free-standing and
   bar designs for mandibular implant-supported overdentures.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a CMOS digital camera for computer vision which
   integrates on a chip a 256 x 256-pixel photosensitive array together
   with 32 charge amplifiers and ADCs (one every 8 pixel columns), timing
   and control circuitry and a digital interface with an external
   microprocessor An innovative implementation of algorithmic
   analogue-to-digital conversion was used in the design of the core cell
   for a compact converter array. The circuit offers a good trade-off
   between architectures based on sensors with a single video-rate
   converter and these based on sensors with a large number of lower-rate
   converters (one per pixel column). Fabricated in a standard 1.2-mu m
   CMOS process with an added metal-3 light-shielding layer, the circuit
   requires a single supply voltage and occupies a total area of 50mm(2). A
   thorough electro-optical test of the camera showed good performance in
   terms of sensitivity and spectral responsivity. Image quality adequate
   for computer vision was demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The current trends in development and deployment of advanced
   electromechanical systems have facilitated the unified activities in the
   analysis and design of slate-of-the-art motion devices, electric motors,
   power electronics, and digital controllers. This paper attacks the
   motion control problem (stabilization, tracking, and disturbance
   attenuation) for mechatronic systems which include permanent-magnet DC
   motors, power circuity, and motion controllers. By using an explicit
   representation of nonlinear dynamics of motors and switching converters,
   we approach and solve analysis and control problems to ensure a spectrum
   of performance objectives imposed on advanced mechatronic systems. The
   maximum allowable magnitude of the applied armature voltage is rated,
   the currents are limited, and there exist the lower and upper limits of
   the duty ratio of converters. To approach design tradeoffs and analyze
   performance (accuracy, settling time, overshoot, stability margins, and
   other quantities), the imposed constraints, model nonlinearities, and
   parameter variations are thoroughly studied in this paper. Our goal is
   to attain the specified characteristics and avoid deficiencies
   associated with linear formulation. To solve these problems, an
   innovative controller is synthesized to ensure performance improvements,
   robust tracking, and disturbance rejection. One cannot neglect
   constraints, and a bounded control law is designed to improve
   performance and guarantee robust stability. The offered approach uses a
   complete nonlinear mechatronic system dynamics with parameter
   variations, and this avenue allows one to avoid the conservative results
   associated with linear concept when mechatronic system dynamics is
   mapped by a linear constant-coefficient differential equation. To
   illustrate the reported framework and to validate the controller,
   analytical and experimental results are presented and discussed. In
   particular, comprehensive analysis and design with experimental
   verification are performed for an electric drive. A nonlinear bounded
   controller is designed, implemented, and experimentally tested, (C) 1999

   inter-layer distance of approximate to 100 mu m and an efficiency of
   approximate to 80\% for 20 keV photons. The image is acquired by
   scanning the object across the beam cross-section and the overall

   of corresponding pixels in the three layers, thereby reducing the effect

Abstract = {{A number of different imaging systems are in use in X-ray medical
   diagnostics (e.g. digital radiography or computer tomography). The
   design goal of these imaging systems is to optimally use the information
   contained in X-ray quanta that have passed through the patient. The best
   image quality, as well as the minimisation of the X-ray dose applied to
   the patient are of prime importance. We report about innovations for
   novel detectors which reduce the X-ray dose and improve the image
   quality simultaneously.
   Advances in thin film electronics have permitted the development of
   large a-Si:H imaging arrays to design flat panel solid state detectors
   (short FD, up to 45 x 45 cm2) for both digital radiography and
   fluoroscopy. The proposed detector consists of a CsI:TI needle shaped
   scintillation crystal layer (thickness: 450 mu m, needle diameter
   similar to 10 mu m) in front of an a-Si:H-panel. The Detective Quantum
   Efficiency (DQE) is about 65 \% (at spatial frequency zero) and spatial
   resolution is 2.8 lp/mm at 20\% of the MTF and 6.2 lp/mm at 4 \%.
   In computed tomography (CT), a new generation of linear detector array
   consists of Gadolinium Oxysulfid (GOS) ceramic scintillator elements,
   glued onto photodiodes. Important criteria for the selection of the
   detector material are good absorption of the incident X-rays (alpha > 95
   \%) and high efficiency of conversion of the absorbed radiation energy
   to an electrical signal. A very short decay time to extremely low levels
   of afterglow is an advantage for the very short: scanning times in CT.
   One gets a DQE (at 0 mm(-1)) about 80 \%.
   The next step toward dose reduction could be implemented by the
   application of monochromatic instead of polychromatic X-rays. This would
   additionally improve the DQE and thus enhance image duality. In
   addition, with the application of monochromatic X-rays, scattered
   radiation could be suppressed to a large extent by energy-selective
   single photon measurement, without loss of unscattered photons. At
   present, large area detectors in particular suffer from image quality
   losses, if no scattered radiation (multiline) grid is used.}},

Abstract = {{A small-angle integrated light-scattering (SAILS) instrument was
   designed with the innovative use of a diffusing plate and a
   charge-coupled device (CGD) camera. In contrast to previous small-angle
   light-scattering instruments, SAILS has few optical surfaces, allowing
   the direct recovery of scattering data. Although this approach bypasses
   the need for aberration corrections that are due to lenses, geometric
   corrections still apply and are described in detail. The image on the
   diffusing plate, when photographed by the CCD camera, yields a digitized
   two-dimensional array, covering the observed scattering angles from 10
   to 20 deg. The size distribution of the scattering particles can be
   obtained by a discrete inversion of the experimentally obtained
   intensity versus angle-scattering curve. The mean radii obtained from
   this inversion of SAILS data are compared with nominal sizes given by
   the manufacturer, and standard errors are computed. The results indicate
   that SAILS is an ideal instrument for the study of particulates and,
   because of its fast readout time, is suitable for studying aggregation
   phenomena. However, because of the limited Q range of SAILS it is
   currently not suited for the direct determination of particle diameters
   smaller than approximately 300 nm. (C) 1999 Optical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present preliminary results on the expression of
   Hoxa-11 in the frog Xenopus laevis and the newt Notophthalmus
   viridescens. hi amniote limbs, Horn-II is expressed exclusively in the
   prospective zeugopodium and is involved in the development of
   zeugopodial character identity. While the Horn-II expression pattern in
   Xenopus is similar to those described in mice and chick, the newt
   Notophthalmus has a phase of autopodial Horn-II expression starting with
   the development of digit III. Expression is particularly strong in the
   buds of the postaxial digits. This Horn-II expression pattern is unique
   among tetrapods and adds to the list of developmental peculiarities of
   urodele Limb development, which also include an anterior to posterior
   polarity of digit development. We propose a scenario to explain the
   evolutionary origin of urodele limb development. We assume that recent
   urodeles are derived from a lineage of amphibians which underwent
   partial digit reduction, leaving only two digits intact, most likely
   digits LU and TV according to Morse's law, This implies that urodele
   digits I and II are homologous to amniote digits III and IV, and that
   the postaxial digits of urodeles are an evolutionary innovation
   (re-invention), Supporting evidence for this homology hypothesis is
   found in the developmental connections between the basale commune and
   the postaxial zeugopodial element.}},

Abstract = {{According to David Teece, only strong and integrated firms can
   successfully innovate in a systemic fashion. Looser coalitions
   consisting of joint ventures, alliances, or virtual partners will not be
   able to create a systemic innovation, let alone to set standards for it,
   or to control its further evolution. In this article this position is
   challenged, in particular, regarding the information industry. It mill
   be argued that in view of the fact that industrial structure is changing
   from vertical to horizontal, and digital convergence ts taking place,
   systemic innovation today can only be undertaken by alliance networks.
   Although such networks are vulnerable to opportunism, these are capable
   of producing systemic innovations, because mutual relations can be
   stabilized by forms of both substantive and procedural commitment. If
   standards also haze to De pioneered, alliance networks will have to
   expand. As there are few ways in which these new allies may commit
   themselves, the network is weakened. It is argued that, nevertheless,
   the mutual competition between networks will not end in an impasse.
   Instead, a unique, hybrid standard is likely to emerge in the end, since
   contending networks are willing to compromise, and since some of the
   more important parties along the system chain may usefully constitute
   themselves as arbitrators. This argument is Put to the test by examining
   the case of the development of the Digital Video Duc (DVD). It is shown
   that a battle between two alliance networks caused (one led by Toshiba,
   the other by Philips and Sony), that evolved along the lines conjectured
   above.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Our purpose was to determine the diagnostic potential of a
   new, computerized method of interpreting transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)
   information by artificial neural network analysis (ANNA). This method
   was developed to resolve the current dilemma of visual differentiation
   between benign and malignant tissue on TRUS. To train and objectively
   evaluate ANNA, a new precise method of computerized virtual correlation
   of preoperative ultrasound findings and radical prostatectomy
   histopathology was devised. After training with this pathologically
   confirmed digitized TRUS information, ANNA was tested in a blinded
   study.
   METHODS. Following radical prostatectomy, 289 pathology whole-mount
   sections of 61 patients were correlated digitally with the corresponding
   TRUS slices. Specific selection of TRUS areas unequivocally identified
   on the correlated digitized pathohistology resulted in 553
   pathology-confirmed representations (samples). Of these, 53 were used
   for training and 500 were subjected to blind analysis by ANNA.
   RESULTS. ANNA classified 378 (99\%) of the 381 benign
   pathology-confirmed samples correctly as benign. The false-positive rate
   was 1\% (n = 3). Of the 119 pathology-confirmed malignant samples, 94
   (79\%) were classified correctly; 25(21\%) were falsely classified as
   normal. Out of all 119 cancers, ANNA classified 60 (71\%)bf the
   hypoechoic cancers as malignant and 24 (29\%) as benign. Surprisingly,
   34(97\%) of the isoechoic cancers were correctly classified by ANNA,
   missing only one sample.
   CONCLUSIONS. The introduction of ANNA enhanced the accuracy of TRUS
   prostate cancer identification. Although not all malignant areas were
   detected, cancer was detected in each patient. The ability to detect
   isoechoic cancerous lesions appears to be the essential innovation over
   conventional TRUS interpretation. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of electroencephalogram (EEG) features on the
   scalp surface, both in time or frequency, is of great importance in
   clinical applications and medical research. Traditionally, mathematical
   methods based on interpolation algorithms have been widely applied to
   obtain the EEG mappings, This paper presents an innovative approach to
   reconstructing the brain potential mappings from multichannel EEG's, The
   three-dimensional (3-D) filtering approach, differing from the numerical
   interpolating methods, considers the spatial distribution of brain
   potentials as a 3-D signal, which is processed and interpolated
   according to its spatial frequency characteristics, The performance of
   the 3-D filtering method evaluated on simulated brain potentials is
   shown to be comparable to the four-nearest-neighbors method. Moreover,
   the 3-D filtering method is superior to the spherical splines method in
   efficiency. Two main advantages of this method are: the prospect of
   developing realtime, animated EEG mappings utilizing powerful digital
   signal processors and its capability of processing and interpolating the
   brain potentials on the realistic irregular scalp surface.}},

   store up to 32 events per channel with a double-hit resolution of 8 ns.
   It can realize common-start and common-stop operations. It has 4.2 ms of
   input range with a 125-MHz system clock, The chip uses an asynchronous
   interpolator system based on a delay-locked Line to increase the coarse
   resolution. It has been fabricated in a double-metal single poly n-well,
   1-mu m CMOS process with an area of about 77 mm(2). Measurements show

   objects that capture working practices, such as problems of practice.
   The paper reports on work-in-progress on multimedia objects (primarily
   digitized video clips). Use of multimedia in professional learning is a
   relatively novel approach, and it is surfacing issues about the
   requirements for creating shareable, effective representations. A set of
   descriptors for multimedia objects has been developed and the paper
   focuses on applying the descriptors to an example video clip, to
   identify potential relationships between the descriptors. The duration
   of the clip, its use of artefacts and the social cues given in the clip
   are considered key factors in creating a shareable representation for
   discussion and reflection among practitioners in distributed

Abstract = {{A new and innovative furnace tube inspection system (FTIS) has been
   developed that combines laser profilometry and ultrasonic thickness
   technologies. The system has been designed specifically to inspect the
   serpen-tine tubing networks typical of petrochemical refinery furnaces.
   The FTIS is an autonomous instrument, which is propelled at 0.61 m/s (2
   ft/s) by a column of clean water As the instrument passes through the
   furnace tubing, it optically profiles the inner tubing surface with a
   high speed rotating laser profiler The laser profiler provides high
   density inner radius measurements, while an ultrasonic module
   simultaneously measures tubing wall thickness and records redundant
   radial measurements at a lower sampling density. FTIS employs on board
   state of the art digital electronics to store the recorded data as they
   are collected. After completing the inspection run, the data are then
   downloaded to a portable computer for analysis and display. FTIS is
   currently being used in the field and is targeted to replace current
   conventional furnace inspection practices.}},

   which is a life-size model of the sculptor's body without any arms. The
   three dimensional measurements of the maquette, made by analytical
   photogrammetric techniques, were then processed to produce a fully
   functional three dimensional CAD model from which the dimensions needed
   by the fabricating company, Hartlepool Steel Fabrications Ltd., could be
   extracted. Additionally, the VirtuoZo digital photogrammetric software
   package was used to investigate the potential of automated measurement

Abstract = {{The frequency to digital converter (FDC) is an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC). The chip has been designed to handle one
   input channel but can easily be expanded to handle multiple channels of
   frequencies. The channel is capable of measuring frequencies from 100 Hz
   to 100 kHz. The power consumption of the chip is very low. The frequency
   measurement accuracy is better than 0.1\%. The conversion rate per
   channel is 100 samples s(-1) which can be varied too. The chip has built
   in test equipment (BITE) to verify its operation. It is able to generate
   frequencies like 8, 4, 2 and 1 MHz which can be fed as optional clock
   frequencies depending on the accuracy desired. The FDC chip can be
   interfaced to a 16 bit bus. To meet these stringent specifications of
   the FDC chip an innovative frequency measurement technique has been
   devised called the hybrid technique of frequency measurement. The
   technique proves to be very accurate and it is found that by varying the
   sampling rate the range of input frequencies over which this accuracy
   can be achieved also changes.
   The specifications are particularly strict so that it is possible to use
   the chip for any military application for which a very reliable
   operation is demanded. The FDC chip is hence ideal for control and
   guidance purposes. The chip has wide ranging applications. In
   conjunction with sensors such as accelerometers it can be used to design
   smart sensors. The chip can play a vital role in engine controllers and
   in pressure measurements using vibration type transducers. Sometimes to
   isolate (galvonic) transducers, the output is converted to frequency and
   isolation is achieved using opto-isolators; then by measuring the
   frequency using this chip this can be converted to digital information.}},

   that although broadcasting's special role cannot be ignored in a

   industries when digital technology is bringing about government should
   not create boundaries between industries when digital technology is
   bringing about convergence. Since it is difficult to predict the effect

   the prime arbiter of the deployment of digital innovation. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A quality ladder model is used to test for Marshallian externalities in
   innovation. The model predicts that, in the absence of spillovers, the
   geographical distribution of research should be the same as that of
   production. This hypothesis is strongly rejected: innovation in
   two-digit industries exhibits strong spatial clustering independently of
   the distribution of employment. We find also, in support of Romer and
   Lucas, that there are strong spillovers from aggregate innovative
   activity in a region to the research intensity of individual industries.
   The location of a sector's R\&D activity is determined more by the
   location of other sectors' innovation than by the location of its own

Abstract = {{Digital and analog air photographs and field observations have been used

   dimensions using a digital stereoplotter. The procedure permits
   correction of plotting errors mode by the geologist who could previously
   use only a few ground points recognizable in the field to locate
   sandstone bads on the digital topographic base map. Digital orthophotos
   and elevation data were then used to calculate three-point solutions of
   the strike and dip of sandstone ridges. These procedures allowed the
   geologist to improve his geological interpretation and to validate the
   digital transfer of line work by the photogrammetrist.
   Photogrammetrically calculated bedding measurements augmented those
   measured in the field and allowed the geologist to delineate several

Abstract = {{The Open University has gained considerable experience in the use of
   computer-mediated communication (CMC) and similar techniques in distance
   education. The new media offer a wide range of opportunities for
   extending the educational experience of learners. In one large-scale
   application of CMC, involving some 3500 students, students became
   enthusiastic users of the medium, and regarded it as a major source of
   motivation. However, it is not clear what other academic benefits they
   gained from the activity. The strengths and weaknesses of electronic
   communication as an educational medium and the resulting consequences
   for universities are examined. It seems clear that while the short-term
   effects of the medium are relatively small, in the longer term they may
   entirely reshape the conception of a university. The role of the
   academic will change, and new forms of literacy will need to be
   developed. Issues of access and equitability will need to be addressed
   and learning methods adapted so that the medium gives high added-value.

Abstract = {{The aim of the work is to present a novel apparatus for experimental
   activity in research of new methods for studying material and biological
   tissue with ultrasound. FEMMINA (Fast Echographic Multiparametric Multi
   Imaging Novel Apparatus) is a hardware and software platform dedicated
   to ultrasonic signal and image processing. It uses the radio frequency
   signal for multi parametric calculation and presentation with a
   multiprocessing digital architecture. The architecture is designed to be
   modular, expandable and aimed at embracing different ultrasonic
   investigation techniques. It provides a multi analysis and interactive
   image system not only for clinical usage but also for all applications
   where a high image rate production is required. In order to obtain an
   efficient interactive system, it was also necessary to realize a fast
   signal processing, as well as to implement a fast visualization tool for
   managing multiple images. The platform is completely programmable, and
   for a specific application it can be on-line reconfigured in dependence
   of the parameters that, from time to time, must be evaluated. Spectral
   images of biological in vitro and in-vivo tissue, obtained through the
   Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) by using new processing algorithms are
   presented as preliminary applications of the platform, as well as vector
   images for blood flow 2-D Doppler investigation. Innovative blood
   images, obtained without using the Doppler effect, and novel vector
   distribution images for blood velocity are reported.}},

Abstract = {{The present work introduces some feasibility studies in implementing an
   innovative and easier process to manufacture Hybrid MCM-L EGA modules.
   Palladium circuit finishing is viewed and considered as a catalyst for
   the required ``reaction{''} between costs and performance at all
   different levels of the products design of the next generation. Such
   technological requirement is driven by apparently not compatible needs
   between the System Designer and the packaging costs when a full Wire
   Bond or a full Flip Chip configurations are considered. Hybrid MCM-L may
   be the most reasonable option considering that they represent an easy
   answer when the System Designer needs many functions available from very
   low cost packaged components: their use is very difficult to justify in
   an assembly process as bare die (either Flip Chip and Wire Bond), even
   more difficult within complex design structures where more expensive
   component's are at stake suffering from assembly yield problems driven
   by the low cost components. Last but not least, is the fact that
   currently almost the totality of components available for integration
   are designed for wire bonding, so an additional piece of work would be
   required to transform them in Flip Chip making them compatible on a
   common substrate with SMT parts. A common carrier with the possibility
   to Mount current available components in all the different second level
   assembly configurations is considered feasible. A detailed analysis of
   the Palladium finishing surface behavior within different process steps
   and module configuration is presented. As a study vehicle a current
   Hybrid application with analogue (low cost) and digital (high cost)
   components has been utilized.}},

Abstract = {{This Paper will describe a marketing perspective of innovative
   application possibilities for medium density fiberboard (MDF) made
   possible by certain technological advancements and marketing strategies.
   These advancements include utilizing different resin types and other
   special additives, forming techniques, and breakthroughs in secondary
   processing. The need to develop new products and applications is chiefly
   due to significant increases in global MDF capacity, which has
   challenged the industry to increase demand. Meeting this challenge will
   require an aggressive and unconventional marketing approach, along with
   maximum utilization of analytical, technical, and manufacturing
   resources. Some of the opportunities that exist include substitution for
   solid wood in unconventional interior and exterior applications. Others
   will offer alternatives to non-wood products, where not only cost and
   performance are important, but: also the environmental advantages are
   likewise valued. Success in these markets will be dependent on proper
   use and application of the many technologies currently available, while
   providing economic advantages and superior performance to the customer.
   Demand for MDF has not historically been a problem, even with modest
   capacity expansion, which has been the case, at least until the
   double-digit growth rates in consumption finally spawned the literal
   explosion in North American capacity. While new and existing consumers
   have started to absorb the increased capacity, the significant increase
   in availability has made pricing quite competitive. A commodity approach
   to pricing will not provide the long-term profitability companies expect
   in today's financial climate. Success in finding new markets and
   applications will play an important role in achieving continued demand
   growth along with providing higher returns on investments.}},

Abstract = {{With the current emphasis on green technology and recently introduced UK
   and European legislation, the accent on minimising atmospheric emissions
   and ground pollution is paramount. In this study, an approach to
   intelligent flame control is investigated using Digital Image
   Processing, Fuzzy Logic, and Artificial Neural Network techniques.
   Successful development of such system will not only lead to minimised
   atmospheric emissions, with much improved combustion efficiency, but
   also considerable savings in fuel costs. An experimental rig was
   constructed for the investigation of a series of names using digital
   image processing. This involves processing and analysing Bunsen flame
   images over a range of different gas and airflow rates, in-order to
   identify the main control parameters. Fuzzy logic is used to convert
   analytical control rules stated by the human operator into automatic
   control strategy. Both the universe and character of the fuzzy
   membership is adjusted through the process of real time learning. This
   innovative Neuro-Fuzzy system learns and implements dynamic adjustments
   of the network, which overcomes the traditional training and use
   bottlenecks.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a two-year Small Business Innovation Research program to
   assess the US Air Force radiographic inspection environment and evaluate
   candidate digital X-ray imaging systems for use in this environment have
   resulted in several recommendations for the use of these emerging
   technologies. Visits to representative Air Force bases were made to
   review the radiographic practice and culture at operational, training
   and Air Logistic Center locations. Particular attention was given to
   bases with F-15 squadrons, since this aircraft accounts for a large
   fraction of the radiographic NDI conducted in the Air Force. Operational
   units of F-16, T-38, B-1B, C-130, and C-141 aircraft were also visited
   to gain a wider view of the X-ray inspection applications. Digital X-ray
   imaging systems have been evaluated relative to required performance
   characteristics, adaptability to the Air Force inspection environment
   and cost of acquisition and use. Several categories of X-ray imaging
   systems were evaluated. These include flat panel arrays, storage
   phosphors, screen camera systems, and image intensifier tubes.}},

Abstract = {{ii number of tactical military and commercial applications require
   multimedia, self-organizing high throughput, wireless networks that can
   operate independently of fixed or external infrastructures. These uses
   range from low echelon push-to-talk radio to higher echelon subscriber
   access to MSE, and include commercial applications such as wireless LANs
   and emergency communications. The Soldier Phone system addresses these
   needs with an innovative concept termed Orthogonal Domain Multiple
   Access (ODMA) to provide dynamic bandwidth management. It adjusts radio
   transmit and receive times, channels, and data rates to match the
   dynamic radio frequency (RF) environment and user traffic loading. ODMA
   is embedded in a larger suite of`protocols that manage the peer-to-peer
   communications, These include ATM style switching for datagrams and
   virtual circuits; network management for routing, signaling, and address
   resolution, and user convergence for many traffic types. This protocol
   suite has been integrated with baseband digital signal processing (DSP)
   functions to yield a Wireless Networking Engine (WNE). Soldier Phone is
   the first instantiation of` the WNE and has been successfully
   demonstrated in a laboratory testbed. It will be field tested in the
   near future.}},

Abstract = {{The Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office (LOSCO) and 3001, Inc. are
   developing the Louisiana Oil Spill Geographic Information System
   (LOGIS). The LOGIS will, when complete, provide all relevant information
   for Louisiana's oil spill planning, assessment, and response, accessible
   24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Three innovative methods are being used
   to populate the LOGIS database. These methods are saving LOSCO time and
   money. They are innovative mapping techniques, including data
   acquisition technology and mapping applications; innovative field
   database methods; and storage and distribution techniques. Data
   acquisition innovation includes airborne GPS; roll-feed, single-pass
   scanning of color infrared film; digital orthophotography production
   without diapositives; and GIS-based flight management. Mapping
   application innovation includes mapping features by image
   interpretation, using maps for pre-field planning, and using mobile GIS
   in the field and DOQQs on-screen for mapping reconnaissance. LOSCO has
   contracted to have a Microsoft Access database developed to assist field
   crews. Using laptops, field crews can input field data directly into a
   digital format. Since a Web browser or FTP site will not feasibly handle
   more than one terabyte of information housed in the LOGIS, the
   contractor is devising new ways to distribute the data 24 hours a day.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated hardware and software (HW\&SW) solutions are very cheap and
   easy to implement at industrial level in many sectors. These innovations
   can thus be profitably applied in the field of mineral processing and
   more specifically in flotation processes, especially adopting new
   processing detection strategies and analysis of flotation froth features
   oriented to analyze both the whole and the single flotation froth
   characters. In this perspective new procedures can be successfully
   applied to carry out quite ``simple{''} and ``easy-to-apply{''}
   determinations and new control actions on routine bases, both at
   laboratory ({''}off-line{''} control) and processing plant scale
   ({''}on-line{''} control). The possibility to utilize new analytical
   ``on-line{''} digital imaging techniques in the field of flotation can
   open new horizons. To successfully reach these goals, several
   conditions, linked with the particular nature of the samples (froth
   images) have to be verified:
   the adoption of specific sampling procedures (easy and correct
   acquisition of the images necessary for the analysis);
   the identification of those parameters that extracted from the images
   can describe the characters concerning the froths (morphological and
   morphometrical parameters, color and/or textural information);
   the procedures able to extract the characters of interest from the
   images (points, lines, 2D and 3D analysis);
   the identification of a correct target-oriented-processing-strategy to
   manipulate and process the previous extracted characters;
   the synthesis of the results and the definition of one or more
   correlation functions able to establish a correspondence between digital
   information, extracted from the images, and bulk materials handling and
   processing;
   the definition of suitable control strategies, at a different level of
   interaction/s with the process/es, to apply specific control action on
   the process itself.
   In the paper will be analyzed, described and discussed the guidelines
   that can be considered at the base of the definition of digital based
   procedures for flotation froth processing and handling. The
   considerations will be developed with particular reference to the case
   of industrial flotation plant operating in steady state conditions.}},

   databases for a long time. The rise of the Internet led numerous
   libraries and research center to envisage the sharing of this scientific
   patrimony with the general public. But such a popularization project
   cannot be undertaken without reassessing the initial orientation of the
   database. This communication presents the results of tests carried out
   as part of a digitizatlon project undertaken by a team of librarians and
   historians. After an in-depth analysis of the process of image reading,
   we suggest new ways to access and index images. First, we propose an
   overview interface to allow for a constant dialog between the user and
   the archive; secondly, we have recourse to the concept of
   ``scenotype{''} to better understand image reading and to conceive an
   innovative indexing method.}},

Abstract = {{In most advanced imaging systems designed for low light level
   applications, the heart of the detection process is an image
   intensifier. While such imaging systems are ideal in low light, they are
   sensitive to sudden increases in brightness levels within the field of
   view. These sudden bright spots are caused by a variety of sources (both
   intentional and not) and can result in a loss of contrast, blinding of
   the imaging system and damage to the components. As a safety measure
   against this situation, most systems incorporate global methods for
   automatic protection against bright sources. Unfortunately, this results
   in loss of gain and image contrast over the entire field of view, even
   if the bright source occupies only a small portion of the image.
   Exposure control over individual segments of the image is required. We
   present initial results from a unique implementation of the Digital
   Micromirror Device (DMD(TM)) technology. Through proper placement of the
   DMD in the optical path and by providing an automatic feedback control
   loop from. the intensified digital imager, sections of the image plane
   can be automatically diverted from the optical path by controlling the
   mirror pixels in those affected areas. An innovative approach, the
   DMD-based Anti-Blooming System (DABS), has been developed. Using rapid
   digital processing, this control can be ultimately implemented between
   frames of the imager to both preserve the hardware and allow for
   seamless return to a high contrast image. Repeated polling of the image
   plane through the feedback loop will allow far active control of the
   intensified image. A system description of the DABS and successful
   results from initial closed loop operation are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Banks are engaged in a dramatic upheaval on a global scale, spurred by
   liberalization, globalization, disintermediation, securitizion,
   digitalization, etc. Customers' changing attitudes and the establishment
   of the Euro (with the attendant market adjustments) are also influencing
   the banks, which have been responding in several ways - mergers,
   concentration on core business, customer orientation, and structural and
   procedural changes, to name just a few.
   The author identifies the main drivers behind the strategic adjustment
   of banks: differentiation of products and services; establishment of
   customer-oriented marketing; alternative electronic chains of
   distribution; technological efficiency; and a culture focused on
   performance, innovation and cooperation, and effective leadership. All
   of this, he points out, occurs in the context of ever-greater
   transparency.
   Sokolovsky concludes with a look at the future, when banks will be
   marked by (among other things) relationship banking, integration of all
   financial services into one consulting service that is tailored to
   client needs, multi-channel distribution, and state-of-the-art
   transactions and consultations.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated, high-speed photographic system combining a
   high-repetition rate, pulsed ruby laser and a high-framing rate CCD
   camera has been demonstrated. Individually, the laser and camera have
   been discussed previously and each was developed under the Small
   Business Innovative Research (SBIR) sponsorship through the Air Force
   Research Lab (AFRL). This paper presents for the first time digital
   images captured at 333 kHz using the two elements integrated as a
   high-speed photographic system.
   The laser is capable of generating a train of 65 pulses at 500 kHz
   operation with micropulse energy of similar to 350 mJ each (>25 J for
   the macropulse). The test reported herein required only about 10\% of
   this capability or similar to 40 mJ per pulse. The laser was selected as
   the master time control because the laser pulse could be located in time
   with high precision (<1 ns jitter) relative to a secondary laser output
   trigger. The laser pulse occured at the end of the Q-switch open time,
   as previously shown by the authors (PSI). Synchronization of the camera
   and the laser Q-switch driver in this way required different repetition
   rates for the laser and the camera due to the state triggering
   requirements of the two components.
   The illuminated object for this test case was an Air Force 3-bar
   resolution chart. A f=-100 mm negative lens expanded the laser beam to
   fill the target area while a sheet of ground glass placed after the lens
   diffused the beam to remove coherent laser speckle from the image. A 17
   nm wide ruby filter with 75\% transmission centered at 694 nm (Andover
   Corporation) was used to remove stray light. The CCD array imaged the
   3-bar chart through a f/4, 100 mm lens.
   The Silicon Mountain Design camera used here had the capability to
   capture 16 frames at a framing rate up to 1 MHz (SMD 64k1M). This test
   was configured at 1/3 of the maximum framing rate. In order to achieve
   the high framing rate, only one out of sixteen sub-pixels was active per
   frame comprising a 256x256 array for each frame. This effected the
   resolution of an image and the sequential frame to frame resolution. The
   observed resolution was 0.25 line pairs per mm using 256(2) pixels on a
   2 cm(2) array. The effective camera open shutter lime for this test case
   equals the laser pulse width of similar to 10 ns (FWHM laser pulse).
   This paper details the fluence requirements for the test case, the
   synchronization of laser pulses to camera open shutter time (integration
   time) and the resolution of the image versus the expected resolution. It
   has been demonstrated that 10 ns wide high-speed laser pulses can be
   captured digitally at a high frame rate. Integration of these two
   elements into a high-speed photographic system expands image capture
   capabilities and facilitates near real time data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Using a mobile handset in noisy environments makes the far-end speech
   difficult to be perceived from the near-end user perspective. As he is
   surrounded by a loud background noise, handset user needs to be highly
   concentrated to understand the far-end speaker conversation. Ambient
   noise reduction algorithms provide an efficient solution to build a
   silent zone between the handset loudspeaker and the user ear, thus
   improving speech understanding for the near-end speaker.
   This paper presents a full description of an innovative ambient noise
   reduction system developed on a TI TMS320C54x DSP. This contribution is
   combining both theoretical and experimental considerations, raising
   potential issues that may be encountered when implementing these
   applications on a real system. It will be shown that the advanced
   architecture of TI TMS320C54x DSP makes the ambient noise reduction
   application possible to be executed in the same CPU performing in the
   same time wireless digital cellular baseband processing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of motion estimation and selective
   reconstruction of objects undergoing rotational motion composed with
   translational motion. The goal is to derive the motion parameters
   belonging to the multiple moving objects, i.e. the angular velocities
   and the translational velocities and identify their locations at each
   time instance by selective reconstruction. These parameters and
   locations can be used for various purpose such as trajectory tracking,
   focus/shift attention of robot, etc. The innovative algorithm we have
   developed is based on angular velocity and translational velocity tuned
   2D+T filters. One of the important fact about our algorithm is that it
   is effective for both spinning motion and orbiting motion, thus unifies
   the treatment of the two kinds of rotational motion. Also by tuning of
   the filters, we can derive the translational motion parameters and the
   rotational motion parameters separately, which has the advantage of
   making motion estimation faster and more robust comparing to estimating
   all of them simultaneously. The algorithm is simulated using synthesized
   image sequences corrupted by noise and shows to be accurate and robust
   against noise and occlusion.}},

Abstract = {{As electro-optic sensors increase in size and frame rate, the data
   transfer and digital processing resource requirements also increase. In
   many missions, the spatial area of interest is but a small fraction of
   the available field of view. Choosing the right region of interest,
   however, is a challenge and still requires an enormous amount of
   downstream digital processing resources. In order to filter this
   ever-increasing amount of data, we look at how nature solves the
   problem. The Advanced Guidance Division of the Munitions Directorate,
   Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNG) at Eglin AFB, Florida, has been
   pursuing research in the area of advanced sensor and image processing
   concepts based on biologically inspired sensory information processing.
   A summary of two ``neuromorphic{''} processing efforts will be presented
   along with a seeker system concept utilizing this innovative technology.
   The Neuroseek program is developing a 256 x 256 2-color dual band IRFPA
   coupled to an optimized silicon CMOS read-out and processing integrated
   circuit that provides simultaneous full-frame imaging in MWIR/LWIR
   wavebands along with built-in biologically inspired sensor image

Abstract = {{Motion control is one of the most critical factors in the design of a
   robot. The purpose of this paper is to describe the research for
   applying motion control principles for a mobile robot systems design,
   which is on going at the University of Cincinnati Robotics Center. The
   mobile robot was constructed during the 1998-1999 academic year, and
   called BEARCAT II. Its design has inherited many features of its
   predecessor, BEARCAT I, such as vision guidance, sonar detection and
   digital control. In addition, BEARCAT II achieved many innovative motion
   control features as rotating sonar, zero turning radius (ZTR), current
   control loop, and multi-level controller design (conventional control
   and fuzzy logic control). This paper will focus on the motion control
   design, development and programming for the vehicle steering control and
   rotating sonar systems. The systems have been constructed and tested at
   the 1999 International Ground Robotics Competition with the Bearcat II
   running an obstacle course for 153.5 feet and finishing fourth in the
   competition. The significance of this work is in the increased
   understanding of robot control and the potential application of
   autonomous guided vehicle technology for industry, defense and medicine.

   analysis in sparkling wines, using a digital video sequence recorded
   when the urine is poured into the glass. The evolution of the foam's
   thickness, the number of bubbles, their size and speed assesses the
   quality of the wine. The bubbles segmentation is carried out by an
   innovative procedure that combines a non-linear image processing
   technique, based on Mathematical Morphology, with a motion estimation
   method based on Block Matching. The result allows us to work with
   adaptive blocks, which not only enhance the estimation and speed up the
   computations, brit also solve occlusions between bubbles. The evolution
   of foam's thickness is measured using linear filters. Experiments on

Abstract = {{In the spring of 1997, the Bern Dibner Library of Science and Technology
   obtained a three-year grant from the Dibner Fund to establish and
   maintain an Information Literacy Center (ILC). The mission of the ILC is
   to enhance the overall learning environment of the University community,
   by utilizing innovative methods to effectively educate and train
   faculty, staff and students concerning new technology. Also, ILC will
   facilitate the University's stated commitment to incorporate new
   technology throughout the curriculum. The Library, in collaboration with
   other University departments, will use digital technology to make
   information more accessible to the university community.
   The goals of the Center include (1) Producing information packages on
   CD-ROM on library use for undergraduates. (2) Creating
   discipline-specific information packages on CD-ROM for graduate
   students, which will be custom generated on demand. (3) Assisting
   faculty in translation of lecture material to CD-ROM and/or mounted on
   library server for distance learning. (4) Mounting reading materials for
   specific academic programs on library server to enhance access. (5)
   Training and supporting faculty and graduate students challenged by new
   information technology. (6) Providing a workplace and access to
   professional expertise to help Polytechnic staff increase their
   productivity and effectiveness through use of computer resources. (7)
   Designing and conducting workshops on the applications and use of the
   new multimedia products, as they become available on the market.
   The Library Instruction Program currently runs fourteen hands-on
   workshops and short classes: seven, on various new technology
   applications, and seven on using the library's electronic resources.
   Numerous new technology software products, CD-ROMs, and educational
   videos were evaluated for inclusion.
   The Information Literacy Center (ILC) was established in the fall of
   1997 to make new technology accessible and useful to the Polytechnic
   community. Today, almost two years later, the Center has proven to be an
   asset to the Dibner Library and Polytechnic University as a whole.}},

Pages = {{67-85}},
Abstract = {{On the face of it, DTV would seem to be a technology for which consumer
   demand is weak at best. As a production, delivery and display
   innovation, its deployment is more obviously driven by a technological
   rather than an audience imperative. The major question hanging over its
   future is how this greatly enhanced distribution system will be supplied
   with programmes. Much of the debate on IDTV so far has concentrated on
   engineering standards, delivery platforms and the impact of competition.
   Major film/TV companies increasingly see the roll-out of DTV in the
   context of a ``windowing{''} strategy, which serves to maximise profits
   by extending market reach overtime as well as across territories. This
   will go some way towards answering the question of where significantly
   large new volumes of programming will be sourced in order to drive a
   ``content is king{''} scenario. But there is the danger, for early
   adopters especially, that disillusionment may set in as the rhetoric of
   abundance, pushed hard by the TV industry for so long, is confronted by
   viewer realisation that ``multiplexing{''} is really synonymous with
   ``repeats,{''} thus elevating the existing problem of viewer resistance
   to repeats in analogue broadcasting to new heights. In Europe, there is
   little doubt that public service broadcasters should play a major role
   in content supply, beacuase of their vast archives of programming and
   their accumulated investment in production infrasctucture. But the
   strengths of both cultural affinities and barriers in existing, analogue
   TV markets must be carefully assessed before we can extrapolate to any
   new digital environment and the role of PSB in it. We must also assess
   the current tensions between public and private TV systems, intensely
   focussed on the European Commission and its relationship with national
   governments since the adoption of the Protocol of the Amsterdam Treaty,
   in particular the guerrilla war being waged against the EBU, the attempt
   to redefine PSB as a set of programming genres, the contention that the
   licence fee is a form of ``state aid{''} and the argument that PSB will
   be competing unfairly with private TV interersts if allowed to develop
   ``new services.{''}}},

Title = {{Application of clinical models in remineralization research}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{74-85}},
Abstract = {{A multitude of clinical approaches have been taken to study the
   mechanism of how caries lesions progress and regress, and to evaluate
   various intervention strategies directed at the prevention of dental
   caries. Model systems can be broadly classified as demineralization
   (caries) models and remineralization models. A demineralization model is
   one in which there is a net loss of mineral over the course of a study
   period. The focus of this review is on the clinical approaches that can
   be considered as remineralization models where there is net gain of
   mineral as an experimental endpoint. usually as a result of a
   therapeutic intervention. The remineralization models are presented in
   two major categories: namely, in vivo models and in situ models. The in
   vivo models involve the use of natural dental tissues as the
   experimental substrate, while the in situ models use pieces of extracted
   teeth as thr hard tissue substrate. The in vivo models are further
   subdivided into short-term clinical trials, and studies with
   experimentally induced caries. The outcome measures used, in
   conventional clinical trials studying remineralization use subjective
   criteria; namely, caries reversals based on visual/ tactile assessment
   for occlusal and smooth surfaces, visual assessment of bitewing
   radiographs for interproximal surfaces, and tactile changes in hardness
   for dentinal lesions. These relatively insensitive methods cannot be
   easily adapted for remineralization studies and are subject to examiner
   error. The use of visual criteria to classify the caries activity status
   of non-cavitated lesions has been proposed, but remains to be validated.
   The limitations of conventional caries detection methods has led to
   increasing interest in developing objective, quantitative approaches for
   assisting in caries diagnosis, and for monitoring changes in caries
   status (mineral loss/mineral gain) over time. Quantitative light-induced
   fluorescence, infrared laser fluorescence, electrical conductivity, and
   digital imaging fiber-optic transillumination are among the most
   promising techniques currently available. The greater sensitivity of
   these quantitative methods permits the detection of lesions at an
   earlier stage than conventional methods. There is now the potential that
   short-term clinical trials may replace conventional caries trials for
   some research applications, once these new approaches have been properly
   validated. In addition to studies evaluating the repair of naturally
   occurring caries, it is possible to experimentally induce incipient
   caries on natural teeth by restricting oral hygiene practice, or by
   using artificial means to eliminate mechanical forces on the tooth
   surface (banding or placing brackets on teeth). In situ models continue
   to be useful approaches to evaluate innovative remineralization
   technology. They have been applied in a wide range of remineralization
   studies, including topical fluoride products, remineralizing solutions,
   dairy products, and chewing gum. Whatever the approach used to study
   remineralization, the ultimate goal of clinical intervention strategies
   is the preservation of tooth structure and the prevention of lesion
   progression to the point where restorative intervention would be
   required. Therefore, the arrestment of caries lesions, as weil as the
   reversal of the caries process, can be considered clinically successful
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The current digital revolution, the fourth information revolution in
   history after the invention of writing, the book and printing, has
   serious potential to exacerbate the gulf between the North and the
   South. As has been observed in the USA, even within an affluent country,
   with inadequate policy interventions, information technology not only
   widens the digital divide but also deepens the racial ravine. The
   implications of the new information and communication technologies
   (ICTs) for science and scholarship and for development are examined. The
   maldistribution of access to ICTs - telephones, computers, networks,
   Internet, bandwidth and electronic journals - is bound to make it even
   more difficult for the developing countries to contribute to, and take
   advantage of, knowledge in the sciences. These countries will get
   further marginalised, As suggested by Brace Alberts, President of the
   National Academy of Sciences, USA, knowledge dissemination structures
   need to be put in place which are not entirely based on commerce.
   Innovative models, such as the community access model of the M.S.
   Swaminathan Research Foundation, which attempts to transform the
   otherwise divisive information technologies into allies in the equity
   movement, can make a difference to the life of the rural poor. The
   Swaminathan model emphasises delivering locale-specific knowledge that
   the people actually need and can use to improve their lot. The model
   follows a bottom-up approach, involving the user community as partners
   right from the beginning, emphasises knowledge delivery and uses
   technology - a hybrid wired and wireless network - only when it is
   necessary to achieve its major goal of knowledge delivery.}},

Abstract = {{For the SLR system to be described, it has been decided to use the
   bistatic approach. The two separate telescopes are spaced by about 2
   meters and are using identical azimuthal mounts. A 130mm diam. lens is
   used for transmitting the laser beam and a 450mm parabolic mirror for
   the receiver. Each telescope is enclosed by an independently driven
   housing isolating it from wind forces as well as environmental
   contamination thus enabling even a use without any dome. The telescopes
   are driven by direct on-axis motors which are controlled by built-in
   digital servo systems. Moving cables are avoided by sliding contacts
   allowing a continuous rotation in both axes without limitation. The
   focal units of each telescope are mounted in separate boxes below the
   platform of the observation building. The transmitter box contains the
   variable beam expander and the receiver box contains the filters
   (spatial and spectral) as well as the photoelectric receivers.}},

Title = {{Modeling the evolution of markets with indirect network externalities:
   An application to digital television}},
Journal = {{MARKETING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{396-416}},
Abstract = {{The usefulness of a technology product for an end-user often depends on
   the availability of complementary software products and services.
   Computers require software, cameras require film, and DVD players
   require movie programming in order for customers to value the whole
   product. This phenomenon, where the demand for hardware products is
   mediated by the supply of complementary software products, is called an
   indirect network externality. Indirect network externalities create a
   two-way contingency between the demand for the hardware product and the
   supply of software products, and result in a strategic interdependence
   between the actions of hardware manufacturers and the actions of
   software providers. Indirect network externalities are gaining economic
   significance in technology markets, because hardware and software are
   typically provided by independent firms, and both sets of firms have an
   incentive to free-ride on each others' demand creation efforts. Despite
   the ubiquity of this phenomenon, it has largely been ignored in the
   marketing science literature.
   We present a conceptual and operational model for the evolution of
   markets with indirect network externalities. The key feature of our
   framework is to model the market-mediated dependence between the actions
   of hardware manufacturers and software complementers, created by the
   direct dependence of consumer demand for the whole product on the
   actions of manufacturers as well as complementors. In addition, we
   incorporate marketing-mix effects on consumer response, as well as
   heterogeneity in consumer preferences for hardware and software
   attributes. We model consumer response using a latent-class choice
   model. To estimate the complementer response functions, we use a
   modified Delphi technique that allows us to convert qualitative response
   data into quantitative response functions. We integrate the consumer and
   complementer response models to create a simulation model that generates
   forecasts of market shares and sales volumes for competing technologies,
   as a function of marketing-mix effects and exogenously specified
   regulatory scenarios.
   The modeling framework is of interest to new product modelers interested
   in creating empirical models and decision-support systems for
   forecasting demand in technology markets characterized by indirect
   network externalities. The decision-support aspects of the modeling
   framework should appeal to managers interested in understanding and
   quantifying the complex interplay between hardware manufacturers and
   software complementers in the evolution of markets with indirect network
   externalities.
   We present an application of the modeling framework to the U.S. digital
   television industry, and use the framework to characterize the
   competition among analog and digital TV technologies. Our results
   suggest that complementer actions play an important role in the
   acceptance of digital TV technologies in general, and high definition
   television (HDTV) in particular. We find that forecasts that ignore the
   influence of indirect network externalities would be seriously biased in
   favor of HDTV. We illustrate how the modeling framework can be used to
   identify and profile customer segments in the digital TV market based on
   their utility for hardware-related features as well as
   programming-related features. We also illustrate the decision-support
   capabilities of the modeling framework by evaluating the sensitivity of
   the forecasts to varying marketing, regulatory, and complementer
   response scenarios. We derive implications for marketing and public
   affairs policies of the hardware manufacturers.
   The developments in the digital TV industry generally support our
   finding that HDTV will be a niche product, and will diffuse slower than
   originally expected due in part to the lack of programming. The delays
   in the introduction of digital TV to the marketplace also suggest that
   most forecasts for infrastructure-intensive technologies like digital TV
   may be too optimistic simply because they underestimate the delays in
   agreeing upon technology standards and resolving regulatory debates.}},

Abstract = {{In today's medical environment, efficiency and accuracy are the keys to
   successful outcomes. This concept is especially applicable during video
   endoscopic imaging, where image clarity is of utmost importance for
   medical applications. One of the most exciting advances in video
   endoscopy is the development of digital image storage devices. We report
   on a fast and efficient way to grab and store images during endoscopic
   procedures, Images can be stored on standard 3.5{''} floppy disks using
   an innovative new digital image recorder. The images are stored as high
   resolution JPEG files (640x480x24) for excellent clarity and detail.
   Once loaded onto the computer or network, the images can be placed into
   electronic medical records, imported into internet web pages,
   incorporated into slide presentations, and most importantly, stored in
   well organized archives which take up a minimum of space and are easily
   accessed by multiple users. This digital image recorder provides a
   complete system for acquiring images on a standard format 3.5{''} floppy
   disk - the worlds most ubiquitous storage format.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents partial results of the technological ACTS project
   S3M(1) (AC313) which provides technological solutions to offer
   multimedia applications and interactive digital television services to
   users living in collective installations. These installations known as
   SMATV (Satellite Master Antenna Television Systems) are a combination of
   typical CATV networks and individual satellite installations. The main
   objective of the above project is to provide innovative solutions for
   the physical and medium access control layers for the interaction
   channel in these kind of collective installations. Additionally the S3M
   project is developing multimedia applications to be run on the mentioned
   infrastructures considering both scenarios of applications Small Office
   Home Office (SoHo) as well as Interactive Digital TV.
   The S3M project have analysed the behaviour of the existing collective
   installations infrastructures (the new and the old installations)
   deriving the transfer functions of these networks and analysing the
   degradation suffered for the interaction channel signal when passing
   through the network and the installed devices. This paper presents the
   results obtained from simulations and measurements performed on these
   kind of networks when typical signals used in the return channel
   characteristics is passed through the network. Several type of
   installations (inductive, resistive, old and new) have been taken into
   account in the computer simulations and in the laboratory tests. The
   simulations and the measurements carried out have allowed to reassess
   the design parameters have been reassessed and has been derived that the
   solutions proposes by S3M project allows that the users living in
   collective installations can enjoy of the new emergent multimedia

Abstract = {{Magneto-optic imaging based upon Faraday rotation of polarized light has
   been successfully applied to the problem of non-destructive testing of
   cracks, stress fractures, corrosion, and other surface and subsurface
   defects in both ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic metal structures. Some of
   these applications have been successfully applied to aircraft fuselage
   and wing structural examination, as well as to the inspection of tanks
   and other low-accessibility containers. There are significant needs and
   opportunities for improving upon the accuracy, sensitivity, portability,
   and automation of such non-destructive evaluation, particularly for
   aircraft which are by virtue of age, design, or condition subject to
   dangerous metal fatigue developments in between scheduled examination.
   There has been a need for improvements in the basic magneto-optic
   sensing technology as well as in the image processing of data gathered
   from the sensors, and in the refinement of crack and corrosion
   recognition algorithms and methods that can enhance automated and
   assisted recognition. The current research and development program in
   non-destructive testing applications at MODIS Corporation has developed
   several innovations within these areas that enable wider application of
   magneto-optic imaging. These include new Fe-Ga based thin-film
   technology resulting in (R, Bi)(3)(Fe, Ga)(5)O-12 wafers that are
   demonstrably more sensitive to low-strength magnetic fields. These films
   contain (Y, Lu, Bi)(3), (Fe, Ga)(5), O-12 composition, grown on a
   transparent single-crystalline substrate of Gd-3 Ga-5 O-12 composition.
   Other more sensitive films and substrates have been developed as well.
   These films have uniaxial anisotropy due to (111) crystallographic
   orientation, although with (100) orientation films can be customized for
   more spatial resolution and sensitivity due to the almost uniformly
   planar anisotropy. The MODE (Magneto-Optic Detection and Encoding)
   sensor technology is incorporated into a modular scanning apparatus that
   enables the operation of several modes of inspection using replaceable
   video or digital still camera devices as well as variable optics for
   magnification. Instead of relying upon traditional eddy current
   technology for introducing measurable magnetic fields in the sample
   object being examined, the MODIS apparatus operates with a high-current
   (1-5 kA), micro-burst (< 0.5 ms) application to the test surface. The
   sensitivity of the MODE Fe-Ga wafers has been demonstrated in laboratory
   experiments to operate with magnetic fields that are weaker than those
   produced by long-duration high-current eddy currents such as are
   presently being used in NDT applications. The coupling of higher
   magneto-optic sensitivity pins a reduction in the eddy current
   generation and heat dissipation opens a path to a number of variations
   and extensions of magneto-optic NDT. Algorithms and software developed
   by MODIS and pacers for processing and analysis of the scanner output
   images reside on a Windows 95/NT computer and are compatible with
   body-wearable PC systems to enable completely hands-free, mobile
   inspection and data collection The recognition algorithms are based upon
   standard digital image processing and neural network pattern recognition
   that has been successfully applied in other applications.}},

Abstract = {{A high resolution underwater imaging system using sparse array
   technology has been developed and tested in turbid waters around
   Australia. High resolution three dimensional imaging implies many
   voxels. The present system can image 10(3)x10(3)x4x10(3) voxels although
   faster images can be obtained by zooming to a smaller volume of
   interest. With three dimensional images, precise dimensions of complex
   shapes such as pipe joints can be obtained. Potential applications in
   offshore platform inspection are discussed.
   The longer wavelengths of Megahertz acoustic signals produces less
   scattering than light while array technology allows the imager to take
   advantage of pulsed ensonification to further reduce backscatter fogging
   of the image. The advantage of acoustics is most pronounced in very
   turbid waters.
   The megahertz frequencies allow millimeter resolution with array sizes
   compatible with ROVs. Digitization takes place on the acoustics tile
   that make up the array and the signals are then passed by fiber optical
   cable to the above surface processor to reduce the volume and underwater
   weight of the system.
   There are a number of obstacles to producing an innovation in underwater
   imaging. Worries about adequate coherence lengths to support arrays
   capable of adequate resolution were found to be groundless. One
   impediment to success was the computing loads implied by multi-element
   arrays and large voxel numbers. To attack this problem international
   groups were funded to provide potential solutions and a decreasingly
   smaller number of groups supported at each review point. This technique
   has produced a lower cost approach for the underwater acoustic camera
   design.}},

Abstract = {{One of the objectives of surface metrology is to obtain a better and
   faster assessment of the micro- or nanogeometry of component surfaces.
   In this way the innovative concept of the profiler is changing towards
   non-contact modular computer-controlled systems for measuring and
   analyzing shape and texture of a surface. In this paper we present a new
   instrument which is based on the concept of confocal microscopy. In this
   instrument (which may be used for measurements on smooth and rough
   surfaces) a pattern of slits is imaged by a very high numerical aperture
   optical system on the surface of the sample to be measured. The
   reflected or diffused light is observed with a CCD array and analyzed
   with different digital image processing algorithms. In addition to the
   replacement of the existing stylus systems there are also important new
   potential applications for this type of instrument. We present the
   results obtained in micro- or nanomeasurements of high precision optical
   surfaces, texture assessment of non-homogeneous liquid depositions and
   metrology of microstructures such as master gratings and certified
   calibration standards. The obtained results show that the confocal
   profiler is robust enough to provide a surface topography with spatial
   resolution lower than 0.5 mu m and uncertainty of about 10 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Smoke/obscurant testing requires that 2-dimensional cloud extent be
   extracted from visible and thermal imagery. These data are used alone or
   in combination with 2-dimensional data from other aspects to make
   3-dimensional calculations of cloud properties, including dimensions,
   volume, centroid, travel, and uniformity. Determining cloud extent from
   imagery has historically been a time-consuming manual process. To reduce
   time and cost associated with smoke/obscurant data processing, automated
   methods to extract cloud extent from imagery were investigated. The
   TRACE system described in this paper was developed and implemented at
   U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), UT by the Science and Technology
   Corporation (STC) - Acuity Imaging Incorporated (AI) team with Small
   Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding. TRACE uses dynamic
   background subtraction and 3-dimensional fast Fourier transforms (FFT)
   as primary methods to discriminate the smoke/obscurant cloud from the
   background. TRACE has been designed to run on a PC-based platform using
   Windows. The PC-Windows environment was chosen for portability, to give
   TRACE the maximum flexibility in terms of its interaction with
   peripheral hardware devices such as video capture boards, removable
   media drives, network cards, and digital video interfaces. Video for
   Windows provides all of the necessary tools for the development of the
   video capture utility in TRACE and allows for interchangeability of
   video capture boards without any software changes. TRACE is designed to
   take advantage of future upgrades in all aspects of its component
   hardware. A comparison of cloud extent determined by TRACE with manual
   methods is included in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past three decades, great strides have been made toward
   real-time characterization of deep-sea sediments. Significant
   improvements in core quality and recovery related to the development of
   the DSDP hydraulic piston corer (HPC) and the DSDP/ODP advanced piston
   corer (APC) paved the way for the evolution of noninvasive measurement
   systems. Non-invasive techniques provide cost-effective use of otherwise
   expensive sea time, and leave sediments undisturbed for additional
   post-cruise study. These methods revolutionize our ability to
   characterize sediment properties. Suddenly, it has become possible to
   correlate at high resolution between geographically separated sites, and
   develop detailed proxies of physical, geochemical, and environmental
   processes. While previous generations of scientists were forced to
   extrapolate using low resolution data of variable quality, today we have
   a growing abundance of high-quality, closely-spaced, co-located
   measurements that can be applied in many ways. Data types now routinely
   available include: gamma-ray attenuation density, acoustic properties,
   magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma emissions, diffuse spectral
   reflectance and sediment resistivity. Non-invasive measurements allow
   shipboard scientists to document full recovery of sediment sequences
   recovered by drillship. This enables correlation among piston cores,
   mapping of downhole variability, development of detailed age models, and
   characterization of sediment mineralogy as well as physical and optical
   properties at centimeter to decimeter scale. Composite stratigraphic
   sections, created by matching variations in sediment properties from
   multiple holes at a given site, can be combined with age information to
   transform depth profiles into time series useful for spectral analyses.
   These composite sections are also useful for developing synthetic
   seismograms to integrate coring results with regionally extensive
   geophysical data. This suite of accomplishments make these methodologies
   among the tools of choice for characterizing sub-Milankovitch and
   Millennial-scale climatic variability.
   Future objectives related to the evolution of these methods should focus
   on improved calibration and intercalibration protocols for existing
   systems and the deployment of innovative new measurement techniques.
   Many of the new techniques on the horizon will improve our ability to
   image sediment in two or three dimensions. Important advancements will
   include the deployment of a variety of digital cameras for archiving
   visual information, confocal laser macroscopes for studies of sediment
   microfabric, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for estimating
   porosity in volume or cross sectional view. and a new generation of
   X-ray methods (Scanning XRF and CT-Scan) for elemental estimation and
   characterization of density variations related to ice-rafted debris
   (IRD), bioturbation and compositional changes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews empirical evidence on how telecommunications
   technologies affect the context of work and organizations at the
   individual, group, organizational, and inter-organizational level of
   analysis. Telecommunications is defined broadly to include both networks
   themselves and applications that enable not only computer-mediated
   communication but also digital transactions. Because digital
   telecommunications is an emergent phenomena, our knowledge of its
   implications for work is sparse. Despite this lack of evidence, numerous
   claims are made in the literature. Telecommunications are depicted as
   freeing the work of individuals and organizations from the constraints
   of time and space. In addition, telecommunications are said to
   facilitate market coordination and cause greater interdependence among
   organizations. In general, predictions of the effects of
   telecommunications neglect intervening variables and are overly
   deterministic. We evaluate the claims that have been made about
   telecommunications technology in light of the available evidence and
   conclude with suggestions for further research.}},

Abstract = {{During the 1997 processing tomato season, a number of weed management
   trials were conducted in the Northern San Joaquin Valley of California,
   covering both preemergence and postemergence treatments for control of
   Solanum and other weed species. Herbicides evaluated for preemergence
   weed control included metam-sodium at 54 kg/ha, rimsulfuron (0.018 to
   0.035 kg/ha), dimethenamid (0.42 to 0.84 kg/ha), napropamide (2.24
   kg/ha), metolachlor (2.80 kg/ha), pebulate (6.72 kg/ha), trifluralin
   (0.56 kg/ha) and FOE-5043 (1.01 kg/ha). Materials tested for
   postemergence weed management were rimsulfuron at 0.018 to 0.035 kg/ha
   and metribuzin at 0.14 and 0.28 kg/ha. All trials had four replications
   using a randomized complete block design. With exception of
   metam-sodium, all others herbicides were applied with a CO2 backpack
   sprayer in a spray volume of 280 l/ha.
   In a combination preemergence/postemergence study near Brentwood, CA,
   one-half of the trial area was treated with metham-sodium, as a
   subsurface layered treatment, 12 days before field seeding and the
   remaining trial area was not, after field planting, other preemergence
   herbicides were applied to the surface of the tomato beds and sprinkler
   incorporated with 1.9 cm of water. Postemergence applications of
   rimsulfuron plus crop oil concentrate (COC) and metribuzin alone were
   made over some of the metam-sodium treatments three and one half weeks
   later. Excellent control of black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) and
   hairy nightshade (Solanum sarrachoides Sentner) occurred with
   preemergence combinations of metam-sodium plus rimsulfuron, rimsulfuron
   plus dimethenamid, rimsulfuron plus napropamide, and rimsulfuron used
   alone. Postemergence applications of rimsulfuron plus COC were also very
   effective. None of the treatments were effective on seedling field
   bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.). The combination preemergence
   treatments of rimsulfuron plus dimethenamid caused a temporary reduction
   in crop growth. All treatments gave greater yields than the untreated
   control, led by the preemergence treatment of rimsulfuron, alone at
   0.026 kg/ha, giving 143.5 MT/ha.
   A pre-transplant mechanically incorporated weed control experiment near
   Tracy, CA evaluated six herbicides and/or combination treatments for
   control of black and hairy nightshade, common fiddleneck (Amsinckia
   intermedia Fisch, and Mey.), and shepherdspurse (Capsella bursa-pastoris
   L.). After the treatments were applied to the bare tomato beds soil
   incorporation was accomplished using a Performer tiller pulled by a
   Challenger tractor, a new innovation. The field was transplanted the
   following day with a furrow irrigation applied 24 hours later. Best
   control of all weed species present occurred with rimsulfuron at 0.035
   kg/ha. All treatments showed excellent crop safety and outyielded the
   untreated control, led by rimsulfuron at 117.7 MT/ha. The same
   herbicides were evaluated in a layby incorporated trial on a direct
   seeded tomato field, northwest of Tracy, CA, when the crop was 15 to 20
   cm tall. Applications were made as directed sprays and then soil
   incorporated 7.6 cm deep with a conventional power driven rotary tiller.
   Best control of hairy nightshade, barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli
   L.), and smooth crabgrass (Digitaria ischaemum Schreb. Ex Muhl) was
   achieved by rimsulfuron at 0.035 kg/ha, followed closely be dimethenamid
   at 0.84 kg/ha. Both of these treatments also produced the highest yields
   (99.2 MT/ha and 95.2 MT/ha, respectively). All treatments exhibited
   excellent crop safety and outyielded the untreated control.
   A postemergence weed control trial south of Banta, CA, evaluated rates
   of rimsulfuron with four different adjuvants (X-77, crop oil concentrate
   (COC), SCOIL, and SILWET) and metribuzin, alone and in combination with
   rimsulfuron plus COG. Applications were made over the tomatoes and black
   nightshade when they were at the cotyledon to first true leaf stage of
   growth. Weed control was excellent with all treatments except metribuzin
   alone. Minor growth suppression increased with all adjuvants as the rate
   of rimsulfuron increased from 0.018 to 0.035 kg/ha; SILWET showed more
   injury than the other adjuvants. At harvest there was no significant
   difference in yield with any of the treatments, including the untreated
   control.}},

Abstract = {{On September 18, 1997, Honeywell Technology Center (HTC) successfully
   completed a three-week flight test of its rotor acoustic monitoring
   system (RAMS) at Patuxent River Flight Test Center. This flight test was
   the culmination of an ambitious 38-month proof-of-concept effort
   directed at demonstrating the feasibility of detecting crack propagation
   in helicopter rotor components. The program was funded as part of the
   U.S. Navy's Air Vehicle Diagnostic Systems (AVDS) program.
   Reductions in Navy maintenance budgets and available personnel have
   dictated the need to transition from time-based to ``condition-based{''}
   maintenance. Achieving this will require new enabling diagnostic
   technologies. The application of acoustic emission for the early
   detection of helicopter rotor head dynamic component faults has proven
   the feasibility of the technology. The flight-test results demonstrated
   that stress-wave acoustic emission technology can detect signals
   equivalent to small fatigue cracks in rotor head components and can do
   so across the rotating articulated rotor head joints and in the presence
   of other background acoustic noise generated during flight operation.
   During the RAMS flight test, 12 test flights were flown from which 25
   Gbyte of digital acoustic data and about 15 hours of analog flight data
   recorder (FDR) data were collected from the eight on-rotor acoustic
   sensors, The focus of this paper is to describe the CH-46 flight-test
   configuration and present design detail:; about a new innovative
   machinery diagnostic technology called acoustic fault injection. This
   technology involves the injection of acoustic sound into machinery to
   assess health and characterize operational status. The paper will also
   address the development of the Acoustic Fault Injection Tool (AFIT),
   which was successfully demonstrated during the CH-46 flight tests.}},

Abstract = {{The Army has defined a vision for Army Aviation that generates a new
   Digital Aviation Logistics (DAL) infrastructure and maintenance concept,
   which fully utilizes the potential of future systems to reduce
   operations and support (O\&S) costs and improve readiness. The vision
   will take advantage of on-board Health and Usage Monitoring Systems
   (HUMS) and automated diagnostics/fault detection to perform
   condition-based maintenance to reduce costs and increase availability.
   The envisioned systems will put information interactively in the hands
   of all aviation maintainers and users, from the flight line to the
   factory. The aircraft in the future will perform condition monitoring
   and report status to the operations center and maintenance personnel.
   On-board diagnostic systems and portable expert-based testers will
   isolate aircraft faults. Structural Usage Monitoring Systems (SUMS) will
   permit on-condition monitoring of life-limited components and will
   prevent premature retirement of components, thereby, reducing costs by
   replacing parts only when necessary. To make the vision a reality, there
   are numerous technology challenges to overcome.}},

Abstract = {{On September 18, 1997, Honeywell Technology Center(HTC) successfully
   completed a three week night test of its rotor acoustic monitoring
   system (RAMS) at Patuxent River Flight Test Center. This flight test was
   the culmination of an ambitious, 38-month, proof-of-concept effort
   directed at demonstrating the feasibility of detecting crack propagation
   in helicopter rotor components. This program was funded as a part of the
   US Navy's Advanced Vehicle Diagnostic System (AVDS) program.
   Reductions in Navy maintenance budgets and available personnel have
   dictated the need to transition from time-based to ``condition-based''
   maintenance. To achieve this requires new enabling diagnostic
   technologies. The application of acoustic emission for the early
   detection of dynamic helicopter rotor head component faults is just such
   a proven enabling technology. The night test results demonstrated that
   stress-wave acoustic emission technology can detect signals equivalent
   to small fatigue cracks in rotor head components and can do so across
   the rotating articulated rotor head joints and in the presence of other
   background acoustic noise generated during flight operation. During the
   RAMS night test, 12 test nights were flown from which 25 Gbytes of
   digital acoustic data and about 15 hours of analog flight data recorder
   (FDR) data were collected from the right on-rotor acoustic sensors, The
   focus of this paper is to overview the CH-46 night test configuration.
   and present design details about a new innovative machinery diagnostic
   technology, called acoustic fault injection.}},

   that control the device output, power consumption, and diagnostic
   configuration. Tests measuring operating speed, RIIC functionality and
   D/A converter performance were completed. At 2.1 x 2.3 cm, this die is
   also the largest non-stitched device ever made by Indigo's foundry,

Abstract = {{We describe a novel three-beam confocal laser Doppler microscope (CLDM)
   which allows 2D microscopic velocity flow measurements and utilises the
   benefits of both the Doppler mode of contrast formation and the high
   lateral and axial resolution imaging capability of confocal microscopy.
   This is accomplished by a microscope objective focusing three laser
   beams to produce a `probe volume' within a specimen, rather than the
   traditional two input beams. The specimen is mounted on a scanning
   stage, which enables the final image to be constructed point by point.
   The two dimensional velocity information of the particles within this
   probe volume are `encoded' into the beat frequencies of the back
   scattered light. By using digital filtering to deinterlace the
   individual signals and computer reconstruction techniques, `velocity
   images' will be formed. These velocity images, produced solely by
   Doppler scattering of light from moving particles, displays the flow
   distribution within some defined area. Our goal is to eventually produce
   a full three dimensional velocity volume of a biological cell, which
   would truly be a significant innovation in microscopy.
   We demonstrate an experimental optical device capable of forming the
   required three independent fringe fields inside the probe volume,
   examine this probe volume from a theoretical basis and perform an
   analysis of the scattered light frequencies. Preliminary experimental
   results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry is an approach to land-use which offers much promise in
   addressing many of the inter-related problems associated with rural
   development and land degradation (Scherr, 1992; Nair, 1993). This
   research incorporates remotely sensed agroforestry landscape information
   within a computerized model that relates spatial structure at the field
   and landscape scale to maize production. Remote sensing, cartographic
   modeling as well as landscape ecological theory and methods of analysis
   figure prominently in the work. The study area is in the coffee zone on
   the southern footslopes of Mount Kenya. The research tests the
   hypotheses that: there is a correlation between landscape, field
   structure and crop production. Specifically, it is hypothesized that
   spatial configuration at the field scale, (e.g. patch size, shape and
   adjacency relationships etc.) as well as at the landscape scale (density
   of trees and hedgerows) can be significantly correlated with
   productivity. The central hypothesis is that spatial variability across
   the landscape, at scales both at and beyond that of the field, can
   explain a significant amount of the variability in yields. In order to
   carry out the work, a recent innovation in remote sensing, the Compact
   Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), has been used in the project. The
   CASI was used to acquire a detailed digital image of the site at a high
   spatial resolution (1.75 m pixel size). Six spectrally narrow width
   bands were acquired with the purpose of determining chlorophyll density
   as well as crop type and vigor. Findings indicate that the spatial
   measures that were undertaken at the landscape scale do not explain
   enough crop variability to be statistically significant. Rather, it is
   far better explained at the individual field level. Here it was
   demonstrated that the distance from shelter plantings is inversely and
   curvilinearly related to crop vigor as measured by the relationship
   between the Near Infra Red and Red wavelengths. Findings indicate that
   the positive effects of trees in the study landscape are limited to
   within 25 m of the canopy and may increase production as much as 32\% at
   the optimal distance. An optimum hedgerow inter-distance of 40 m is
   suggested in order to maximize crop vigor. The impact of both the
   existing conditions as well as two possible alternatives are evaluated
   for their total landscape wide impacts on maize yields and wood
   production. It was determined that removal of the existing hedgerows
   (50\% of all the trees in the area) by a disturbance such as a pest
   outbreak would cause a 5\% reduction in maize production. A second
   alternative, which identified under-utilized planting niches throughout
   the landscape, is predicted to result in a modest increase in maize
   production and a doubling of wood products. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a
   semiautomated computer-vision system to quantify the percentage of voids
   in mineral aggregates (VMA\%) of bituminous mixtures. The system used a
   hybrid procedure which utilized a digital image analysis scheme and a
   planimeter surveying instrument. Thirty-nine Marshall specimens were
   prepared using limestone and gravel aggregates. Values of VMA\% were
   obtained using the ASTM conventional procedure and the computer-vision
   procedure. To compute VMA\% using the computer-vision procedure, normal
   case photography with uniform scale images was used to map horizontal
   and vertical cross sections of Marshall specimens. Image domain
   measurements were corrected for distortion. Spatial filters and image
   processing operations were used to enhance the aggregate edges.
   Experimental results showed slight variations between VMA\% computed
   using conventional and the computer-vision procedures. The average
   differences of VMA\% between conventional and the computer-vision
   procedures were 0.81\% and 0.006\% for gravel and limestone specimens,
   respectively. Measurements of VMA\% for limestone mixtures were more
   precise than those for gravel mixtures because of the angular edge shape
   of limestone particles. Variations in VMA\% were due to the anisotropic
   properties of asphalt mixtures, aggregate distribution in the asphalt
   mixture, and different shapes of aggregates. Using the
   computer-vision-based technique, VMA\% of horizontal and vertical cross
   sections were 50\% consistent. The existence of fine aggregate in the
   asphalt mixture affected the accuracy potential of the developed system
   because a low-resolution camera was used. Increasing the camera
   resolution and automating the area computation of aggregate are expected
   to enhance the potential accuracy of the procedure. The proposed method
   for VMA quantification is anticipated to improve field quality control
   of hot-mix asphalt (HMA). The use of computer-vision technology with
   bituminous mixtures can open the doors to a wide variety of
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Along with the dramatic transformation of society, the environment
   surrounding education has also undergone profound changes. People have
   increasingly diversified expectations as to the role that universities
   should play in society. In response to these various demands, a wide
   range of innovative new trials have been launched, exploiting the
   dramatic advances in multimedia communications technology. Focusing on
   education-related applications, this paper investigates the network
   configuration and qualitative aspects of the type of comprehensive
   network systems that we anticipate will be deployed on university
   campuses in the near future. First, we consider the range of diverse
   potential applications for multimedia communications technologies on
   college campuses. Then we present the concept of a hierarchical
   structure for a network system that effectively meets these needs. Next,
   we describe an all-digital bi-directional communications system that, by
   combining digital satellite and landline circuits, could effectively
   support a host of learning applications, such as remote lectures and
   home learning. The structure of the system is described in detail.
   Quality-related issues related to use as a system for educational
   purposes are highlighted from the standpoint of the hierarchical
   structure and interconnectivity is clarified. Finally, we present an
   overview of field trials that were conducted as part of a cooperative
   project between Tokai University and NTI: Some findings and evaluation
   results are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the network
   system and also highlight issues that must be addressed in the future.

Abstract = {{The paper develops an open-loop digital receiver suitable for operation
   with frequency flat-fading channels disturbed bg fast-fading conditions
   and large carrier phase variations. The receiver consists of a bank of
   ``matched{''} stochastic nonlinear filters (NLF's) and a maximum a
   posteriori probability (MAP) decision processor driven by the filters'
   innovations processes. This structure is able to perform
   symbol-by-symbol detection while keeping track of multiplicative
   distortion (carrier amplitude and phase) within the symbol interval.
   The NLF propagates probability densities represented as products of
   Tikhonov and Gaussian functions, whose parameters are computed according
   to a minimum Kullback distance criterion, i.e., we adopt an information
   preserving strategy, This filter is hangup free and outperforms the
   extended Kalman-Bucy filter (EKBF), especially in terms of phase
   acquisition. These characteristics explain why the NLF-based receiver
   mag exhibit much lower error probabilities than those obtained with an
   equivalent EKBF-based receiver.
   Simulations show that the proposed detection/estimation scheme is robust
   against mistuning of receiver parameters, being appropriate for
   all-digital modems in mobile radio communications.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated low voltage RF receiver for digital satellite radio is
   presented. It contains all the basic building blocks from the low noise
   amplifier (LNA) to the baseband buffer and two phase-locked loops
   (PLL's) which provide the RF and the intermediate frequency (IF) local
   oscillator signals. Innovative solutions for critical blocks such as the
   LNA, the IF buffer, the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), etc., as
   well as new arrangements for bias circuits have been adopted which
   greatly increase circuit performance. Moreover, 2.4-V regulated power
   supplies with power down capability have also been included. The
   receiver needs a small number of external components that are
   principally the RF image filter and the surface acoustic ware (SAW)
   channel filter. It achieves a maximum gain of 120 dB and a noise figure
   of 5 dB, The internal regulators are set to 2.4 V and ensure correct
   operation with an external power supply varying from 2.7 to 5.5 V. The
   receiver was integrated in a highperformance 20-GHz silicon bipolar
   technology. Its die size is 18 mm(2) and it needs a quiescent current of

Abstract = {{The present study demonstrates the possibility of manufacturing
   polyurethane {[}ChronoFlex(R) (CF)] nerve guidance channels (NGCs)
   featuring a highly smooth internal surface. Comparative SEM and AFM
   observations prove marked differences between the internal surface
   microgeometry of Silastic and CF channels. SEM of CF samples shows a
   surface with no detectable roughness, while Silastic channels show
   transversal rows along the entire surface. AFM digital image of Silastic
   samples show a surface with a rough microgeometry defined by a
   tridimensional pattern with peaks up to 1400 nm. AFM digital image of CF
   samples show, indeed, an essentially flat microgeometry with the highest
   level at 545 nm. These preliminary results suggest that the association
   of an innovative sequential deposition manufacturing technique with the
   new CF polyurethane may produce NGCs with a smoother surface
   microgeometry, in comparison to NGCs obtained from commercial Silastic
   tubes. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two Earth-orbiting radar missions are planned for the near future by
   NASA - Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and LightSAR. The SRTM
   will fly aboard the Shuttle using interferometric synthetic aperture
   radar (IFSAR) to provide a global digital elevation map. SRTM is jointly
   sponsored by NASA and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA).
   The LightSAR will utilize emerging technology to reduce mass and
   life-cycle costs for a mission to acquire SAR data for Earth science and
   civilian applications and to establish commercial utility. LightSAR is
   sponsored by NASA and industry partners.
   The use of IFSAR to measure elevation is one of the most powerful and
   practical applications of radar. A properly equipped spaceborne IFSAR
   system can produce a highly accurate global digital elevation map,
   including cloud-covered areas, in significantly less time and at
   significantly lower cost than other systems. For accurate topography
   over a large area, the interferometric measurements can be performed
   simultaneously in physically separate receive systems. The Spaceborne
   Imaging Radar C (SIR-C), successfully flown twice in 1994 aboard the
   Space Shuttle Endeavour, offers a unique opportunity for global
   multifrequency elevation mapping by the year 2000. The addition of a
   C-band receive antenna of approximately 60 m length, extended from the
   Shuttle bay on a mast, and operating in concert with the existing SIR-C
   antenna, produces an interferometric pair. It is estimated that the 90\%
   linear absolute elevation error achievable is less than 16 meters for
   elevation postings of 30 meters. The SRTM will be the first single-pass
   spaceborne IFSAR instrument and will produce a near-global
   high-resolution digital topography data set.
   Since LightSAR offers important benefits to both the science community
   and US industry, an innovative government-industry teaming approach is
   being explored, with industry sharing the cost of developing LightSAR in
   return for commercial rights to its data and operational responsibility.
   LightSAR will enable mapping of surface change. The instrument's
   high-resolution mapping, along with its quad polarization, dual
   polarization, interferometric and ScanSAR modes will enable continuous
   monitoring of natural hazards, Earth's surface deformation, surface
   vegetation change, and ocean mesoscale features to provide commercially
   viable and scientifically valuable data products. Advanced
   microelectronics and lightweight materials will increase LightSAR's
   functionality without increasing the mass. Dual frequency L/X-band
   designs have been examined.}},

Abstract = {{Translation functions in high-speed communications networks such as
   Internet protocol and asynchronous transfer mode are requiring larger
   and faster lookup tables, Content addressable memories (CAM's) provide
   built-in hardware lookup capability with high speed and high flexibility
   in address allocation. Previous high-capacity CAM's have been inadequate
   for emerging applications; comparators are time-shared among multiple
   bits or multiple words, resulting in serialized operation. Fully
   parallel architectures represent the best solution for highspeed
   operation, but previous fully parallel CAM's have lacked the capacity
   required for leading-edge networking applications. This paper describes
   a fully parallel (single-clock-cycle) CAM chip. The chip uses a 0.35-mu
   m digital CMOS technology to achieve 2.5 Mb of CAM storage and 30-MHz
   operating frequency, Innovative layout techniques are used to achieve
   two-dimensional decoding, a traditional problem with high-capacity
   CAM's. Architecture and operation of the chip are described, including a
   novel NAND match architecture, operation-specific: self-timing loops,
   and on-board cascade management circuits. The chip functions at 31 MHz,
   with a search access time of 26 ns and an average search power
   dissipation of 5.2 W at 25 MHz.}},

   Institute (ETSI), UMTS is a set of standards aimed at the global market.
   It will be a real third-generation global system for mobile
   communications, adding new features and introducing relevant
   technological innovations while evolving from both a global system for
   mobile communications (GSM) and integrated services digital networks
   (ISDN's), UMTS standardization is a market-driven process, and UMT
   standards are based on the carefully selected market requirements
   developed in close cooperation with the UMTS Forum and GSM Memorandum of
   Understanding Association (MoU). UMTS belongs to the IMT-2000 family
   and, while supporting existing services, will be capable of offering new
   and revolutionary services including multimedia and access to the
   Internet, offering a speed of 2 Mb/s for a single user at a radio-access

Abstract = {{There has been considerable interest over the last decade in the
   detection of digital coherent lightwave signals corrupted by phase
   noise. However, the majority of the work has been in the performance
   analysis of various modulation schemes. In addition, the receivers
   studied have, in general, been zero-phase noise optimal or ad hoc
   modifications of these. In this paper, we consider the design problem of
   constructing optimal receivers for systems using frequency shift keying
   (FSK), Using the innovations approach, we show the format of the optimal
   receiver and use a small phase noise approximation to derive suboptimal
   receivers. Also, receivers based on optimum linear filters are also
   derived. Both receivers are analyzed by simulation and performance
   improvements over the standard receivers are shown. Furthermore, the
   receivers developed can equally well be used to further improve the
   performance of other detection schemes such as postdetection filtering
   and time diversity, The methodology is also used to derive equivalent
   receivers for systems using on-off keying (OOK).}},

Abstract = {{Laser dismantling has been investigated for many years in several
   laboratories including the Photonics Systems Laboratory. However, until
   recently, material processing with high-power laser beams was not
   seriously considered as an acceptable alternative for nuclear power
   plant dismantling. Our laser dismantling approach associates optical
   technologies and target plasma modelization and control. In previous
   papers, we have reported on innovative digital diffractive engineering
   used for adapted light concentration. In this paper we introduce the
   plasma modelisation and control for which laser cutting at long distance
   without assist gas is now possible. We discuss the basic model that we
   have taken into account and we describe the mechanisms of laser material
   interaction with plasma formation that we have to deal with to optimise
   a laser dismantling process. We conclude with a discussion of optimized
   laser parameters to be used for efficient laser dismantling. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the antiplane wave propagation in a 2D
   heterogeneous dissipative medium with complex layer interfaces and
   irregular topography. The initial boundary value problem which
   represents the viscoelastic dynamics driving 2D antiplane wave
   propagation is formulated. The discretization scheme is based on the
   finite-difference technique. Our approach presents some innovative
   features. First, the introduction of the forcing term into the equation
   of motion offers the advantage of an easier handling of different inputs
   such as general functions of spatial coordinates and time. Second, in
   the case of a straight-line source, the symmetry of the incident plane
   wave allows us to solve the problem of oblique incidence simply by
   rotating the D model. This artifice reduces the oblique incidence to the
   vertical one. Third, the conventional rheological model of the
   generalized Maxwell body has been extended to include the stress-free
   boundary condition. For this reason we solve explicitly the stress-free
   boundary condition, not following the most popular technique called
   vacuum formalism. Finally, our numerical code has been constructed to
   model the seismic response of complex geological structures: real
   geological interfaces are automatically digitized and easily introduced
   in the input model. Three numerical applications are discussed. To
   validate our numerical model, the first test compares the results of our
   code with others shown in the literature. The second application rotates
   the input model to simulate the oblique incidence. The third one deals
   with a real high-complexity 2D geological structure.}},

Abstract = {{A motion control problem for electric drives and servo-systems actuated
   by permanent-magnet synchronous motors is studied. Using a complete
   nonlinear model in machine variables and applying the offered nonlinear
   mapping control framework, an innovative synthesis procedure is
   introduced to design the robust bounded controllers to ensure precise
   tracking and disturbance rejection. These control algorithms are
   different compare to existing structures, and the synthesized new class
   of nonlinear controllers maps the error vector and state variables.
   Compared with commonly used algorithms, the dynamic performance is
   improved and robustness is guaranteed due to nonlinear feedback. The
   admissibility concept is employed because control bounds are imposed. It
   is shown that the robust tracking is ensured, stability and disturbance
   attenuation are guaranteed in the specified state-output and state-error
   sets for admissible disturbances, reference inputs, and parameter
   variations. Experimental verification of the developed control framework
   and digital implementation of the synthesized innovative controllers
   have a significant merit. This paper reports application features. The
   thorough researched innovative concept in motion control of
   permanent-magnet synchronous motors together with commercially available
   advanced hardware are applied, and experiments are performed to validate
   the results. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background New policy options are emerging in the debate regarding the
   regulation of firearms in the United States. These options include the
   treatment of firearms as consumer products, the design of which can be
   regulated for safety; denial of gun ownership to those convicted of
   misdemeanors; and strategies to curtail the illegal sale of guns. The
   public's opinion of these innovative gun-policy options has not been
   thoroughly assessed.
   Methods We conducted two telephone surveys of 1200 adults each in the
   United States in 1996 and 1997-1998. Cognitive interviews and pretests
   were used in the development of the survey instruments. Potential
   participants were then contacted by random-digit dialing of telephone
   numbers.
   Results A majority of the respondents favored safety standards for new
   handguns. These standards included childproofing (favored by 88 percent
   of respondents), personalization (devices that permit firing only by an
   authorized person; 71 percent), magazine safeties (devices that prevent
   firing after the magazine or clip is removed; 82 percent), and
   loaded-chamber indicators (devices that show whether the handgun is
   loaded; 73 percent). There was strong support for policies prohibiting
   persons convicted of specific misdemeanors from purchasing a firearm.
   Support for such prohibitions was strongest for crimes involving
   violence or the illegal use of a firearm (83 to 95 percent) or substance
   abuse (71 to 92 percent). There was also widespread support for policies
   designed to reduce the illegal sale of guns, such as mandatory
   tamper-resistant serial numbers (90 percent), a limit of one handgun
   purchase per customer per month (81 percent), and mandatory registration
   of handguns (82 percent). Even among the subgroup of respondents who
   were gun owners, a majority were in favor of stricter gun regulations
   with regard to 20 of the 22 proposals covered in the poll.
   Conclusions Strong public support, even among gun owners, for innovative
   strategies to regulate firearms suggests that these proposals warrant
   serious consideration by policy makers. (N Engl J Med 1998; 339:813-8.)

Abstract = {{An innovative acoustic noise canceling method using adaptive Wiener
   filtering (AWF) was developed for improved acquisition of distortion
   product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The system used one microphone
   placed in the test ear for the primary signal. Noise reference signals
   were obtained from three different sources: (a) pre-stimulus response
   from the test ear microphone, (b) post-stimulus response from a
   microphone placed near the head of the subject and (c) poststimulus
   response obtained from a microphone placed in the subject's nontest ear.
   In order to improve spectral estimation, block averaging of a different
   number of single sweep responses was used. DPOAE data were obtained from
   11 ears of healthy newborns in a well-baby nursery of a hospital under
   typical noise conditions. Simultaneously obtained recordings from all
   three microphones were digitized, stored and processed off-line to
   evaluate the effects of AWF with respect to DPOAE detection and
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement. Results show that compared to
   standard DPOAE processing, AWF improved signal detection and improved
   SNR. (C) 1998 Biomedical Engineering Society.}},

Abstract = {{This article's concern is with discourses of innovation, and it makes
   some instructive connections between technoromanticist discourses across
   two ``revolutions{''}: the industrial revolution at the dawn of the 19th
   century and the information revolution at the close of the 20th century.
   Ifs central question is this: Given the proliferation of futurist and
   neophilic rhetoric about the ``digital revolution{''} and the wonders of
   computer-mediated learning, how cart we explain teachers' less than
   enthusiastic participation in bringing about changes involving
   computers? This article draws an data from a 2-year study of the
   implementation of new technologies in 12 elementary schools across the
   province of British Columbia. In broad strokes, it is a study of
   failure, for what it does is document in some derail the very great
   divergences between what teachers actually do with computers in their
   classrooms and the enthusiastic claims and exhortations of educational
   administrators and policy makers with respect to the educational
   benefits of new technologies.}},

   being generated has necessitated the development of tools for efficient
   search of these media. Content-based visual queries hare been primarily
   focused on still image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel,
   interactive system on the Web, based on the visual paradigm, with
   spatiotemporal attributes playing a key role in video retrieval. We have
   developed innovative algorithms for automated video object segmentation
   and tracking, and use real-time video editing techniques while
   responding to user queries. The resulting system, called VideoQ (demo
   available at http://www.ctr.columbia.edu/VideoQ/) is the first on-line
   video search engine supporting automatic object-based indexing and
   spatiotemporal queries. The system performs well, with the user being
   able to retrieve complex video clips such as those of skiers and
   baseball players with ease.}},
