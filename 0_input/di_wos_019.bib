Abstract = {{Objective: Implementation of evidence-based, innovative treatments is
   necessary to address posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related
   mental health problems of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi
   Freedom (OEF-OIF) military service personnel. The purpose of this study
   was to characterize mental health clinicians' perceptions of virtual
   reality as an assessment tool or adjunct to exposure therapy. Methods:
   Focus groups were conducted with 18 prescribing and nonprescribing
   mental health clinicians within the Veterans Health Administration.
   Group discussion was digitally recorded, downloaded into Ethnograph
   software, and coded to arrive at primary, secondary, and tertiary
   themes. Results: Most frequently mentioned barriers pertained to aspects
   of virtual reality, followed by veteran characteristics. Organizational
   barriers were more relevant when implementing virtual reality as a
   treatment adjunct. Conclusions: Although the study demonstrated that use
   of virtual reality as a therapy was feasible and acceptable to
   clinicians, successful implementation of the technology as an assessment
   and treatment tool will depend on consideration of the facilitators and
   barriers that were identified. (Psychiatric Services 61:1153-1156, 2010)}},

Abstract = {{In Europe one out of every nine women suffers from breast cancer during
   her lifetime. Since the introduction of mammography screening programs
   more breast cancers are being diagnosed when they are still small and
   early stage cancers with a favourable prognosis. The introduction of
   digital mammography systems has led to a continuous reduction of breast
   cancer mortality especially in specific patient subgroups. Furthermore,
   the digital mammography platform enables the development of new,
   innovative breast imaging methods to increase sensitivity and decrease
   breast cancer mortality. This digital mammography platform includes
   digital breast tomosynthesis, digital contrast medium mammography and
   digital contrast medium breast tomosynthesis as well as fused data sets
   from digital mammography with ultrasound or MRI. The following article
   summarizes these new applications, describes the strengths of the
   digital platform and illustrates the potential advantages of an improved
   breast cancer diagnosis by digital mammography.}},

Abstract = {{In music production, ``monitoring{''} refers traditionally to audile
   strategies intended to reveal the ``true{''} sound of mediated audio.
   Here, it is expanded to include new, digital technologies intended to
   better know and control the record-object beyond what listening and
   listening technologies allow. Surveying traditional, contemporary, and
   emerging tools of record production and distribution, this essay
   addresses three types of monitoring: audio, visual, and data.
   In sum, monitoring entails the supplementation and subversion of the ear
   through protocols promising to surmount the biases and distortions of
   audio media. Key technologies include reference speakers, room
   correction systems, digital audio workstations, open mixes, pre-sets,
   social networking sites, and automatic music information retrieval.
   Situating these within a ``techoustemology{''} of monitoring, the
   central argument is that many innovations in digital audio are
   non-auditory and, therefore, displace sound and listening as the central
   means of producing relevant knowledge about music mediated in the
   digital age.}},

   advancements that provide operational innovations and improvements to
   film scanners. It describes Time Delay Integration (TDI) sensor
   technology and outlines the significant speed and stability improvements
   of this system compared to other sensors (e.g., classic charge-coupled
   device {[}CCD] line sensors). The article also highlights how the use of
   efficient light-emitting diode (LED) light sources will greatly affect
   the scanning process. Furthermore, a new design in film roller gates as
   well as optical perforation detection systems provides touch-free
   optical pin registration for gentle film handing. In addition,
   integrated digital image processing is now capable of shifting the
   images into the subpixel domain. In summary, the paper provides an
   in-depth discussion of the new technology that is available for
   post-production facilities to address a multitude of scanning

Abstract = {{Within the last two decades, modelling of rainfall-runoff has become an
   important topic in water resources assessment due to increasing water
   demand and energy, particularly in the determination of hydropower
   potential. In addition to remote sensing (RS) and geographical
   information systems (GIS), with the development on satellite
   technologies, it becomes possible to asses rapid and economic solutions
   to determine a practical rainfall-runoff relation, particularly poorly
   gauged or ungauged basins. In this paper, Solakli Watershed which is
   located in Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey is selected as the study
   area. To determine the hydroelectric water potential in a poorly gauged
   basin, basin boundary and area, minimum maximum and mean elevation,
   slope information of the basin have been derived from the digital
   elevation model (DEM) using remote sensing (RS) and geographical
   information systems (GIS) techniques. IRS P5 stereo satellite data with
   2.5-m spatial resolution has been used for deriving the DEM. This DEM is
   used to produce the flow direction and flow accumulation maps of the
   basin. Afterward, synthetic drainage network is obtained with the
   analysis of these maps. Using topographical data such as area, mean
   basin elevation and limited point observations of rainfall data; a
   regression model was derived for the whole watershed. This regression
   model was validated on a sub-basin with satisfactory results using mean
   areal rainfall which was calculated isohyetal map produced by kriging
   method. Suggested hydropower station points are also determined.}},

Abstract = {{Our objectives were to develop and test a new system for the potential
   for stable real time cancellation of residual stimulation artefacts
   (RSA) using surface electrode autogenic electromyography controlled
   functional electrical stimulator (aEMGcFES) This type of closed loop FES
   could be used to provide more natural continuous control of lower
   extremity paretic muscles We built upon work that has been done in the
   field of FES with one major technological innovation an adaptive
   Gram-Schmidt filtering algorithm which allowed us to digitally cancel
   RSA in real time This filtering algorithm resulted in a stable real time
   estimation of the volitional intent of the stimulated muscle which then
   acted as the direct signal for continuously controlling homonymous
   muscle stimulation As a first step toward clinical application we tested
   the viability of our aEMGcFES system to continuously control ankle
   dorsiflexion in a healthy subject Our results indicate positively that
   an aEMGcFES device with adaptive filtering can respond proportionally to
   voluntary EMG and activate forceful movements to assist dorsiflexion
   during controlled isometric activation at the ankle We also verified
   that normal ankle joint range of movement could be maintained while
   using the aEMGcFES system We suggest that real time cancellation of both
   primary and RSA is possible with surface electrode aEMGcFES in healthy
   subjects and shows promising potential for future clinical application
   to gait pathologies such as drop foot related to hemiparetic stroke (C)

Abstract = {{Social influence drives both offline and online human behavior. It
   pervades cultural markets, and manifests itself in the adoption of
   scientific and technical innovations as well as the spread of social
   practices. Prior empirical work on the diffusion of innovations in
   spatial regions or social networks has largely focused on the spread of
   one particular technology among a subset of all potential adopters. Here
   we choose an online context that allows us to study social influence
   processes by tracking the popularity of a complete set of applications
   installed by the user population of a social networking site, thus
   capturing the behavior of all individuals who can influence each other
   in this context. By extending standard fluctuation scaling methods, we
   analyze the collective behavior induced by 100 million application
   installations, and show that two distinct regimes of behavior emerge in
   the system. Once applications cross a particular threshold of
   popularity, social influence processes induce highly correlated adoption
   behavior among the users, which propels some of the applications to
   extraordinary levels of popularity. Below this threshold, the collective
   effect of social influence appears to vanish almost entirely, in a
   manner that has not been observed in the offline world. Our results
   demonstrate that even when external signals are absent, social influence
   can spontaneously assume an on-off nature in a digital environment. It
   remains to be seen whether a similar outcome could be observed in the
   offline world if equivalent experimental conditions could be replicated.}},

   revenue and net publishers' unit datasets and.e-book revenues for
   2008-9. Data for net publishers' revenues, net publishers' units, and
   digital e-book revenues for higher education textbooks, professional and
   scholarly books, and consumer e-books were also evaluated covering the
   years 2008-9.
   Drawing on important economic data projections and the publicly
   available competitive print and digital strategies crafted by
   competitors in the consumer, higher education, and professional and
   scholarly sectors, the authors develop net publishers' revenue and unit
   projections for all of these book categories for 2010-15.
   The university press data sets reveal unsettling declines in revenues
   and units for 2008-2015. Addressing these declines, the authors conclude
   with a brief series of recommendations, including the rapid adoption of
   a digital `e-book' business model in order to reposition the presses in
   what is becoming a digital book marketplace.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic science has a significant current and future role in crime
   detection, policing and the criminal justice system. Government and
   societal drivers, police priorities and advances in science and
   technology are demanding, as well as providing opportunities, for its
   impact and potential to be expanded, evaluated and assessed further.
   Within this, there is a need for the Criminal justice System to be clear
   what it is looking for in respect of forensic science and to identify
   what the priorities, opportunities and processes are for development and
   possible expansion (of some areas, such as Digital Forensics, Biometrics
   and Imaging technologies). For example, if the police service's primary
   forensic science requirements are for reductions in unit costs,
   improvements in detection rates or faster turn-around times then this
   should be clearly specified to internal and external providers, while
   recognising that such requirements could have consequences for the
   development and delivery of forensic science, as well as policing, in
   other ways.
   A key area of agreement within the forensic community is the importance
   of establishing a vehicle for identifying future possibilities,
   potential and priorities which fosters innovation, maintains investment
   and shapes (rather than directs) the forensic science market; together
   with the need for engagement with the broader based academic community,
   in relation to research and development}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a mobile exploration activity that guides elementary
   students to learn during a social science activity with digital support
   from mobile devices and wireless communications. The students are
   situated in both the real world and the virtual world to extend their
   learning experiences. The learning activities between the field and the
   digital system not only demonstrate the practices of mobile learning,
   which emphasizes learning that happens close to real life, but also
   provides digital learning content to facilitate students' field studies.
   To enhance the learning performance of the students, an inquiry-based
   mobile learning approach is employed to assist the students in
   constructing their own knowledge by taking cognitive load into
   consideration. To evaluate the effectiveness of the innovative approach,
   33 fifth grade students were arranged to carry out investigations in the
   Peace Temple of southern Tainan with the inquiry-based mobile learning
   system. Through pre- and post-class questionnaires as well as
   observations and focus group interviews, descriptive quantitative and
   qualitative data were collected and analyzed. The results show
   significant positive results in terms of the students' learning.}},

Abstract = {{The modern instruments involved in the measurement on the
   telecommunication systems are generally based on suitable digital signal
   processing methods which provide the desired quantities by elaborating
   the acquired samples. To warrant suitable accuracy and repeatability as
   well as the alias-free sampling (Nyquist-Shannon theorem), the
   measurement instruments are usually forced to operate with high sampling
   frequencies, long observation periods and very fast measurement
   algorithms. However, if bandpass signals are involved, as it happens in
   modern telecommunication systems, the bandpass sampling theory could be
   employed to significantly reduce the sampling rate, without any replica
   overlapping. This opportunity is very attractive for both instrument
   designers and users, since it allows optimizing the hardware resources
   through a more efficient employment.
   The choice of the bandpass sampling rate is a not trivial task, and
   wrong values may cause aliasing phenomena and affect the accuracy of
   measurement results. In this paper, two original algorithms,
   particularly useful to both instrument designers and users, are proposed
   to automatically select the sampling rate when bandpass signals have to
   be measured. To assess and validate the efficiency and the suitability
   of bandpass sampling criteria proposed, a number of tests have been
   performed on emulated and real DVB-T signals. An analysis of the
   benefits, in terms of computational burden and memory requirement,
   provided by the bandpass sampling implementation on RF measurement
   station has been carried out with reference to both nonparametric and
   parametric kinds of power spectrum density (PSD) estimators. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new optical measurement method employing a HSI
   (hue, saturation and intensity) colour model to form trapezoidal
   structured patterns for morphology reconstruction of a measured object
   at high speed. Profilometry on objects having non-monochromatic surfaces
   is considered as one of the remaining challenges most faced by the
   currently existing structured-light projection methods since the surface
   reflectivity to red, green and blue light may vary significantly. To
   address this, an innovative colour calibration method for a hue
   component is developed to determine the accurate reflectivity response
   of the measured surface. The trapezoidal colour pattern is calibrated to
   compensate the hue-shifted quantity induced by the reflective
   characteristics of the object's surface. The developed method can
   reconstruct precise 3D surface models from objects by acquiring a
   single-shot image, which can achieve high-speed profilometry and avoid
   in situ potential measurement disturbances such as environmental
   vibration. To verify the feasibility of the developed methodology, some
   experiments were conducted to confirm that the measurement accuracy can
   be controlled within 2.5\% of the overall measurement range and the
   repeatability of 3.0\% within +/- 3 sigma can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to the improving performances of 3D optical scanners, in terms of
   accuracy and repeatability, reverse engineering applications have
   extended from CAD model design or reconstruction to quality control.
   Today, contactless digitizing devices constitute a good alternative to
   coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) for the inspection of certain
   parts. The German guideline VDI/VDE 2634 is the only reference to
   evaluate whether 3D optical measuring systems comply with the declared
   or required performance specifications. Nevertheless it is difficult to
   compare the performance of different scanners referring to such a
   guideline. An adequate novel benchmark is proposed in this paper:
   focusing on the inspection of production tools (moulds), the innovative
   test piece was designed using common geometries and free-form surfaces.
   The reference part is intended to be employed for the evaluation of the
   performance of several contactless digitizing devices in computer-aided
   inspection, considering dimensional and geometrical tolerances as well
   as other quantitative and qualitative criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays all the National Central Banks are continuously studying
   innovative anti-counterfeiting systems for banknotes. In this note, an
   innovative solution is proposed, which combines the potentiality of a
   hylemetric approach (methodology conceptually similar to biometry),
   based on notes' intrinsic characteristics, with a well-known and
   consolidated 2D barcode identification system. In particular, in this
   note we propose to extract from the banknotes a univocal binary control
   sequence (template) and insert an encrypted version of it in a barcode
   printed on the same banknote. For a more acceptable look and feel of a
   banknote, the superposed barcode can be stamped using IR ink that is
   visible to near-IR image sensors. This makes the banknote verification
   simpler.}},

Journal = {{PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{There has been a recent upsurge in worldwide attention on digital
   pathology, which has transformed from static snapshots from
   camera-equipped microscopes to its modern form that encompasses scanning
   of whole glass slides with evaluation of histological images on a
   computer screen, along with management of its accompanying information.
   Although it has been widely accepted in education and research, its
   implementation in diagnostic surgical pathology practice is not without
   challenges in workflow integration, technological infrastructure,
   pathologist acclimatisation, global standardisation for clinical
   practice, and cost issues, among others. Nonetheless, early adopters
   have harnessed its benefits in specific niches, like frozen section
   services and remote second opinion consultations. Its tremendous
   potential is worthy of further validation to compare with conventional
   glass slide evaluation, even while it is already paving the way for
   advancement into virtual three-dimensional imaging technology, with a
   glimpse into a possible future digital diagnostic pathology practice.}},

Abstract = {{Novel automated photogrammetry is based on four innovations. First is
   the cost-free increase of overlap between images when sensing digitally.
   Second is an improved radiometry. Third is multi-view matching. Fourth
   is the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), making complex algorithms for
   image matching very practical. These innovations lead to improved
   automation of the photogrammetric workflow so that point clouds are
   created at sub-pixel accuracy, at very dense intervals, and in near
   real-time, thereby eroding the unique selling proposition of lidar
   scanners.
   Two test projects compare point clouds from aerial and street-side lidar
   systems with those created from images. We show that the photogrammetric
   accuracy compares well with the lidar-method, yet the density of surface
   points is much higher from images. and the throughput is commensurate
   with a fully automated all-digital approach. Beyond this density, we
   identify 15 additional advantages of the photogrammetric approach.}},

Abstract = {{Computer literacy plays a critical role in today's life sciences
   research. Without the ability to use computers to efficiently manipulate
   and analyze large amounts of data resulting from biological experiments
   and simulations, many of the pressing questions in the life sciences
   could not be answered. Today's undergraduates, despite the ubiquity of
   computers in their lives, seem to be largely unfamiliar with how
   computers are being used to pursue and answer such questions. This
   article describes an innovative undergraduate-level course, titled
   Computer Literacy for Life Sciences, that aims to teach students the
   basics of a computerized scientific research pursuit. The purpose of the
   course is for students to develop a hands-on working experience in using
   standard computer software tools as well as computer techniques and
   methodologies used in life sciences research. This paper provides a
   detailed description of the didactical tools and assessment methods used
   in and outside of the classroom as well as a discussion of the lessons
   learned during the first installment of the course taught at Emory
   University in fall semester 2009.}},

Abstract = {{The limited number of unearthed fossils and their accessibility are
   factors that hinder paleoanthropological studies. Original remains, but
   also osteological collections of extant specimens, have to be curated in
   optimal and adapted environments, and direct manipulation needs to be
   limited in order to preserve this irreplaceable patrimony. Imaging
   methodologies have recently provided ways for innovative advances in the
   preservation of these collections, as well as offering new perspectives
   to museographic displays and original scientific studies. Here, we
   describe recent examples of developments obtained from imaging
   methodologies and discuss methodological and ethical implications of
   these new ``virtual{''} collections. Undeniably, ``virtual
   anthropology{''} is an additional tool in our large set of analytical
   possibilities and for curators, with its specific constraints related to
   the particular nature of the analysed material. Finally, we suggest some
   possible guidelines for the optimisation of the preservation, management
   and development of collections while preserving their scientific
   exploitation. (C) 2010 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes an empirical study of behaviors associated with
   consumers' creative modification of digital information goods found in
   Web 2.0 and elsewhere. They are products of culture such as digital
   images, music, video, news and computer games. We will refer to them as
   ``digital culture products{''}. How do consumers who transmute such
   products differ from those who do not, and from each other? This study
   develops and tests a theory of consumer behavior in transmuting digital
   culture products, separating consumers into different groups based on
   how and why they transmute. With our theory, we posit these groups as
   having differences of motivation, as measured by product involvement and
   innovativeness, and of ability as measured by computer skills. A survey
   instrument to collect data from Internet-capable computer users on the
   relevant constructs, and on their transmutation activities, is developed
   and distributed using a web-based survey hosting service. The data are
   used to test hypotheses that consumers' enduring involvement and
   innovativeness are positively related to transmutation behaviors, and
   that computer self-efficacy moderates those relationships. The empirical
   results support the hypotheses that enduring involvement and
   innovativeness do motivate transmutation behavior. The data analysis
   also supports the existence of a moderating relationship of computer
   self-efficacy with respect to enduring involvement, but not of computer
   self-efficacy with respect to innovativeness. The findings further
   indicate that transmutation activities should be expected to impact Web
   2.0-oriented companies, both incumbents and start-ups, as they make
   decisions about how to incorporate consumers into their business models
   not only as recipients of content, but also as its producers. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Background: Anesthesia professional delivered sedation has become
   increasingly common when performing colonoscopy and EGD.
   Objective: To provide an estimate of anesthesia professional
   participation rates in colonoscopy and EGD procedures and to examine
   rate changes over time and geographic variations for both procedures.
   Design: Retrospective sample design.
   Setting: National survey data from i3 Innovus for the period 2003 to
   2007 on the use rate of anesthesia professionals in both procedures.
   Patients: A sample of 3688 observations included 3-digit zip code-level
   information on anesthesia professional use rates.
   Interventions: Data were linked to the Bureau of Health Professions'
   Area Resource File to control for sociodemographic factors and provider
   supply characteristics for anesthesia professional use rates.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Multivariable regression analyses were
   performed to identify factors predicting the use rate of anesthesia
   professionals in these procedures and to forecast use rates for the
   years 2009 to 2015.
   Results: For colonoscopy and EGD, anesthesia professional participation
   is projected to grow from 23.9\% and 24.4\% in 2007 to 53.4\% and 52.9\%
   by 2015, respectively. Average growth rates were highest in the
   northeast for colonoscopy (145.8\%) and EGD (146.6\%). Anesthesia
   professional use rates were significantly greater in areas having a
   higher percentage of older subjects (45 years and older), higher per
   capita income and lower unemployment rates, and higher per capita
   inpatient admissions and were significantly lower in areas having more
   per capita outpatient visits for both procedures.
   Limitations: Nonexperimental retrospective sample study design. Database
   sample May not be nationally representative. Market area characteristics
   were used to control for socioeconomic and demographic factors. However,
   there may remain some important market factors that we were unable to
   control.
   Conclusions: Anesthesia professional delivered sedation is projected to
   grow substantially for both procedures. (Gastrointest Enclose

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative control law for distributed dc
   generation supplied by a fuel cell (FC) (main source) and supercapacitor
   (auxiliary source). This kind of system is a multiconverter structure
   and exhibits nonlinear behavior. The operation of a multiconverter
   structure can lead to interactions between the controls of the
   converters if they are designed separately. Typically, interactions
   between converters are studied using impedance criteria to investigate
   the stability of cascaded systems. In this paper, a nonlinear control
   algorithm based on the flatness properties of the system is proposed.
   Flatness provides a convenient framework for meeting a number of
   performance specifications for the hybrid power source. Using the
   flatness property, we propose simple solutions to hybrid energy
   management and stabilization problems. The design controller parameters
   are autonomous of the operating point; moreover, interactions between
   converters are taken into account by the controllers, and high dynamics
   in disturbance rejection is achieved. To validate the proposed method, a
   hardware system is realized with analog circuits, and digital estimation
   is accomplished with a dSPACE controller. Experimental results with
   small-scale devices (a polymer electrolyte membrane FC of 1200 W, 46 A
   and a supercapacitor module of 100 F, 500 A, and 32 V) in a laboratory
   corroborate the excellent control scheme during a motor-drive cycle.}},

Title = {{The ``Third Hand{''}: IT-Enabled Competitive Advantage in Turbulence
   Through Improvisational Capabilities}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{443-471}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Organizations are increasingly engaged in competitive dynamics that are
   enabled or induced by information technology (IT). A key competitive
   dynamics question for many organizations is how to build a competitive
   advantage in turbulence with digital IT systems. The literature has
   focused mostly on developing and exercising dynamic capabilities for
   planned reconfiguration of existing operational capabilities in fairly
   stable environments with patterned ``waves,{''} but this may not always
   be possible, or even appropriate, in highly turbulent environments with
   unexpected ``storms.{''} We introduce improvisational capabilities as an
   alternative means for managing highly turbulent environments; we define
   this as the ability to spontaneously reconfigure existing resources to
   build new operational capabilities to address urgent, unpredictable, and
   novel environmental situations. In contrast to the planned role of
   dynamic and operational capabilities and the ambidexterity that they
   jointly offer, improvisational capabilities are proposed to operate
   distinctly as a ``third hand{''} that facilitates reconfiguration and
   change in highly turbulent environments.
   First, the paper develops the notion of improvisational capabilities and
   articulates the key differences between the two
   ``reconfiguration{''}-improvisational and dynamic-capabilities. Second,
   the paper compares the relative effects of improvisational and dynamic
   capabilities in the context of new product development in different
   levels of environmental turbulence. Third, the paper shows how
   IT-leveraging capability in new product development is decomposed into
   its three digital IT systems: project and resource management systems,
   organizational memory systems (OMS), and cooperative work systems-and
   how each of these IT systems enhances improvisational capabilities, an
   effect that is accentuated in highly turbulent environments.
   The results show that although dynamic capabilities are the primary
   predictor of competitive advantage in moderately turbulent environments,
   improvisational capabilities fully dominate in highly turbulent
   environments. Besides discriminant validity, the distinction between
   improvisational and dynamic capabilities is evidenced by the
   differential effects of IT-leveraging capability on improvisational and
   dynamic capabilities. The results show that the more the IT-leveraging
   capability is catered toward managing resources (through project and
   resource management systems) and team collaboration (through cooperative
   work systems) rather than relying on past knowledge and procedures
   (through organizational memory systems), the more it is positively
   associated with improvisational capabilities, particularly in more
   turbulent environments.
   The paper draws implications for how different IT systems can influence
   improvisational capabilities and competitive advantage in turbulent
   environments, thereby enhancing our understanding of the role of IT
   systems on reconfiguration capabilities. The paper discusses the
   theoretical and practical implications of building and exercising the ``
   third hand{''} of improvisational capabilities for IT-enabled
   competitive dynamics in turbulence.}},

Abstract = {{Using agent-based simulation experiments, we investigate the outcome of
   SAs between two smaller online search engine companies in competition
   with a dominant market leader in settings where an advertiser's decision
   making is the consequence of a combination of NI (e. g., an individual's
   willingness to follow others' decisions) and IP. In particular, we focus
   on a context in which the combined search engine company competes with a
   market leader holding a larger share of the market than the two
   runner-up ``underdogs{''} combined. Our results indicate that, with the
   presence of NI and cascading effects, an alliance with ``only{''}
   35\%-40\% combined market share could compete with a leader whose market
   share, at the time of an alliance, is 60\%-65\%. Although important,
   size alone might be insufficient to build the market as suggested by the
   ``vanilla{''} network effect theory. Another noteworthy finding is that
   a nonlinear association exists between NI and an alliance outcome; the
   combined runner-up companies have the best chance of success when the
   extent of NI is midrange, rather than on the high or low end of
   continuum. Contrary to the conventional view, this finding might also
   stimulate discussions among network science researchers. Furthermore,
   our results suggest that NI substantially moderates the relationship
   between the combined market share at the time of an alliance and the

   Competition in the Enterprise Systems Software Industry}},

Abstract = {{As more and more firms seek to digitize their business processes and
   develop new digital capabilities, the enterprise systems software (ESS)
   has emerged as a significant industry. ESS firms offer software
   components (e. g., ERP, CRM, Marketing analytics) to shape their
   clients' digitization strategies. With rapid rates of technological and
   market innovation, the ESS industry consists of several horizontal
   markets that form around these components. As numerous vendors compete
   with each other within and across these markets, many of these
   horizontal markets appear to be crowded with rivals. In fact,
   multimarket contact and presence in crowded markets appear to be the
   pathways through which a majority of the ESS firms compete. Though the
   strategy literature has demonstrated the virtues of multimarket contact,
   paradoxically, the same literature argues that operating in crowded
   markets is not wise. In particular, crowded markets increase a firm's
   exposure to the whirlwinds of intense competition and have deleterious
   consequences for financial performance. Thus, the behavior of ESS firms
   raises an interesting anomaly and research question: Why do ESS firms
   continue to compete in crowded markets if they are deemed to be bad for
   financial performance? We argue that the effects of rivalry in crowded
   markets are counteracted by a different force, in the form of the
   economics of demand externalities. Demand externalities occur because
   the customers of ESS firms expect that software components from one
   market will be easily integrated with those that they buy from other
   markets. However, with rapid rates of technological innovation and
   market formation and dissolution, customers experience significant
   ambiguity in deciding which markets and components suit their needs.
   Therefore, they look at crowded markets as an important signal about the
   legitimacy and viability of specific components for their needs. Through
   their presence in crowded markets, ESS firms can signal their commitment
   to many of the components that customers might need for their digital
   platforms. Customers might find that such firms are attractive because
   their commitments to crowded markets can mitigate concerns about
   compatibilities between the components purchased across several markets.
   This unique potential for demand externality across markets suggests
   that ESS vendors might, in fact, benefit from competing in many crowded
   markets. We test our explanations through data across three time periods
   from a set of ESS firms that account for more than 95\% of the revenue
   in this market. We find that ESS firms do reap performance benefits by
   competing in crowded markets. More importantly, we find that they can
   enhance their benefits from crowded markets if they face the same
   competitors in multiple markets, thereby increasing their multimarket
   contact with rivals. These results have interesting implications not
   just for understanding competitive conduct in the ESS industry but also
   in many of the emerging digital goods industries where the markets have
   similar competitive characteristics to the ESS industry. Our ideas
   complement emerging ideas about platform models of competition in the
   digital goods industry and provide important directions for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Information technologies (IT) have affected economic activities within
   and beyond the boundaries of the firm, changing the face of e-commerce.
   This article explores the circumstances under which value is created in
   business networks made possible by IT. Business networks combine the
   capabilities of multiple Firms to produce and deliver products and
   services that none of them could more economically produce on its own
   and for which there is demand in the market. We call this business
   network-based value creation. We apply economic theory to explain the
   conditions under which business networks will exist and are able to
   sustain their value-producing activities. Informedness has the potential
   to increase the complexity of consumer demand. Addressing this demand
   requires flexible production and delivery of products and services, and
   can be achieved by value-adding business networks supported by IT,
   standardized technology, and business process solutions. We also examine
   the benefits associated with business network-based value creation and
   fair value-sharing to support the sustainability of business networks.
   We develop a set of propositions and draw upon multiple case examples
   from the travel and hospitality industry to validate our theoretical
   perspectives on business network-based value creation. The results
   demonstrate that this industry is going through a digital transformation
   that makes it possible for many firms to engage in highly effective and
   innovative network-based value creation.}},

Abstract = {{Extending the perspective of agency theory, this study incorporates both
   professional and local knowledge asymmetry into a model of relationship
   satisfaction between global professional service firms and their local
   clients. The model also includes learning orientation and adaptation
   that are theorized to regulate the impact of knowledge asymmetry on goal
   incongruence, which ultimately affects relationship satisfaction. China
   was selected as the setting of the study because it is the largest
   emerging market, has seen double-digit growth of advertising
   expenditures for the past two decades, and is home to many multinational
   advertising agencies that have increasingly pursued local clients as
   revenue sources. Multiple informants from 177 domestic Chinese firms and
   their multinational advertising agencies were personally interviewed,
   and the dyadic data were used to test the model. Results show that both
   types of knowledge asymmetry lead to goal incongruence, which causes
   client dissatisfaction. The role of learning orientation varies, as does
   the role of adaptation, in moderating the impact of knowledge asymmetry
   on goal incongruence and the impact of goal incongruence on relationship
   satisfaction. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings
   are discussed, along with the limitations of the study and future
   research directions. Journal of International Business Studies (2010)

Abstract = {{Automated trust negotiation is an approach that establishes mutual trust
   between strangers wishing to share resources or conduct business by
   gradually requesting and disclosing digitally signed credentials.
   Sometimes negotiators do not have very strict security requirements or
   the efficiency is the most crucial need. In such cases, it is preferable
   to adopt schemes that speed up negotiations, even if they do not
   maximize the protection of the involved resources. Therefore, in this
   paper, we present a trust negotiation framework that speeds up
   negotiations from two aspects whenever possible, disclosure sequence
   generation and credential validation, which are computationally
   expensive during negotiations. The framework we propose presents several
   innovative features, such as the support for predicting disclosure
   sequences by locally trusted peers, the use of declaration tickets and
   proving tickets to reduce the number of exchanged credentials and
   credential validations. Further, we report experimental results based on
   our implementation of this framework, which show that our framework can
   greatly speed up negotiations whenever possible.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, in a quadrupole mass filter, ion isolation is achieved by
   scanning the rf and DC voltages with a fixed ratio. In this paper, we
   describe an innovative procedure implemented in a digitally driven
   linear ion trap termed digital asymmetric waveform isolation (DAWI) in
   which ion isolation is obtained by manipulation of the duty cycle of the
   rectangular waveforms. Variation of the waveform duty cycle allows
   introduction of a precisely defined DC quadrupole component into the
   main trapping field of the quadrupole ion filter. The DAWI method is
   completely controlled at software level and does not require any
   hardware modification. (J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2010, 21, 1530-1533) (C)

Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of Rogers attributes associated with
   innovation adoption (1995) in the context of demographic characteristics
   of public relations practitioners (PR) in the Greek financial services
   sector as they adopt and utilize the internet for PR purposes. Data is
   gathered via an on-line questionnaire administered to PR practitioners
   that work in companies participating in the Athens Stock Exchange. A
   quantitative approach was used in order to depict the attitudes and
   perceptions of these practitioners toward the use of on-line PR.
   The findings indicate connections between age, trialability, working
   experience, and adoption. Identifying the factors that affect the
   adoption of the internet by PR managers may assist organizations and
   practitioners to improve their relations with stakeholder publics in the
   digital world. The value of the paper is in conceptualising theoretical
   approaches of innovation and internet adoption and helping to create a
   framework for internet adoption by PR managers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{This study explores the phenomenon of chasm in the marketing process of
   discontinuous innovations. Drawing on Moore's concept of chasm crossing,
   an empirical analysis is performed using the data gathered from a survey
   of potential users of satellite DMB. First, the demand of satellite DMB
   is forecasted. Then, the demand changes in different innovation adopter
   groups are determined from the continuous innovation perspective relying
   on Rogers' technology adoption life cycle model. Finally, the diffusion
   process of this high-tech service is re-examined from the perspective of
   discontinuous innovation in order to identify the market gap and
   elaborate strategies to overcome the chasm. In the analysis, time points
   of innovation adoption are used as the basic unit of analysis for the
   purpose of shifting the analytical focus from market diffusion to
   consumer acceptance. This study is expected to provide a useful
   methodological framework for future empirical applications in this
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Digital halftoning plays a central role in getting more observable
   grey-levels for either the innovative electronic paper or other less
   level devices. The hardware implementation of digital halftoning is,
   however, seldom fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel
   implementation of digital halftoning by means of error diffusion. The
   proposed scheme not only can perform a new method called chaotic and
   edge enhanced error diffusion, but also can be reduced to perform the
   conventional Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion. Best of all, our new
   scheme can produce halftone images with lower worm-like artifacts and
   sharper image edges. This scheme is mainly composed of four components:
   gradient-based edge detection, chaotic threshold generation, edge
   enhanced quantization, and error diffusion. Each circuit design of the
   four components is illustrated for the first time. Besides, we
   demonstrate the hardware performance of our scheme by using a field
   programmable gate array (FPGA) chip to offer possibly further
   applications(1).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a framework for teaching design engineering in a
   global context using innovative technologies to enable distributed teams
   to work together effectively across international and cultural
   boundaries. The Digital Libraries for Global Distributed Innovative
   Design, Education, and Teamwork (DIDET) Framework represents the
   findings of a 5-year project conducted by the University of Strathclyde,
   Stanford University, and Olin College that enhanced student learning
   opportunities by enabling them to partake in global, team-based design
   engineering projects, directly experiencing different cultural contexts
   and accessing a variety of digital information sources via a range of
   innovative technology. The use of innovative technology enabled the
   formalization of design knowledge within international student teams as
   did the methods that were developed for students to store, share, and
   reuse information. Coaching methods were used by teaching staff to
   support distributed teams and evaluation work on relevant classes was
   carried out regularly to allow ongoing improvement of learning and
   teaching and show improvements in student learning. Major findings of
   the 5-year project include the requirement to overcome technological,
   pedagogical, and cultural issues for successful eLeaming
   implementations. The DIDET Framework encapsulates all the conclusions
   relating to design engineering in a global context. Each of the
   principles for effective distributed design learning is shown along with
   relevant findings and suggested metrics. The findings detailed in the
   paper were reached through a series of interventions in design
   engineering education at the collaborating institutions. Evaluation was
   carried out on an ongoing basis and fed back into project development,
   both on the pedagogical and the technological approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the concept of Orchestrating Smart Business Networks
   (SBN) as a managerial function that shapes structural dynamics for
   innovation. On the basis of commitment, as one way to exert power, and
   dynamic capacities, the suggested managerial function can develop a path
   of efficiency towards innovation by managing the SBN's structural
   dynamics, the network boundaries and digital platforms. The network's
   centripetal and centrifugal forces are used as the units of analysis,
   and this managerial function is then tested with empirical results

Abstract = {{Resin infiltration is an innovative approach to arrest progression of
   caries lesions. The aim of this randomized split-mouth
   placebo-controlled clinical trial was to assess whether resin
   infiltration of proximal lesions is more effective than non-operative
   measures alone with respect to the inhibition of caries progression. In
   22 young adults, 29 pairs of interproximal lesions with radiological
   extension into the inner half of enamel or the outer third of dentin
   were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. In the test group,
   lesions were infiltrated (Icon, pre-product; DMG). A placebo treatment
   was performed in the control group. All participants received
   instructions for diet, flossing, and fluoridation. The primary outcome
   after 18 months was radiographic lesion progression (assessed by digital
   subtraction radiography). No unwanted effects could be observed. In the
   effect group, 2/27 lesions (7\%) and in the control group 10/27 lesions
   (37\%) showed progression (p = 0.021; McNemar). Infiltration of
   interproximal caries lesions is efficacious in reducing lesion
   progression.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, we have much more convenient access to every medical journal
   through web sites, compared to the paper-based publications of the past.
   Beyond simply reading, we can compose, submit, inspect, review, and
   store data through these web sites. Furthermore, medical journals do not
   operate independently, but are rather integrated through online journal
   databases: therefore, an era of ubiquitous access to medical information
   for any purpose, has arrived. Thousands of new papers are pouring out in
   the flood of information everyday, so that it is very important for
   authors to make their research outcomes known to science scholar online
   especially in the options or selections of his or her own purpose of
   study. Therefore, a thorough understanding of database usage is
   necessary in order to meet authors' and readers' goals. The Journal of
   the Korean Medical Association (JKMA) began operating an online database
   (www.kjma.org) in July 2010, to keep pace with international digital
   journal standards. Digital publication is a very encouraging improvement
   in meeting contemporary reader's' needs over the previous paper-based
   system. The tools and content of the journal web site will both be
   continuously updated. Our society ought to not only catch up with other
   society's but further develop our online presence in innovative ways.
   The authors here introduce and summarize the latest trends and ethical
   issues in online publication needed to manage and use the online medical
   databases appropriately.}},

Abstract = {{Peter Lunenfeld is a Professor in the Design vertical bar Media Arts
   department at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is well
   known for his edited collection, The Digital Dialectic: New Essays on
   New Media (MIT Press, 1999), and his book, Snap To Grid: A User's Guide
   to Digital Arts, Media, and Cultures (MIT Press, 2001). Lunenfeld was
   also the Editorial Director for the innovative Mediawork pamphlet series
   published by MIT Press. Within the series, Lunenfeld's own User:
   InfoTechnoDemo appeared in 2005. In the first of a two-part
   trans-journal interview, Elizabeth Guffey (Editor-in-Chief, Design and
   Culture) and Raiford Guins (Principal Editor, journal of visual culture
   ) interview Lunenfeld on a number of topics that touch on visual
   culture, design studies, art, media and cultural critique.
   The trans-journal interview is a collaborative initiative between
   academic journal editors to facilitate conversations across fields of
   study and subject matter by sharing a space where intellectual labor is
   conducted. In part one of this interview, Lunenfeld responds to a number
   of questions related to his Mediawork series and his concept of the
   `visual intellectual'. In the second part of this interview, published
   in Design and Culture 2(3), November 2010, our emphasis includes design
   theory and the digital humanities as recently brought together in the
   form of the NOWCASTING conference that Lunenfeld organized on 16-17
   October 2009 and his forthcoming book, The Secret War Between
   Downloading \& Uploading: Tales of the Computer As Culture Machine (MIT

Journal = {{MEDIA INTERNATIONAL AUSTRALIA}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Much debate in media and communication studies is based on exaggerated
   opposition between the digital sublime and the digital abject: overly
   enthusiastic optimism versus determined pessimism over the potential of
   new technologies. This inhibits the discipline's claims to provide
   rigorous insight into industry and social change which is, after all,
   continuous. Instead of having to decide one way or the other, we need to
   ask how we study the process of change. This article examines the impact
   of online distribution in the film industry, particularly addressing the
   question of rates of change. Are there genuinely new players disrupting
   the established oligopoly, and if so with what effect? Is there evidence
   of disruption to, and innovation in, business models? Has cultural
   change been forced on the incumbents? Outside mainstream Hollywood,
   where are the new opportunities and the new players? What is the
   situation in Australia?}},

Title = {{Risk-sensitive events during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the influence
   of the integrated operating room and a preoperative checklist tool}},

Abstract = {{Awareness of the relative high rate of adverse events in laparoscopic
   surgery created a need to safeguard quality and safety of performance
   better. Technological innovations, such as integrated operating room
   (OR) systems and checklists, have the potential to improve patient
   safety, OR efficiency, and surgical outcomes. This study was designed to
   investigate the influence of the integrated OR system and Pro/cheQ, a
   digital checklist tool, on the number and type of equipment- and
   instrument-related risk-sensitive events (RSE) during laparoscopic
   cholecystectomies.
   Forty-five laparoscopic cholecystectomies were analyzed on the number
   and type of RSE; 15 procedures were observed in the cart-based OR
   setting, 15 in an integrated OR setting, and 15 in the integrated OR
   setting while using Pro/cheQ.
   In the cart-based OR setting and the integrated OR setting, at least one
   event occurred in 87\% of the procedures, which was reduced to 47\% in
   the integrated OR setting when using Pro/cheQ. During 45 procedures a
   total of 57 RSE was observed-most were caused by equipment that was not
   switched on or with the wrong settings. In the integrated OR while using
   Pro/cheQ the number of RSE was reduced by 65\%.
   Using both an integrated OR and Pro/cheQ has a stronger reducing effect
   on the number of RSE than using an integrated OR alone. The Pro/cheQ
   tool supported the optimal workflow in a natural way and raised the
   general safety awareness amongst all members of the surgical team. For
   tools such as integrated OR systems and checklists to succeed it is
   pivotal not to underestimate the value of the implementation process. To
   further improve safety and quality of surgery, a multifaceted approach
   should be followed, focusing on the performance and competence of the
   surgical team as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{Product information given in purchase situations influences purchase
   behavior. In online purchase situations, the use of recommendation
   agents increases the value of product information as information becomes
   adaptive and thus more relevant to consumers' information needs.
   Correspondingly, mobile recommendation agents (MRAs) may also increase
   the value of product information in bricks-and-mortar stores. In this
   sense, product information is not only adaptive but can also be
   requested at any place such as in front of products consumers are
   interested in. Because unprecedented, we investigate the use of a MRA
   that is virtually bound to a physical product via an RFID-enabled mobile
   device and provides product information. Based on Theory of Planned
   Behavior, Innovation Diffusion Theory, and Technology Acceptance Model,
   we develop a model to better understand the impact of MRAs on usage
   intentions, product purchases and store preferences of consumers. This
   model is then tested in a lab experiment (n = 47). Among high usability
   scores, results indicate that perceived usefulness of a MRA influences
   product purchases, predicts usage intentions and store preferences of
   consumers. Thus, new business models for retail stores can be considered
   in which MRAs satisfy both the information needs of consumers and the
   communication needs of retailers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In multimodality imaging, the need to combine morphofunctional
   information can be approached by either acquiring images at different
   times (asynchronous), and fused them through digital image manipulation
   techniques or simultaneously acquiring images (synchronous) and merging
   them automatically. The asynchronous post-processing solution presents
   various constraints, mainly conditioned by the different positioning of
   the patient in the two scans acquired at different times in separated
   machines. The best solution to achieve consistency in time and space is
   obtained by the synchronous image acquisition. There are many multimodal
   technologies in molecular imaging. In this review we will focus on those
   multimodality image techniques more commonly used in the field of
   diagnostic imaging (SPECT-CT, PET-CT) and new developments (as PET-MR).
   The technological innovations and development of new tracers and smart
   probes are the main key points that will condition multimodality image
   and diagnostic imaging professionals' future. Although SPECT-CT and
   PET-CT are standard in most clinical scenarios, MR imaging has some
   advantages, providing excellent soft-tissue contrast and
   multidimensional functional, structural and morphological information.
   The next frontier is to develop efficient detectors and electronics
   systems capable of detecting two modality signals at the same time. Not
   only PET-MR but also MR-US or optic-PET will be introduced in clinical
   scenarios. Even more, MR diffusion-weighted, pharmacokinetic imaging,
   spectroscopy or functional BOLD imaging will merge with PET tracers to
   further increase molecular imaging as a relevant medical discipline.
   Multimodality imaging techniques will play a leading role in relevant
   clinical applications. The development of new diagnostic imaging
   research areas, mainly in the field of oncology, cardiology and
   neuropsychiatry, will impact the way medicine is performed today. Both
   clinical and experimental multimodality studies, in humans and animals,
   will have to demonstrate an efficient use of the imaging information
   provided by the modalities to affect the future of medical imaging.

Abstract = {{On-going class action against America Online's use of free labour' has
   divided opinion about the management of `digital' labour in the `new'
   economy. Web-based systems of collaboration between and within firms and
   their customers, as well as customer engagement in product innovation,
   have underscored claims about the evaporation of traditional labour
   markets and labour processes as well as about (weakening) divisions
   between production and consumption. This has led to (exaggerated)
   debates about the contribution of `free' or `immaterial' labour to
   contemporary economies. This paper argues that while significant
   restructuring has changed traditional organisational forms, capital
   markets remain centralised and digital labour remains as regulated as
   other labour. As such, while labour cannot be fully commodified, digital
   labour is neither free or immaterial, because it is not the content of
   labour itself, but rather its relationship with capital that gives it
   `weight' and value.}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous computing and mobile technologies provide a new perspective
   for designing innovative outdoor learning experiences. The purpose of
   this study is to propose a formative assessment design for integrating
   PDAs into ecology observations. Three learning activities were conducted
   in this study. An action research approach was applied to continually
   revise the worksheet designs. Twenty-seven 5(th) and 6(th) graders'
   observation skills using PDAs, and their extended inquiry performance
   using e-diaries were assessed. An e-library, and online scoring and
   feedback systems were developed accordingly. The results suggest that
   the embedded formative assessment designs were effective for guiding and
   supporting the students' learning progress. The activity worksheets
   successfully helped the students focus their outdoor learning attention
   on the target tasks. The e-library provided reliable resources to
   clarify their observed descriptions, while the automatic scoring and
   feedback systems were especially helpful in sustaining the students'
   persistent effort. Most students demonstrated substantial improvements
   in their observation skills, and extended their inquiry abilities. The
   well designed online formative assessment embedded in the activity
   worksheet is very promising for PDA integrated learning.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to advanced developments in wireless technology, learners can now
   utilize digital learning websites at anytime and anywhere. Mobile
   learning captures more and more attention in the wave of digital
   learning. Evolving use of knowledge management plays an important role
   to enhance problem solving skills. Recently, innovative approaches for
   integrating knowledge management into practical teaching activities have
   been ignored. This is the first study to focus the design of a mobile
   knowledge management learning system that encourages learners to
   acquire, store, share, apply and create knowledge. When learners use
   different mobile devices to learn, larger screens perform better than
   smaller ones in the task performance and system working quality.
   Analyzed by learning achievements, the experimental group has a rather
   significant effect in adopting mobile knowledge management learning
   system than the control group of traditional classroom lectures. After
   evaluating the system acceptance by questionnaire survey, the experiment
   results indicate that (1) perceived easy to use can positively predict
   perceived usefulness by learners, (2) perceived easy to use and
   perceived usefulness can positively predict behavioral intention of the
   system acceptance. Perceived usefulness is the key factor for learners'
   willingness to be guided through the system's learning process.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, multimedia data grows rapidly due to the advanced multimedia
   capturing devices, such as digital video recorder, mobile camera and so
   on. Since conventional query-by-text retrieval cannot satisfy users'
   requirements in finding the desired videos effectively, content-based
   video retrieval is regarded as one of the most practical solutions to
   improve the retrieval quality. In addition, video retrieval using
   query-by-image is not successful in associating the videos with user's
   interest either. In this paper, we propose an innovative method to
   achieve the high quality of content-based video retrieval by discovering
   the temporal patterns in the video contents. On basis of the discovered
   temporal patterns, an efficient indexing technique and an effective
   sequence matching technique are integrated to reduce the computation
   cost and to raise the retrieval accuracy, respectively. Experimental
   results reveal that our approach is very promising in enhancing
   content-based video retrieval in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract = {{Growing interests in e-Government raise the question about the
   developmental stages of e-Government. Since the year 2000, a number of
   e-Government stage models have been suggested by international
   organizations, consulting firms, and individual researchers. However,
   these models seem to be incongruent with each other as these are based
   on different perspectives and use somewhat different metaphors. This
   presents a difficulty not only in understanding different research
   results, but also in planning future actions for e-Government. Without a
   common frame of reference for understanding the developmental stages and
   perspectives reflected in different models and stages, e-Government
   research may become fragmented and disconnected from each other. In this
   research, we have conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis of twelve
   e-Government stage models. Concepts, metaphors, and themes contained in
   these developmental models are extracted through a series of in-depth
   semantic analyses of descriptions and explanations. The first order
   concepts and themes are subjected to an interpretive synthesis
   identifying reciprocal relationships which in turn leads to the
   identification of implied metaphors and themes. Five metaphors are
   identified: presenting, assimilating, reforming, morphing and
   e-governance, while two underlying themes surface: citizen/service and
   operation/technology. These concepts, metaphors, and themes are
   synthesized into a common frame of reference using a reciprocal
   translation technique. A supportive line of argument is developed for
   this frame of reference so that different e-Government stage models can
   be translated into each other. This study contributes to current
   research through offering theoretical advances related to the stages of
   e-Government. Furthermore, the metaphors and themes identified in this
   study would be useful as a conceptual frame for researchers to evaluate
   and understand the development of e-Government, and as a base road map
   for practitioners in planning future e-Government projects. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Due to a system-inherent limitation, conventional synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) is incapable of imaging a wide swath with high geometric
   resolution. This restriction can be overcome by systems with multiple
   receive channels in combination with an additional digital signal
   processing network. So far, the application of such digital beamforming
   algorithms for high-resolution wide-swath SAR imaging has been
   restricted to multichannel systems in stripmap operation. However, in
   stripmap mode, the overall azimuth antenna length restricts the
   achievable swath width, thus preventing very wide swaths as requested by
   future SAR missions. Consequently, new concepts for ultrawide-swath
   imaging are needed. A promising candidate is a SAR system with multiple
   azimuth channels being operated in burst mode. This paper analyzes
   innovative ScanSAR and Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS)
   system concepts with regard to multichannel azimuth processing. For
   this, the theoretical analyses, performance figures, and SAR signal
   processing, which had previously been derived for multichannel stripmap
   mode, are extended to systems operating in burst modes. The
   investigations reveal that multichannel ScanSAR systems enable the
   imaging of ultrawide swaths with high azimuth resolution and compact
   antenna lengths. These considerations are embedded in a multichannel
   ScanSAR system design example to demonstrate its capability to image an
   ultrawide swath of 400 km with a high geometric resolution of 5 m. In a
   next step, this system is adapted to TOPS mode operation, including an
   innovative ``staircase{''} multichannel processing approach optimized
   for TOPS.}},

Abstract = {{The technology world is experiencing the emergence of a generation of
   massive-scale networked digital systems, performing complex operations
   that are partially out of the control of the systems' designers. This is
   the case, e. g., of pervasive computing environments, characterized by
   the proliferation of embedded electronic devices with communication and
   computing capabilities, able to network themselves forming a ``digital
   halo{''} surrounding the user in its daily activities. In this paper, we
   advocate the use of bottom-up design patterns, able to build on results
   in complex systems science and systems biology, for devising new
   solutions for designing and managing such environments. We also present
   a possible application to a novel cyberphysical ecosystem, that we call
   the Energy Web, arising from the combination of innovative information
   and communication technologies with distributed renewable energy

Abstract = {{Fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) with energy storage (ES) device(s) could
   result in improved lifetime, performance, fuel economy, and reduced
   cost. This paper presents the utilization of an ES device consisting of
   a supercapacitor bank for future electric vehicles with a hydrogen fuel
   cell (FC) as the main power source. The study mainly focuses on the
   innovative control law based on the flatness properties for a
   FC/supercapacitor hybrid power source. Utilizing the flatness principle,
   we propose simple solutions to the hybrid energy-management and
   stabilization problems. A supercapacitor module, as a high dynamic and
   high-power density device, functions to supply energy to regulate the
   dc-bus energy. The FC, as a slower dynamic source in this system,
   functions by supplying energy to keep the supercapacitor module charged.
   To ensure energy-efficient operation of the FC stack, the output current
   ripple of the FC stack is minimized by parallel boost converters with an
   interleaving switching technique for a high-frequency ripple by the
   supercapacitor for a low-frequency ripple. To authenticate the proposed
   control laws, a test bench is realized in the laboratory. The control
   algorithm (energy and current control loops) is digitally implemented by
   dSPACE controller DS1103. Experimental results with small-scale devices
   (a proton exchange membrane FC (PEMFC) of 500 W, 50 A, and 10 V and a
   supercapacitor bank of 250 F, 32 V, and 500 A) substantiate the
   excellent performance during load cycles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper measures complementarity between two information technology
   adoption decisions. Assembling establishment-level data of software
   usage, we develop a discrete-choice model where establishments choose
   whether to adopt Internet Protocol-based LAN operating systems and
   Internet applications simultaneously. We find that complementarities
   exist and are significant. By separately estimating the effects of
   switching costs and complementarities, we demonstrate that measured
   complementarities are not solely due to switching costs. We show that
   organizations using sophisticated Internet applications get the same
   payoff from simultaneous adoption than organizations using basic
   Internet applications. On the other hand, organizations with greater
   network complexity are more likely to adopt both applications
   simultaneously than organizations with lower network complexity. (C)

Abstract = {{Using data from 1176 Italian municipalities in 2005, we identify factors
   associated with the development of e-government services supplied by
   local public administrations (PAs). We show that the combination of
   internal competencies and context-specific factors is different when
   explaining decisions to start e-government activities vs. the intensity
   of such activities. Municipalities involved in e-government are larger,
   carry out more in-house ICT activities and are more likely to have
   intranet infrastructures than PAs that do not offer front-office
   digitized services. They are also generally located in regions having
   relatively large shares of firms using or producing ICTs, where many
   other municipalities offer digitized services, and where population
   density is relatively low. The range and quality of e-government
   services supplied by local PAs tend to increase with their stock of ICT
   competencies, their efforts to train workers, and with their ability to
   organise efficient interfaces with end-users. Moreover, there is a
   correlation between the range and quality of e-government services
   offered and the broadband infrastructure development in the area where
   local PAs are located. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Physician practices may adopt and use electronic prescribing
   (eRx) in response to mandates, incentives, and perceived value of the
   technology. Yet, for the most part, diffusion has been limited and
   geographically confined, and even when adopted, use of eRx in many
   practices has been low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that
   decision-makers in the practices possess different technological
   viewpoints (frames) related to eRx and these frames have formed the
   basis for the adoption decision, expectations about the technology, and
   patterns of use. In this study eRx technological frames were examined.
   Design Focus groups, direct observation, and semi-structured interviews
   were conducted with physicians, practice managers, nurses, and other
   medical staff.
   Measurements Focus groups were observed, taped, transcribed, and
   analyzed to reveal themes. These themes guided the observational visits
   and subsequent interviews. A triangulation process was used to confirm
   the findings.
   Results Seven frames emerged from the qualitative analysis ranging from
   positive to neutral to negative: (1) eRx as an efficiency and
   effectiveness enhancing tool; (2) eRx as the harbinger of new practices;
   (3) eRx as core to the clinical workflow; (4) eRx as an administrative
   tool; (5) eRx: the artifact; (6) eRx as a necessary evil; and (7) eRx as
   an unwelcome disruption.
   Conclusion Frames provide a unique perspective within which to explore
   the adoption and use of eRx and may explain why perceptions of value
   vary greatly. Some frames facilitate effective use of eRx while others
   impose barriers. Electronic prescribing can be viewed as a transitional
   technology on the path to greater digitization at the physician practice
   level. Understanding the impact of technological frames on the
   effectiveness of eRx use may provide lessons for the implementation of
   future health information technology innovations.}},

Abstract = {{P>As the largest and fastest growing transition economy in the world,
   China's entrance onto the global stage has been swift and dramatic. As
   such, almost every facet of entrepreneurship, from the identification of
   nascent opportunities to the challenges of managing triple-digit growth
   to the transformation of firms from dying to emerging industries, can be
   studied as natural experiments. The four papers in this issue are
   dedicated to exploring entrepreneurial innovation in the Chinese private
   economy. They include two clinical studies, one on the impact of the
   Beijing Olympics on entrepreneurship, and the other on the co-evolution
   of guanxi networks and entrepreneurial growth. Two studies test theories
   explaining the organizational drivers of innovation and
   entrepreneurship. In the best traditions, these four studies offer
   theoretical insights on the broader implications of entrepreneurship
   research in the Chinese context. We locate the findings offered by these
   four papers in the systems, organizational and social contexts of
   creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship research. Finally, we offer
   some suggestions for future research and ways in which advances in the
   theoretical conversation should proceed.}},

Abstract = {{This general survey of the economics of attention presents the major
   theoretical models for exploring the mechanisms for ``allocating{''}
   attention in an economy where it is a scarce resource. Writers have
   emphasized various means for attracting attention: the recognition,
   relevance, style and power of the emitter of information. The economics
   of attention subjects parties on the Internet and in the electronic
   media to two apparently opposite rationales. The first seeks to protect
   the attention of users from an information overload and improve its
   allocation. The second seeks to capture, for firms, the attention of
   customers or audiences in order to make money from it. Reconciling these
   two approaches is a challenge for innovation and an asset for competing
   in the digital economy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Cooperation between medical informatics, wireless communication and
   pre-hospital emergency services is essential for the optimal
   pre-hospital patient treatment. The use of technological innovations
   improves medical care in the pre-hospital setting with regard to the
   organization of an integrated center, which coordinates all parties
   involved for the patient's best interest.
   METHODS
   A dispatch center was developed in the city of Patras, in southwestern
   Greece, equipped with a Geographic Information System (GIS), which
   immediately points out the location of emergency vehicles (EVs) on a
   digital map depicting the city plan. Additionally, three ambulances of
   the National Center of Immediate Aid (NCIA) were equipped with a
   decentralized traffic management system for the vehicle's traffic
   priority at signaled junctions. The system consisted of a cellular-based
   (GSM) telemedicine module, a Global Positioning System (GPS) and a web
   camera system in the vehicle cabin.
   RESULTS
   The aforementioned system provided considerable assistance to the
   pre-hospital treatment first by selecting the ambulance closest to the
   accident's location and then by pinpointing the optimum route to the
   hospital, thus significantly reducing the overall transportation time.
   CONCLUSION
   The project's objective to coordinate emergency hospital departments
   involved in the treatment of trauma patients with other emergency
   services by utilizing high technology was achieved within this
   interdisciplinary effort.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Extensive literature identifies that the quality of surgery
   not only influences morbidity and mortality but also long-term survival
   and function. This mandates that we develop a system to capture this
   information on a real-time basis.
   METHODS: A synoptic surgical template for breast cancer was created;
   this was digitized and made available to all surgeons in Alberta.
   RESULTS: The data reference 1,392 breast cancer procedures. Ninety-one
   percent of reports were submitted within 1 hour and 97\% of reports were
   submitted within 24 hours. Fifty-two percent of reports were completed
   within 5 minutes. Information quality with respect to completeness of
   staging information was present in 89\%. Eighty-four percent complied
   with practice guidelines and 89\% of breast surgeons adopted the
   template. Seventy-five percent of users were moderately or highly
   satisfied with the system.
   CONCLUSIONS: The experience with the development and implementation of

Abstract = {{Significant changes have taken place in library and information science
   (US) education within the last decade; notably, LIS course content shows
   evidence of an infusion of information technologies and a broadening of
   the information domain. Strategic approaches to course-content change in
   US have ranged from natural evolution to complete revision. This study,
   which is centred in the natural evolution approach, was undertaken as
   part of a larger study at the end of the decade to find factors that
   influenced US faculty to adopt innovations in course content and examine
   the extent to which faculty adopters had integrated an innovation in the
   courses they taught. The innovation chosen for the study was complex,
   related to processes that add value to Internet resources. The processes
   that constituted the innovation were selection of Internet resources,
   organization of Internet resources, Internet reference services,
   interface design in digital libraries, and user analysis in digital
   libraries. The results of a survey of US faculty in the United States
   and Canada showed that there were no differences among faculty adopters
   in the extent to which they had integrated the various Internet
   resource-based value-added processes. However, faculty members who were
   early in adopting the innovation had also integrated the innovation to a
   greater extent than did late faculty adopters.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   The purpose of this review is to discuss transformational changes taking
   effect in biology and medicine and to place them in a broad historical
   context.
   Recent findings
   Recent findings suggest that in the new millennium, information
   technology will promote great changes in the study of biology and the
   practice of medicine. Digital information, more readily assessed,
   analyzed and manipulated, will be used to integrate large and disparate
   data sets. Systems biology emerging as an interdisciplinary field will
   focus on complex interactions in biological systems. Health information
   technology will make possible efficient healthcare that is predictive,
   personalized, preventive and participatory.
   Summary
   Systems biologists' understanding of biological information will promote
   conceptual insights and practical innovations. Predictive, preventive,
   personalized and participatory medicine will help patients and
   physicians make optimal treatment decisions.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, online auctioning has become one of the most
   successful business innovations. eBay is the global leader in this
   marketspace. This paper focuses on understanding bidder behaviour in
   order to provide insight into the design of information systems to
   support online auctions. In contrast to previous work that uses discrete
   bidding information, we implement a functional viewpoint of the bidding
   path. The similarity between paths is measured in the functional space
   using L(2) distance, which allows us to utilize K-means and PAM
   clustering methods. We apply this method to a large sample of
   collectible (1968 Camaro) and commodity (Digital Camera) eBay auction
   data to explore current bidding behaviours. We identify two different
   clusters of bidding behavior across both items which is associated with
   a specific winning percentage. Sniping exists as the dominant behaviour,
   but a hybrid approach has emerged (Sentry + Sniping).}},

Abstract = {{This brief introduces a new method for sampling of transient analog
   waveforms based on the parallel exponential filters. The signal is fed
   to the parallel network consisting of resistor-capacitor (RC) circuits,
   outputs of which are simultaneously sampled. We show that N previous
   samples of the input signal can be reconstructed from single output
   samples of N parallel RC circuits. The parallel sampling method
   increases the sampling rate of the data acquisition system by a factor
   of N. In particular, the method is useful in increasing the sampling
   rate of the Flash-type analog-to-digital VLSI circuits. We present the
   parallel RC network, develop the reconstruction algorithm, and briefly
   describe a variety of applications such as measurement and
   reconstruction of pulses produced by ultrawideband transmitters,
   radiation detectors, and pulse lasers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the use of new media by the BBC as a strategy for
   sustaining institutional legitimacy under a new regulative regime
   favouring open market competition. Focusing on the case of Capture
   Wales, a BBC Wales internet-based project that describes Wales from the
   citizens' autobiographical perspectives, and using a discourse analysis
   approach, we examine how the BBC re-positions itself in the emerging
   digital cultural sphere by using technology in the service of public
   participation. We observe a sense of empowerment in the opportunity
   participants were given arguing that such empowerment is no small thing,
   insofar as it clearly demonstrates that the public value produced
   through technological innovation lies in re-negotiating the power
   relations between institutional authority and ordinary people in
   allowing the latter to appropriate the ``means of media production{''}
   and to tell their own stories in public. Ultimately the article suggests
   that competing interests give rise to crucial tensions between
   ethico-political (serving society) and instrumental (justifying the
   licence fee) conceptions of benefit within Capture Wales, which in turn
   produce constant struggles over the visibility as well as the vision
   of/for this digital storytelling project by the stakeholders involved in
   its execution.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the design of aesthetic products is a process that requires a
   set of activities where digital models and physical mockups play a key
   role. Typically, these are modified (and built) several times before
   reaching the desired design, increasing the development time and,
   consequently, the final product cost. In this paper, we present an
   innovative design environment for computer-aided design (CAD) surface
   analysis. Our system relies on a direct visuo-haptic display system,
   which enables users to visualize models using a stereoscopic view, and
   allows the evaluation of sectional curves using touch. Profile curves
   are rendered using an haptic device that deforms a plastic strip, thanks
   to a set of actuators, to reproduce the curvature of the shape
   co-located with the virtual model. By touching the strip, users are able
   to evaluate shape characteristics, such as curvature or discontinuities
   (rendered using sound), and to assess the surface quality. We believe
   that future computer-aided systems (CAS)/CAD systems based on our
   approach will contribute in improving the design process at industrial
   level. Moreover, these will allow companies to reduce the product
   development time by reducing the number of physical mockups necessary
   for the product design evaluation and by increasing the quality of the
   final product, allowing a wider exploration and comparative evaluation
   of alternatives in the given time.}},

Abstract = {{The information systems field emerged as a new discipline of artificial
   science as a result of intellectual efforts to understand the nature and
   consequences of computer and communication technology in modern
   organizations. As the rapid development of digital technology continues
   to make computers and computing apart of everyday experiences, we are
   once again in need of a new discipline of the artificial. In this essay,
   I argue that the IS community must expand its intellectual boundaries by
   embracing experiential computing as an emerging field of inquiry in
   order to fill this growing intellectual void. Experiential computing
   involves digitally mediated embodied experiences in everyday activities
   through everyday artifacts that have embedded computing capabilities.
   Experiential computing is enabled by the mediation of four dimensions of
   human experiences ('time, space, actors, and artifacts) through digital
   technology. Drawing on a research framework that encompasses both
   behavioral and design sciences, six research opportunities that the IS
   research community can explore are suggested. Ultimately, I propose that
   the IS field return to its roots, the science of the artificial, by
   decisively expanding the scope of its inquiry and establishing a new
   domain of research on computing in everyday life experiences.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: We investigate an innovative and efficacious procedure for
   restoring wrist flexion, finger flexion, and hand sensation by passing
   the contralateral C7 through a subcutaneous tunnel across the anterior
   surface of the chest and neck.
   METHODS: Four patients (3 men, 1 woman) with total brachial plexus
   avulsion were treated from November 2005 to July 2007, their ages
   ranging from 18 to 36 years (average, 26 years). The operative delay was
   from 23 days to 5 months (mean, 2 months). The contralateral C7 nerve
   root was employed to repair the injured lower trunk or the C8-T1 spinal
   nerves via the subcutaneous tunnel across the anterior surface of the
   chest and neck. Direct neurorrhaphy was performed on the C8-T1 residual
   nerve roots in 2 patients. In the other 2 patients, a nerve graft of 4.5
   cm in length was used to restore function of the affected lower trunk.
   RESULTS: Postoperative electromyography at 26 and 38 months recorded
   compound muscle action potentials and motor unit potentials in the
   abductor digiti minimi and the flexor pollicis longus in all cases. On
   clinical examination digital flexion scored M1-M3, carpal flexion M2-M4,
   and hand sensation S1-S3.
   CONCLUSION: Transfer of the contralateral C7 to the lower trunk proved
   to be a safe and feasible procedure. Compared with the traditional
   transfer of the contralateral C7 to the median nerve, it might help
   patients gain better restoration of wrist flexion, finger flexion, and
   hand sensation.}},

Abstract = {{Applying Fidler's (1997) principles of mediamorphosis and Rogers's
   (2003) diffusion of innovations, this study examines a 17-year timeframe
   to assess publication patterns in and outlets for new media research
   that examines the internet and related digital technologies within the
   communication discipline. The five primary findings reveal that: 1)
   publication of new media research continues to diffuse, with the
   subfield likely to have reached a critical mass and passed through an
   adoption `take off' phase; 2) authors favor a concentrated set of title
   keyword terms to describe their research; 3) media-oriented journals
   publish approximately half of all new media articles; 4) a core set of
   14 communication-related journals currently publishes new media
   research; and 5) the principles of mediamorphosis and diffusion of
   innovations help to explain the emergence of the new media concentration
   within the communication discipline. We conclude that new media research
   focusing on the internet and related digital technologies is currently a
   formalized and self-sustaining area of study within the discipline.}},

Abstract = {{Since the mid-1990s, the mobile phone industry has sought widespread
   adoption of mobile data services, envisioning a new ``mobile
   internet{''} with its own complex value network delivered through
   smartphone terminals. With its iPhone, Apple rapidly gained smartphone
   market share while spurring widespread adoption of mobile data services
   in the United States.
   Here it is argued that the success of the iPhone was based on Apple's
   conception of the mobile Internet as being another modality of the
   existing wired Internet, and its leveraging of existing systems
   competencies. It is demonstrated how a promise to deliver the ``real
   internet{''} was a core part of Apple's original strategy, and that
   iPhone users quickly showed an interest in web browsing disproportionate
   to any other mobile phone in the US or Europe. From this, implications
   for the development of the mobile Internet in other countries are
   identified, as well as for future value creation and capture in mobile
   phone value networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Telemedicine has evolved rapidly in recent years to enable unprecedented
   access to digital medical data, such as with networked image
   distribution/sharing and online (distant) collaborative diagnosis,
   largely due to the advances in telecommunication and multimedia
   technologies. However, interactive collaboration systems which control
   editing of an object among multiple users are often limited to a simple
   ``locking{''} mechanism based on a conventional client/server
   architecture, where only one user edits the object which is located in a
   specific server, while all other users become viewers. Such systems fail
   to provide the needs of a modern day telemedicine applications that
   demand simultaneous editing of the medical data distributed in diverse
   local sites. In this study, we introduce a novel system for telemedicine
   applications, with its application to an interactive segmentation of
   volumetric medical images. We innovate by proposing a collaborative
   mechanism with a scalable data sharing architecture which makes users
   interactively edit on a single shared image scattered in local sites,
   thus enabling collaborative editing for, e.g., collaborative diagnosis,
   teaching, and training. We demonstrate our collaborative telemedicine
   mechanism with a prototype image editing system developed and evaluated
   with a user case study. Our result suggests that the ability for
   collaborative editing in a telemedicine context can be of great benefit
   and hold promising potential for further research.}},

Abstract = {{In order to increase the LHC luminosity, an innovative crystal based
   collimation system is being developed in the UA9 experiment: exploiting
   the well-known effect of channeling and the recently discovered volume
   reflection phenomenon, a short silicon bent crystal will be used to
   replace the traditional multi-stage collimation system to remove the
   beam halo particles. This idea will be tested with a 120 GeV/c proton
   beam on the LSS5 straight section at the SPS accelerator ring (CERN)
   using several crystal technologies and a high performance tracking
   system based on high resolution (5 pm) double-side microstrip silicon
   detectors. The first silicon detector will be positioned in a roman pot
   at about 50 m from the crystal, where the phase difference of 90
   maximizes the distance of the steered particles (due to the crystal)
   from the beam core; after around 20 m a second tracking station will be
   able to measure the steering angle. Each detector side is readout by
   three 128 channel VA1TA self-triggering ASICs, which contain a
   preamplifier, two shapers and a sample and hold circuit; the analog
   signals are digitized by one 10 MHz ADC (per ASIC) and are carried to
   the DAQ system (which is located on ground) by a series of fiber links
   (GOH). The DAQ will be completed by a Slow Controls system which will
   check the power supply voltages and currents and the roman pot pressures
   and temperatures. This paper gives an insight of the UA9 experiment,
   underlining the tracking system features and the first results of a
   silicon detector prototype in the SPS. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The results obtained by the Slim5 collaboration on a low material budget
   tracking silicon demonstrator put on a 12 GeV/c proton test beam at CERN
   are reported. Inside a reference telescope, two different and innovative
   detectors were placed for careful tests. The first was a 4k-Pixel Matrix
   of Deep N Well MAPS, developed in a 130 nm CMOS Technology, square
   pixels 50 pm wide, thinned down to 100 mu m and equipped with a digital
   sparsified readout running up to 50 MHz. The other was a high
   resistivity double sided silicon detector, 200 mu m thick, with short
   strips with 50 mu m pitch at 45 degrees angle to the detector's edge.
   The detectors were equipped with dedicated fast readout architectures
   performing on-chip data sparsification and providing the timing
   information for the hits. The criteria followed in the design of the
   pixel sensor and of the pixel readout architecture will be reviewed.
   Preliminary measurements of the pixel charge collection, track detection
   efficiencies and resolutions of pixel and strip sensors are
   discussed./// The data driven architecture of the readout chips has been
   fully exploited in the test beam by a data acquisition system able to
   collect on electronic board up to 2.5 Million events per second before
   triggering. By using a dedicated Associative Memory board, we were able
   to perform a level 1 trigger system, with minimal latency, identifying
   cleanly tracks traversing the detectors. System architecture and main
   performances are shown. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{FDA \& Digital Mammography Why Has FDA Required Full Field Digital
   Mammography Systems to Be Regulated as Potentially Dangerous Devices for
   More Than 10 Years?}},

Abstract = {{Digital mammography is routinely used in the US to screen asymptomatic
   women for breast cancer and currently over 50\% of US screening centers
   employ the technology. In spite of FDAs knowledge that digital
   mammography requires less radiation than film mammography and that its
   equivalence has been proven in a prospective randomized trial, the
   agency has failed to allow the technology market access via the 510(k)
   pre market clearance pathway. As a result of the restrictive Pre Market
   Approval process, only four suppliers have received FDA approval. The
   resulting lack of a competitive market has kept costs high, restricted
   technological innovation, and impeded product improvements as a result
   of PMA requirements. Meanwhile, at least twelve companies are on the
   market in the EU and the resulting competitive market has lowered costs
   and provided increased technological choice.
   A cultural change with new leadership occurred in the early 90's at FDA.
   The historical culture at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health
   of collaboration and education gave way to one characterized by a lack
   of reliance on outside scientific expertise, tolerance of decision
   making by unqualified reviewers, and an emphasis on enforcement and
   punishment. Digital mammography fell victim to this cultural change and
   as a result major innovations like breast CT and computer aided
   detection technologies are also withheld from the market.
   The medical device law, currently under review by the Institute of
   Medicine, should be amended by the Congress so that new technologies can
   be appropriately classified in accordance with the risk based assessment
   classification system detailed in Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug,
   and Cosmetic Act. A panel of scientific experts chartered by the NIH or
   IOM should determine the classification appropriate for new technologies
   that have no historical regulatory framework. This would be binding on
   FDA. Unless the law is changed we will likely again experience
   additional debacles similar to that of digital mammography where
   important technology has been withheld from millions of women for more
   than a decade.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling reactor power without any manual support is becoming more
   and more important. The READIG project (READIG = Reactor Instrumentation
   and Digital Control) power control system installed in unit 2 of the
   Philippsburg nuclear power station KKP 2) requires no manual
   intervention except for specific strategy criteria settings. It was even
   possible to eliminate the power distribution set points. With minor
   adaptations, this concept can be applied in other PWR plants as well.
   KKP 2 is a PWR plant with particularly sophisticated core charges; as a
   consequence, the I\&C systems were adapted accordingly. The increase in
   integral reactor power and the low-leakage core charges are the main
   reasons for lower limiting margins, especially in peak limiting. The
   standard control concept was supplemented in such a way that a more
   precise fine control concept for power distribution in the full-load
   regime is achieved.
   The READIG project fully utilizes the possibilities offered by digital
   TXS Technology, which is why use is also made of physical
   parameterization. The new power distribution control concept has these
   advantages:
   Operation at small peak-/DNB-reactor output limitation margins.
   Stable control without manual intervention also in load cycles and in
   the frequency control mode.
   Simplified operation due to omission of the power distribution set
   point.
   Reduction to zero of the frequency of L-bank steps at constant power
   with superimposed frequency control mode.
   Reduction to zero of the frequency of D-bank steps at constant power
   with superimposed frequency control mode.
   Lower quantities of demineralized water to be fed at constant power with
   superimposed frequency control mode (+/- 1\%).}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{22-35}},

Abstract = {{Digital video production in schools is often theorised, researched and
   written about in two ways: either as a part of media studies practice or
   as a technological innovation, bringing new, ``creative{''}, digital
   tools into the curriculum. Using frameworks for analysis derived from
   multimodality theory, new literacy studies and theories of embodied
   identity, this study examines a video production made by two children
   who were taking part in a video project on the theme of
   self-representation and identity. Evidence was collected in the form of
   production notes, video interviews and the media text itself. The
   findings suggest that this way of working in new media can be thought of
   as a new literacy practice, metaphorically conceived as a form of
   ``curatorship{''} of children's own lives in the uses of multimodal
   editing tools for the intertextual organisation of digital media assets
   and their subsequent exhibition to peer groups and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of normalized materials, promoters and users led
   to a significant amount and diversity of databases and software for
   material selection, presenting differentiating abilities for the
   materials selection process.
   The aim of the present study is the critical analysis of the digital
   tools for material selection, trying to answer to a few important
   questions, such as What kind of digital tools exist? How do they work?
   What properties determine the selection? and What kind of information
   results from the selection?
   To materialize this useful and innovative investigation, a
   bibliographical search was carried out on selection methods, databases,
   and software for material selection. About three hundred software,
   databases and website references were collected and, after a previous
   analysis, 87 were selected for this study.
   All the relevant information about digital tools was organized in
   tables, including the name, user conditions, number of materials,
   ``materials family or class{''}, selection paths, website address,
   resulting information and a descriptive text. The digital tool's data on
   the tables were comparatively analysed. The capabilities and limitations
   of the existent digital tools, together with the aspects to be
   developed, are discussed.
   The availability of the information here reported will be very helpful
   for designers, engineer students and all kind of professionals
   performing materials selection for product design. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The current work is focused on the implementation of a robust multimedia
   application for watermarking digital images, which is based on an
   innovative spread spectrum analysis algorithm for watermark embedding
   and on a content-based image retrieval technique for watermark
   detection. The existing highly robust watermark algorithms are applying
   ``detectable watermarks{''} for which a detection mechanism checks if
   the watermark exists or not (a Boolean decision) based on a watermarking
   key. The problem is that the detection of a watermark in a digital image
   library containing thousands of images means that the watermark
   detection algorithm is necessary to apply all the keys to the digital
   images. This application is non-efficient for very large image
   databases. On the other hand ``readable{''} watermarks may prove weaker
   but easier to detect as only the detection mechanism is required. The
   proposed watermarking algorithm combine's the advantages of both
   ``detectable{''} and ``readable{''} watermarks. The result is a fast and
   robust multimedia application which has the ability to cast readable
   multibit watermarks into digital images. The watermarking application is
   capable of hiding 2(14) different keys into digital images and casting
   multiple zero-bit watermarks onto the same coefficient area while
   maintaining a sufficient level of robustness.}},

Abstract = {{This article embraces the concept of technology identity as an
   innovative theoretical and methodological approach to study the digital
   divide. Reporting on qualitative data taken from a mixed-method study,
   the analytical approach goes beyond an access and skills perspective in
   measuring digital inequities. Narratives collected from students
   demonstrate how powerful sociocultural influences, such as family
   practices and access to a quality K-12 education, contribute to the
   development of a technology identity. The stories outlined in this
   article offer illustrative accounts of how holding a particular
   technology identity impacts the academic and social life of college
   students. Taken together, the narratives highlight the role of schools
   and universities as institutions which are perpetuating - rather than
   resisting - inequalities associated with the digital divide.}},

Abstract = {{This article provides a summary of the most notable results of a
   research project with the aim of analysing the process of educational
   integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in
   teaching and learning practices of four primary and secondary schools in
   the Canary Islands. The research team has planned and developed
   ethnographic methodologies in which a longitudinal study has been
   performed, over two years, with participating schools in the Medusa
   Project (a government educational project to provide digital technology
   to all schools, and to train teachers for ICT educational use, in the
   Canary Islands). We selected four schools (three of Early Childhood and
   Elementary Education and one of Secondary Education). Data collection
   was conducted through different qualitative techniques: interviews (with
   the management team, the ICT coordinator of the centre and the teaching
   staff), via classroom observations, and by conducting focus groups with
   students. The research team has tried to identify the most important
   effects of the Medusa Project, and specially, of ICT regarding
   innovation in school organisation, in the classroom teaching, in the
   student learning environment and in the professional practice of
   teachers. The results are broadly similar to studies conducted in other
   international contests. The findings indicate that ICT incorporated
   sonic organisational changes both at centre and classroom level, but not
   necessarily pedagogical innovation in teaching practices. Also, the
   figure of the ICT teacher and coordinator is an important catalyst in
   the process of using digital technologies in a pedagogical manner in
   every school.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This article presents data from research which focused on
   evaluating educational innovation processes, which arc characterized by
   the use of digital technologies in a significant way. Our aim is to
   identify the changes generated by the pedagogical use of ICT
   (Information and Communication Technologies), seeking to describe and
   assess the organisational dimensions as well as those related to teacher
   training, teaching practices and learning outcomes.
   Methodology: The research team monitored the innovative process over a
   year at four schools, following the multiple case studies methodology
   and incorporating different strategies (interviews, questionnaires,
   monitoring guidelines, assessment reports and observations) to obtain
   information and analysing data of both quantitative and qualitative
   nature.
   Results: The evaluation process carried out in schools is described; the
   overall strengths and weaknesses are shown - given that there are many
   similarities in the schools (such as importance of provision of
   resources, high motivation of teaching staff, the training effort made
   by teachers, cooperative and positive working atmosphere, family support
   and student satisfaction) - and, finally, a comprehensive analysis of
   results, including opinions of students, their families, teachers and
   some learning outcomes (achieved objectives, skills, motivation,
   satisfaction) is presented.
   Discussion and conclusions: ICT innovation processes require some
   conditions related to infrastructure, personnel, leadership,
   organization, motivation, personal effort, etc. without which these
   processes slow down or do not take place at all. The analysis made in
   these schools has enabled the research team to highlight the main
   strengths and weaknesses of these processes, and make suggestions for
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{This Article proposes a framework tailoring the fair use doctrine
   specifically for technology cases. At the inception of the twenty-first
   century, information technologies have become increasingly central to
   the U.S. economy. Not surprisingly, complex copyright cases involving
   speech technologies, such as DVRs, MP3 devices, Google Book Search, and
   You Tube, have also increased. Yet existing copyright law, developed
   long before digital technologies, is ill prepared to handle the
   complexities that these technology cases pose. The key question often
   turns not on prima facie infringement, but on the defense of fair use,
   which courts have too often relegated to extremely fact-specific
   decisions. The downside to this ad hoc adjudication of fair use is that
   it leads to an uncertainty over what is permissible that may impede
   innovation in speech technologies. This Article addresses this ongoing
   problem by proposing that courts recognize a specific type of fair use
   technological fair use and tailor the four fair use factors accordingly.
   Technological fair use is supported not only by a synthesis of existing
   case law and economic theory, but also, more importantly, by the
   constitutional underpinnings of the First Amendment and the Copyright
   and Patent Clause.}},

Abstract = {{Facing uncertainty about whether to adopt a new technology, firms rely
   on both external and internal sources of information. Firms may learn
   vicariously about the desirability of adoption; a large body of research
   has demonstrated a tendency for firms to imitate rival adopters.
   Organizations with multiple units may also learn from their own
   experience once an initial unit of the firm has adopted. This article
   uses data on the establishment of websites by consumer magazines during
   the early internet era to test the hypothesis that multi-unit firms pay
   less attention to rivals after an initial unit of the firm has adopted.
   Consistent with this hypothesis, it is found that the influence of
   rivals drops sharply following the initial adoption. One explanation for
   the shift is that vicarious learning becomes less valuable once richer
   information becomes available from internal sources.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In telemedicine, technology is used to deliver services.
   Because of this, it is expected that various actors other than those
   involved in traditional care are involved in and need to cooperate, to
   deliver these services. The aim of this study was to establish a clear
   understanding of these actors and their roles and interrelationships in
   the delivery of telemedicine. A video teleconsultation service is used
   as a study case. Methods: A business modeling approach as described in
   the Freeband Business Blueprint Method was used. The method brings
   together the four domains that make up a business model, that is,
   service, technology, organization, and finance, and covers the
   integration of these domains. The method uses several multidisciplinary
   workshops, addressing each of the four domains. Results: Results of the
   four domains addressed showed that (1) the video teleconsultation
   service is a store and put-forward video teleconsult for healthcare
   providers. The service is accepted and has added value for the quality
   of care. However, the market is small; (2) the technology consists of a
   secured Internet Web-based application, standard personal computer,
   broadband Internet connection, and a digital camera; (3) a new role and
   probably entity, responsible for delivering the integrated service to
   the healthcare professionals, was identified; and finally (4) financial
   reimbursement for the service delivery is expected to be most successful
   when set up through healthcare insurance companies. Pricing needs to
   account for the fee of healthcare professionals as well as for technical
   aspects, education, and future innovation. Discussion: Implementation of
   the video teleconsult service requires multidisciplinary cooperation and
   integration. Challenging aspects are the small market size and the slow
   implementation speed, among others. This supports the argument that
   accumulation of several telemedicine applications is necessary to make
   it financially feasible for at least some of the actors.}},

Abstract = {{The CMS silicon microstrip tracker readout system is unprecedented in
   size, with over nine million channels. It is an analogue readout system,
   implemented using CMOS ASICs and linear, semiconductor laser
   transmitters which send pulse height data off-detector for digitisation
   and the first level of data processing. The basic components which
   define the architecture originated in R\&D projects in the early 1990s
   and were crucial in allowing this system to be realised. The
   availability of several key technologies was critical to achieving the
   design preferences, and the components and technologies were utilised
   also to build the control and monitoring system and, later, to implement
   critical elements of other CMS sub-detector systems. The background to
   the technology choices and early development of the system is described
   and an attempt is made to draw some lessons which could be relevant for
   the future.}},

Title = {{Differential effects of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists on central and
   peripheral blood pressure at rest and during exercise}},

Abstract = {{center dot At rest, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists lower peripheral
   systolic blood pressure (SBP) but have less effect on central SBP.
   center dot Effects of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists on central and
   peripheral blood pressure during exercise are unknown.
   WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
   center dot This study shows that acute beta-blockade in healthy
   normotensive subjects markedly reduces peripheral SBP by similar to 20
   mmHg during moderate exercise but has no significant effect on central
   SBP.
   center dot The differential effect of beta-blockade on central and
   systolic blood pressure is not completely explained by reduction in
   heart rate. Beta-blockade may blunt dilation of muscular arteries,
   influencing peripheral amplification during exercise.
   BACKGROUND
   Differential effects of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (beta-ARB) on
   central and peripheral blood pressure may relate to change in heart rate
   and/or vasodilator tone and thus be exaggerated during exercise.
   AIMS
   To examine acute effects of selective and nonselective beta-ARB on
   central and peripheral blood pressure, cardiac output and peripheral
   vascular resistance during exercise.
   METHODS
   Healthy volunteers (n = 20, 18 men, 19-54 years) received propranolol 80
   mg, bisoprolol 20 mg, and placebo 1 h before bicycle ergometry (50, 75
   and 100 W each for 3 min) in a randomized, cross-over study. Cardiac
   output was determined by pulmonary uptake of soluble and inert gas
   tracers (InnoCor, Innovision). Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) was
   determined from the late systolic shoulder of the digital artery
   pressure waveform (Finometer, Finopres).
   RESULTS
   At rest, both beta-ARB reduced brachial but not central SBP (compared
   with placebo). During exercise, beta-ARB reduced brachial SBP
   (reductions of 19.9 +/- 4.3 mmHg and 23.2 +/- 2.7 mmHg for propranolol
   and bisoprolol, respectively, at 100 W, each P < 0.0001) but not central
   SBP. The difference between peripheral and central SBP was reduced,
   relative to that during placebo, by 21.5 mmHg (95\% confidence interval
   8.8, 34.1) and 26.4 mmHg (18.1, 34.8) for propranolol and bisoprolol,
   respectively, at 100 W (each P < 0.01). There was no significant effect
   of beta-ARB on diastolic blood pressure or peripheral vascular
   resistance.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Despite reducing brachial blood pressure, acute beta-adrenoreceptor
   blockade in man at rest and during exercise does not reduce central
   blood pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific studies using direct agricultural air quality (AAQ)
   measurement have experienced revolutionary changes since such a study
   was first reported in the early 1950s. Comprehensive AAQ research with
   multi-institutional or international collaboration, long-term
   monitoring, and multi-pollutant measurement has been conducted with
   greater frequency. On-site computer system (OSCS), consisting of data
   acquisition hardware, a personal computer, and custom-developed AAQ
   research software has become an important tool in these studies. The
   role of the OSCS has been expanded from exclusively data acquisition to
   a combination of data acquisition, control, regular and advanced data
   processing, and communication. This paper studied the general and
   specific requirements of OSCS in AAQ research and introduced a system
   with new methodology and technology for high level quality assurance and
   quality control (QAQC).
   Data acquisition in AAQ studies is needed for five main categories of
   instruments and sensors: pollutant concentrations, air exchange, weather
   conditions, building status, and measurement system status. Regular data
   processing consists of converting electrical signals to engineering
   units, averaging data over a given period of time, and performing data
   correction. Advanced data processing includes calculating
   location-shared analyzers and sensors (LSAS) data and instrument
   calibration data and generating daily reports in real-time or upon user
   requests. The primary control needs in AAQ research centers around the
   LSAS using multi-point air sampling system. Controls for sampling tubing
   heating and equipment cooling are often required. Computer
   communications to monitor system status, deliver alarms and data, and
   provide remote diagnosis and controls help to reduce operation costs and
   increase research quality and data completeness.
   An OSCS that offered flexibility, high capacity, user-friendliness. and
   high level QAQC was developed for field and laboratory AAQ research. A
   total of 29 OSCSs have been built and used in various AAQ studies in 13
   states in USA for handling a total of more than 3.0 billion data points.
   The system adapted a set of data processing algorithms as well as some
   novel features, including All-data Display and Dynamic Run-time
   Configuration (DDRC), Digital Output DDRC, real-time sampling system
   monitoring and protection, Global Channel, traceable configuration, and
   post-measurement data processing. The system also integrated two
   stand-alone instruments, an Innova multi-gas analyzer and a 7-port
   Environics gas diluter, which are popular in AAQ research. The
   strengths, weaknesses, and future development of the system are also
   discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since the early days of digital communication, hidden Markov models
   (HMMs) have now been also routinely used in speech recognition,
   processing of natural languages, images, and in bioinformatics. In an
   HMM (X(t), Y(t))(t >= 1), observations X(1), X(2), ... are assumed to be
   conditionally independent given a Markov process Y(1), Y(2), ..., which
   itself is not observed; moreover, the conditional distribution of X(t)
   depends solely on Y(t). Central to the theory and applications of HMM is
   the Viterbi algorithm to find a maximum a posteriori probability ( MAP)
   estimate e(e(1:T)) = (e(1), e(2), ... , e(T)) of Y(1:T) given observed
   data e(1:T). Maximum a posteriori paths are also known as the Viterbi
   paths, or alignments. Recently, attempts have been made to study
   behavior of the Viterbi alignments when T -> infinity. Thus, it has been
   shown that in some cases a well-defined limiting Viterbi alignment
   exists. While innovative, these attempts have relied on rather strong
   assumptions and involved proofs which are existential. This work proves
   the existence of infinite Viterbi alignments in a more constructive
   manner and for a very general class of HMMs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we strive towards the development of efficient techniques
   in order to segment document pages resulting from the digitization of
   historical machine-printed sources. This kind of documents often suffer
   from low quality and local skew, several degradations due to the old
   printing matrix quality or ink diffusion, and exhibit complex and dense
   layout. To face these problems, we introduce the following innovative
   aspects: (i) use of a novel Adaptive Run Length Smoothing Algorithm
   (ARLSA) in order to face the problem of complex and dense document
   layout, (ii) detection of noisy areas and punctuation marks that are
   usual in historical machine-printed documents, (iii) detection of
   possible obstacles formed from background areas in order to separate
   neighboring text columns or text lines, and (iv) use of skeleton
   segmentation paths in order to isolate possible connected characters.
   Comparative experiments using several historical machine-printed
   documents prove the efficiency of the proposed technique. (C) 2009

   interactions between mandrel and die geometries, processing parameters
   and viscoelastic properties of the polymeric material. Moreover, parison
   size changes with time due to sagging effect. An innovative, contactless
   and on-line measurement technique of the parison as it is extruded is
   shown to be an effective tool to measure precisely parison diameter and
   thickness and to capture dimensional changes during time. This technique
   employs laser lighting of the parison and hinges on the refractive
   properties of molten polymer. Images taken with a digital camera are
   processed to give a precise measurement of diameter and thickness, at
   different time step during extrusion. Thus, parison swell and sag have
   been recorded for a commercial HDPE. Influence of processing parameters
   such as the rotational speed screw speed or die gap width can be brought
   forward. Moreover, numerical simulations of the parison formation
   process have been carried out, with an integral viscoelastic
   constitutive equation.}},

Abstract = {{Information technologies are used across all stages of the construction
   process, and are crucial in the delivery of large projects. Drawing on
   detailed research on a construction megaproject, we take a
   practice-based approach to examining the practical and theoretical
   tensions between existing ways of working and the introduction of new
   coordination tools in this paper. We analyze the new hybrid practices
   that emerge, using insights from actor-network theory to articulate the
   delegation of actions to material and digital objects within ecologies
   of practice. The three vignettes that we discuss highlight this
   delegation of actions, the ``plugging{''} and ``patching{''} of
   ecologies occurring across media and the continual iterations of working
   practices between different types of media. By shifting the focus from
   tools to these wider ecologies of practice, the approach has important
   managerial implications for the stabilization of new technologies and
   practices and for managing technological change on large construction
   projects. We conclude with a discussion of new directions for research,
   oriented to further elaborating on the importance of the material in
   understanding change.}},

Abstract = {{The study examines the professional development of junior-high-school
   teachers participating in the Israeli ``Katom{''} (Computer for Every
   Class, Student and Teacher) Program, begun in 2004. Athree-circle
   support and training model was developed for teachers' professional
   development. The first circle applies to all teachers in the program;
   the second, to all teachers at individual schools; the third to teachers
   of specific disciplines. The study reveals and describes the attitudes
   of science teachers to the integration of laptop computers and to the
   accompanying professional development model. Semi-structured interviews
   were conducted with eight science teachers from the four schools
   participating in the program. The interviews were analyzed according to
   the internal relational framework taken from the information that arose
   from the interviews. Two factors influenced science teachers'
   professional development: (1) Introduction of laptops to the teachers
   and students. (2) The support and training system. Interview analysis
   shows that the disciplinary training is most relevant to teachers and
   they are very interested in belonging to the professional science
   teachers' community. They also prefer face-to-face meetings in their
   school. Among the difficulties they noted were the new learning
   environment, including control of student computers, computer
   integration in laboratory work and technical problems. Laptop computers
   contributed significantly to teachers' professional and personal
   development and to a shift from teacher-centered to student-centered
   teaching. One-to-One laptops also changed the schools' digital culture.
   The findings are important for designing concepts and models for
   professional development when introducing technological innovation into
   the educational system.}},

Abstract = {{Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a common and often
   devastating condition that requires prompt neurosurgical evaluation and
   intervention. Modern management of aSAH involves a multidisciplinary
   team of subspecialists, including vascular neurosurgeons, neurocritical
   care specialists and, frequently, neurointerventional radiologists. This
   team is responsible for stabilizing the patient on presentation,
   diagnosing the offending ruptured aneurysm, securing the aneurysm, and
   managing the patient through a typically prolonged and complicated
   hospital course. Surgical intervention has remained a definitive
   treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms since the early 1900s. Over
   the subsequent decades, many innovations in microsurgical technique,
   adjuvant maneuvers, and intraoperative and perioperative medical
   therapies have advanced the care of patients with aSAH. This report
   focuses on the modern surgical management of patients with aSAH.
   Following a brief historical perspective on the origin of aneurysm
   surgery, the topics discussed include the timing of surgical
   intervention after aSAH, commonly used surgical approaches and
   craniotomies, fenestration of the lamina terminalis, intraoperative
   neurophysiological monitoring, intraoperative digital subtraction and
   fluorescent angiography, temporary clipping, deep hypothermic
   cardiopulmonary bypass, management of acute hydrocephalus, cerebral
   revascularization, and novel clip configurations and microsurgical
   techniques. Many of the topics highlighted in this report represent some
   of the more debated techniques in vascular neurosurgery. The popularity
   of such techniques is constantly evolving as new studies are performed
   and data about their utility become available.}},

Abstract = {{A series of mobile phone prototypes, called The Swarm, have been
   developed in response to the user needs identified in a 3-year empirical
   study of young people's use of mobile phones. The prototypes take cues
   from user led innovation and provide multiple avatars that allow
   individuals to define and manage their own virtual identity. This paper
   briefly maps the evolution of the prototypes and then describes how the
   pre-defined, colour-coded avatars in the latest version are being given
   greater context and personalization through the use of digital images.
   This not only gives `serendipity a nudge' by allowing groups to come
   together more easily, but also provides contextual information that can
   reduce gratuitous contact.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I ask the question: Does the output-mix of countries
   change in response to changes in factor endowments? If so: How long does
   it take? Using data on capital, as well as skilled and unskilled labour
   employed in three-digit International Standard Industrial Classification
   (ISIC) manufacturing industries for a sample of 27 developing and
   developed countries over the 1973-1990 period, I find that the
   output-mix of countries does not change in response to endowment
   changes, even after 15 years. This answer raises another question: How
   then do countries absorb changes in factor endowments? The data show
   that in both the short and long runs, an increase in the supply of a
   production factor reduces its rate of return and makes it more
   intensively used in all sectors of the economy: changes in production
   techniques. In the long run, the point estimate is that the reduction in
   the rate of return is more than 50\% larger than in the short run. This
   is consistent with induced innovations being predominantly biased
   towards the scarce factor.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the impact of trade integration on plant TFP using Chilean
   plant-level data (1982-1999) and 3-digit bilateral trade flows. Our
   contribution is to disentangle the impact of export and import barriers,
   estimated as border effects within a multilateral context. A fall in
   export barriers is positively correlated with plant productivity in
   traded sectors. The reduction of import barriers, however, can only be
   associated to productivity improvements in export-oriented sectors. In
   import-competing sectors a robust positive correlation shows up between
   plant productivity and protection. We then test several channels linking
   trade integration and firm productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Cinema and 3D pictures are the latest innovations for cinemas.
   Audio reproduction on the other hand, is nearly the same as it was in
   the late 1980s, when discrete multichannel audio was introduced. Even
   uncompressed storage and distribution, as well as the addition of a few
   more channels, did not change things significantly. Wave Field Synthesis
   (WFS) can change the situation because it offers spatial audio as a
   complement to 3D pictures. Using WFS, it is possible to focus sound
   sources inside the audience area. The sweet spot limitation of
   traditional multichannel audio no longer applies. On the production
   side, a complete new tool set is available for sound designers and
   mixers, based on object-based audio post-production. Although the basic
   principles of Wave Field Synthesis have been well-known for a long time,
   recent developments have made it possible to bring this technology into
   today's theaters. This article describes the current state of WFS in
   motion picture sound, as well as its unique properties and the benefit
   of object-based reproduction in the audio post-production process.}},

Title = {{Using digital imaging to assess spectral solar-optical properties of
   complex fenestration materials: A new approach in video-goniophotometry}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{4, SI}},

Abstract = {{A large variety of angularly selective fenestration systems have been
   developed in the past two decades and show great potential in improving
   visual comfort while reducing energy consumption, especially when
   combined with spectrally selective properties. Such systems include
   light-redirecting glazing, shading, film coatings, reflectors and
   others. To assess the potential of these systems accurately and
   reliably, one needs to be able to predict in detail how they modify the
   energy, direction and spectral make-up of solar radiation. For this
   assessment, spectral (wavelength-dependent) Bidirectional Transmission
   or Reflection Distribution Functions are used, usually referred to as
   BTDFs or BRDFs, or more generally BSDFs for Scattering Functions.
   To enable a faster, cheaper, and continuous investigation of these
   properties over most of the solar spectrum (400-1700 nm), an innovative
   goniospectrometric instrument has been created, relying on digital
   imaging, on light collection by an ellipsoidal half-transparent mirror,
   and on a filtering method in the visible range to generate spectral
   radiometric BSDFs. This so-called Heliodome instrument is described in
   this paper. It enables the performance of new fenestration technologies
   to be assessed in terms of lighting and solar gains management
   potential. The rotating table also serves as a heliodon, an
   architectural design tool for visualizing sunlight distribution inside a
   scale model and performing analyses on appropriate sun control
   strategies. The Heliodome's major innovations compared to other devices
   are to enable an analysis of both the visible and the near-infrared
   portions of the solar spectrum, to provide spectral as well as
   photometric light distribution data, and to ensure a continuous
   investigation of the transmitted or reflected light in a time-efficient
   way. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Peer-to-Peer networking technology and related innovations have had a
   major impact on the music and motion picture industries. While digital
   technology has improved the quality of audio and video recordings and
   decreased distribution costs, it has also made unauthorized duplication
   of copyrighted material and its transmission over the Internet easier.
   The media industry attributes an erosion of its sales after 1999 to the
   illegal copying and sharing of digital files and has taken steps to
   tighten copyright laws and prosecute violators. Others attribute the
   downturn to a lack of innovative products and futile efforts by the
   industry to retain a business model made obsolete by technological
   innovation. In the meantime, unauthorized file-sharing via Peer-to-Peer
   networks continues unabated and its real financial impact on the
   industry remains unclear. The market perceives illegal file-sharing to
   be a significant threat to the long-term profitability of the media
   industry and regards current legal initiatives to protect its
   intellectual capital as beneficial. This article discusses several
   strategies and business models that the media industry may consider to
   respond to the current threat and better cater to changing customer
   tastes.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, the music industry has become the paradigm of the
   transformations that has carried the development of the productive
   system towards Informational Capitalism. Of the hand of a quick
   technological innovation, not always produced by companies, new forms of
   production and consumption of music have been developed. This new
   environment has dragged the phonographic companies to a crisis of sales
   that has forced a radical transformation for the sake of survival. One
   of these business transformations has been the intensification of the
   management of copyright. This intensification occurs mainly in two
   areas: the extension of the protection deadlines and the expansion of
   the fields and rights management companies-driven activities. This
   article is intended to answer the question that lies behind the
   ambitions to modify the productive system: how create cultural
   industries capable, at the time, to maintain a common and democratic
   culture and also to develop initiatives to generate capital gains to
   musicians, songwriters, and other music professionals. We will use data
   from a research that have conducted three group interviews segmented by
   age. The aim is to cross the views and experiences of consumers with the
   analysis of the evolution of music industry organization. From the
   observation that the younger generations are installed in a culture of
   free music, we explore what new business opportunities appear and how
   are received from the conflicting positions already referred.}},

Abstract = {{The discourse stating that the profound changes in ICT of the last
   decade have also radically altered the way our students learn, and that
   they can all now be considered digital natives, is increasingly
   prevalent. However, this paper argues that these changes are not as
   immediate, automatic or beneficial as the dominant political and
   technological discourse on the benefits of ICT would have us believe,
   and that they give rise to many different situations that characterize
   university teaching and learning practice. Using the ratings of three
   Likert questionnaires on information processing and communication in
   three different environments (Moodle, Tuenti and the classroom itself),
   and applying multivariate techniques ( factor analysis and cluster
   analysis), we have found four clusters: pro-ICT students, anti-ICT
   students, listless student and neutral student. The presence of such
   segments of students allows us to conclude that, although computers are
   nowadays taken for granted in Higher Education classrooms, we are
   perhaps overestimating both the real impact of ICT on teaching and
   students' digital competencies, and that this false perception of
   reality benefits technology vendors but not methodological and pedagogic
   innovation, which can only be achieved through the necessary reflection
   on education matters from educational principles.}},

Abstract = {{Communications networks are the basic infrastructure of the digital age.
   The future of news, business, interaction, entertainment, health care,
   education, and many other areas will be built on top of these platforms.
   Network infrastructure is the dividing line between the old physical
   economy of scarcity and the new information economy of abundance. The
   legal framework for networks will therefore shape not only the
   telecommunications businesses that provide connectivity, but also the
   applications, services, content, and user activities that depend on it.
   Unfortunately, communications networks are entering a vast legal gray
   area. As telecommunications and media converge into the Internet, they
   are escaping from the regulatory frameworks of the Communications Act of
   1934. In its effort to engage the Internet, the Federal Communications
   Commission (FCC), the regulatory agency responsible for communications,
   has backed its way into a dead-end statutory theory that provides
   insufficient basis for effective regulation.
   The solution lies within the Communications Act itself but not where the
   FCC and others have been looking. The essential requirement for a
   flourishing network-infrastructure platform is open interconnection. By
   locating its authority to regulate the Internet in its obligations to
   oversee interconnection under Title II of the Communications Act, the
   FCC could reorient communications law for the challenges of a new era.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses principal issues of the ECG interpretation
   adaptivity in a distributed surveillance network. In the age of
   pervasive access to wireless digital communication, distributed
   biosignal interpretation networks may not only optimally solve difficult
   medical cases, but also adapt the data acquisition, interpretation, and
   transmission to the variable patient's status and availability of
   technical resources. The background of such adaptivity is the innovative
   use of results from the automatic ECG analysis to the seamless remote
   modification of the interpreting software. Since the medical relevance
   of issued diagnostic data depends on the patient's status, the
   interpretation adaptivity implies the flexibility of report content and
   frequency. Proposed solutions are based on the research on human experts
   behavior, procedures reliability, and usage statistics. Despite the
   limited scale of our prototype client-server application, the tests
   yielded very promising results: the transmission channel occupation was
   reduced by 2.6 to 5.6 times comparing to the rigid reporting mode and
   the improvement of the remotely computed diagnostic outcome was achieved
   in case of over 80\% of software adaptation attempts.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative sensor technique has been developed to detect water leaks
   in supply pipes, especially in cases where the existing prevailing
   methods do not offer reliable solution, such as in PVC pipelines or for
   minor leaks. The presented system uses a Continuous Wave (CW) Doppler
   sensing unit operating at 2.45 GHz, consisting of a low power
   transmitter, a homodyne receiver and a digital signal processing unit.
   The operation principle is the detection of the Doppler frequency shift
   of the reflected electromagnetic wave by slightly moving water that
   leaks out of a pipe. A first prototype has already been developed and
   tested in test sites as well as in real water leaking conditions. The
   system has additionally been compared to the commercially available
   water leaking methods, verifying its reliability and accuracy in the
   detection of water leaks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{CPU and System-on-Chip (SoC) are two key technologies of IT industry.
   During the course of ten years of research, we have defined the UniCore
   instruction set architecture, and designed the UniCore CPU and the
   PKUnity SoC family. This cross-disciplinary practice has also fostered
   many innovations in microprocessor architecture, optimizing compilers,
   low power design, functional verification, physical design, and so on.
   In the mean time, we have put technology transfer on the list of our top
   priorities. This effort has led to several marketable products, such as
   ultra mobile personal computers, secure micro-workstations and
   3C-converged consumer electronic,,. The development, of the next
   generation products, the 64-bit multi-core CPU and SoC, is also
   underway. They will find their applications in secure and adaptable
   computers for mobile and desktop, as well as personal digital multimedia
   devices. Being consistent with the philosophy and the long-term plan,
   and by leveraging the cutting-edge process technology, we will continue
   to make more innovations in CPUs and SoCs, and strengthen our commitment

Abstract = {{There's always been a performance gap between companies that embrace
   technology and companies that resist it - what MIT professor Erik
   Brynjolfsson calls the productivity gap between ``leaders and
   laggers.{''}
   What's new is that the gap has widened, and it has widened most in
   IT-intensive industries whose leading companies, what Brynjolfsson calls
   ``digital organizations,{''} know how to tap the flood of data created
   by information technology with a ``higher information metabolism.{''}
   IT is setting off a revolution in innovation on four dimensions
   simultaneously, he says: measurement (nano data, including the
   ``trillions of bits of information thrown off by enterprise planning
   systems{''}); experimentation (such as Amazon's ``A/B experiments{''});
   sharing (using, for instance, internal wikis to share best-practice
   ``micro-innovations{''}); and replication (being able to scale up
   innovation quickly). Brynjolfsson notes that each dimension is important
   by itself, but done together, they reinforce each other and create a new
   kind of R\&D.
   What we're going to see in the coming decade, he argues, are companies
   whose whole culture is based on continuous improvement and
   experimentation, with IT changing the innovation process itself.
   Brynjolfsson likens this revolution to the scientific revolution of the
   16th and 17th centuries.}},

   derived from remote sensing satellites to better manage farms and
   rangelands while reducing environmental impacts has gained popularity in
   recent years. However, prohibitive costs and non-availability of near
   real time remote sensing imagery has slowed the adoption of this
   technology for in-field decision making. Digital Northern Great Plains
   (DNGP), a web based remote sensing data dissemination system, was
   developed to address these drawbacks. It provides end users easy and
   free access to a variety of imagery and products in near real time. With
   delivery of archived and current data, DNGP has helped farmers and
   ranchers reduce operational costs and increase productivity through a
   variety of innovative applications. Moreover, negative environmental
   impacts were lessened.}},

Abstract = {{The common serial robot or parallel robot is difficult to implement for
   CT-guided surgery in a limited workspace. A novel hybrid robot with 9
   degrees of freedom is presented in this paper, whose detailed structure
   is analysed based on screw theory and displacement manifold (DM). The
   dexterity of the hybrid robot is provided in terms of Riemann manifold
   (RM). Besides, DICOM (digital imaging communications in medicine) image
   processing, spatial registration and 3D dynamic reconstruction in the
   operation planning subsystem are analysed, in which some innovative
   methods are introduced. Meanwhile, the architecture of the CT-guided
   hybrid robot system and its subsystems are proposed. Simulative clinical
   experiment showed that the locating precision of the hybrid robot
   reaches 1.08 mm, which can meet the requirement of CT-guided Surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Digital convergence for mobile phones is a hot issue. This study
   considers future development of mobile phones with a view toward
   consumers' usage and the amount they are willing to pay. In order to
   select preferable convergence technology, we utilize convergence
   concepts such as absorption, blending, and combination. The result of
   conjoint analysis shows that a preference for convergence technology
   will involve computing, media, navigation, and imaging. However, only
   the computing attribute increases consumers' willingness to pay. Our
   study results contribute to product planning and commercialization of
   innovative mobile phones. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{By profiling demographic characteristics, perceived general adoption
   attributes, perceived value-based adoption attributes, motivational
   needs, mass media use, and content interest, this exploratory study
   examines the nature of four categories of mobile TV adopters current,
   potential, continuous non-, and discontinuous user groups. Despite the
   limited sample size (N = 214), there are some meaningful findings. First
   of all, the non-adoption rate of mobile TV of the continuous non-, and
   discontinuous user groups is higher than the adoption rate of the
   current and potential user groups. Less than half of the respondents (N
   = 34) who had used TV on a mobile device were unwilling to use it again
   in the next twelve months, and almost half of those (N = 102) did not
   have the intention of using it within the coming year. The results
   suggest that the discontinuous group seems to have been dissatisfied
   with the actual mobile TV use when compared with their expectations and
   evaluations, while the potential user group is more likely to have high
   expectations and positive evaluations before the adoption and use of
   mobile TV. All user groups were unwilling to pay the fee, despite the
   current and potential user groups perceiving the exceptional values. No
   differences were found in the personality trait of innovativeness and
   mass media use behaviors among the four groups. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{In a context-aware ubiquitous learning environment, learning systems can
   detect students' learning behaviors in the real-world with the help of
   context-aware (sensor) technology; that is, students can be guided to
   observe or operate real-world objects with personalized support from the
   digital world. in this study, an optimization problem that models the
   objectives and criteria for determining personalized context-aware
   ubiquitous learning paths to maximize the learning efficacy for
   individual students is formulated by taking the meaningfulness of the
   learning paths and the number of simultaneous visitors to each learning
   object into account. Moreover, a Heuristic Algorithm is proposed to find
   a quality solution. Experimental results from the learning activities
   conducted in a natural science butterfly-ecology course of an elementary
   school are also given to depict the benefits of the innovative approach.

Abstract = {{This article, which draws upon the work of the AHRC-funded research
   project Moving Manchester (2006-9), looks at the ways in which
   Manchester's vibrantly multicultural writing community positions itself
   in relation to issues of region and regional identity. In particular, it
   investigates how contemporary writers have both reproduced and
   challenged the stereotypes associated with the city, issues of
   filiation/affiliation and the way in which many local writers' groups
   may be said to have produced literature which is of the region without
   necessarily being about it. The innovative `grassroots' nature of much
   Manchester writing (notably its `live literature' scene) is also
   considered. The final section of the article compares this
   community-based experience of `writing' and `region' with that found on
   digital storytelling websites and posits that the digital form would
   seem to encourage transnational rather than regional identifications in
   the texts produced.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in information and communications technology continually offer
   innovation to assist faculty in their efforts to help students learn new
   information or develop new skills. However, faculty members are often
   hesitant to incorporate these innovations into their courses out of fear
   that these new methods may not provide the anticipated outcomes. Hence,
   students are often the subjects of educational trials to evaluate
   curriculum innovations by comparing a new teaching/learning method to
   traditional lecture-based instruction. The most typical finding is that
   students can learn equally well by either method. However, two
   question,, that have not been studied extensively in dental education
   are whether dental students will actually use computer-based educational
   resources made available to them and whether students perceive these
   materials to provide a value-added learning experience. Accordingly, the
   goals of this study were to determine whether first-year dental students
   (D1), second-year dental students (D2), and third-year dental students
   (D3) would 1) use an interactive tooth atlas, available on a DVD, as a
   study aid and 2) perceive that the atlas provided sufficient value-added
   benefit their dental anatomy (D1), preclinical laboratory endodontics
   (D2), and clinical endodontics (D3) courses, to recommend adding it to
   their school's comprehensive electronic resources. A low percentage of
   the Students (14 percent: 40/289) voluntarily downloaded the atlas From
   a DVD to their laptops prior to the addition of incentives in the form
   of atlas-related examination questions. Even after incentives were
   added, only 43 percent of the students 126/289) downloaded the DVD.
   After using the atlas. students responded to the statement ``Using the
   3D Interactive Tooth Atlas was beneficial for me{''} on a 0 to 10 scale
   with 0 representing strongly disagree, 5 representing unsure, and 10
   representing strongly agree. The mean rankings were 5,34 for D1s. 6.79
   for D2s, and 7.28 for D3s. Students also responded to the statement
   ``The atlas should be added to our school's VitalBook{''} (digital
   library of curriculum materials). The mean rankings for this statement,
   using the same 0-10 scale. were 5.15 for the D1s, 6.63 for the D2s, and
   7.26 for the D3s. Based upon these findings. the course directors
   decided not to add this atlas to the students' electronic resources.}},

Abstract = {{Even as the Internet continues to grow as a global platform for
   communication and commerce, the success of new value offerings on the
   Internet hinges oil acquisition of new customers and retention of
   existing customers. Central to the flow of customers in and out of trial
   and repeat behavior in this burgeoning and dynamic environment,
   characterized by diversity among both producers and consumers of value
   offerings, is the process of social contagion-active word of mouth that
   flows among customers or passive observation of others. To estimate
   contagion on the Internet, the authors develop a trial-repeat purchase
   diffusion model for successive innovations in value offerings on the
   Internet. The model extends the state-of-the-art diffusion modeling by
   incorporating (i) dynamic market potential, (ii) heterogeneity among
   first-time triers, (iii) heterogeneity in word of mouth due to repeat
   buyers and non-repeaters (i.e., positive and negative word of mouth),
   and (iv) dynamic repeat purchase rate. The model also incorporates the
   influence of product characteristics, specifically source of innovation
   (i.e., whether the innovation is driven by environmental needs or
   competitive pressures) and product bundling, and competition. The
   authors test the model with weekly adoption data for 11 computer
   soft-ware products available on the shareware system, involving over 100
   new versions in the period 1991-1994, and in a market whose size grows
   by a factor of fifty from early 1991 to late 1994. The findings clarify
   the role of word of mouth effects, competition, and product
   characteristics in fostering the diffusion process for digital
   information goods. (C) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation,

   based on the electrical modulation of a 3 mu m layer of nematic
   liquid-crystal sandwiched between a Fresnel zone electrode structure and
   a reference substrate. Each zone is divided into 12 subzones to digitize
   the phase profiles and define the phase wrapping points. The focusing
   power can rapidly be switched by electrically changing the number of
   subzones and re-establishing the wrapping points. Potential applications
   include zooms with no moving parts and autofocus lenses for compact

Abstract = {{In the last couple of decades, handheld wireless devices such as cell
   phones have become one of the most prolific electronic devices in
   history. With this has come an exploding demand for performance and
   features that cover almost every aspect of our digital multimedia
   interconnected lives including 3-D gaming, still and video cameras, WAN,
   Bluetooth, high-speed data connections, and so on. As ever increasing
   features continue to be integrated into these products, there is an
   ongoing need to develop innovative ways to reduce power consumption and
   extend battery life. Only through continual process and circuit
   cooptimization are we able to reap the benefits of technology scaling
   required to meet the feature and performance demands in the face of
   increasing process variations and exponentially increasing leakage
   currents. As a result, SmartReflex power and performance technologies
   have been developed and applied to 90 nm, 65 nm, and 45 nm
   system-on-chip (SoC), to achieve optimal power and performance.
   SmartReflex technologies consist of two major components to optimize SoC
   power and performance: static and dynamic techniques. Static techniques
   like power-gating, retention and off-mode are used to lower leakage and
   allow for extended battery lifetimes for standby times. Dynamic
   techniques such as dynamic power switching, adaptive voltage scaling,
   dynamic voltage/frequency scaling with split-rail memories, and adaptive
   body-biasing address active power and performance challenges. These
   techniques enable SoC solutions with the performance of the latest
   process technology and provide the user with advanced multimedia
   features with orders of magnitude of power reduction.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative image editing system based on a sequential
   immunoperoxidase-immunofluorescence technique on routine histological
   sections is described. With this technique it is possible to identify
   different antigens in different cells, as well as co-localised antigens
   in the same cell. The method uses digital image editing to mix two
   independently captured images into one merged image. The technique was
   performed with indirect immunoperoxidase, followed by sequential
   indirect immunofluorescence, digital image acquisition and image
   editing. Multiple staining examples using anti-cytokeratin,
   anti-vimentin and anti-calbindin antibodies on canine skin and
   cerebellum, and feline pleural mesothelioma sections were performed in
   order to investigate the capabilities of the proposed technique. Our
   data demonstrated that this method can be easily used to assess multiple
   protein staining studies with minimum laboratory equipment, and that it
   allows a better structural visualisation of the tissue morphology
   compared to double immunofluorescence. Moreover, in contrast to
   double-immunoperoxidase, with this method it is possible to easily
   co-localise two different antigens in the same cell compartment. (C)

Abstract = {{The global diffusion of digital technology, which occurred more rapidly
   than the global diffusion of any technology previously, has been mired
   by its uneven distribution across, and unequal effects on, societies
   worldwide. In addition, policy initiatives to close this global digital
   divide, which peaked with the two World Summit on Information Society
   conferences, still did not change the course of this differentiated
   globalization process. In this article, I attribute the cause of such
   stalling of policy on the issue of the global digital divide to the
   bifurcation of current international policy: attention is split between
   concern for the impeded access of the poor to this revolutionary
   technology, on the one hand, and the race to lead the world in creating
   the next ``hot{''} technology, on the other. These two concerns, which
   have been given the pithy titles of the ``global digital divide{''} and
   the ``global innovation divide,{''} are leading to two separate policy
   tracks, targeting the world's laggards and leaders as separate entities
   and operating under separate logics. This separation is problematic
   because the issues of access to technology and ownership of rights to
   technology are intertwined. This article describes the two global
   technology divides and analyzes the policies that are currently charted
   to address them.}},

Abstract = {{Methods available for quickly and objectively quantifying the behavioral
   phenotypes of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, lag behind in
   sophistication the tools developed for manipulating their genotypes. We
   have developed a simple, easy-to-replicate, general-purpose experimental
   chamber for studying the ground-based behaviors of fruit flies. The
   major innovative feature of our design is that it restricts flies to a
   shallow volume of space, forcing all behavioral interactions to take
   place within a monolayer of individuals. The design lessens the
   frequency that flies occlude or obscure each other, limits the
   variability in their appearance, and promotes a greater number of flies
   to move throughout the center of the chamber, thereby increasing the
   frequency of their interactions. The new chamber design improves the
   quality of data collected by digital video and was conceived and
   designed to complement automated machine vision methodologies for
   studying behavior. Novel and improved methodologies for better
   quantifying the complex behavioral phenotypes of Drosophila will
   facilitate studies related to human disease and fundamental questions of
   behavioral neuroscience.}},

Number = {{7279}},

Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{Robustness seems to be the opposite of evolvability. If phenotypes are
   robust against mutation, we might expect that a population will have
   difficulty adapting to an environmental change, as several studies have
   suggested(1-4). However, other studies contend that robust organisms are
   more adaptable(5-8). A quantitative understanding of the relationship
   between robustness and evolvability will help resolve these conflicting
   reports and will clarify outstanding problems in molecular and
   experimental evolution, evolutionary developmental biology and protein
   engineering. Here we demonstrate, using a general population genetics
   model, that mutational robustness can either impede or facilitate
   adaptation, depending on the population size, the mutation rate and the
   structure of the fitness landscape. In particular, neutral diversity in
   a robust population can accelerate adaptation as long as the number of
   phenotypes accessible to an individual by mutation is smaller than the
   total number of phenotypes in the fitness landscape. These results
   provide a quantitative resolution to a significant ambiguity in
   evolutionary theory.}},

   to contextualise the Create10 conference. The conference was held at
   Edinburgh Napier University in June/July 2010 and attracted over 120
   delegates. The papers that comprise this special section in Digital
   Creativity reflect aspects of the debates that took place both within
   the main conference and in the work exhibited at the Student Design
   Exhibition. The papers by Fallman and Stolterman, and Edmonds explore
   the need for, and possible sources of, theoretical underpinnings in
   Interaction Design. While the work presented firstly by Kettley, Downes,
   Harrigan and Glazzard and secondly by Speed emphasise the importance of
   `learning through doing' as a means of better understanding the process
   of design and the nature of user engagement.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Radiography (DR) is finally taking its rightful place in the
   arsenal of NDT technologies. With film X-ray dyeing out as film
   manufacturers stop film production, NDT technicians seek new solutions
   for X-ray NDT. DR is the leading, most innovative top technology for
   X-ray inspection available today. With its high quality imaging, NDT
   results and analysis quality is increased. Amorphous Silicon (a-Si) flat
   panels are up to 100 times more sensitive than film and allow for great
   images with reduced exposures or energies.
   The high signal to noise ratio enables improved probability of detection
   (POD), and combined with fast and easy set up on site, the inspection
   time is shortened significantly, reducing costs and plant shut down. The
   software provided with DR enables image enhancement that makes even the
   tiniest detail visible to the human eye. In this article we will review
   the properties of hardware and software required to maximise the quality
   potential of results that can be achieved with this advanced technology.}},

Abstract = {{System FOTOM 2009 on NetBeans platform. On the Department of Informatics
   FEI VSB TU Ostrava FOTOM is developer system FOTOM, which serves the
   digital image processing. The program is created in the programming
   language C++. Originally the system was developed as a purpose-built
   program with no public API for other future modules. For this mason we
   decided to create a whole new generation system based on modern language
   and built on a suitable platform, enabling full modularity of the
   system. This calls for a revolutionary version of FOTOM 2009 with a
   newly designed core, which, thanks to strong API allowing an application
   to become more flexibile, easily expandable. The purpose of
   implementation of the new version of the system is not only
   reprogramming the original version of the system and provide a advantage
   of modularity, but revise the original tools and extend them by new and
   innovative ideas The current system does not replace all functionality
   of FOTOM 2008. New core is backward compatible and allow export to old

   Just a few statements can achieve the division operation that the

   thousands of digits in 3 to 5 seconds, which has been verified
   correct.The innovation of the program is that it not only employs array
   to store larger integer,which breaks through the limitation of integer
   store in computer, but also only uses subtract to obtain the
   quotient,which Simplifies the operation process and reduces the
   complexity of the program. The principle of program is simple, and the
   computing speed is high efficient. In short, the program has large
   significance in the field of information security.}},

Abstract = {{Current maritime systems are to a large extent based on legacy analog
   VHF radios for ship-to-shore communications near port waters, and
   relatively low bandwidth digital satellite communications (SatCom) for
   long-range ship-to-ship/shore communications. The cost of bandwidth for
   SatCom networks is expected to remain high due to the cost of launching
   satellites into orbit and also due to the stabilizers required for
   presently available on-board antennas. On the other hand, the legacy VHF
   system comprises low bandwidth radios incapable of supporting
   applications requiring high data rates. Unlike the terrestrial networks,
   advancement in maritime communication means is severely lagging behind
   its land counterpart.

   workload distribution. As a result, the understanding that global
   managers have of their off-shore teams is often skewed by the lack of
   information that one would normally obtain by being in close proximity
   to employees.
   The Digital Diffusion Dashboard has provided a set of metrics and tools
   that enable global managers to understand the network in which their
   employees operate. This network can be analyzed to understand things
   such as volumes, response time, individuals with whom an employee
   regularly interacts, cultural influences in the workload of an employee,
   ``buzz{''} around critical topics, emotion, and team collaboration.
   Additionally, using these tools can help manage the adoption of new
   global processes as well as staff changes and turnover to shorten
   transition time for both incoming and exiting employees. All of these
   measurements have a significant impact, especially in virtual teams
   where the tools help bridge the gap between location and perceived
   performance.
   A software suite of programs is used to create these metrics, which
   include: Condor, WORDij, and LIWC. Together this software suite creates
   the Digital Diffusion Dashboard metrics and tools, which are used to
   illuminate details that are hidden in e-mail networks that can improve
   efficiency and increase a manager's ability to understand how work gets
   done in a global collaborative network.}},

Abstract = {{Collaborative innovation networks (COINs) and swarm creativity is often
   studied in a professional business context. We propose that studying
   COINs of amateurs and non-business contexts provides a crucial and
   complementary perspective on these phenomena. By broadening the scope of
   COINs research to encompass these edge cases, we can begin to identify
   patterns and trends that persist across diferent contexts. For the past
   three years, we have been studying COINs in a novel context: online
   communities of Flash animators who collaborate over the internet to
   create animated movies and games called ``collabs{''}. From a
   quantitative analysis of nearly 900 collabs on Newgrounds.com, we found
   that these projects can be highly successful, attracting hundreds of
   thousands of Internet audience members to download the completed
   animations. Our analysis also demonstrated that is possible to predict
   the success potential of a collab by examining specific factors,
   including attributes of the leader organizational structures, and
   activity patterns within a collab.
   Our focus in this research has been on the social dynamies within
   collabs, especially the role of leadership. Through in-depth interviews
   with collab participants, we found that collabs are typically created by
   groups of amateurs, or in some cases, animation students, often located
   around the world and speaking different languages. Their motivations
   tend to be social-psychological-such as learning, reputation, social
   support, and self-efficacy-rather than financial, and almost everyone
   contributes as an unpaid volunteer. We also found that a shared goal of
   almost every collab participants with whom we spoke was to create
   something original; that is, a movie or game that audidnce perceived as
   unique. To this end, collab participants are constantly experimenting
   with new processes, team compositions, and artistic styles. We have
   identified notable similarities and differences between collabs and
   other COINs involved with entertainment production. Collab participants
   emulate the professional filmmaking community in that they recruit
   mainly through social networks; in contrast to movie studios, however,
   collabs are organized enterly online, via discussion forums, blogs, and
   instant messaging. This process is faciliated by online reputation
   markers, such as digital histories of past contributions. Another
   similarity between the film set and the collab production process is
   that both operate in a hierarchial fashion, with one individual a the
   top, the ``benevolent dictator,{''} which holds that flattened
   hierarchies make decisions in a democractic or meritocratic fashion.
   Finally, in contrast to professional filmmaking, we found that the
   division of labor is collabs is often modularized, rather than
   specialized. Collab leaders typically assign entire scenes to individual
   animators to be recombined upon completion. This modularization allows
   animators to work independently and in parallel to sidestep some of the
   challenges posed by distributed collaboration.
   The breadth and potential of COINs, as illuminated by our ongoing study
   of collabs, continue to surprise and inspire us. Our future work
   includes (1) developing software tools to support collabs and (2)
   relating these findings to other forms of online creative collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing demand from consumers to integrate camera modules into
   electronic devices, such as cell phones, has driven the cost of camera
   modules down very rapidly. Now that most cell phones include at least
   one camera, consumers are starting to ask for better image quality and
   resolution without compromising on the cost.
   Many applications including mobile electronics, automotive, medical,
   security and laptop computers, require reliable, small form factor, high
   level functionality integration and low manufacturing cost digital
   camera modules. To satisfy these demands, Tessera has developed
   Wafer-Level Camera (WLC) technology, which includes wafer level
   packaging of image sensor, wafer level optics (WLO) and wafer level
   integration of optics. This enables manufacturers to significantly
   advance the integration of miniaturized cameras. Compared to traditional
   camera module manufacturing technology, where optical lenses are made by
   either molded glass or injection molded plastics, in WLO, thousands of
   optical lenses or lens assemblies are fabricated simultaneously on a
   wafer-scale using photopolymer replication and wafer bonding
   technologies. Wafer-scale optics and wafer-scale integration offer a
   smaller form factor, lower manufacturing costs, and improved reliability
   over conventional designs {[}1-8]. In this paper, we will present an
   innovative wafer level packaging technology, Tessera's SHELLCASE (R)
   Micro Via Pad (MVP), WLO, and wafer level integration technologies for
   making digital camera modules.}},

Abstract = {{The advance of wireless and mobile technologies has enabled students to
   learn in an environment that combines learning resources from both the
   real world and the digital world. Although such an approach has been
   recognized to be innovative and important, several problems have been
   revealed in practical learning activities. One major problem is owing to
   the lack of proper learning strategies or tools for assisting the
   students to acquire knowledge in such a complex learning scenario.
   Students might feel excited or absorbed when using the mobile devices to
   learn in the real context; nevertheless, their learning achievements
   could be disappointing. To deal with this problem, this study presents a
   mobile learning system that employs Radio Frequency Identification
   (RFID) technology to detect and examine real-world learning behaviors of
   students and provide personalized learning guidance accordingly.
   Experimental results from a natural science course of an elementary
   school show that this innovative approach is able to improve the
   learning achievements of students as well as enhance their learning
   motivation.}},

Abstract = {{the increase in navigation accuracy demanded by EGNOS and Galileo and
   their future evolution encourages the study and design of advance
   receiver architectures. In that direction, the ADIBEAM project focuses
   on the design of high accuracy ground stations, specifically GNSS
   Reference Stations, in order to improve its robustness in front of
   multipath and interference errors with the goal of achieving centimeter
   level tracking accuracy. The adoption of antenna arrays and digital
   beamforming at the ground reference station receivers is one of the most
   promising approaches to cope with errors induced by multipath and
   interference.
   This paper proposes an innovative design of a ground based tracking
   station. In particular, the architecture proposed is based on the use of
   an antenna array and digital beamforming techniques, considering both
   adaptive and deterministic methods. The work carried out here considers
   the ground based tracking system, including the characterization of the
   system components (antennas, RF chains, calibration techniques, GNSS
   software receiver and digital beamforming), and the development of a
   software based experimentation platform representative of the proposed
   design for a hardware prototype. The sensitivity to perturbations and
   the extreme difficulty to perfectly control and calibrate all the
   components of the system, especially regarding the antenna array
   implementation, requires that the proposed design take into
   consideration not only the benefits of the possible solutions but also
   their feasibility for a real implementation.
   In summary, this paper will present the design proposed and the
   Experimentation Platform used for its validation.}},

   of pulsed interferences is demonstrated. The mitigation of strong pulses
   as well as of low power Distance Measurement Equipment (DME) pulses is
   discussed and the results obtained for both the cases are presented. In
   the second part of the paper the mitigation of Continuous Wave

Abstract = {{Governments, corporations and families around the world are seeking
   low-carbon and ecological economic growth pattern and life style amidst
   the post-financial crisis era. The essence of low-carbon economy is to
   fundamentally abandon human's dependence on fossil energy through
   technological and managerial innovation. Featuring in low energy
   consumption, low emission and low pollution, a sustainable development
   path shall be established to decrease the greenhouse gas emission, such
   as CO2. In China, urban cities receive about 75\% of the total carbon
   emission of the whole country. Currently, urban management in China is
   facing a variety of difficulties and problems, including departments'
   redundancy, feeble coordination, out-dated management pattern, and low
   management efficiency as well. Through research, we find out that it is
   crucial to control the carbon emission in cities in a bid to establish a
   low-carbon and ecological development pattern. Moreover, serious
   departmentalization is the most difficulty point for urban management.
   Poor information sharing and coordination both obstruct the management
   procedure. In view of the research, we believe the key for urban
   management in China is to solve the information isolation island
   problem, creating a more coordinated and efficient cooperation among
   departments. A digital urban management pattern shall also be adopted in
   China, which will improve the quality of decision-making and urban
   management level. Furthermore, the integration of networking industry
   and other information industries has to be strengthened to train modern
   managerial talents and develop China's own digital management system
   with property rights. In result, national information security will be
   ensured and urban management level and quality will be improved.}},

Abstract = {{The number of different types of devices on the home network is
   expanding rapidly. While this explosion of innovation provides
   compelling new devices to consumers, there are challenges ensuring
   compatibility among these devices and providing a comprehensive user
   interface that supports consumers managing their digital content across
   several devices. The Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) has
   specified an architecture that enables interoperability between the
   various devices and allows a user to enjoy the desired content across
   several devices. To complement DLNA, we investigate ontological
   representation from semantic web technology to model the interaction
   between multiple home devices and to provide an enriched and more
   comprehensive metadata based multimedia search. This removes the user
   burden of searching each device individually. Development of a prototype
   incorporating these ideas has begun, using a well known semantic web

Abstract = {{Digital video recorders (DVR) are getting connected to the Internet.
   There are several ways to engineer networked DVRs. Consumers can store
   the recordings at home or to remote cloud storage service. The recorder
   software can be implemented to respond to consumers' or rights owners'
   needs. The most common DVRs have been home based recorders that respect
   at least some of the rights owners' interests. However, the cloud model
   is developing traction as broadband becomes more common. The new
   technology changes markets and courts have to define the limits of
   place- and time shifting. Networked DVRs open a door for social
   enrichment by viewer communities, but also threaten the whole business
   model of advertisement-based television. Networked DVRs can potentially
   change the centrally controlled broadcast economics of television into
   decentralized Internet economics.}},

Abstract = {{In breast cancer imaging many innovations continue to take place. This
   paper discusses computer aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer in
   mammograms, which is the first large scale application of independent
   computerized interpretation of radiological images. Thousands of systems
   have already been installed worldwide and use of CAD is rapidly
   expanding with the introduction of digital mammography. Despite this
   success, most radiologists believe that the performance of CAD should be
   improved to make it more useful. CAD algorithms do not yet operate at
   the level of performance of trained human readers, while there is no
   reason to doubt that this is an achievable goal.
   The most common complaint of radiologists using mammography CAD is that
   current algorithms have too many false positives. Indeed, considering
   that current CAD algorithms operate at a level of one or two false
   positives per four view case case (MLO and CC views of the right and
   left breast), there are still a few hundred false positives for every
   true positive in a screening setting. When asked what is so bothering
   about false positives, some comment that they confuse them or slow down
   the reading. However, the worst aspect of false positives is that
   readers loose confidence in CAD, as they see many irrelevant CAD marks
   on obviously normal regions. They wonder how a system that operates so
   poorly in some aspects can ever help them.
   Interestingly, experienced readers seem to have more faith in CAD than
   inexperienced readers. Perhaps experienced radiologists are more
   tolerant to false positives because they can easily dismiss them. They
   also recognize the main value of current CAD systems: the very high
   sensitivity. When reading fast, perceptual oversights occasionally
   occur, and CAD may help to avoid those. Of course, this is particularly
   important when there is no double reading. For less experience
   radiologists dismissing false positives is less easy, and they may have
   to spend a significant amount of time to interpret CAD marked regions.
   The fact that CAD may confuse readers is an important message to CAD
   researchers. It reveals the rather obvious, but often neglected truth
   that radiologists have difficulty in interpreting mammographic regions
   and making the right decisions. In screening programs the decision to be
   made is if a woman should be recalled or not. Ideally, there should be a
   clear line between suspicious mammographic regions that require
   additional workup and other mammographic findings. Screening would then
   simply be the task of finding these regions, and misses could be
   classified as `search errors'. This simple model of breast cancer
   screening is often advocated by `expert' screening radiologists and
   forms the basis of current CAD technology. CAD users are instructed to
   use the technology as a `checker' to avoid oversights, but are
   discouraged to use it as an interpretation aid. Despite these clear
   guidelines, it is highly likely that many radiologists do use CAD as an
   interpretation aid when they become more familiar with the technique.
   They realize that the high negative predictive value of CAD is very
   valuable. Suppose a reader doubts whether to make a recall or not given
   the presence of an uncertain mammographic finding. When using CAD, the
   reader will know that the likelihood that a cancer is present becomes
   lower when CAD does not mark the region and higher when CAD does mark
   it, in particular if it is marked in multiple views. Using this
   information makes a lot of sense and will lead to better decisions on
   average. To this end, CAD information should be weighed properly, which
   is something the reader should learn from experience. This potential of
   CAD has been convincingly demonstrated in a study where CAD was combined
   independently with reader scores. To further explore the idea of using
   CAD as an interpretation aid an experimental environment was developed
   in which CAD informatiomn is presented interactively to the readers.
   First results obtained by this approach are very promising.
   Modern breast imaging is becoming increasingly complex with the
   introduction of new modalities. Contrast enhanced MRI is nowadays widely
   used, for instance in high risk screening programs, while novel
   modalities as automated whole breast breast ultrasound and tomosynthesis
   are expected to play an important role in the near future. To meet
   demands of radiologists, CAD methods have to be developed that can
   integrate multimodal image information in intelligent decision and
   navigation support applications.}},

Abstract = {{It is an innovation that we use digital close-range photogrammetry
   method to monitor the deformation of the steel goods shelf instead of
   traditional method. Digital camera is not for professional measurement,
   and it has no fiducially mark and orientation equipment, so we can't
   obtain the initial values of internal-external azimuth while
   photographing instantly. So the traditional methods can't process
   measurement data, and it will be superior to use Spatial Time Baseline
   Parallax Method. In this paper, we will introduce a method to process
   deformation measurement data of steel goods shelf by spatial Time
   Baseline Parallax Method and obtain the experiment results. This method
   considers of the influence of the resolution ratio, fatal distance,
   outside environment and eliminates them effectively, so we got a good
   results that the monitoring error is less than 3 parts per thousand.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes an innovative textile sensor system to monitor
   dynamic body movement and human posture by attaching wearable digital
   sensors to analyze body motion. The proposed system can display and
   analyze signals when individuals are walking, running, veering around,
   walking up and down stairs, as well as falling down with a wearable
   monitoring system, which reacts to the coordination between the body and
   feet. Several digital sensor designs are embedded in clothing and wear
   apparel. Any pressure point can determine which activity is underway.
   Importantly, wearable digital sensors and a wearable monitoring system
   allow adaptive, real-time postures, real time velocity, acceleration,
   non-invasive, transmission healthcare, and point of care (POC) for home
   and non-clinical environments.}},

Abstract = {{In the paper, a three-degree freedom hybrid magnetic bearing (HMB) with
   bilateral magnetic pole faces is proposed, which is driven by a 2-phase
   AC power inverter in radial directions and a DC amplifier in axial
   direction respectively. The axial and radial biased magnetic fluxes are
   provided by a common radial polarized permanent magnet ring, and the
   axial and radial control magnetic fluxes are provided by the inner and
   outer two-layer coils, respectively. The configuration and producing
   magnetic suspension forces of an innovated three-degree freedom
   bilateral magnetic pole face hybrid magnetic bearing are introduced. The
   flux path is calculated by using equivalent magnetic circuit, the
   mathematics models of the radial and axial magnetic suspension forces
   are deduced. The displacement stiffness and current stiffness are
   derived by linearizing the mathematics models. The experiment
   prototype's parameters of this magnetic bearing are given. Based on
   TMS320F2812 DSP, the digital control system of the three-degree freedom
   HMB with bilateral magnetic pole faces is built. The performances of
   digital control system of three-degree freedom HMB with bilateral
   magnetic pole faces has been test by experiments. The start suspension
   experiment, stable suspension experiment and the anti-disturbance
   experiments have been done respectively. The relative experimental
   waveforms and experiment results are given. The research results have
   shown that the control performances of the digital control system of the
   three-degree freedom HMB with bilateral magnetic pole faces are well.}},

Abstract = {{Optical camouflage is one of the significant ways to protect military
   weapons in modern wars. Effective camouflage design can largely reduce
   the conspicuity of the fixed targets in a real battlefield. In this
   paper, an innovative digital camouflage pattern design based on fuzzy
   c-means clustering and its evaluation is presented to imitate the
   background both in color and texture. In this new method, histogram
   quantization and matching between the real background and I military
   standard colors is first carried out in HSV color space. Then camouflage
   pattern is abstained by a combination of the fuzzy c-means clustering
   and morphological operations, such as open operation and close
   operation. And the camouflage scene is composed with tank using new
   digital camouflage pattern. Finally, several common edge detectors are
   utilized to give an objective evaluation to the new digital camouflage
   pattern which is painting on the target in a composed camouflage scene.
   Assessment results also show the effectiveness and potency of the new
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The Lee propagation prediction model has been well recognized by the
   wireless industry as one of the most accurate propagation prediction
   models. This paper discusses innovative approaches dealing with rough
   digital samples of terrain data and enhancements to the Lee model during
   the validation process.
   In general, the Lee model is composed of two parts, the impact of
   man-made structures and the impact of the natural terrain variation
   {[}1-6]. There are other papers discuss innovative algorithms on
   calculating effective antenna gain {[}7,8] and diffraction loss {[}7-9]
   as well as on enhancing the Lee model {[}12-14]. This paper focuses on
   the natural (terrain) factor. The new algorithm presented in this paper
   is quite different than others as it integrates both Line Of Site (LOS)
   and shadow loss calculation together for the Lee model. First, in the
   LOS scenario, it addresses the issue of big swing of effective antenna
   gain due to non-continuous terrain data. Second, in the non-LOS
   situation, the effective antenna gain is integrated with shadow loss.
   Both single knife edge and multiple knife edge scenarios are discussed.
   The new algorithm is developed based on the analysis of measured and
   predicted (the theoretical shadow loss and effective antenna gain) data.
   The new algorithm involves more calculation but it improves the accuracy
   of the predicted value. This algorithm was implemented and verified
   using field terrain and measurement data from a variety of different
   environments and different countries including Italy, US, Spain, Japan,
   South Korea, Taiwan and Romania.}},

Abstract = {{Redundancy techniques, such as N-tuple modular redundancy has been
   widely used to improve the reliability of digital circuits.
   Unfortunately nothing substantial has been done for the analog and mixed
   signal systems. In this paper, we propose a redundancy based
   fault-tolerant methodology to design a highly reliable analog and
   digital circuits and systems. The key contribution of our work is an
   innovative mean voter. This mean voter is a low power, small area, very
   high bandwidth and linearly scalable voting circuit. Unlike other
   conventional voters which works with odd N in an NMR, the mean voter
   works for both odd and even N for analog units and hence reduces the
   area and power further. For the proof of concept, we designed two fault
   tolerant analog circuits i.e. a low pass anti-aliasing analog filter and
   a 4-bit flash ADC. We also presented fault-tolerance mechanism in 4-bit
   binary adder and an FPGA cell for demonstrating its advantage in digital
   applications. Experimental results are reported to verify the concepts
   and measure the system's reliability when single upset transient may
   occur.}},

Abstract = {{The theme for Autotestcon 2010 is ``45 Years of Support Innovation -
   Moving Forward at the Speed of Light.{''} This theme is particularly
   relevant for military ATE systems because it highlights the dichotomy of
   striving to maintain state-of-the-art testing capabilities, while at the
   same time needing to support legacy technologies that may be decades old
   - indeed, as old as Autotestcon itself. The need to support discrete
   transistor-based electronics, TTL, CMOS and other technologies developed
   in the 1960's and 1970's, using test systems built around custom ASIC's,
   high performance FPGA's and logic levels whose peak-to-peak amplitudes
   were once considered ``noise{''}, presents unique challenges.
   Systems deployed in the last century used CRT monitors to display
   information to a technician or operator. These monitors were based on
   analog video transmission standards such RS170, NTSC (National
   Television Standards Council), PAL (Phase Alternating Line) and other
   similar standards. Today, with the widespread use of DVI and HDMI
   digital video, it is rare to find CRT monitors in commercial use. But
   they are still widely used in older deployed systems.
   This paper is a case study based on the requirement for a PXI-based
   instrument that can generate simple color bar signals in NTSC and PAL
   formats to support the Mini-Samson/Katlanit Remote Controlled Weapon
   Station. By integrating an off-the-shelf PXI FPGA card, with an
   intellectual property (IP) core available in the public domain and a
   handful of commercially available support components, a cost effective
   solution was developed which supports the generation of both analog and
   digital video signals for testing CRT and LCD monitors. The flexibility
   of this approach allowed the extension of the original requirement for
   generating color bar patterns to include more complex test patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the widespread adoption of the Bologna Process in Spanish
   universities, is demanding to put into practice innovative proposals.
   There is no doubt that methodologies must move from traditional style
   and concept-based teaching to student-centred and competency-based
   instruction. A novel approach to design interactive classroom
   environments supported by mobile Tablet PC technology is presented. It
   is focused on integrating formative assessment into classroom practices
   and providing students with immediate feedback. We describe the six
   steps of the proposed approach and how they are implemented in a
   first-year Computer Engineering course. Initial results have showed that
   the dropout rate in the experimental group has been reduced more than
   50\%, while the number of students passing the course has almost doubled
   over the control group. Our approach has also promoted the students'
   autonomy and motivation, thereby improving their academic performance
   and enhancing their self-confidence in the learning process.}},

   that addresses scientific workflow management systems in a bottom-up
   manner: firstly from the operating systems and file systems side where
   the scientific workflow management systems must reside and interact, and
   finally to the functionality that the scientific workflow management
   systems must provide and the World Wide Web on which the scientific
   workflow management systems must operate. In the systems level, we
   extend and modify the operating system and file system through
   optimization techniques. In the applications-level, we examine the need
   to organize raw data and corresponding metadata alongside the
   interference of these data with existing computing resources.}},

Abstract = {{Serious games is an emerging technology growing in importance for
   specialized training, taking advantage of 3D games and game engines in
   order to improve the realistic experience of users. The concept of a
   serious game combines the concept of computer games used for
   recreational purposes with specific goals like training specialized
   personnel and is part of the concept of blended learning.
   The idea of a serious game for radio planning requires some level of
   abstraction and a combination between visual designers and engineers in
   order to maintain accurate concepts about radio and a good ``feeling{''}
   from the gamer or user side.
   In this paper we expose the development of a serious game for
   Telecommunications planning training, which uses open source tools and
   real data from Digital Terrain Maps. We combine some innovative ideas
   about propagation models, 3D modeling of digital terrain, game engines

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative implementation of the wavelet packet
   transform using Butterworth passive filters for differential protection
   of power transformers. The proposed implementation is based on designing
   cascaded stages of high pass 3(rd) order Butterworth filters with
   cut-off frequencies identical to the cut-off frequencies of wavelet
   packet transform associated digital quadrature mirror filters. These
   high pass filters are designed to extract the second level high
   frequency components present in the three-phase differential currents.
   The extraction of these frequency components is required in order to
   detect and classify transients in three-phase power transformers. The
   output of the designed Butterworth high pass filters is utilized to
   initiate a trip signal in case of internal fault currents. The 3(rd)
   order Butterworth high pass filters are designed to simplify their
   practical implementation as well as their integration with the
   differential protective relay for the tested power transformer.
   Different magnetizing inrush, through-fault and internal fault currents
   are investigated for different loading conditions. Performances of the
   proposed Butterworth passive filter-based differential relay are
   compared with those of the digital wavelet packet transform-based relay.
   Comparison results show that the Butterworth filter wavelet packet
   transform-based differential relay is able to provide a low cost good
   diagnosis and fast responses to internal fault currents.}},

Abstract = {{Miniaturized unmanned flying robots, also referred to as MUAVs (Micro
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) open up completely new fields of innovative
   applications in the areas of civil security, cellular networks,
   surveying, entertainment and media. The AVIGLE project is based on the
   vision of a novel, widely applicable avionic service platform which
   supports multiple high-tech services by using open interfaces. Recent
   developments in the area of lithium polymer batteries and carbon
   fiber-reinforced plastic materials let MUAVs become an aerial platform,
   that can be equipped with a variety of sensors such as image or time of
   flight (ToF) cameras. Furthermore, it is also possible to mount
   communication technologies on the platform in order to let the MUAVs
   work as communication hot spots or relais at places where no cellular
   networks are available. In this paper we present a system of systems
   concept of an Unmanned Aerial System working as a service platform for
   different Concepts of Operations (ConOps).}},

   objective to estimate accurately and repeatedly topography and
   topographic changes associated with mass change or other dynamic effects
   on glaciers, ice caps and polar ice sheets. Elevation measurements are
   complemented with glacier velocity measurements, providing valuable
   additional information for a better understanding of the hydrology of
   glacierized basins and of the Arctic and Antarctic water cycle. SIGNAL
   is capable of monitoring all critical regions with a high spatial
   resolution and an adequate revisit time. This paper gives an overview
   about the actual mission design status and provides a brief description
   of the topography (DEM - digital elevation map) self-calibration
   strategy and the estimated global interferometric performance.}},

Abstract = {{The verification of mixed-signal SoC is emerging as the most significant
   challenge, and with its cost surpassing the chip design cost. This paper
   presents a new automated verification methodology namely RVM
   (recursively verifying and modeling) and a set of supporting electronic
   design automation tools. The RVM methodology is built on the existing
   design flow and environments but with three major innovations to cope
   with custom-designed transistor blocks: a tool for automatically
   generating and validating simulation-efficiently behavioral models from
   a circuit netlist, a tool for characterizing and verifying the
   electrical rule correctness of analog blocks, and a hierarchical
   environment that allows designers to control the modeling and
   verification complexity. With the RVM methodology, analog circuits are
   verified in a way similar to the well-established digital verification.
   A set of industry benchmark results have shown that the RVM methodology
   is cable of reducing the verification time by potentially 100x to 1000x.
   With the increasing complexity of full-chip mixed-signal system-on-chip
   design, the RVM methodology is emerging as the only scalable
   verification solution.}},

   SystemC-AMS Timed DataFlow (TDF) modeling formalism used to model these
   multidomain devices. It also details the presented case study, a
   bio-compatible system with feedback consisting of a biological sensor
   instanciating a T flip-flop BioBrick and a EnFET, a voluntarily simple
   digital processing unit and an actuator based on the Hodgkin-Huxley
   neuron model. Some simulation results are given that validate the use of
   SystemC-AMS as an attractive, open-source and flexible framework for

Abstract = {{A non-ideal return path in the printed circuit board (PCB) with a split
   reference plane will increase electromagnetic interference (EMI) that is
   encountered in the digital LCD-TV system using a 2-layer PCB. An
   innovative layout skill using the surface mounted jumpers or zero ohm
   resistors to connect the power nets in the PCB and DDR SDRAM can avoid
   the split reference plane in the bottom layer. From the S-parameters
   simulation, the proposed PCB design induces less signal insertion loss,
   which is expected to have less radiation. The radiated emission
   measurement was also performed to verify the 2-layer PCB with the solid
   reference plane achieving less electromagnetic radiation from 0.36 dB to
   8.65 dB (mu V/m) in the range of DDR operating and harmonic frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new Interferometric Fiber Optic Gyroscope (IFOG)
   optimized for Line of Sight (LoS) stabilization being developed by IFOS
   and its prime subcontractors InFiber Technology and Optiphase under
   sponsorship of AFRL as a Phase II SBIR program. To date IFOS designed,
   built and tested five prototypes. Four gyros were delivered to Lockheed
   Martin (LM) for further testing.
   The design is based on an innovative approach that enables production of
   a small, low cost gyro with excellent noise and bandwidth (BW)
   characteristics. The development is aimed at achieving sensor volume
   less than 5 cubic inches (phi 2.0 x 1.5) with cost less than several
   thousand dollars per axis. The new IFOS gyro uses an open-loop
   configuration, utilizing small diameter fiber with new all-digital
   signal processing. The optics is integrated using all-fiber approach
   that leads to highly flexible and lower cost implementation. The gyro is
   configured as a ``split gyro{''} (distributed architecture), where the
   light source, electronics and receiver are integrated in an external
   package, and the sensor head is integrated in robust and environmentally
   rigid package.
   The dimensions of the present sensor-head prototype are phi 2.7 x 2
   (11.5 cubic inches), using single mode fiber (SMF) for low cost. The
   gyro data rate is very large and can be as high as the modulation
   frequency (> 40 kHz). We have shown that the Angle White Noise (AWN) at
   high frequencies is not flattening out and extremely-high-BW low-noise
   operation is possible. To date we measured Angle Random Walk (ARW) <
   0.0022 deg/rt-hr and demonstrated angle noise density < 10(-11)
   (arc-sec)(2)/Hz at 10 kHz and integrated angle noise < 100 nano-radians
   at 2 Hz to 10 kHz BW window. The SMF gyro demonstrated < 0.02 deg/hr
   flicker limit and < 0.2 deg/hr long term in run bias stability.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a series of 4D Extended Cardiac-Torso (XCAT) phantoms for
   multimodality imaging research. Highly detailed whole-body anatomies for
   the initial adult male and female were previously defined for the XCAT
   using non-uniform rational b-spline (NURBS) surfaces based on the
   Visible Male and Female anatomical datasets from the National Library of
   Medicine. To extend the XCAT beyond these adult models, we utilized
   innovative methods in computational anatomy to efficiently create new
   phantoms by mapping the template XCAT anatomy (male or female) to match
   the anatomical framework provided by patient CT data. We applied these
   methods to create a series of 4D XCAT phantoms representing both genders
   with varying ages, heights, and weights from pediatric to adult
   patients. Forty-seven phantoms were created in total, 25 male and 22
   female, each containing thousands of anatomical objects. To demonstrate
   the usefulness of the phantoms, we show example simulation studies in
   PET, SPECT, and CT using publicly available simulation packages. As
   demonstrated in the pilot studies, the 4D XCAT series can produce
   realistic imaging data when combined with accurate models of the imaging
   process. Distributed to the research community, such a unique library of
   computational models will have a widespread use in imaging research to
   quantitatively evaluate and improve imaging devices and techniques and
   to investigate the effects of anatomy and motion.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of computing the level-crossings of an analog
   signal from samples measured on a uniform grid. Such a problem is
   important, for example, in multilevel analog-to-digital (A/D)
   converters. The first operation in such sampling modalities is a
   comparator, which gives rise to a bilevel waveform. Since bilevel
   signals are not bandlimited, measuring the level-crossing times exactly
   becomes impractical within the conventional framework of Shannon
   sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel sub-Nyquist sampling
   technique for making measurements on a uniform grid and thereby for
   exactly computing the level-crossing times from those samples. The
   computational complexity of the technique is low and comprises simple
   arithmetic operations. We also present a finite-rate-of-innovation
   sampling perspective of the proposed approach and also show how
   exponential splines fit in naturally into the proposed sampling
   framework. We also discuss some concrete practical applications of the
   sampling technique.}},

   gate technologies not only benefits digital systems, but significantly
   improves RF performance. The peak cutoff frequency (f(T)) doubles from
   209 GHz in the 90 nm node to 445 GHz at the 32 nm node. 1/f flicker
   noise reduces by an order of magnitude from the 0.13 um node to the 32

Abstract = {{The availability today of electricity in Oil \& Gas application is a key
   factor in process production, evaluation and maintainability. The use of
   IEC61850, a mature communications technology, as a toolbox to develop
   applications in an open environment is now possible beyond what was
   permitted by the former generation of communication protocols. The
   benefits of IEC 61850 have become more apparent since innovative
   applications of utmost importance can now be materialized as compared to
   the traditional legacy technology.
   The paper focus is two advanced applications for the Oil \& Gas industry
   that benefit from IEC61850:
   Distributed Fast load shedding, i.e. managing on the same site multiple
   substations and generation machines.
   Data optimization between substation HMI's and the Control Room DCS
   (Digital Control System).
   These applications use GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Event)
   messages, a multi-casted message defined by the IEC 61850 standard, to
   replace traditional wiring between protection relays, digital meters,
   bay computers etc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an innovative method to model and simulate DC-DC
   converters with a digital or mixed-signal control loop is proposed using
   the SystemC-AMS hardware-description language. The proposed method was
   employed to model a specific test case, consisting of a Buck converter
   with a digital PID regulator. The reliability of the model was checked
   by comparing the results with MATLAB/Simulink simulations. The
   SystemC-AMS approach was found to be well suited to model the proposed
   system and very efficient from a computational point of view, since the
   simulation time can be strongly reduced with respect to other solutions
   (e.g. MATLAB/Simulink).}},

Abstract = {{We have developed monolithic silicon pixel sensors as study devices for
   a digital electromagnetic calorimetry application at future collider
   detectors, such as a linear collider. The motivation for a digital ECAL
   and the sensor requirements which arise from this are discussed.
   We present results from the ``TPAC{''} CMOS sensors produced using the
   0.18 mu m INMAPS process. The sensors have 50 mu m pixel size. The
   technology is also applicable to tracking and vertexing applications
   where highly granular pixels with integrated in-pixel readout is needed.
   Several varieties of the TPAC sensors were fabricated with and without
   some of the various processing innovations available in INMAPS,
   specifically deep P-wells and high-resistivity epitaxial silicon. The
   performance of these sensor variants has been measured both in the
   laboratory and at beam tests. Comparisons of these sensors with each
   other are presented, showing that the INMAPS innovations result in
   significant improvements in the sensor performance.}},

   ``Scholarly research in the field of South East Asian animation has
   resulted in findings that acknowledge the lack of original and genuinely
   Southeast Asian animation concepts, which are not derived from Western
   or Japanese styles.{''}Error! Reference source not found.
   This research project sets out to create innovative and genuinely
   Southeast Asian digital animation using a traditional Asian story. The
   investigators argue that this approach will result in animation that
   distinguishes itself by its strong cultural identity and achieves
   stylistic innovation. Hassan Muthalib, a renowned Malaysian animation
   scholar and president of the Animation Society of Malaysia supports this
   point of view by stating the following:
   ``Congratulations on your effort to explore an area not yet attempted.
   So far, only literary writers and researchers have forwarded suggestions
   for the preservation of the nation's folktales, legends and mythologies
   through feature films but nothing has materialized in a big
   way.{''}{[}2].
   Methodology and outcomes
   Technology and art collaborate in search of a genuinely Asian animation
   design style: In his research, Hans-Martin Rall has explored Asian folk
   tales in storyboards and the development art for animated short films.
   In an interdisciplinary project with computer scientists Hock Soon Seah
   and Henry Johan, a sequence from the Vietnamese folk-story story The
   Beach Boy has been fully completed:
   The collaborators investigated new technological approaches inspired by
   Asian design. This involved recreation of typical Asian art styles
   through the use of digital technology by research and use of non
   photo-realistic rendering, vector and pixel-based automated
   inbetweening, and mixed media techniques.
   The investigators were particularly interested in the creation of

Abstract = {{This paper aims to present the project ``An INTegral Teacher Training
   for developing digital and communicative competences and subject content
   learning at schools (intTT){''}, a Socrates-Comenius project involving
   six Universities: Comenius, Bratislava (Slovakia), Helsinki (Finland),
   Lisboa (Portugal), Leicester (United Kingdom) and Teknik, Karadeniz
   (Turkey). This project has been financed by the Executive European
   Commission.
   This team has been working together in educational projects, partners
   are convinced of the need to train teachers in developing communicative
   and digital competences to foster significant learning of subject
   content. These competences are identified as key competences for
   lifelong learning and are closely related to subject content learning,
   personal and professional development in today's society. Moreover, a
   good achievement of communicative and digital competences are needed for
   all areas of employment \& should be developed in Compulsory Education.
   Although there are some studies about digital and communicative
   competences in Compulsory School, the innovation of this project
   approach lies on an integral and cooperative teaching-learning method of
   both competences together in order to improve their development and, at
   the same time, to use them in every subject area for improving the
   teaching/learning process of pupils. Moreover, the teaching/learning of
   subject content is benefited of this interconnexion as the better
   command of communicative and digital competences in pupils is, the
   better pupils are prepared to assimilate any subject content.
   This paper presents the main aims and lines of the project.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptation of courses to the framework of the European Higher
   Education Area has led to changes in the way content is designed and
   disseminated both inside and outside the classroom.
   Several tools have already been created to support teaching in this
   context. This paper presents a new one called ``Reality Bites{''}, which
   was designed for a web environment. This tool is based on the analysis
   of business concepts that appear in the media, news or interviews, are
   broadcast in multimedia format (usually video) and are available on the
   websites of some broadcasting channels (e.g., multimedia files that can
   be found on the website of regional television channels).
   The basic structure of these tools is as follows. First, a business
   concept from a business course's syllabus is presented (for example, the
   concept of innovation in an organization). Second, the link to the
   multimedia file is provided (which may have been posted on a
   broadcasting channel's website or on YouTube). Then, the students are
   given some questions for analysis and reflection. Finally, if necessary,
   some links to websites of interest are provided to extend knowledge.
   Improvements may well be made to this structure as the teaching team
   creates and tests operational conditions.
   The aim of Reality Bites is to bring students into contact with real
   business situations (by viewing scenes on business issues), so that they
   can analyse the business concepts that are presented.
   The objective of this paper is to present the teachers' experience in
   the design and implementation of these new learning tools. The group
   that worked on this project is made up of experienced teachers who are
   involved in the creation and use of digital teaching resources, such as
   tutored exercises, WebQuests, and illustrative case studies (examples of
   these tools can be found on the website: www.ub.edu/gidea). This should
   allow teachers to create tools that are better suited to students'
   needs.}},

Abstract = {{The Intercultural Design Camp is an innovative collaboration, which also
   represents an important developmental stage in the evolving
   relationships of a group of European higher education institutions
   coming to terms with the realities and demands of
   ``internationalization{''} and interdisciplinarity. There are currently
   four partner institutions within the cluster: University College
   Arteveldehogeschool, Ghent; Stuttgart Media University; Linkoping
   University and the University of the West of Scotland.
   The project developed from a period of collaboration and consultation on
   the development of a larger scale joint post-graduate programme. This
   gave rise to interesting proposals, which met some stumbling blocks in
   terms of funding and compatibility of systems. It was decided to adopt a
   more proactive philosophy and use a brief intensive collaboration as a
   means of testing and ``kick-starting{''} the collaboration. Accordingly,
   the first Intercultural Design Camp was established in September 2009 at
   Munsingen a former military camp in the Swabian Mountains, now a unique
   environmental site where Stuttgart Media University has a base.
   Challenges included the cultural differences, methods of thought and
   working practices of students from different countries - but perhaps
   just as importantly, different disciplines. Digital Art students from
   Scotland, Graphic Design \& Communication students from Sweden and
   Information Design, Print and Media Publishing students from Germany had
   surprisingly different ideas of how to respond to the relatively open
   brief and had to develop effective ways of working together in
   international, interdisciplinary project teams.
   The process was as important as the product - in this case cross-media
   projects addressing and embodying aspects of intercultural
   communication. While the students got to know one another in enforced
   proximity, staff was able to observe other teaching styles and discover
   more about their partner institutions' organisational approaches.
   What emerged from this pilot was a clear sense that this brief but
   intensive collaboration - within the context of longer established
   institutional relationships - has lasting benefits and has already acted
   as an effective catalyst for further innovative developments in learning
   and teaching within the individual institutions and between
   institutions. A measure of the success of the Design Camp is the
   increased willingness of students to move to undertake ERASMUS exchanges
   - rather than requiring a `leap of faith', students are going to work
   with people they already know. One student was able to develop work for
   his Honours Creative Project from the Munsingen experience.
   The pilot assisted greatly in the success of a bid for funding from the
   EU for an intensive course, which will come into play in 2011 with the
   Design Camp in Sweden. The methodology of the Design Camp has also
   informed the development of the collaborative modules at UWS which have
   in turn assisted in the development of the Design Camp 2010.
   The range of direct and indirect reciprocal benefits this collaborative
   model offers is assessed, including opportunities for developing staff
   research collaborations on practice-based and pedagogical research with
   continuing analysis of practitioner output and the student experience.
   The consolidation of the Intercultural Design Camp and potential
   expansion of the network will be considered.}},

Abstract = {{In Malaysia, university libraries are always looking for innovations to
   support learning activities. These might include conducting library
   tutorials via mobile podcast; interacting with library users via Library
   2.0 tools such as Facebook; and developing electronic repositories.
   However, the emergence of blended learning has raised new issues and
   challenges as libraries consider how to better support students in their
   learning. This paper will discuss partial findings of a research project
   that explores the use of a Malaysian university's digital library
   services in a blended learning environment. The research used a
   qualitative case study approach, utilizing interviews, to explore
   students' experiences of using digital library services. Two cases
   studies were conducted - one in a high technology and the other in a low
   technology learning environment. Analysis of the interviews with twenty
   students revealed four main influences in the use of digital library
   services by students. They are: accessibility; language barriers; time
   constraint; and preferences and options. Cross cases analysis revealed
   the existence of a digital divide. This paper recommends university
   librarians work to increase information literacy, to apply the concept
   of blended librarianship, and to rethink their Web 2 applications. Also
   recommended are focusing on the idea of digital inclusion rather than
   the digital divide and the translation and publications of e-books in
   the local language.}},

Abstract = {{At the time of the Internet, unlimited circulation of information in
   which all media are trying to give us more answers and even the unlined
   issues, quality news and information we receive is especially important.
   In an effort to understand the content of media credibility, researchers
   have established various kinds of measures and statistical procedures.
   Any attempt to promote innovation and transformation of traditional
   media to modern digital platforms is impossible without a complete
   understanding of the credibility of the media. Most researchers agree
   that trust, fairness, accuracy believability and in depth of information
   are key elements that create the credibility of all, and online media.
   Understanding and acceptance of credibility as a key factor of quality
   media is an indispensable factor in meeting the essential social
   function of media in the field of social communication, selection of

Abstract = {{Currently, educational trends schemes are aimed to students and academic
   networks focused on learning and collegial work with major demands of
   communication and effective access to information resources. This finds
   expression in the educational model that should underpin education
   online and which implies a substantial change in traditional paradigms,
   a restatement of the curriculum and a reorganization of the roles of the
   educational actors. It should also promote a flexible, relevant and
   better coverage educational offering, based on the student to develop
   academic skills for work and life and at the same time allow the
   achievement of significant learning incorporating an intelligent use of
   Information Communications Technology.
   Creating a virtual environment is not just to move the physical
   classroom teaching to a virtual one, or change the chalk and blackboard
   for an electronic resource, or focus the content of a subject into texts
   redden in the computer monitor. It requires that all those involved in
   the design of these environments be aware of all available technological
   resources (infrastructure, resources, information resources, etc.), as
   well as the advantages and limitations of these to relate them to
   objectives, content, strategies and learning activities and evaluation.
   The lack of socialization that exists in the Virtual Learning
   Environments (VLE) has been often questioned. However, it is obvious
   that in VLE there is the communication process. We see the interaction
   of actors (dialogical action), as well as interactivity through the
   diversity of languages used in educational materials for the VLE.
   Innovative educational models should encourage interactive learning
   environments, synchronous and asynchronous, where the teacher is
   committed with student's learning and plays a role as advisor and
   facilitator/instructor; students will become actors of change with
   skills and new ways of working in which they can use innovative cutting
   edge technologies, educational materials, information resources and
   digital content.
   Not to say that these virtual environments have the same opportunities
   that face communication. Undoubtedly, we can't deny the richness of
   communication that exists in an environment where you can feel, smell,
   see, touch, hear and even more, to obtain information from non-verbal
   communication (absent, to some extent in virtual environments). In this
   paper we propose to consider both environments as different forms and
   alternatives for people seeking formal education.
   We also propose to reflect on the communication that exists in a VLE,
   using a ``Middle Communication Model{''} which considers the different
   levels of interaction that make up the communication process in a VLE.
   Resources and materials integrated into a VLE are messages that present
   through different communication languages, all natural human languages,
   but in a VLE they require a treatment that emphasizes them due the lack
   of kinesthetic language, so that the materials contain the necessary
   interactivity and in addition with an appropriate interaction, enabling
   teachers and students feel a real innovative learning environment.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last couple of years Unitec New Zealand's Plumbing Gasfitting
   and Drainlaying Department has developed a suite of twenty-five eBooks
   for the plumbing and gasfitting industry. Based on our successful
   correspondence model, the eBooks are substantially enhanced with
   multimedia including custom-made animation, interactive simulations and
   QuickTime Virtual Reality. This resource is proving popular with
   apprentices, particularly otherwise-reluctant learners.
   Prototype software was developed in collaboration with a group of
   talented Unitec NZ computing science students for their end-of-degree
   Industry Project. On completion, the prototype was so successful that
   Unitec retained the Industry Project group to develop the fully
   functional software necessary to compile the eBooks (KatipoWriter) and
   to complete the website which hosts them.
   The design of the website and the custombuilt compiler enables Unitec to
   move quickly to update content when changes occur in the industry.
   The investment in multimedia enables users to easily interact in a
   virtual sense with the science and general principles that underlie the
   `what' and the `how' of plumbing and gasfitting, enabling users to
   readily make connections between theory and practice. Eventually, the
   website will include a series of short courses for qualified plumbers
   and gasfitters wanting to undertake ongoing professional development.
   This paper provides background and context to the development of Unitec
   New Zealand's Plumbing and Gasfitting eBook Project. The actual
   presentation will be in the form of a live presentation of the resource.}},

Abstract = {{To support learning of emergent social and professional networking
   skills in an online e-business course, the author has developed a
   curriculum innovation that provides an authentic and collaborative
   learning experience to complement existing curriculum. The author
   describes his review of research literature into situated cognition,
   socially-shared cognition, collaborative learning, authentic learning,
   and generational characterizations such as millennial learners and
   digital natives in the context of online learning and e-business
   activities. A description follows of how this review has been initially
   applied for the author's online course in e-business as the basis for
   subsequent action research focusing on usability of these techniques
   within an online learning environment. The course design innovation
   achieves a two-fold purpose in its learning objectives. Online social
   networking is introduced early in the course and sustained throughout
   the semester to enhance collaborative learning among peers, especially
   those whose preferences and needs are addressed through the enhanced use
   of collaborative activities using social networking sites, software, and
   techniques. Social networking activities are also introduced to support
   the initial building of knowledge and skills in the context of
   e-business marketing strategies, such as in generating new business,
   customer prospecting, establishing trust, and building working
   relationships. Social networking sites and activities include blogging
   on hosted blogging services, micro-blogging on twitter.com, professional
   networking on linkedin.com, social networking on facebook.com, social
   bookmarking on delicious.com, and social posting on posterous.com.
   Mobile communication techniques are also introduced in the context of
   online learning and e-business strategies. The instructional strategy of
   this innovation is described in terms of a cognitive apprenticeship
   model in which social networking is modeled and the scope of related
   activities are scaffolded and supported through individualized coaching
   which is later receded to allow for initial expertise to build from the
   reciprocal sharing of knowledge among learning peers in a social
   networking environment. This curriculum innovation is also elaborated in
   ways that teachers can understand and apply social networking and social
   media as learning support strategies in other types of courses. The
   paper concludes with a proposal for subsequent user experience
   evaluation that is deemed appropriate to the early adoption stage of
   this curriculum innovation.}},

Abstract = {{The simulation allows to accelerate the learning process and improves
   its quality. With simulation clinics, Dental Schools have improved their
   preclinical laboratories to provide a more realistic clinical teaching
   environment. In dental education, it is highly desirable for students to
   develop some degree of automaticity with certain clinical skills
   (positioning the dental mirror, manipulating the dental handpiece and
   burs, and the use of indirect vision) prior to treating patients.
   In Pediatric Dentistry matter (3rd and 4 th course of the Degree in
   Odontology, UCM) the student realizes a few preclinical practices in
   conditions of simulation. On having finished it, they must have
   demonstrated the necessary competencies before their incorporation to
   the dental treatment of infantile patients.
   With the support of a Project of Educational Innovation of the UCM, we
   the teachers of the Matter have developed a few practical guides
   incorporate in digital videos with the preclinical restorative
   procedures. For the student, this didactic resource helps him to the
   autolearning of normal procedures and contributes to a more flexible
   formative action focused on the student. Instructional videos may aid in
   the teaching of steps in preparation and restoration of primary teeth.}},

Abstract = {{New methodologies and materials are required to optimize the
   transference of knowledge between teacher and student yielding the
   improvement of the educational process. Nowadays, this process is
   focused on the student autonomy that is understood as the competence of
   learning-to-learn. Consequently, the development of new approaches of
   teaching should be oriented to reinforce the learning-to-learn
   competence.
   This work describes an original experience based on these principles of
   innovative teaching. The experience has been carried out the last two
   academic years in the subject ``Communication Theory{''} for students
   belonging to Telecommunication Engineering Bachelor in the University of
   Jaen (Spain). The main idea is to develop a communication system over
   the acoustic channel using the multimedia hardware of a PC. The speakers
   are the transmitters while the microphone is the receiver of the
   communication system. A simulator in MATLAB has been implemented to be
   able to perform the transmission and reception over the acoustic
   channel. Some digital modulations are introduced during this subject,
   concretely, the family of modulations M-PSK, M-FSK and M-QAM. The
   simulation software allows the parameterization of digital modulations
   in order to evaluate their performance over the acoustic channel.
   In this teaching experience, new material associated to digital
   modulations has been generated and organized following the principles of
   problem-based teaching. The student revises the material and interacts
   with the simulator in real-time in order to assert the theoretical
   concepts. The material and the simulation program are available in the
   web-based platform ILIAS of the University of Jaen. In this way, the
   autonomous study is reinforced making use of web-based resources.
   In order to demonstrate the advantages of the methodology, an evaluation
   is performed before and after the introduction of the new material. The
   results show an improvement about 0,8 (in a 0 to 10 scale) in the way
   the students understand the techniques and their associated problems.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the obtained experience in the development of a
   teaching innovation project in which a new methodology has been applied
   to four computer network subjects that belong to different degrees at
   the University of Jaen: Digital Network Architecture (Ingenieria Tecnica
   de Telecomunicacion); Networks, Services and Systems I (Ingenieria de
   Telecomunicacion); Communication Networks Management (Ingenieria de
   Telecomunicacion); and Computer Networks (Ingenieria Tecnica
   Industrial).
   The teaching innovation project proposes that the students work in
   groups in order that each group develops a project that includes several
   aspects of the different subjects. The main objective of the proposed
   methodology is to improve the following aspects: autonomous learning,
   work group, active attitude in the learning process, expression aptitude
   and criticism, theory application and curriculum diversification.
   The teaching project comprises the following activities: a) to present
   the selected projects to the students; b) to teach additional classes
   regarding the projects; c) to order the needed material; d) to execute
   projects; e) to present and evaluate the results that have been obtained
   in each working group; and f) to carry out a survey.
   The results obtained in the teaching project shows that the
   participating students have improve their skills and marks and have
   developed autonomously several tasks including preliminary study of the
   state of the art, documentation and selection of hardware and software,
   develop of their project, design and develop of tests and experiments,
   analysis of results, obtaining conclusions, documentation and oral
   presentation.}},

Abstract = {{As a researcher and teacher (course of Architectural Design 3) at
   Universita di Bologna, Faculty of Engineering, in order to leverage
   novelty in architectural thinking, innovation was promoted in:
   . teaching methods
   . theory + design strategies
   . tools
   Teaching methods
   The Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) paradigm influenced education,
   learning and knowledge. General assumptions about classroom learning
   tend towards a one-way information flow from a teacher to a relatively
   passive learner within a linear path (from theory to application) and an
   homogeneous knowledge base. Research has shown a different, non linear
   landscape, where learners are diverse (both in knowledge and learning
   ways), theory and application have mutual influence and
   intercommunication (multiple and dense information flow) is the basis
   for knowledge intensification. Knowledge is continuously created, so
   recognizing, capturing and questioning it is vital. The course uses a
   social network (first opened on http://ar-ca3.ning.com/ - moved to
   http://grou.ps/arca3/ - public and seamlessly connected to other web
   ecologies) as a ``meme pool{''}: the flow of memes (basic units of
   information) forms networks of raising emergent complexity up to evolved
   systems of thinking in this platform for knowledge exchange, an
   information ecosystem that is an aspect of our natural ecosystem.
   Students and teachers share experiences and are exposed to different
   stimulations, engaging reflection in front of the unexpected and the
   heterogeneous.
   Workshops (used to teach tools) are a necessary completion of a
   theoretical framework; the intensive knowledge application to a specific
   issue through a ``learning by doing{''} experience pushes cognition
   acceleration.
   Theory + design strategies
   The core of the approach is a theoretical framework which gravitates
   around the key concepts of
   . nature as a CAS
   . emergence
   . complexity + network model
   . information, morphogenesis and evolution
   . environmental sensibility and design ecologies
   Design strategies follow a 3 stages open path: rule-based morphogenesis,
   trials and errors, evaluation and selection. ``Errors{''} are the real
   chances of learning in front of the unexpected: the new information
   gained can then feedback in the design process or make it diverge
   towards new paths. Environmental sensibility is embedded since
   morphogenesis through information-driven processes and perpetually
   monitored.
   Tools
   Knowledge is a continuous process of modeling, tools and brains are
   mutually shaping each other. The course structure exploits a set of
   tools ranging from teaching to design tools (taught through workshops),
   the most important being:
   Teaching tools:
   . the social network and its connected web ecologies
   . VUE (visual understanding environment): non-linear organization of
   lectures, focusing on connections more than on notions;
   . lectures by leading-edge figures of architectural scenario (t<>p
   lecture series - http://grou.ps/arca3/calendar/event/130300)
   Design tools:
   . Rhinoceros
   . Rhinoscript, Grasshopper
   . Autodesk(R) Maya
   . Ecotect
   Tools were taught leading to the fabrication of a simple design idea
   from the digital model. Despite our lack of digital fabrication tools it
   was important to go through an engineering process of complex shapes.}},

Abstract = {{This project involves the creation of methodological innovation,
   technology, and the development of multimedia educational content. It
   emphasises the Undergraduate Course, which is the basis of the future of
   the Faculty, and it is in preparation for the implementation of degrees
   beginning in the 20102011 academic year at the College of Fine Arts
   Altea. The project will develop multimedia materials useful for teaching
   and distance learning.
   More specifically, RUIDEM PROJECT is a draft of a type of interactive
   format accessed through computers, utilising documents designed for a
   web-based format, that integrate multimedia, interactivity and
   self-assessment resources with feedback.
   This project is intended to establish measures conducive to creating new
   and efficient modes of dissemination of the Regulations for the use of
   Educational Facilities among teachers and students. It will combine
   multimedia tools and online learning to present the information through
   a slideshow, voice-over narration and a digital narrator. This on-line
   interactive audiovisual will be accompanied by virtual animation
   creation and types of assessment such as multiple choice, association
   and fill in the blanks.
   The project is directed and focused on teachers, learners and service
   personnel in general as whole, with a focus on the scope of concrete
   knowledge, effective participation, penalties, and enforcement of the
   use of infrastructure, studio, spaces, machinery, and teaching materials
   of our Faculty of Fine Arts. This project is intended as to completely
   develop the full potential of the Faculty of Fine Arts, Altea and to
   encourage the correct, or proper, use of the infrastructure. The
   ``Regulations for the use of Educational Infrastructure{''} currently
   exists as a written document, but because of its length it is difficult
   for students to read and understand it completely. The Project will
   develop and emphasise the most crucial points in order to make an
   understanding of the Regulations more feasible. The ultimate goal is to
   finish the documents, reports and dissemination of the use of the rules
   of the workshops of the Faculty, because knowledge of their proper
   functioning is vital in the teaching and training of students in Fine
   Arts to the standard of the European Higher Education Area. The finished
   result will be included in all syllabi of the degree, as an
   understanding of the Regulations is essential to the success of the
   learning process in both teachers and students.}},

Abstract = {{Teaching engineering design in the early phases, especially in the
   sophomore or junior years can be very challenging. It is difficult to
   mimic the industrial setting to leap from concept to prototype to
   product in a classroom environment. By presenting a real-world problem
   that has a potential demand, it is possible to emulate the design steps
   carried out in the industry. In-class design projects consisting of
   paper design and computer simulation lack the final (and rewarding)
   stage of a physical product. Introducing prototyping can facilitate a
   stage in design where a physical product is necessary for better
   conceptual understanding, clearer visualization, and realization of the
   specialized problems.
   The objective of this paper is to present a method that provides
   motivation in teaching product design through rapid 3-D prototyping. The
   progression of a heart valve design is described along with the modeling
   capabilities and its possible benefits in the classroom.
   Rapid prototyping is the fabrication of physical objects from 3-D
   virtual images in a digital data set. This technology is used to make
   models and prototype parts for desired applications in many fields. In
   most projects, a designer has to conceptualize and analyze different
   versions of the product to be made. Selective versions of the design are
   then replicated on a computer using computer aided design (CAD) programs
   such as SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Maya, etc. After the design is made on the
   computer, the corresponding data is transferred into a 3-D printing
   machine where a physical model is made. Models can be made out of an
   ABS-type substance which can be hardened to yield good prototypes. Other
   materials that can be used are plastic, rubber, or metal. In addition,
   it is possible to enhance the appearance of the prototype by adding
   coloring to give it a more real and life-like appearance. In this
   project a heart valve is designed using an iterative approach to rapid
   prototyping technology.
   The first step in designing a heart valve included doing research on
   current solutions methods and studies of the heart valve. Using this
   information, several models were made using SolidWorks with varying
   properties. For designand prototyping purposes only two models were
   selected. During design reviews, some of the problems were identified
   and necessary improvements were made. New 3-D prototypes of the mitral
   valve, which is one of the valves requiring replacement in some patients
   with valvular disease, are being designed to alleviate the problems
   observed.
   The process of 3-D prototyping in a classroom setting will give the
   students a better appreciation of a real part and the progressing from
   conceptual design to physical design. The heart valve models will be
   used for educational purposes, and refined models will be used for
   laboratory experimental testing giving better insight into designing
   improved artificial heart valves. In conclusion, the approach of rapid
   prototyping in teaching product design with a case study of heart valves
   appears to be feasible.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of a professional development grant for college
   professors educating teachers in varying academic disciplines, the
   presenters were introduced to a new curriculum development approach
   intended to integrate knowledge in a discipline with teaching strategies
   and technology applications. The approach provides a framework for
   ``teacher knowledge ... as a complex interaction among three bodies of
   knowledge{''} {[}1] with the added element of leadership: technology,
   pedagogy, administration and content knowledge.(TPCK).
   One of the presenters participated in an intensive collaborative study
   of TPCK in a grant-supported interdisciplinary leadership committee
   seeking to develop teachers with the ability to integrate appropriate
   technology in teaching their specific subjects. In particular, the
   presentation describes development of a plan to use ``flip (digital)
   video{''} as a technology to enhance the pedagogy of teaching interview
   skills to school leadership candidates. Results of the collaborative
   TPCK curriculum development process led to successful use of the
   technical advantages of digital video in helping interviewers and
   interviewees practice, observe, and analyze the use of interviewing
   skills in a group setting.
   Beyond using the TPCK approach to integrated curriculum and technology
   development, this session explores the use of social networking as a
   professional development forum for college faculty. The presentation
   describes group interactions that occurred when faculty from varying
   specialties met to share learning about technologies and to brainstorm
   creative applications of new technologies within their subject areas.
   The session concludes with presenter reflections about extending faculty
   professional development into the realm of Web 2.0 through the use of
   online social networking media and learning management systems to
   connect college faculty across distance and geographic boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{The strategic framework for European co-operation in education and
   training (ET2000) underlines the need to promote the modernisation
   agenda for higher education to improve the quality and efficiency of
   education and training.
   The Universities have an important role to play in future. One of the
   main strategies is to stimulate the student's autonomy and how to
   develop creativity and innovative attitudes. The higher education
   program encourages the best use of teaching and learning techniques
   based on ICT(information and communication technologies).
   Our innovation team has adapted to the European Higher Education Area
   model the food analysis experimental teaching in different degrees:
   Pharmacy, Food Science and Technology, and Human Nutrition and
   Dietetics. The knowledge of the analytical procedures in food analysis
   is essential to Health Science students.
   An audiovisual material has been developed in Power Point, describing
   the different analytical methods. Videos of experimental procedures
   performed in the laboratory by the teacher have been filmed with a
   digital video camera. This material has been transferred to a PC and
   edited with specific software; it will serve as a support to
   experimental teaching.
   A DVD in Spanish and English Language has also been developed. It
   describes the analytical methods with the aim that Spanish and foreign
   students, by means of the ``UCM Campus Virtual{''}, might have a tool to
   facilitate their learning.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper is directed to show, on one hand, the contribution
   given by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to the
   teaching and learning activities that currently take place in various
   contexts; on the other hand it refers to other ongoing projects about
   the ways to archive and share educational resources.
   Our attention will focus on:
   the importance of networking technologies for learning and for the
   management and dissemination of information and knowledge
   the creation of innovative learning tools
   the importance that is going to be taken by non-formal educational
   settings (such as libraries) in lifelong learning society
   towards which direction it's important to work to ensure that
   information sources are actually available to every active citizen
   In the first part the main contexts of use of new technologies are
   analyzed, in line with lifelong learning society's demands. Then it is
   described the role that public libraries, especially the academic ones,
   tend to assume at the Italian and European level, into knowledge
   building paths and knowledge management.
   Finally we are going to examine some learning object repositories at
   Italian and international level, with standardization matters regarding
   digital resources and their sharing and reusability.
   After several years spent in discussions and conferences about an
   information based society, the focus is now on ``knowledge{''} seen as a
   complex of attitudes, procedures and expectations that are the most
   relevant values of our society; the Lisbon Council in 2000 set a
   strategic goal to make Europe, within a decade, ``the most competitive
   knowledge-based society{''}, encouraging in particular the spreading of
   ICT, digitalization projects, open standards and open source archives.
   Can we feel satisfied in achieving this goal?
   It's also important to consider that the role of informal education
   always exercised by libraries, at the dawn of the third millennium is
   radically changing and it has exhausted its traditional role of
   mediation, counselling and assistance. We are facing a new model called
   knowledge management in which libraries find their place at the
   beginning of information transfer circles, becoming responsible not only
   for the organization and dissemination of resources, but also for the
   creation of innovative forms of shared knowledge, not just carefully
   selected and organized but also dynamically customized according to the
   needs and language of ever more demanding and sophisticated users.}},

Abstract = {{It has been for a few years now that new technologies have been entering
   the learning field and new educational methods are taking full advantage
   of these available technologies, testing and verifying the possible
   synergy between teaching innovations and the changes that these
   technologies have already brought to the practice and to project designs
   of professional studies. Education is undergoing a rapid process of
   evolution, particularly in Higher Education where there is a concurrence
   between technological advancement due to e-learning and the need to
   modify traditional educational models. For these reason many
   universities and teaching institutions are strongly pointing towards
   long-distance teaching environments, such as telematic universities that
   train students who are not obliged to attend lessons, giving them
   maximum flexibility in time and learning mode, thanks to e-learning
   environments implemented in Internet. The Council of Europe (Lisbon
   2000) has set a major aim for Europe to become before 2010 ``the most
   dynamic and competitive knowledge society in the world, with sustainable
   economic growth, higher and better employment, and greater social
   cohesion{''}. In March 2001 the Council of Europe presented an
   e-learning action plan calling for a significant program of updating and
   coordination between European education systems. These include:-
   developing and integrating ICT in education and training;- developing
   high quality educational materials;- creating flexible infrastructures
   to make e-learning accessible to all;- promoting a universal digital
   instruction;- creating lifelong learning opportunities.
   The main goals that the work develops are:
   1. the construction of an interactive course on architectural design for
   architectural long-distance teaching, with the support of online
   thematic databases, and definition of guidelines for the methodology of
   architectural e-learning;
   2. the selection of the appropriate platform in order to release the
   courses, taking into account the technological requirements as
   interactivity, the catchment area, the system expansibility;
   3. verify the efficacy of e-learning through the observation and the
   monitoring of the courses and the arrangement of tools and tests for
   quality and quantity verification. The work take into account the
   experience of the Multimedia Laboratory of Architecture (LaMA).

Abstract = {{A learning pill is a ``reusable learning objects{''}, that is, a
   digitized entity, which can be used, reused or referenced during
   technology, supported learning or small chunks of learning (granules,
   objects) that are labelled (meta-tagged within IMS standards) so systems
   can automatically mix and match them to assemble and deliver
   individualized learning experiences. They present a hierarchy of
   learning objects, which ranges from simulation through topical unit and
   reusable learning object (RLO) to information objects.
   Learning pills are a new way of thinking about learning content.
   Traditionally, content comes in a several hour chunk. Learning objects
   are much smaller units of learning, typically ranging from 10 to 15
   minutes. Are self-contained - each learning object can be taken
   independently and reusable - a single learning object may be used in
   multiple contexts for multiple purposes. Can be aggregated - learning
   objects can be grouped into larger collections of content, including
   traditional course structures. Are tagged with metadata - every learning
   object has descriptive information allowing it to be easily found by a
   search.
   A learning pill in the University of Vigo has a 1024P+P format. It
   enables us to combine a computer desktop image and the video image of
   the lecturer or presenter in the same video. The end product is a video
   with resolution at 1024x768 including the lecturer, his/her voice and
   the PC background used for the presentation in all its resolution, with
   any program used and the mouse pointer movements.
   In the case of engineering disciplines, learning pills are well received
   by students not only if their content is about fundamental concepts on
   chemical engineering but in the following cases: case studies, use of
   computer programs, problem resolution.
   In the case of problem resolution we are now working in a new kind of
   learning pill called ``mixed learning pill{''} because we have detected
   the time that takes the numerical resolution is very large in relation
   to the ``key steps{''} description. By means of a short postproduction,
   we can reduce or accelerate the calculations time to focus our learning
   pill on key steps, combining the use of or excel or matlab screencast
   recordings for the calculations with PowerPoint slides for the key
   steps.
   Finally, to evaluate competences reached by students, according to the
   Bologna Declaration in the European Space for Higher education a new
   tool that complement the knowledge pills in order to help the student
   the knowledge level reached, teachers are preparing test under the
   flashcard format.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the EFL/ESL teachers search for traditional ways to motivate
   their students to learn English or even suffice with the textbook and
   other supplementary materials. They ignore the fact that their students
   are ``digital natives{''} who live in the ``digital world{''} and that
   they spend hours online either by playing interactive games or surfing
   the net for some information about things they prefer. Teachers ignore
   the fact that they can motivate their students by introducing them to
   what they like and not to what they should like.
   Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to present the experience of the
   researcher who used Storytelling Alice with her students to enhance
   their English Language Proficiency. Storytelling Alice is 3D programming
   software designed primarily for teaching secondary school students
   programming. The software includes ``worlds{''} that refers to the
   setting of the story, imaginary characters, buildings, animals, and
   aliens. The children has to learn first how to select the world, how to
   choose the characters and most importantly how to make the characters
   move, speak, duck, run, dance, and turn. Speaking is one of the most
   important features in this presentation as it is one of the means of
   communication, and negotiation of meaning. In this presentation, the
   researcher will show the participants how she taught speech acts by
   using storytelling Alice. Speech acts are statements that communicate a
   certain message to the listener such as making requests, asking
   questions, apologizing, agreeing and disagreeing and many other types.
   Speech acts are challenging for the non-native speakers of English due
   to L1 interference. That is to say, the influence of their language will
   hinder communication with either the hearer or speaker. Therefore, to
   motivate the students to learn Speech acts in an innovative way, the
   researchers encouraged them to make a project using one of the speech
   acts types that they have studied. The students took 3D programming
   classes parallel to the grammar and conversation class. The researcher
   introduced the topic of agreeing and disagreeing and gave the students
   some guiding examples. Then the students were asked to use the
   Storytelling Alice program to produce dialogues or conversations between
   two characters that have to do with the theme of agreeing and
   disagreeing. The students had two choices to enable the characters to
   speak: they can either add conversation bubbles, or they can record
   their voices (similar to role play). The students were asked to choose
   the first option which is adding the conversation bubbles. The students
   participating in this program were secondary school students who
   enrolled for a summer school for the month of July. Then the students
   were instructed to work in pairs on creating a world in which there is a
   conversation between two characters. The theme should be agreeing and
   disagreeing. The students produce creative scenes with interesting
   conversations. Most of the students were influenced by the TV cartoons,
   or cyber games; however, they finally made a language project with
   something they feel interesting.}},

Abstract = {{The triple helix innovation is a process by which academia, government,
   and industry collaborate (i.e., engage in a process of mutually
   beneficial leveraging of resources) to create new knowledge, technology,
   or products and services that are transmitted to final users in
   fulfilment of a social need. Now, under the new 2.0 phenomenon, final
   users not only consume the knowledge, technology, or products and
   services but they use them to produce new goods and services.
   More recently, the Quadruple-Helix model essentially extents the three
   main pillars of the Triple Helix with a new axis referred as the
   consumer, the market, or the people in the society. In this model, local
   agents, such as city halls, science and technology parks, as well as new
   technology-based companies, gain a more prominent role.
   Citizen Information Services (CIS) is a term that encompasses all those
   names that NGOs and governments attach to public services such as: I\&R,
   CAB, Citizen Attention Service (CAS), Central Information Point, Portal
   for citizens, etc The first social services orientated to the citizens
   were created in the USA in 1870 and were known as The Social Services
   Exchanges and consisted of maintaining a centralized file and
   confidential of the families and individuals through social agencies, in
   order to ``ensure an information exchange for the aid to be adapted to
   real needs and detect impostors{''}, these services have evolved and now
   known as Information and Referral (I \& R). World War II forced the UK
   to create the Citizens Advice Bureaus (CAB) that still operate in
   present. The Republic of Ireland has followed the steps and created the
   Citizens Information Board. Governments, following the trend of the
   model G2C (Government-to-Citizens) and with the support of the UE and
   ONU, develop strategies to provide better management of government
   through transparency and public access to information enabling the
   completion of paperwork and on-line consultations and, in some cases,
   the service is available 24 hours, 365 days a year.
   In this paper we draft how would these services benefit of a
   Quadruple-helix approach. This paper uses the previously sketched
   framework with the purpose of illustrating emergent e-Government
   initiatives. More concretely, we aim to discuss citizen information
   services (CIS) from two main perspectives. First, a review on their
   history, technological and social background is described in order to
   explain the time-line conductive to the actual situation. Second, an
   impact evaluation process is proposed with the aim of enabling the
   implied parties -city halls and citizens- drawing the main implications
   of using such tools. Preliminary results point to a series of benefits
   such as cost reduction, improved service quality, work reduction, and
   enhanced end-user perceived quality and satisfaction.
   As a methodology we use the case-study. This methodology fits better our
   research since case studies are rich, empirical descriptions of
   particular instances of a phenomenon. Moreover, cases can be historical
   accounts, but they are more likely to be contemporary descriptions of
   recent events. Concretely, we focus on iSAC (Virtual Citizens Attention
   Service) a project designed to diversify the capacity of local
   Information and Referral (I\&R) Services and to improve the quality of
   such services, by using the latest scientific findings on ICTs.}},

Abstract = {{Educational project- work in progress - The project Still life with...
   is a collaborative project between, the Visual Art Education in Mary
   Immaculate Teacher Education College (MIC)(i), Limerick City Gallery of
   Art (LCGA) and International artists Anne Cleary and Denis Connolly. The
   project is based around a reinterpretation of the classical genre of
   still life painting through contemporary art practice, using new
   technology and public participation.
   Like most collaborative projects, Still life with... began as a series
   of conversations. These conversations revolved around the nature, value,
   purpose and pleasure of making and looking at art. Collaboration
   resulted from a shared aspiration of developing potential links and
   promoting the appreciation of art making, and art meaning. The project
   offers the parties involved an opportunity to develop their
   practice/knowledge base within a particular context. The author of the
   paper will focusing on the educational component of the project and will
   consider the potential contribution that will be made by MIC staff and
   students.
   The project will conclude in the form of an art installation. The
   installation is to be constructed by visual art elective students in
   Mary Immaculate College. The students will be involved in the project
   from the concept stage to completion. Within the project students will
   have control over the means of production, and the education programes
   that are devised. Connelly and Cleary will work with the students on the
   technology that will combine the made art with the interaction elements
   of the exhibition.
   The project will have a multidisciplinary approach to teaching and
   learning supporting linkage and integration across a variety of
   disciplines and subject areas (topics explored during initial
   conceptualisation included, Art History in its cultural context,
   critical thinking, architecture, art in public spaces, fine art and
   design, the use of multimedia in education, alternative educational
   programs as well as developing art making and thinking skills) It is
   envisaged that the outcomes from this collaborative, exploratory
   educational project will provide the context of developing a model for
   innovative and progressive pedagogic approaches to teaching and learning
   within Visual Art Education and digital media within MIC. The project
   will advocate a student centred approach (active involvement,
   collaboration, peer learning, reflection) while utilizing a combination
   of concepts, processes skills and digital Media in art education.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV) has designed,
   developed and set up a new teaching platform called Polimedia which is
   included in a greater project named ``Net Teaching Plan{''} which
   includes the following teaching supports: Digital Learning Objects
   (DLOs), Digital Learning Modules (DLMs) and Publication of free access
   content in the OpenCourseWare (OCW) web site. They are defined as
   individual teaching concepts characterized by small duration (in the
   5-15 min range) that can be accessed by students, teachers and/or all
   internet users as support for teaching purposes, tutorship tasks or
   simply to reinforce some concepts discussed in the class. These objects
   can be accessed by students, teachers and/or all internet users
   depending on the restrictions established by the authors, following the
   respective URL. Many of the Polimedia learning objects are based on two
   elements: a power point presentation and a teacher explanation. Both
   elements are recorded in an individual way and after recording, they are
   processed together into a video file to offer a learning object
   characterized by complete synchronization between the power point
   presentation and the teacher explanation. This learning object allows
   some levels of interactivity with the students since it is possible to
   record different questions; the student can pause the video file and try
   to answer. We recommend some Polimedia objects to the students one week
   before the concept is discussed in the class so the student can work
   with the concept and he has an active role in the teaching -learning
   process. We also use these Polimedia objects for on-line tutorship tasks
   so students can formulate different questions via e-mail after viewing
   and working the Polimedia object. The overall results of the use of this
   new multimedia platform are really interesting and very useful due to
   the active role of the student in the teaching-learning process.}},

Abstract = {{University Faculties of Fine Arts in Spain have recently started
   offering classes which, up until a few years ago, were taught
   exclusively to advanced vocational students or those studying in
   Audiovisual Communication Faculties. These classes use audiovisual media
   as a creative tool. This stems, firstly, from artists' need to use all
   the technological instruments available to them throughout the creative
   process, and, secondly, from the boom in the use of alternative digital
   media, primarily via the Internet. What was once used only by a
   privileged few, who could afford the extremely high costs of audiovisual
   material, is now available to anyone with a computer and a digital
   camera, so that they too can produce high-quality audiovisual creations.
   It is now, in this period of democratisation of audiovisual creation,
   when art teaching becomes particularly important. Students need to know
   about scriptwriting, audiovisual language, storyboarding, filming and,
   above all, postproduction using highly-specific, difficultly-mastered
   software packages. Current curricula limit the teaching of these
   subjects to just a few hours each week during one term, but the changes
   made to university courses in order to adapt to the European Higher
   Education Area mean that we will be able to provide students with the
   tools that they need to learn these techniques independently.
   A group of lecturers from the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of
   Granada is working on a Teaching Innovation Project, which is financed
   by the University's Vice-Chancellorship for Quality Assurance. The main
   aims of this Project are:
   1. To provide students with the tools that they need to carry out
   post-production processes on audiovisual materials independently.
   2. To use interactive methods to show students the different steps that
   need to be taken in the pre-production stage.
   3. To create audiovisual materials which can be consulted by all
   students so that they can correct their work themselves.
   The pre-production stage is the part of the process of audiovisual
   production which requires the most time, but it can also be learnt
   outside of the classroom, provided that students have access to the
   necessary educational resources.
   However, once students have completed the second stage - production -
   they find that they have to edit their audiovisual creation and adapt it
   to the final format and media used. To make this task easier for
   students, the Teaching Innovation Project aims to prepare two tutorials
   to teach them how to use the video editing programmes Adobe Premiere and
   After Effects CS3.
   We believe that this Innovation Project will help students enrolled on
   audiovisual courses (video creation, animation, etc...) to learn about
   the basic concepts of audiovisual creation, as well as about the
   advanced tools that can be used to complement their training within the
   framework of the European Higher Education Area. Our work at the
   Conference will be centred around showing attendees the advances that
   have been made in the Project and the results achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The architectural curriculum of today still resembles that of a
   curriculum established in the 1950' s. Technological innovation, while
   having a superficial affect on the modern education of an architect, has
   not been fully incorporated into an antiquated pedagogy. Schools of
   architecture continually utilize digital tools for innovative purposes
   on an individual level but rarely incorporate these tools as part of
   curricular development. Digital tools and methodologies - many of which
   are borrowed from outside fields - are generally explored by students,
   teachers with an interest, or recent graduates who have newly entered
   academia within a curriculum that does not recognize the rapid change
   the profession of architecture has undergone toward the end of the 20th
   century. Computer-generated design, digital fabrication, Building
   Information Modeling, computer simulations and sustainability are but a
   few of the major innovations that have redefined architectural practice.
   These topics should be imbedded into a curriculum for the 21st century,
   replacing outmoded teaching methodologies put in place in an era prior
   to the advent of the personal computer and global warming. The shift in
   ideology should not replace a design education but augment it - making
   it relevant to issues and practices of the architect in the 21st
   century.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Game Based Learning (DGBL) is the concept that Digital Games can
   be used to facilitate traditional methods of learning, either in a
   formal classroom setting or in an informal learning environment such as
   the learner's home or an institutions computer laboratory. The
   advantages that DGBL brings to any learning environment includes
   heightened engagement, an interactive learning process, adaptability to
   subject matter and a learning style suited to modern learners.
   Whilst there may be some resistance to implementing DGBL, using gaming
   as a means to learn is by no means a new occurrence. Games have been
   part and parcel of our daily-lives for the majority of our existence.
   During the 20th century certain traditional games were transformed into
   digital versions and new digital games were created spurned on through
   the introduction of the computer, the internet and mobile phones which
   have put these digital games within the reach of billions of people
   around the planet. The 18-25 year old youth market, which is the main
   target market of tertiary education institutions and constitutes the
   term `modern learner', are well-schooled in using and interacting with
   digital technologies of this nature and as such are not only willing to
   but more importantly want to learn by more engaging and entertainment
   means such as DGBL.
   The pervasiveness, as well as the engaging and entertaining nature of
   digital games, has led to concept of digital game-based learning (DGBL).
   The motivational power of digital games as well as their ability to let
   learners `learn by doing' makes then very attractive learning tools. As
   such, digital games are no longer viewed as simply being of value for
   entertainment purposes but also for educational purposes. This has lead
   to DGBL receiving widespread attention, both in corporate and
   educational arenas. Digital game-based learning provides universities
   not only with innovative learning methods but also with a competitive
   advantage. Digital game-based learning should be introduced for adult
   education and that universities can and should use digital gaming as a
   new form of innovative learning. Since the introduction of the digital
   gaming industry, it has grown to a substantial industry that has an
   important role to play in the evolution of the curriculum for any
   Information Systems courses.
   While research into the use of digital games in education is relatively
   novel it is growing rapidly. Historical DGBL research has predominantly
   focused mostly on proving DGBL's effectiveness rather than exploring why
   and how they are effective as well as what he terms ``prescription{''}
   which refers to how to implement DBGL. Additionally, although the
   concept of adoption frameworks is widespread within the academic
   community, given the relatively immature nature of DGBL adoption within
   educational and corporate institutions, it is important to develop a
   DGBL-specific adoption framework which can be used by educational
   institutions wishing to implement DGBL as part of their curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{``Serious Games{''} is a term to describe a game that is played mainly
   for educational purposes. This does not mean that the games are not fun,
   entertaining. This term was originally to describe educational board and
   card games used in the home or the classroom. Now that gaming - both
   online and offline - has entered the digital age and swept across our
   collective media landscape, this is the perfect opportunity to use this
   technology and marry it with what we know about how children learn.
   Here is what we know about how children learn; based on the principles
   of Multiple Intelligences and Brain Based learning, we that children
   learn by a process of absorption, by seeing, touching, hearing, smelling
   and most of all, by doing(1). By the time a child enters school, he or
   she comes with a defined and sophisticated knowledge base which can be
   used for the teacher's and peers' benefit.
   Online learning has created a paradigm shift in the classroom,
   stimulating and developing a new range of skills; from image and text
   processing to sifting and sorting; from single-task to multi-task
   acquisition; from passive receipt of material to active participation in
   the gathering of that material. Young learners in this digital
   environment form a mosaic of facts and impressions from a variety of
   sources; they are not overwhelmed by the vastness of the internet,
   shrink from learning new applications nor do they draw a sharp line
   between the virtual and live learning experience. These ``digital
   natives{''} often join the classroom with the skills they need to jump
   straight into the information stream; we from the analog world moan that
   kids today do not use libraries or read books in the same way our
   ancestors lamented our parents' lack of skills churning butter or using
   a loom.
   As these changes rock the world of education, there are profound changes
   occurring within the field of gaming; the same tools - Social Media,
   devices like the iPhone and end-user innovation - are found in the new
   generation of entertainment games and require the same skills to use
   them. Flash animation and 3-D rendering tools have made the graphics
   more believable; serious games offer the ability to experience
   situations which would otherwise be impossible to re-create in a
   ``live{''} environment due to cost, safety or logistical issues. Some
   examples for adult applications are flight simulators to train pilots,
   military training and health and safety workers' training.
   This visual presentation will combine what we know about how children
   learn with what we know about how they play and take the first steps
   towards building serious learning games for primary school education,
   using the Social Media and Flash animation.

Abstract = {{Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are part of a digital
   technology known as human interface technology (HIT). These technologies
   are emerging, as AR is part of the reality-virtuality continuum of
   placing virtual objects in the real world, in real time. This technology
   is currently being developed for use in a many industries
   internationally, and its use to enhance and reinforce procedural
   learning in medicine and radiology is well established. Similarly,
   within the global context, there is a wealth of information about the
   benefits of using simulators, such as manikins in health care, as
   effective and safe learning and teaching (L\&T) tools. The use of
   immersive VR within education has been found to accelerate student
   understanding of complex concepts. By integrating simulation and AR,
   authentic and exciting interdisciplinary L\&T opportunities can be
   explored.
   The majority of current nursing, medical and human life science students
   are `digital natives' and have expectations that their L\&T experiences
   will be supported by the digital world with which they are familiar.
   However, its use for `immigrants' is also being well received. Rigorous
   research exploring the use of AR in the simulation environment for L\&T
   is currently scant. The School of Nursing and Midwifery at the
   University of Tasmania, Australia, in collaboration with the HITLAB
   Australia, is leading L\&T simulation in Tasmania by developing
   innovative ways of using AR in order to reduce the theory-practice gap
   and stimulate new ways of learning in a low risk health environment.
   The aim of this paper is to outline how HIT prepares to meet the
   expectations of `millennial' students and healthcare professionals by
   integrating AR into the simulation skills environment.}},

Abstract = {{This research looks at the cognitive issues of a struggling dyslexic
   reader and how a multi-sensory approach of teaching reading can be
   conjoined with the new theoretical methods of interaction design, in
   order to develop innovative technologies that enhance customized
   learning. In this research a case study identifies how alternative
   methods for teaching a dyslexic learner to read might suggest other
   approaches to teaching reading to all types of learners. Studying the
   published educational and psychological research of the issues
   surrounding the dyslexic reading problem, along with the multitude of
   practical questions I formed in interviews, motivated me to ask this
   design research question: What are visual, auditory, tactile, and
   kinesthetic ways to teach the relationships between phonemic sounds and
   alphabetic letterforms through innovative digital interactive learning
   interfaces for dyslexic children 9 -11 years old?
   Sub-Questions: How can photographic images and moving images be
   integrated with alphabetic letterforms to give visual cues to a
   struggling reader on how to pronounce phonemes? How can digital
   interactive learning experiences be created that allows a student to
   learn to read using the combination of senses, that would allow them to
   learn in a manner that is best for them?
   This approach is rooted in multi-sensory on-screen reading experiences.
   Additionally, I ask the question: ``How can reading be taught in a way
   that de-emphasizes the 26 letters or our alphabet but stresses the 44
   common sounds that comprise the English language,{''} for it is sound
   that makes up the spoken word.
   The first section of the paper defines the condition of dyslexia, as
   well as clarifies some of the common misconceptions. Additionally, I
   outline the established education, science, and psychology research for
   which this interaction design project is based, which includes a 1975
   research study by Villutino, Smith, Steger, and Kaman, outlining the
   primary cognitive issues surrounding the struggles of a dyslexic reader,
   and Howard Gardner's `` Multiple Intelligences{''}.
   The second section defines a dyslexic learning style and analyzes the
   current multisensory approach to teaching dyslexics to read in hope of
   establishing some criteria for how an on-screen reading experience can
   address these issues and add other benefits to learning. Additionally,
   this research project looks at the benefits of having
   technology-enhanced learning in the classroom. With the use of
   technology in the classroom I argue the need for interdisciplinary teams
   (consisting of interactive designers, and educators) working together in
   the development of educational curricula.
   The fourth section explains design explorations in response to the
   research previously discussed. These studies seek to engage multiple
   senses. By embedding visual, auditory, and tactile, and kinesthetic
   qualities within letterforms for on-screen reading, a dyslexic reader
   gets the cues as he/she needs them within the actual context of reading
   text, which allows for the individualization of instruction without
   additional teachers. Taking into consideration the different pathways to
   learning. Both the educator and interaction designer can work together
   to develop digital interactive learning tools that allow students to
   engage any combination of learning pathways. Thereby giving students
   access to concepts and ideas that have been blocked and/or shorten the
   time it takes for any students to master new concepts.}},

Abstract = {{The transformation that has been taking place within higher education
   due to new digital technologies and information systems is fundamentally
   changing the way students will be educated in the future. In Thomas
   Friedman's book The World is Flat, {[}1] the author refers to a new
   global connectivity where everyone has access to the same vast network
   of information and ideas. The opportunity this connectivity brings to
   higher education has been largely unrealized. The ability to access a
   rapidly growing library of high-quality information resources for a
   relatively small financial investment will allow institutions in the
   developing world to compete with established institutions in the West.
   With education becoming more consistent and equal in standard globally,
   all academic institutions will need to be more competitive to attract
   students. This paper will examine innovative systems such as online
   textbook sources, Wikimedia, and student and faculty networks in which
   digital technology can potentially improve learning outcomes and better
   utilize financial resources. This paper will also explore how new
   technology will create new types of resources and how they will be
   potentially shared among users and institutions.
   The autonomous campus that strives to secure all its resources in one
   physical place will not be able to compete with the networked campus.
   Alliances between institutions of higher education, similar to what one
   would find in the corporate world, will allow for greater flexibility,
   diversity, quality of information and financial competitiveness. This
   paper will examine types of alliances and how institutions might benefit
   by sharing faculty, students and university resources.
   The paper will conclude by looking at this new hybrid condition in
   higher education that will mediate between physical and virtual
   classrooms. It will examine how the role of faculty in teaching and
   research will be altered to incorporate new teaching methods as well as
   new teaching structures.}},

Abstract = {{Analysts of curricular innovation identify two different versions: the
   intended reform, which presents idealised prescriptions, and the
   realised version, which is actually implemented in classrooms (Coleman,
   1996; Fullan, 2001; Markee, 1997). There is often a gap between the two
   because the experience and perceptions of the key decision-makers - the
   teachers - are usually not taken fully into account (MacDonald, 1991;
   McGee, 1997). This paper reports an ongoing collaborative curricular
   reform project which seeks to enhance personnel and institutional
   capacity through joint investment and empowerment (Norton, 2000).
   The introduction to the paper briefly discusses alternative strategies
   of curriculum reform focussing on the teaching and learning of English
   as a second language, and reviews a number of empirical studies which
   suggest that, in many Asian contexts, there is a considerable mismatch
   between the expectations of policy makers and what actually happens in
   schools. The importance is emphasised of taking into consideration
   contextual opportunities and constraints - and above all the existing
   knowledge, beliefs and practices of teachers (Borg, 2006) in order to
   empower them to become creative knowledge-makers in the field
   (Allwright, 2006) rather than consumers of other people's ideas and
   theories.
   This is followed by an explanation of the setting of the innovation, a
   resource-poor university department in a newly independent South East
   Asian nation, and a description of the research team, which comprises
   applied linguists based in New Zealand and indigenous English language
   instructors of potential school teachers of English. One of the aims of
   the innovation is to build a collection of digitalised texts, around
   which to develop and extend a range of computer-mediated language
   learning tasks intended to facilitate classroom teaching and self-access
   learning (Wu \& Witten, 2007). At the same time, the existing
   English-language curriculum is to be re-focussed to bring it into line
   with the Common European Framework for Languages (Council of Europe,
   2001).
   The philosophical framework which informs the project is that of
   Activity Theory (Leont'ev, 1978; Engestrom, 1987). The paper continues
   with an explanation of how this model can be applied within and between
   institutions so that intended organisational change, such as curricular
   reform, can be effectively implemented.
   Although attention will be drawn to some of the emergent outcomes of the
   project, the focus of this paper is the developmental process of this
   ambitious project over the past four years in terms of: establishing
   mutual trust and confidence, contextual awareness, sharing material and
   financial resources, team building, clarifying understandings of the
   division of labour, exchanging leadership roles, and co-construction of
   texts both for pedagogical purposes and professional and academic
   dissemination.}},

   connection to other competences on the Primary Education curriculum
   (information processing, digital competence, linguistic competence,
   social and civic competence, the ability to learn to learn, and personal
   initiative and independence). The research question has been: Does the

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION
   The adoption of new educational paradigm based on the European Space for
   Higher Education requires an adaptation of the teaching methodology and
   evaluation skills to work in undergraduate degrees.
   OBJECTIVES
   The aim of this work was describe and assess the implementation of a
   digital portfolio as an evaluation system in the Massage Therapy course
   in Physiotherapy degree at the Miguel Hernandez University.
   METHODS
   Twenty-five volunteered students (20 women and 5 men; mean age of 20,1
   +/- 2,22 years) participated in this experience. The monitoring of this
   methodology is framed in a learning agreement signed between the teacher
   early in the course.
   The analysis of the work was carried out using an instrument based on
   SEEQ questionnaire (Student `Evaluations of Educational Quality)
   combined with open questions.
   RESULTS
   The overall assessment of the experience was very positive (81.56\%) or
   fairly positive (16,44\%). In all dimensions of the questionnaire has
   been achieved very high scores (4,6 +/- 0,4). The most positive was
   ``able to work along the way and not to decide the weight of evaluation
   in a final exam{''} and ``approve learning.{''} As negative aspects
   include: a low loading speed and connection with the website and the
   overhead of carrying the portfolio to date.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The digital portfolio is a learning assessment system that fits into the
   new European Higher Education Space since it's student-centered,
   promotes and facilitates independent learning skills development.
   The use of portfolio has been very well received and acceptance in
   students who have used it as a teaching strategy, despite it involves
   more effort.
   However, despite its virtues, is not a method without difficulties:
   technical, human resources, work habits, summative evaluation.
   Arguably, this method requires more record of the pupil, increased
   assistance to mentoring, a commitment to the teacher, resulting in
   greater accountability, involvement and workload for both, but also
   greater enthusiasm and motivation}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of digital economy has continued to influence education
   and the mode for delivery of teaching and learning. The advancing
   technologies associated with the Internet have revolutionized teaching
   strategies, student assessment and student-teacher interaction in
   numerous interesting ways. A new learning experience is through distance
   education where the traditional campus is no longer the main means of
   obtaining tertiary qualifications. Distance education programs are
   delivered through technological means that transcends national
   boundaries. Through distance education, learning in universities has
   become more flexible and responsive to the diverse needs of the
   students. Distance education in this paper is defined as a formal and
   institutionalized based education where the learner and instructor are
   separated by both time and distance. The discussion of the impact of
   distance education on universities will include the following topics:
   (a) distance education and student learning, (b) the changing role of
   the academic staff, (c) an illustration of distance education program
   for engineering in Malaysia, and (d) the cultural and structural
   challenges for the organization. The authors conclude by emphasizing the
   importance of the ``student-centered{''} approach in providing quality
   education through distance programs in corporatized universities. If
   distance education is to be effective and innovative for students, the
   management of the university must work collaboratively with the
   academics to consider appropriate technologies that will enhance
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Ngee Ann Secondary School (Singapore) is constantly seeking to explore
   new technology and with the use of innovative pedagogy to engage our
   students in the teaching and learning.
   Having grown up in a global and digital networked landscape, students
   are entering an accelerating world of change in every aspect of life. In
   order for students to thrive in the new eras, educators must frequently
   re-evaluate the goals of education, seek new ways of learning and
   teaching and most importantly, inculcate values and 21st century skills
   among students through various learning platforms.
   The paper describes how Ngee Ann Secondary School harnesses the 3D
   virtual environment - Second Life to complement the inculcation of
   Social Emotional competencies through Project V@LITE 2.01. Anchoring on
   the Ethical mind, one of the minds in Professor Howard Gardner's Five
   Minds for the Future, and harnessing the rich 3D virtual environment,
   Project V@LITE 2.0 aims to inculcate social emotional competencies
   through authentic simulated scenarios based on broad themes covered in
   the school's values and life-skills syllabus which include youth
   empowerment, building individual self-esteem and developing habits of

Abstract = {{Results of PISA 2000, 2003, 2006 and TIMSS have made evident that there
   has been a generalised descent in reading competence. In particular, in
   Spain the average of descent has been especially notorious when students
   are asked to communicate in, with and about mathematics, because they
   are not able to use the knowledge and skills that they have learnt at
   school when they are in front of new results. As a consequence, OCDE
   recommends that reading and the improvement of reading understanding to
   be a major aim for Spanish society, authorities, families, schools and
   mass media. In order to take in consideration this recommendation, the
   Ministry of Education and Culture has introduced in the 2007 new
   curriculum the suggestion of having a specific time of reading and the
   inclusion of ICT in all the levels and subjects of education; and the
   proposal of elaboration and development of studies that go in deep in
   the teaching of the reading understanding, its assessment and the
   incidence of ICT. One proposal of study is LECTMAT (La lecture como
   estrategias para el desarrollo del pensamiento y razonamiento
   matematico) ``Reading a strategy for developing mathematical thinking
   and reasoning{''} with grade 9 Compulsory Secondary Students. It means
   from a systemic point of view assessing in an integrated manner the
   students' skills, attitudes and competences when they are reading from a
   traditional or an innovative perspective, using or not ICT tools. This
   mixture of different didactical methods and aims for reading needs a
   wide theoretical framework. Our proposal is a 3C-didactical component
   that it can be characterized as:
   Skill-driven learning (combines self-paced learning with instructor
   support to develop specific knowledge and skills). In this case the
   skills are reading strategies as: summarising a text, identifying the
   main idea, the structure of the text, anticipating the end, giving
   hypothesis of meaning, interpreting the results, comparing and
   integrating different information, making deductions, valuing the
   content, form, relating the content with own knowledge and experiences.
   Attitude-driven learning (combines various events and delivery media to
   develop specific behaviours). Behaviours that appear because students
   have different affective, cognitive, values and difficulties when
   reading in mathematics classroom.
   Competency-driven learning (combines performance support tools with
   knowledge management resources and mentoring to develop workspace
   competencies). This workspace should let students to develop reading,
   communication in, with and about thinking and reasoning in mathematics
   with the digital competence.
   The integration of all those aspects is done from a ``blended learning
   approach{''} with three different components. A content component that
   makes learning material available to a learner; a communication, that
   offers interpersonal exchange between learners or learners and tutors; a
   constructive, that facilitates and guides individual as well cooperative
   learning activity to actively operate on learning tasks (or assignments)
   with different degrees of complexities.
   In this paper we introduce all the elements that compose this systemic
   theoretical framework and the tools for analysing the development of
   thinking and reasoning mathematical competence when reading.}},

Abstract = {{Brief Description:
   Technology is remaking the world and changing the way human beings
   create, communicate, organize, share information, and learn. As a result
   of this sea change, our education system is at the beginning of a true
   revolution. This session provides a look at the changes beginning to
   emerge and a preview of what we think education can and will be in the
   future.
   Overall Description:
   What would public education look like if we invented it today? Certainly
   it would embrace the many ways in which technology has transformed how
   we all create, communicate, organize, share information, and learn.
   Today, with the power of technology, new integrated offerings and tools
   can unite teacher training and assessment, and online curriculum content
   for educators, parents and administrators to support and enrich today's
   generation of learners.
   In this presentation, Fiona O'Carroll, Executive Vice President for
   Digital Products Research \& Development at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,
   will provide a look at the trends taking shape in our education system
   and a glimpse of what the future of education can look like. Key
   discussion points will include:
   How greater adoption of technology is opening new doors for tools that
   support the evolution of digital education.
   How digital platforms and curricula can provide cognitively rich,
   differentiated teaching and learning resources that boost personalized
   learning and increase student achievement.
   New possibilities for educators to enhance classroom content and
   collaboration, and make curricula available to all students and teachers
   from one central learning hub.
   Integrating digital content as a learning tool across an entire school
   district, for example, teachers and students gain unlimited
   opportunities for focused, efficient instructions that connect and align
   resources to the district benchmarks. A true district-wide
   democratization of education can result.
   Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is a global education leader and has been
   working with educators across the world to embrace the ways in which new
   technologies can change the way people learn and unlock every child's
   potential. The company's Learning Village portal, for example, enhances
   the teaching and learning experience by truly connecting educators to
   best practices, instructional strategies, lesson plans and resources for
   measurable student achievement.

Abstract = {{A phase transition is taking place in the education and training market
   right now. One very old steady state model-the traditional academic
   classroom-based model-is transitioning to the more efficient and
   personalized performance-based e-Learning model required by the
   competitive need of the times. The skills gap is a ubiquitous
   characteristic of life in the future. New knowledge is being generated
   faster than we can learn it. At the same time, new learning technologies
   are being generated, combinations of which can bring about the reality
   of worker empowerment-a concept whose time has come.
   Four integrated components-a network, a database, a computer, and two or
   more learners-jointly create the knowledge solution that reinforces the
   corporate knowledge worker's ability to not only survive, but to win
   more often. This suggests the emerging differences between the first
   wave of e-Learning implementations, that were largely derived from the
   academic model, and the new fusion model that merges digital and human
   assets as a real-time performance support technology.
   By the year 2010 much of the turbulence will be behind us. And also, by
   then it will be clear that the students activities that require a
   classroom do not belong in an online environment, and vice versa. The
   required technologies are already in place. When the white-water
   subsides, the innovation within the invention will emerge. Is it any
   wonder that many Organizations are already beginning to realize that
   effective management of the online learning environment is one of the
   most crucial business decisions of this decade.
   As conclusion it is necessary remark that Innovation technologies is
   pushed new E-learning technologies and that means new challenges in
   teaching in special in Higher Education.

Abstract = {{Within the structure of Griffith University, located in Australia's Gold
   Coast, the Queensland College of Art (QCA) has implemented several
   ongoing and successful Work Integrated Learning (WIL) programs.
   Our primary focus is to develop University/Industry Partnerships that
   benefit the students, the University and the Industry partners in ways
   that traditional student/employer relationships would not.
   Our student focus is designed to prepare our Graphic Design, Digital
   Design, Fine Art, ePhotojournalism and 3D Design students for a ``real
   world{''} environment, whilst still fostering excellence in their
   professional practice.
   The five majors are collectively known as the Bachelor of Digital Media
   and one of the degree's University/Industry programs is an Industry
   Project subject. Students are mentored through a semester of work
   experience in local and international environments, with approximately
   25\% students gaining full- or part-time employment at the end of that
   period each year.
   The film and television industry is one industry in particular where
   ongoing relationships have been developed and student's benefit from
   having world class experience and technology at their fingertips.
   Another opportunity for University/Industry Partnerships is fostered
   through our Community Design program. Major public art and ``real
   world{''} projects are developed in partnership with community leaders
   and industry bodies and students are then able to work in large,
   project-managed groups to develop exciting proposals, many of which get
   industry funding and are taken to market.
   Two recent projects to come out of the Community Design program are
   ``The Wild Animus project{''} and ``Sierra Grand{''}.
   ``The Wild Animus Project{''} involved sound and visual artists from San
   Francisco collaborating with our students to produce three public
   installation spaces to encourage interaction with ancient art and modern
   technology.
   The ``Sierra Grand{''} project combined public art and technology and
   utilized a wide combination of our students skill sets, unique to our
   degree program, such as fine art, 3D visualization, graphic design and
   fabrication.
   A third program undertaken recently by the Gold Coast QCA was the
   development of a creative incubator within the University. ``Liveworm
   Gold Coast{''} was established in 2007 as a professional WIL studio and
   creative incubator. The studio houses between 6-10 students at any one
   time and a variety of ``real world{''} projects are undertaken with a
   support staff and creative director on-hand to facilitate the process.
   Liveworm Gold Coast also serves as a creative incubator for the honors
   level students who develop a proposal over the course of their honors
   year, and are mentored to completion. Often these projects are developed
   to the point where they can be taken to market as design innovations,
   such as the ``Flux Mug{''} by recent graduate Richard Neville, which is
   now for sale in the Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane. The honors year
   itself also supports University/Industry Partnerships between individual
   students and the wider design community. Honors student Jenna Read
   established a partnership with Czech designer Filip Blazek during a
   recent QCA research trip to the Czech Republic, and she is now being
   mentored through a process of bringing Filip's world-class collection of
   Velvet Revolution posters to Australia in the New Year.
   One of Liveworm Gold Coast's most recent projects is the
   ``Kombumerri{''} project. Last year, Griffith University signed a treaty
   with the local indigenous community-the Kombumerri people. This treaty
   is the first of its kind in Australia and Liveworm Gold Coast was
   commissioned to make a sculptural piece to recognize and celebrate this
   treaty. The project, due for completion in early 2010, has developed
   creative partnerships between Kombumerri elders, the students and the
   University over the last year, as well as industry partners, such as
   glass studios, lighting experts, shop fitters and sign writers. The
   resulting installation is a stunning outcome that merges history,
   sculpture, public art and information graphics.
   Through a diverse range of programs, the QCA Gold Coast campus is
   continually providing over 100 Bachelor of Digital Media students every
   year with a rich and varied set of industry experiences. The
   University/Industry Partnerships are always rewarding for the students,
   the University and the community at large, and the industry experience;
   along with folio outcomes far outweigh anything the students could take
   away from a traditional degree.
   Our University has implemented several ongoing and successful Work
   Integrated Learning (WIL) programs. Our primary focus is to develop
   University/Industry Partnerships that benefit the students, the
   University and the Industry partners in ways that traditional
   student/employer relationships would not.

   ePhotojournalism and 3D Design) are collectively known as the Bachelor

   incubator within the University. ``Liveworm Gold Coast{''} was
   established in 2007 as a professional WIL studio and creative incubator.
   The studio houses between 6-10 students at any one time and a variety of
   ``real world{''} projects are undertaken with a support staff and
   creative director on-hand to facilitate the process.
   Liveworm Gold Coast also serves as a creative incubator for the honors
   level students who develop a proposal over the course of their honors
   year, and are mentored to completion. Often these projects are developed
   to the point where they can be taken to market as design innovations,
   such as the ``Flux Mug{''} by recent graduate Richard Neville, which is
   now for sale in the Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane. The honors year
   itself also supports University/Industry Partnerships between individual
   students and the wider design community. Honors student Jenna Read
   established a partnership with Czech designer Filip Blazek during a
   recent research trip to the Czech Republic, and she is now being
   mentored through a process of bringing Filip's world-class collection of
   Velvet Revolution posters to Australia in the New Year.
   One of Liveworm Gold Coast's most recent projects is the
   ``Kombumerri{''} project. Last year, our University signed a treaty with
   the local indigenous community-the Kombumerri people. This treaty is the
   first of its kind in Australia and Liveworm Gold Coast was commissioned
   to make a sculptural piece to recognize and celebrate this treaty. The
   project, due for completion in early 2010, has developed creative
   partnerships between Kombumerri elders, the students and the University
   over the last year, as well as industry partners, such as glass studios,
   lighting experts, shop fitters and sign writers. The resulting
   installation is a stunning outcome that merges history, sculpture,
   public art and information graphics.
   Through a diverse range of programs, our campus is continually providing
   over 100 Bachelor of Digital Media students every year with a rich and
   varied set of industry experiences. The University/Industry Partnerships
   are always rewarding for the students, the University and the community
   at large, and the industry experience; along with folio outcomes far
   outweigh anything the students could take away from a traditional
   degree.}},

Abstract = {{Physiology is a scientific discipline characterized for being
   experimental and instrumental and as such, it demands a direct contact
   with the ``way of doing the things{''}, that reveals ``what{''} and
   ``how{''} of the production of the physiological knowledge. The teaching
   of Physiology, requires methodological tools that should allow the
   students an approximation adapted to the alive animal and to the complex
   system of interactions directed to maintain the homeostasis, when the
   integrity of the animal is kept. The employment of new technologies,
   including digital supports multimedia, present pedagogic innovative
   approaches, since they use a current technology and allow very diverse
   forms of use. This versatility opens wide possibilities of didactic
   experimentation and educational innovation in the laboratory, being a
   useful tool as support and reinforcement that facilitates the practical
   training of the students. In the process of adjustment of our
   laboratories of practical teaching to the new audiovisual technologies,
   it has been made presentations in PowerPoint of the different practices,
   including digitalization of images, as well as schemes and employment of
   hypertext for a major comprehension. Moreover, there has been carried
   out video recording of practices realized in animals in vivo, where
   different commentaries and questions have been inserted on the practice
   to facilitate the understanding and to introduce the student in the
   physiological phenomenon, before it faces the practical assay. So, the
   student gets a global vision of each practice doing special support in
   the details of the procedure of accomplishment (material, methodology,
   instrumental technologies, precautions.). With this work of innovation
   in educational methodologies for practical classes there have been
   generated audiovisual materials that favor and facilitate the active and
   autonomous learning of the student and help to improve the capacity of
   comprehension of the oral messages in the practical education of the
   discipline. In addition, the video recording of the practices in animal
   in vivo they have helped to reduce the negative impact of the animal
   experimentation on the environment, reducing considerably the use of
   alive animals and reagents. These audiovisual materials have served as
   complement for the accomplishment of the practices on the part of the
   pupil and in addition they will be used also by the teacher as one more
   tool at the moment of giving the practical classes.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays we observe as the concept of literacy, traditionally linked to
   the aptitude to read and write, it is acquiring new approaches (digital
   literacy, in information.). Already it is not a question only that the
   students have resources but that they are capable of analyzing them, to
   manage them and to apply them to new situations.
   In this context the school library is constituted as a tool that
   provides information and fundamental ideas to be developed successfully
   in the society which surrounds us.
   In this regard, the Law 2/2006, on May 3, of education (BOE 04/05/06),
   in its article 113, specifies that the centres of education will have a
   school library that will help to foment the reading and that the
   students could accede to the information and other resources for the
   learning of other areas and matters, and that could train their critical
   use.
   In addition, the organization of the school libraries will have to be
   like space opened for the educational community.
   Besides the Decrees 130/2007, on June 28, and 133/2007, on July 5,
   which, respectively, there regulate the educations of Primary Education
   and of Secondary Obligatory Education in the Autonomous Community of
   Galicia, include a series of basic competitions that the students must
   acquire of progressive form. For that, it proposes to all the centre to
   prepare the reading projects of centre, in order to articulate the
   actions of the whole teachers for the achievement of the pedagogic aims
   referred to the acquisition of the linguistic competence and skills in
   the use of the information, as well as to the acquisition and
   consolidation of the reading habit.
   So, the library can be a strategic element in the pedagogic innovation
   that helps to revitalize the educational practices and the cultural life
   of the centres, providing to the teachers and students with
   opportunities for the use of numerous resources that allow the
   achievement of a progressive autonomy in the learning.
   With this work we try to realize a conceptualization of the school
   libraries through a review of the contributions made by different
   authors, as well as an analysis of the different official announcements
   of the Improvement of the libraries Plan, in the autonomous region of
   Galicia in the last years.}},

Abstract = {{The utilization of a telescope with a large single aperture is limited
   by the manufacturing technique, cost, volume and weight of a monolithic
   mirror. In order to solve these problems, the technology of the
   segmented synthetic aperture was introduced. The primary mirror of a
   large segmented synthetic aperture telescope consists of several
   segmented mirrors, whose misalignment errors make the wavefront change
   drastically and influence the MTF of the optical system badly. The
   wavefront coding technology (WFC) is an innovative technology that
   joints the optical design and digital image processing together. By
   adding a phase mask close to the pupil of an optical system and
   modulating the wavefront, the WFC system becomes very insensitive to
   defocus and other aberrations based on defocus. The theoretical analysis
   of characteristics of the WFC system was done in the form of PSF. The
   application of WFC to a segmented three mirror anastigmat (TMA) was
   presented. A space telescope with an effective focal length as 40m, a F
   number as 10, a field of view as 0.5 degrees x0.05 degrees was designed,
   whose primary mirror consisted of seven segmented mirrors. The influence
   of defocus and misalignment errors on the telescope was discussed. The
   imaging process of the WFC system and following image restoration were
   simulated. As a result, sharp images were obtained and the large
   segmented synthetic aperture telescope had looser misalignment tolerance
   and extended depth of focus.}},

   especially of the life-size digital X-ray image of the painting, brought
   new insights into the development of its compositional and iconographic
   resolution, which is considered innovative for its time. Four stages in
   the development of Piombo's composition of Madonna of the Veil were
   identified on the basis of the research data. With respect to the
   results of its detailed analysis that was carried out by the means of
   several research methods, new retouching of the damaged and missing

Abstract = {{This paper summarises research results of BIM (Building Information
   Modeling) application in early architectural design, attempts to
   determine the problems, capture the trends of object-oriented modeling
   and find the relations of BIM with CAAD (Computer Aided Architectural
   Design) education. The aspects of implementation of object-oriented and
   BIM-related modeling methods and relations with existing designing
   praxis are discussed. The evolution and the phases of dominating CAAD
   technology and its emerging with information systems leading to
   intelligence and concept of BIM supporting the whole life cycle of the
   building are analysed. Different object-oriented modeling software
   alternatives are discussed and compared. The IFC (Industry Foundation
   Classes) format enabling the interchange of the BIM information between
   different CAAD software in AEC industry is presented. The results of the
   study - the methods and a set of digital tools developed for solving of
   the problem are presented. An innovative international BIM-based
   architectural competition as a case study that took control over
   important design parameters and interrelations with the CAAD education
   are discussed. Main phases of the process, deliverables, client
   procedures and tools supporting competition entrants and issues of the
   competition are presented. The factors of the case study concerning CAAD
   theory and praxis are analysed. The problems and conflicts during the
   process of competition have been revealed.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of light is an important issue in several scenarios ranging
   from scenic design, light pollution study, illumination engineering, and
   agriculture. It is typically determined by using a portable digital
   light or lux meter. By realizing that the proliferation of cell phones
   is currently tremendous, this paper proposes for the first time a
   low-cost cell phone based digital light meter. Our innovative idea comes
   from the fact that the digital camera built into the cell phone is
   functioned as a two-dimensional light sensitive device and the captured
   image can be made diffuse. In this way, the diffused image is correlated
   to the corresponding light level by the built-in microprocessor of the
   cell phone and our specific algorithm embedded. Our experiment using a
   typical cell phone embedded with a digital camera and our JAVA program
   will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative method to design a high dynamic range ADC is described.
   The ADC was developed to acquire audio samples for community noise
   monitoring and pattern recognition with a sampling frequency of 22kSps
   and a dynamic range of 105dB (35dB(SPL), to 140dB(SPL)). By using low
   resolution ADCs, some analog amplification and filtering stages, and a
   concatenation algorithm, a good performance and cost efficient audio
   sampling module has been built for audio level calculations. In order to
   guarantee the signal readability a logarithmic legibility formula is
   introduced. A series of tests with different frequencies and dynamic
   ranges showed that the module can easily replace the current Sigma-Delta
   ADC boards.}},

Abstract = {{Communication services, architecture, and technologies are rapidly
   evolving in response to application demand and research innovation.
   These changes are motivating a fundamentally new approach to the design
   and provisioning of services, facilities, and infrastructure.
   Traditionally, such resources have been designed and implemented as
   centralized fixed utility services, with almost no options for
   specialization and customization, especially by processes at the network
   edge. Supporting infrastructure has been created and deployed much like
   buildings are constructed, using a set of highly defined plans,
   resulting in hardened structures intended to exist basically unchanged
   for many years. However, this approach leads to severe restrictions on
   the creation, deployment, enhancement, and customization of services.
   Furthermore, this approach does not recognize the inherent potential of
   digital resources for affecting ongoing improvements through rapid
   continual change and for specialization and customization. Consequently,
   a new communication design model is being created, implemented in
   prototype, and placed into production at select sites around the world.
   This new model is based on multiple emerging trends in advanced network
   research. This model supports a much broader range of communication
   services than traditional systems and highly versatile functionality by
   providing a structural programmable framework. This structure
   encapsulates network resources as addressable modules that can be
   discovered, integrated, and customized to create many different types of
   communication services in advance or dynamically, in direct response to
   changing requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To evaluate the learning outcomes of an online, distance
   education course in statistics for doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) students.
   Design. Lectures for the course were produced by the course faculty,
   converted into digital format (mp4), placed within the college's course
   management system, and video streamed to students. The course required
   students to interact with the course content using workbooks and
   simulations and with the instructor via VoIP examination reviews.
   Assessment. A quasi-experimental study involving 4 groups of students
   was conducted. Second-year (P2) students were assigned randomly to 1 of
   3 groups and asked to complete a precourse survey that contained:
   demographic information only (group 1); demographic items plus 10 items
   assessing statistics knowledge (group 2); or demographic items plus 20
   items assessing statistics knowledge (group 3). At the end of the
   course, all students were given the same 20 items on the final
   examination (postcourse survey instrument). A control group consisting
   of randomly selected first-year (P1) students completed the 20-item
   precourse survey instrument. P1 and P2 students' scores on the 20-item
   precourse survey were not significantly different. Students who had
   taken a statistics course before entering the PharmD program scored
   higher on the precourse survey. P2 students in all 3 study groups had
   similar scores on the final examination (postcourse survey) (p = 0.43).
   Conclusions. Students can be taught the basic principles of statistics
   and how to use statistics to read the pharmacy and medical literature
   entirely online. This study has significant implications for how classes
   traditionally taught in the classroom might be taught at a distance
   using innovative instructional technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an all-digital approach to the generation of the
   modulated radio-frequency carrier and its application to a multimode
   transmitter in today's communication systems and draws a possible
   picture of tomorrow's systems. We will first analyze how digital
   transmitters will progressively replace their analog counterparts and
   what are the main issues associated with this trend. The combination of
   Delta Sigma modulation and digital mixing is proposed as an innovative
   approach enabling multimode operation of transmitters with low power
   consumption and chip area, easy configurability, and good performance. A
   90 nm CMOS chip has been designed to demonstrate the feasibility of the
   concept and its potential in multimode transmitter architectures.
   Techniques such as redundant arithmetic and non-exact quantization are
   used in the high-speed Delta Sigma modulator implementation.
   Furthermore, approaches to antenna filtering using BAW filters and
   reconfigurable semi-digital RF FIR filters will be introduced. Finally,
   a review of recent outstanding transmitter designs will allow a
   comparison between the presented approach and architectures based on
   digital-to-RF conversion.}},

   digital development}},
Journal = {{ANTHROPOLOGY SOUTHERN AFRICA}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{19-32}},
Abstract = {{Anthropologists are increasingly interested in the reception and
   adaptation of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) at the
   local level, especially when these are intended or adapted for social
   change in the kinds of societies and communities anthropologists study.
   The process has been increasingly driven by the spread of landline
   telephones, radio, television, personal computers, the Internet (1.0 and
   now 2.0), basic cell phones and now internet-enabled or `3G' cell
   phones. These successive technological innovations, now collectively
   grouped as ICTs, have had the effect of shrinking distance by increasing
   the reach of both those who control these technologies and those who can
   access them. With radio and TV, and even the Internet until recently,
   communication tended to be one-way: from the centre to the periphery
   both between and within countries. This was never the case with landline
   telephones, which offered two-way communication from the outset; but
   landlines rarely extended into the rural areas of developing countries,
   and even where there was access, the poor generally could not afford
   domestic installation. Cellular phones, though even more expensive in
   terms of call charges, operate beyond the reach of landlines, are
   portable and no longer as dependent on frequent charging from mains
   electricity as before. The wireless networks that run them now offer
   access to the Internet almost everywhere - for those who have 3G
   handsets and/or wireless-connected computers - and include such useful
   adaptations to Third World conditions such as `pay as you go' and
   `please call me.' Moreover, the Internet itself has become more
   interactive with its 2.0 technologies. If `development' (as opposed to
   modernisation) is about agency and empowerment for those who currently
   lack it, then there is development potential in the newest ICTs despite
   their control by major multinational corporations. Informatics
   professionals and elements of the `development community' reaching as
   high as the World Bank and the United Nations (Millennium Development
   Goals) regard ICT4D (ICTs for development) as a potential redeemer of
   half a century of mostly failed interventions on behalf of the world's
   poor. But how feasible is ICT4D? How is it being received and what are
   its direct and indirect impacts? This paper is the outcome of four years
   of engagement with an ICT4D research project founded in Dwesa-Cwebe on
   the Wild Coast of the Eastern Cape in South Africa. It assesses not only
   the potential and snags of ICT as a development tool, but also, via a
   baseline research project completed in 2008, provides a sense of the
   setting, the needs of the community and the potential of the `Living
   Lab' approach to ICT4D.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient computer support of product innovation processes has become an
   important issue of industrial competitiveness in the last forty years As
   a consequence, there has been a growing demand for new computer-based
   tools and system Various hardware, software and knowledge technologies
   have been used over the years as the basis of design support systems
   With the appearance of network technologies, the conventional standalone
   workstation paradigm has been replaced by the paradigm of
   web-interconnected collaborative environments Currently, the emerging
   and rapidly proliferating mobile and ubiquitous computing technologies
   create a technological push again These technologies force, us to
   reconsider not only the digital information processing devices and their
   interconnection, but also the way of obtaining, processing and
   communicating product design information Many researches and
   laboratories are engaged with the development of novel concepts,
   architectures, tools and methods for next-generation design support
   environments 1 hey will integrate many resources of the current
   collaborative design environments with pervasive computing functionality
   and large-scale mobility in a volatile manner Part of the design support
   tools will have fixed location, but will be remotely accessible through
   wireless networks Other part of the tools will be moving with the
   designers as portable, embedded, wearable and transferable devices, and
   will feature ad hoc connectivity These not only offer new ways for
   aggregation, processing and presentation of design information, but also
   enable alternative ways of completing design activities Our current
   research concentrates on three interrelated main issues (i) studying
   workflow scenarios for future design support environment, (ii)
   investigation and integration of multiple technologies into an ad hoc
   interconnected heterogeneous infrastructure, and (in) exploring
   efficient methods for utilizing new affordances in supporting product
   innovation In this paper we report on the results of our recent
   technology study that analyzed the current results and trends of
   ubiquitous technology development, and tried to form a vision about the
   possible manifestation of future ubiquitous design support environments
   Essentially, they have been conceptualized as ad hoc and volatile
   networks of fixed and mobile information collection, processing and
   communication units This network functions as a complex service provider
   system, with special attention to the on-demand information management
   in the fuzzy front end of design projects}},

Abstract = {{In this increasingly convergent and digital world, young people are
   reportedly using new media with high engagement outside school, yet
   disengaged in those schools where technology access is low or
   restricted. Such an apparent disconnection is magnified when predictions
   of their futures are tied to requisites including technological
   expertise, adaptability to change, innovative capacities and complex
   problem-solving abilities. Such future oriented capacities challenge
   traditional views that basic literate and numerate proficiency is
   sufficient for academic success. They also raise questions about the
   sufficiency of digital engagement for developing higher order critical
   and creative skills. Collectively, these future oriented capacities
   heighten educational imperatives for improving the quality of young
   people's learning outcomes in this rapidly changing online world. This
   article addresses these issues. It draws on diverse literature sources
   and an Australian research study (2003-2008) into secondary students'
   curricular digital literacies (Appendix A) to present conceptual
   advances in understandings about how to recognise, talk about and value
   signs of quality learning in student-created multimodal products.
   Finally, the article offers an assessment framework with potential for
   assisting students and teachers to access core concepts and mobilise
   those essential capacities for enhancing performance when using and
   creating knowledge online.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cells play an important role in veterinary medicine in different
   ways. Currently several stem cell therapies for animal patients are
   being developed and some, like the treatment of equine tendinopathies
   with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have already successfully entered
   the market. Moreover, animal models are widely used to study the
   properties and potential of stem cells for possible future applications
   in human medicine. Therefore, in the young and emerging field of stem
   cell research, human and veterinary medicine are intrinsically tied to
   one another. Many of the pioneering innovations in the field of stem
   cell research are achieved by cooperating teams of human and veterinary
   medical scientists.
   Embryonic stem (ES) cell research, for instance, is mainly performed in
   animals. Key feature of ES cells is their potential to contribute to any
   tissue type of the body (Reed and Johnson, J Cell Physiol 215:329-336,
   2008). ES cells are capable of self-renewal and thus have the inherent
   potential for exceptionally prolonged culture (up to 1-2 years). So far,
   ES cells have been recovered and maintained from non-human primate,
   mouse (Fortier, Vet Surg 34:415-423, 2005) and horse blastocysts (Guest
   and Allen, Stem Cells Dev 16:789-796, 2007). In addition, bovine ES
   cells have been grown in primary culture and there are several reports
   of ES cells derived from mink, rat, rabbit, chicken and pigs (Fortier,
   Vet Surg 34:415-423, 2005). However, clinical applications of ES cells
   are not possible yet, due to their in vivo teratogenic degeneration. The
   potential to form a teratoma consisting of tissues from all three germ
   lines even serves as a definitive in vivo test for ES cells.
   Stem cells obtained from any postnatal organism are defined as adult
   stem cells. Adult haematopoietic and MSCs, which can easily be recovered
   from extra embryonic or adult tissues, possess a more limited plasticity
   than their embryonic counterparts (Reed and Johnson, J Cell Physiol
   215:329-336, 2008). It is believed that these stem cells serve as cell
   source to maintain tissue and organ mass during normal cell turnover in
   adult individuals. Therefore, the focus of attention in veterinary
   science is currently drawn to adult stem cells and their potential in
   regenerative medicine. Also experience gained from the treatment of
   animal patients provides valuable information for human medicine and
   serves as precursor to future stem cell use in human medicine.
   Compared to human medicine, haematopoietic stem cells only play a minor
   role in veterinary medicine because medical conditions requiring
   myeloablative chemotherapy followed by haematopoietic stem cell induced
   recovery of the immune system are relatively rare and usually not being
   treated for monetary as well as animal welfare reasons.
   In contrast, regenerative medicine utilising MSCs for the treatment of
   acute injuries as well as chronic disorders is gradually turning into
   clinical routine. Therefore, MSCs from either extra embryonic or adult
   tissues are in the focus of attention in veterinary medicine and
   research. Hence the purpose of this chapter is to offer an overview on
   basic science and clinical application of MSCs in veterinary medicine.}},

Title = {{The taper of cast post preparation measured using innovative image
   processing technique}},
Journal = {{BMC ORAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Background: No documentation in the literature about taper of cast
   posts. This study was conducted to measure the degree of cast posts
   taper, and to evaluate its suitability based on the anatomy aspects of
   the common candidate teeth for post reconstruction.
   Methods: Working casts for cast posts, prepared using Gates Glidden
   drills, were collected. Impressions of post spaces were made using
   polyvinyl siloxan putty/wash technique. Digital camera with a 10' high
   quality lens was used for capturing two digital images for each
   impression; one in the Facio-Lingual (FL) and the other in the
   Mesio-Distal (MD) directions. Automated image processing program was
   developed to measure the degree of canal taper. Data were analyzed using
   Statistical Package for Social Sciences software and One way Analysis of
   Variance.
   Results: Eighty four dies for cast posts were collected: 16 for each
   maxillary anterior teeth subgroup, and 18 for each maxillary and
   mandibular premolar subgroup. Mean of total taper for all preparations
   was 10.7 degree. There were no statistical differences among the total
   taper of all groups (P = .256) or between the MD and FL taper for each
   subgroup. Mean FL taper for the maxillary first premolars was lower
   significantly (P = .003) than the maxillary FL taper of the second
   premolars. FL taper was higher than the MD taper in all teeth except the
   maxillary first premolars.
   Conclusions: Taper produced did not reflect the differences among the
   anatomy of teeth. While this technique deemed satisfactory in the
   maxillary anterior teeth, the same could not be said for the maxillary
   first premolars. Careful attention to the root anatomy is mandatory.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a research framework which focuses on developing
   innovative technologies in the area of Smart Management for Sustainable
   Human Environment through the SmartEN Marie Curie ITN Network. Until
   now, research was mainly focused on the development of proactive
   risk-based approaches for civil infrastructure reliability and
   management with benefits in improved performance, safety and cost.
   Recently, a new generation of miniature wireless sensor platforms which
   utilize novel digital signal processing has emerged which can be
   exploited to reduce significantly uncertainties associated with the
   various predictive models directly affecting the quality of the decision
   making. These developments open up a completely novel area of
   multidisciplinary research towards the `smart' management for a
   sustainable environment. SmartEN aims to push innovation in this area
   through the development of an ITN network focusing on the development
   and effective integration of emerging technologies targeting key
   application areas of current interest to Europe and internationally.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of CAS systems into school practices of algebra is
   marginal. To integrate effectively digital technology in the teaching
   and learning of algebra, it is necessary to go beyond the experience of
   CAS and of their instrumented techniques and to face the design of new
   artefacts. In this paper we discuss design problems faced in the
   development of a new digital artefact for teaching and learning of
   algebra, the Alnuset system. We present the key ideas that have oriented
   its design and the choices we have worked out to instrument its
   incorporated algebraic techniques. We compare the quantitative, symbolic
   and functional instrumented techniques of Alnuset with those of CAS
   highlighting crucial differences in the teaching and learning of
   algebra.}},

Abstract = {{Much has been written about the way in which e-Learning has changed
   learning in higher education without transforming it to meet the needs
   and expectations of Homo Zappiens (Homo Zappiens: Growing Up in a
   Digital Age. London: Network Continuum Education, 2006). The beliefs and
   practices of teachers in the sector have remained largely unchanged
   despite the widespread adoption of e-Learning. This study identifies key
   differences in the beliefs and practices of practitioners, reflecting
   levels of engagement with e-Learning. It shows how many e-Learning
   initiatives have led to the internalization of such change, with the
   adoption of exemplars and best practice. It considers why the examples
   of externalization (where exemplars are adapted to context and the
   modifications passed to others) are much more limited. Using activity
   theory, the barriers to such change are explained and lessons for future
   approaches to professional development derived. The nature of the
   transformation needed is explored in order to make the switch in higher
   education learning and teaching from analog to digital. Through an
   exploration of the nature of e-Learning innovation, it considers the
   learning communities that should be at the heart of such transformation.
   It should, therefore, be of value to practitioners wishing to innovate
   and those who design and deliver the professional development programs
   to support them.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Chinese state has allowed US-based transnational
   corporations to play an instrumental role in China's information
   technology (IT)-led development strategy, a dominant segment of Chinese
   political and technological leadership has always been wary of the
   negative political, economic and cultural implications of continued
   American domination in digital technological developments. Chinese
   efforts at asserting greater control over a rapidly evolving networked
   communication infrastructure have been multifaceted. Significantly, the
   past few years have seen an escalation of domestic discourses on
   ``network sovereignty{''} and ``indigenous innovations{''} or the
   mastery of core technologies at the industrial development strategy and
   technological policy levels. An elite consensus has crystallized around
   the mobilization of national resources to catch up with the United
   States in hardware and software IT developments, particularly to achieve
   potential leadership in next-generation network technologies. However,
   China's quest for technological leadership in the network age continues
   to be constrained by a range of domestic political economic forces on
   one hand, and mediated by the paradoxical dynamics of interstate
   cooperation and rivalry in the political economy of global communication
   on the other. The growing transnational nature of the capitalist
   accumulation process, of which China's deepened global integration
   through its rapidly expanding and increasingly market-driven information
   industry has been a critical component, has further complicated these
   endeavors.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an important next step in the trend toward
   inexpensive and universal access to information and sophisticated
   computing resources that help close the digital divide between the
   computer haves and have-nots. In cloud computing, the end-users can
   access fully functional software and services online at little or no
   cost using inexpensive computers or mobile communication devices that
   connect them via the Internet. Innovative service providers no longer
   need to own and maintain development or production infrastructures and
   can automatically scale their production operations to meet growing
   demand much more easily and economically than possible with internal
   data centers, traditional hosting, or managed services arrangements. The
   cloud's inherent ability to dynamically scale up or scale down the
   infrastructure commitment as demand changes on a pay-as-you-go basis has
   a positive impact on the service provider's overhead costs, energy
   costs, and in reducing its carbon footprint.
   Cloud economics as presented in this chapter refers to the economic
   forces, business drivers, and structural issues affecting the broad
   costs and benefits of adopting the cloud technologies or the creation of
   private or public utility clouds. Here, cloud economics also deal with
   the economy inside the cloud, which includes monetization, charging,
   billing, and taxation of products and services inside the cloud.}},

Abstract = {{Still photography has a rich history of technological innovations to
   record the light in a scene dating back to the early 19th century (at
   least). The recent decades have seen these technological innovations
   create a revolutionary shift in the materials, processes, and uses of
   still images. Most of the still photography world has completed a move
   from silver halide (AgX) technology that dominated the field for over a
   century to digital still cameras based on silicon (Si) sensors that
   arrived on the scene about two decades ago and have essentially
   supplanted AgX capture technologies in most applications. This research
   ponders the question of whether the image quality obtained with Si has
   also surpassed that of AgX in the context of typical consumer and
   professional photographic prints and soft displays. Four camera systems,
   two digital and two film based, were evaluated using both objective
   image quality metrics and psychophysical evaluation of prints and
   displayed images. The results show that a high-end digital SLR does
   indeed produce better images than an equivalent 35mm film system, but
   that a typical digital point-and-shoot camera has substandard quality
   that can be somewhat attributed to ``too many megapixels{''} and ``too
   much post processing{''} for the lens capabilities and sensor size. The
   conclusion is that indeed film is done, but there remain significant
   areas for improvement in digital systems. In particular improvements in
   printing techniques, lens-sensor matching, and noise reduction are
   called for.}},

Abstract = {{International digital government research has increased in the last 10

   problems for the North American region is scarce. In an effort to lay
   the foundation for new research in the context of North America, this
   chapter presents a comparative analysis of policy and program priorities
   of digital government in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Common
   themes in the agendas of the three countries include services to the
   citizen, improved government operations, transparency, connectivity, and
   economic development. Main differences can be explained on the basis of
   differences in development. In general, we could say that the US
   government is renewing its e-government agenda, as a component of a
   wider innovation system. The government of Canada is also in a
   refreshing process, but more directed to consolidate a digital
   architecture for government services and operations, and Mexico is in
   the process of consolidating a digital government program.}},

Abstract = {{Information-driven collective intelligences derive from the connection
   and the interaction of multiple, distributed, independent agents that
   produce and process information, and eventually turn it into knowledge,
   meant in the broad sense of capability of conceptual representation. For
   instance, the Worldwide Web can be viewed as an information-driven
   collective intelligence emerging from the digital network known as the
   Internet. The point here is how to extend such a capability for
   knowledge generation from the participating agents to the collective
   intelligence itself.
   In this paper we show how this can be obtained with graph-based
   algorithms for the detection of communities of agents so as to support a
   dynamic, self-organized form of concept-discovery and
   concept-incarnation. In particular, we show how to strengthen community
   ties around concepts in order to increase their level of socialization
   and, consequently, of ``fertility{''} in the generation of new concepts.
   Since there exists a direct relationship between concept discovery and
   innovation in human intelligences, we point out how analogous innovation
   capabilities can now be supported within information-driven collective
   intelligences, with direct applications to product innovation.}},

Title = {{An update of ADELEX: developing the lexical competence of Spanish
   university students through ICT in the ESHE}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-85}},
Abstract = {{The educational experience related over the following pages is the
   result of several research projects undertaken after an evaluation of
   the vocabulary size of final year English philology students at the
   University of Granada (Spain), who were found to have a significant
   deficiency in their lexical competence. In view of the results obtained,
   which, amongst other things, demonstrated a clear cut lexical shortfall
   for future teachers of English, a group of lecturers from the same
   department formed the research group ADELEX and designed a semi-virtual
   course to redress this perceived deficit. The initiative was to become
   one of the first subjects to be sanctioned under the auspices of the
   Centre for Virtual Learning at the University of Granada (CEVUG). Later
   on, this online learning experience joined the Andalusian Virtual Campus
   (Campus Andaluz Virtual) and the new ADELEX was transformed into a fully
   virtual course, which obviously gave the project a wider scope. In its
   present incarnation, this updated version of ADELEX has a twofold
   purpose. On the one hand, its aim is to research into the nature of
   lexis (i.e. lexicology, semantics, pedagogical lexicography, phraseology
   etc.) as well as to focus on state-of-the-art digital methodology to
   solve real and meaningful problems that promote linguistic interaction
   in addition to autonomous and cooperative learning. On the other hand,
   it seeks to question Spanish university education on three fronts: (i)
   the integration and pedagogical use of new technologies in university
   pedagogy; (ii) European convergence and the implementation of the ECTS
   (European Credit Transfer System); and (iii) educational innovation
   aimed at bridging the gap between the university and the reality
   confronting students both in social and vocational contexts. Finally,
   this learning experience has been awarded the European Label for
   Pedagogic Innovation by the European Commission and the Spanish Ministry
   of Education, and is funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation
   within the National Research Programme.}},

   the mobile and ubiquitous teaming approach, which situates students in
   an environment that combines real-world and digital-world learning
   resources. Although such an approach seems to be innovative and
   interesting, several problems have been revealed when applying it to
   practical learning activities. One major problem is owing to the lack of
   proper learning strategies or tools that can guide or assist the
   students to learn in such a complex learning scenario. Students might
   feel excited or interested when using the mobile devices to learn in the
   real world; however, their learning achievements could be disappointing.
   To cope with this problem, in this study, a knowledge engineering
   approach is proposed to develop Mindtools for such innovative learning
   scenarios. Experimental results from a natural science course of an
   elementary school show that this innovative approach not only enhances
   learning motivation, but also improves the learning achievements of the
   students. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses modes of documentation and archiving of live
   performance. It also constitutes a documentation of the practical and
   theoretical concerns encountered while documenting Blast Theory's Mixed
   Reality Performance Rider Spoke (2007) over a period of three years
   (2007-2010) through two different technologies developed by the Mixed
   Reality Laboratory at the University of Nottingham: the Digital Replay
   System (DRS), and a CloudPad. Conducted by an interdisciplinary team
   with expertise in Performance Studies, Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
   and Information Management, this documentation comprises: a reflection
   on the imperative to archive which underpins significant aspects of the
   digital economy; an analysis of Blast Theory's work Rider Spoke; a
   discussion of a prototype archive developed using the DRS as part of the
   EPSRC-funded Creator project; a `bespoke' documentation of Rider Spoke,
   including a description of how the team from the Mixed Reality
   Laboratory, the Centre for Intermedia at the University of Exeter and
   the Ludwig Boltzman Institute Media.Art.Research used off-the-shelf
   technologies innovatively to capture the participant experience when the
   work was shown at the ars electronica festival in Linz (2009); and a
   contextual analysis of our methodology and the first presentation of an
   original archiving tool, the CloudPad, developed by the RCUK-funded
   Horizon research project specifically for the documentation and
   annotation of Mixed Reality Performance.}},

Abstract = {{When ``going digital{''} in the field of education one possible option
   typically adopted in higher and adult education is, so to speak, to
   ``enhance the real world{''} through technology. Course materials are
   provided in digital format, face-to-face interaction is replaced by
   forums or social spaces, exercises and activities are remotely performed
   and scored, etc. Another option is to create ``innovative learning
   experiences{''}, that without technology would not be possible nor
   conceivable. Innovative learning experiences are more difficult to
   conceive, and also riskier to introduce in an established learning
   environment: they are also more difficult to explain and to evaluate.
   Innovative learning experiences, however, have also a great potential:
   they can generate ``excitement{''} (something new!) and non-traditional
   educational benefits (still alongside with the `traditional' ones), like
   increased media literacy, professional skills and attitudes and more. In
   this paper, we will present two real-life innovative learning
   experiences for schools: collaborative 3D environments (for high school
   students) and digital storytelling (for pupils of all school grades,
   including kindergarten). We will discuss how they were designed and
   deployed (involving more than 20,000 students, from 3 continents) and
   what educational benefits they brought about.}},

Abstract = {{International cooperation and knowledge transfer among countries has
   become increasingly important in the last decades, giving opportunity to
   a set of multiple interaction programs particularly amongst developed
   and developing regions. This paper discusses the feasibility of the
   adoption of Digital Ecosystems (DEs) in the Latin American context,
   based on the experience of deployment of DEs in the European Union.
   Different deployment experiences in the European context revealed the
   need of a methodology for planning and implementing DEs that resulted in
   a set of tools for measuring the maturity grade of localities related to
   the deployment of DEs and the need of an impact index for understanding
   its long-term implications of the dynamics of their implementation. This
   paper proposes a new methodological framework that integrates concepts
   related to ICT adoption, connectivity and absorption capacities and
   recognises the strong influence of social capital over these. The paper
   concludes with the description of a methodological tool oriented towards
   the mapping, evaluation and modification of scenarios related to ICT
   adoption process among multiple agents.}},

   using geographic-based technologies. The ScotlandsPlaces website has
   seen the development of innovative technologies including the
   redevelopment of open-source geo-middleware, the ScotlandsPlaces XML
   schema for data transfer and the use of dynamic map interfaces for user
   querying. Although these technologies that sit behind the site are
   innovative and cutting edge, the website itself has a simple design and
   is easy to use. System developments such as the digital volumes

Abstract = {{In the music field, an open issue is represented by the creation of
   innovative tools for acquisition, preservation and sharing of
   information. The strong difficulties in preserving the original
   carriers, together dedicated equipments able to read any (often
   obsolete) format, encouraged the analog/digital (A/D) transfer of audio
   contents in order to make them available in digital libraries.
   Unfortunately, the A/D transfer is often an invasive process.
   This work proposes an innovative and not-invasive approach to audio
   extraction from complex source material, such as shellac phonographic
   discs: PoG (Photos Of Ghosts) is a new system, able to reconstruct the

Abstract = {{Two new full field digital mammography (FFDM) equipments are compared,
   Fujifilm Amulet and Siemens Mammomat Inspiration. The systems are
   identical apart from the detector. Both use a-Se for photon conversion,
   but differ in detector readout technology: innovative photoconductive
   switching readout in the first system (pixel pitch 50 mu m) and
   conventional a-Si TFT-matrix readout in the second (pixel pitch 85 mu
   m). Comparison of the physical characteristics in terms of MTF, NNPS and
   DQE gives similar results for peak-DQE (both > 70\% for Mo/Mo
   anode/target combination at 120 mu Gy detector entrance kerma(air)), but
   a slower DQE decline at higher frequencies in the first system. Image
   quality assessment was based on contrast to noise (CNR) measurement and
   automated contrast detail (CD) curve analysis (phantom CDMAM ver. 3.4
   and CDMAM Analyser ver. 1.1, both Artinis). It revealed a superior
   performance of the new detector equivalent to an average glandular dose
   (AGD) reduction comprised between 8\% and 28\% at equal image quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes several innovative PDF document enhancements and
   tools that can be used when building a digital library. The main result
   presented in this paper is the PDF re-compression tool, developed using
   the jbig2enc encoder called pdfJbIm. This re-compression tool enables
   the size of the original bitonal PDFs to be, on average, downsized by
   one third. Some modifications to the jbig2enc encoder that increase the
   compression ratio even further are also described here. Together with
   another program, the pdfsizeopt.py by Peter Szabo, we have managed to
   decrease PDF storage size to such an extent that the transmission needs
   of a digital library were significantly reduced. We report the storage
   saving results that we have achieved on The Czech Digital Mathematics
   Library DML-CZ-we have downsized the PDF corpus to 43\% of its original
   size. We also describe pdfsign tool for batch digital signature stamping
   of PDF documents.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes several innovative document transformations and
   tools that have been developed in the process of building the Digital
   Mathematical Library DML-CZ http://dml.cz. The main result presented in
   this paper is our PDF re-compression tool, developed using a jbig2enc
   library. Together with other programs, especially pdfsizeopt.py by Peter
   Szabo, we have managed to decrease PDF storage size and transmission
   needs by 62\%: using both programs we reduced the size of the original
   PDFs to 38\%.
   This paper briefly describes other approaches and tools developed while
   creating the digital library. The batch digital signature stamper, the
   document similarity metrics which uses four different methods, a
   {[}meta]data validation process and some math OCR tools represent some
   of the main byproducts of this project. These ways of document
   engineering, together with Google Scholar indexing optimization, have
   led to the success of serving digitized and born-digital scientific math
   documents to the public in DML-CZ, and will be employed also in the
   project of The European Digital Mathematics Library, EuDML.}},

Title = {{The effectiveness of an innovative intervention aimed at reducing binge

Abstract = {{Aims: To assess the effectiveness of a digital-story intervention (short
   videos made by young people) seeking to reduce the prevalence of young
   people's binge drinking in Caerphilly.
   Method: A quasi-experimental design was adopted with three intervention
   sites and one control site providing the sample (mainly aged 14-15
   years). Three rounds of self-completion questionnaires, completed prior
   (T1), immediately after (T2) and 6 months after the intervention (T3).
   Findings: A total of 1031 questionnaires completed across the three
   time-points. Two-factor ANOVAs revealed a positive effect on knowledge
   for the intervention sample. The intervention group results showed
   stable attitudes towards drinking at the three time-points whilst the
   control group showed increasing positive attitudes towards drunkenness
   over the same time period. Intentions towards drunkenness were higher in
   the control group than the intervention group at T2 (Control - T1 Mean =
   3.37, T2 Mean = 3.90; intervention - T1 Mean = 3.26, T2 Mean = 3.29).
   Intervention participants got drunk on fewer occasions in the last week
   (mean occasions last week = 1.57) compared to control participants (mean
   occasions last week = 2.00), with the difference approaching statistical
   significance (F = 1.90, p = 0.07).
   Conclusions: Promoting negative attitudes towards drunkenness, alongside
   a greater sense of control and potential regret about drunkenness are
   likely to be important factors when considering how to change people's
   intentions to drink. The study shows the potential to reduce the
   frequency of drinking behaviour when intentions are changed, and
   provides recommendations for future interventions of this nature.}},

Abstract = {{Along with the rapid development of information communications and the
   internet technology, mankind has entered the internet era. As for civil
   society, network media means the new carriers and new channels of
   citizen participation; it also means a new kind of democratic manner.
   While for governments, such network media means innovation of their
   governance model. However, the communication between e-government and
   civil society in network era is faced with a formidable array of
   challenges, mainly as follows: First, the network advocates liberalism,
   while it denies any authority beyond the constraints of time, with
   anonymity and virtual characteristics. Under current circumstance, in
   which the network legislation is comparatively lagging behind and
   on-line identity authentication technology is inadequate and imperfect,
   it can easily lead to the spread of the disorder in citizen network
   participation. Second, the e-government may conduct covert network
   political control over civil society through the ``information
   bombardment{''}, ``false information{''}, ``information supervision{''}
   and other ways; the powers of the internet era are clearly shifted to
   the hands of technocrats, thus this may lead to the so-called
   ``technocrats serving the citizens{''} so that the substantive democracy
   of civil society might be impaired. Third, blind repeated construction
   of the government web-site, enforcement of ``Government Online
   Project{''}, and imperfect public information infrastructure, all set up
   many obstacles for the communication. Fourth, the ``digital divide{''}
   has led to the fact that political communication cannot represent the
   interests of the public; the governments can hardly make an appropriate
   decision in line with public opinion. Fifth, government sectors, civil
   servants, and citizens are lack of awareness and ability in terms of
   network information. In response to these problems, the government
   should actively build up open government and the legal protection
   system; establish the protection mechanism ensuring network political
   and orderly participation among civil citizen, conduct ``network
   real-name system{''}, protect the lawful rights and interests of citizen
   participation (including the network participation) through the
   establishment of ``Citizen Participation Law{''}; in addition, the
   government should take measures towards the elimination of the ``digital
   divide{''}, foster ``e-citizens{''} and promote the awareness and
   ability of network information among government sectors, civil servants,
   and citizens.}},

   tools for architecture and design education goes beyond mere competence
   and can pursue innovation in what Branko Koleravic (2003) observed,
   ``The digital age has radically reconfigured the relationship between
   conception and production, creating a direct digital link between what
   can be conceived and what can be built through ``file-to-factory{''}
   processes of computer numerically controlled (CNC) fabrication{''}.
   However, there has been very little written about what students are
   actually learning through digital fabrication courses and the relevance
   of the skills required for innovation in the field of digital
   fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{This paper anticipates the use of 3-D data for the environmental
   analysis of cities, aiming to provide useful tools for urban designers.
   The extraction of urban environmental quality (UEQ) indicators from 3-D
   information using innovative tools is presented. We will introduce our
   recent research about the implementation of computational tools for the
   analysis, evaluation and design of the urban space and compare results
   that can be obtained with different data sources. In particular, we are
   going to present the advantages of urban models generated from LiDAR
   data, by showing the case-study analysis of the measurement and
   quantification of urban vegetation indicators. Results show that the
   limitation to solar accessibility on roofs is not relevant for the
   case-study area. Moreover, a set of environmental and morphological
   indicators could inform urban designers for decision making processes
   about the distribution of vegetation inside the urban fabric.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technologies have become ubiquitous in most societies, changing
   the way that communication, collaboration, access to information, and
   knowledge development can occur. The introduction of digital
   technologies into society has been a catalyst for change within
   schooling. Innovative teachers have integrated new technologies to their
   teaching practice developing ideas found to work and setting aside
   experiences that do not, theories are developed debated and altered
   through educator networks. New knowledge about pedagogy is emerging
   which is likely to cause significant change as systems, mental models
   and processes adapt to new ways of thinking about teaching and learning
   in a digitally enhanced society. The interaction between education
   policies, teaching practice, research, and educational theory is
   influencing teaching praxis. This chapter examines the change process
   across complex schooling structures during the start of a digital age.}},

Abstract = {{A context-aware ubiquitous learning environment is an authentic learning
   environment with personalized digital supports. While showing the
   potential of applying such a learning environment, researchers have also
   indicated the challenges of providing adaptive and dynamic support to
   individual students. In this paper, a decision-tree-oriented mechanism
   is developed for that purpose, enabling digital guidance for students to
   observe and classify real-world objects in the learning activities of
   natural science courses. To show the effectiveness of the innovative
   approach, a context-aware ubiquitous learning environment was
   implemented for the ``butterfly and ecology{''} unit of a fourth-grade
   natural science course in Taiwan, and 42 students participated in the
   learning activity. From the surveys and interviews that were conducted
   to understand the functionalities of the system and the learning
   effectiveness for the students, the results show that the system had a
   positive impact on students' learning, especially on the affective
   domain, including participation, motivation, and interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Centered on the ground-breaking ethnography, Dangerous Citizens. The
   Greek Left and the Terror of the State (2009, Fordham University Press,
   and dangerouscitizens.columbia.edu) by Neni Panourgia, this presentation
   examines the rich pedagogical possibilities of digital media in
   experimental ethnography. Panourgia's ethnography exists both in a print
   edition and as an online book that opens out to reader/viewers in ways
   that challenge them to consider new modes of interpretation. As
   Panourgia herself notes, the electronic edition of her book is not
   intended to replace the print edition, but to explore new ways of
   addressing the subject matter not possible in print: ``it allows one to
   open one's cards, so to speak, to show the intellectual and scholarly
   work that goes into conceptualizing, researching, and producing a book.
   It enables the author to share resources, explore connectivities that
   are not immediately apparent, provide a synaesthetic experience of the
   presented ethnography, hear what the sounds of the place are, follow the
   threading of associations that interlocutors make in sight and in
   sound{''}. In its goal of greater transparency and reflexivity with
   regard to the processes and data that led to the author's conclusions,
   this book reflects important priorities of ethnographic writing today.
   As such, it can be an extremely valuable tool for illuminating the
   ethnographic process to students. The myriad images, videos, and texts
   embedded within the electronic version of Panourgia's book are both an
   illustration of the building blocks drawn on by most ethnographers, and
   an exciting introduction to new ways of reading ethnographic texts that
   include re-organizing data and seeking out new causal connections and
   influences not necessarily highlighted in the printed text. At the same
   time, teaching with such a text poses new challenges for educators. How
   is a teacher to create assignments that will assess the new skills
   gained, and allow students to further develop them? While students today
   are used to drawing on multiple media to gain information, to what
   extent are they able to perceive the important differences between the
   different kinds of information presented? Will the open-ended and
   non-linear presentation of much of the material in the online book make
   it harder for students to learn to construct meaningful linear
   narratives of their own? This presentation describes the presenter's
   strategy for employing this text in a Fall 2010 anthropology course
   ({''}Cultures of Contemporary Europe{''}), focusing both on the new
   challenges presented by a digital textbook such as Panourgia's and on
   the innovations in pedagogy and ethnography that Dangerous Citizens will
   present.}},

Abstract = {{Libraries have a long tradition in attempting to satisfy the
   informational needs of both teachers and learners of all educational
   levels, from Primary and Secondary Education (school libraries) to
   Higher Education ( academic and research libraries), mainly by means of
   providing access to the best quality content. In the digital
   environment, these libraries have transferred their services quite
   successfully. However, libraries have realized the Web brings
   opportunities for providing more sophisticated ways of supporting their
   users' activities, turning the digital library into a place where the
   educational community could not only get informed but also learn in a
   more autonomous and social manner. This has led to the development of
   several projects and applications of Web 2.0 services to libraries
   (library 2.0) as well as innovations in information organization and
   visualization as tools for learning. This paper begins by analysing how
   the conceptualization of digital libraries in the educational domain has
   evolved and why we contend the approriateness, in this context, of the
   term ``educational digital libraries{''}. Then, it explores some of the
   most relevant trends in digital library applications for education,
   focusing on the developments within the Library \& Information Science
   (LIS) area. After that, the paper presents the advances of the DOTEINE
   research group on the development of applications for educational
   digital libraries, particularly those projects developed for the School
   Digital Library of the International Centre for Advanced Technologies
   (CITA) of the German Sanchez Ruiperez Foundation (FGSR). To conclude,
   discussion and remarks on future work are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Designing learning spaces that enable effective teaching and engage
   learners requires an understanding of those who are going to learn in
   these spaces. ``Net-generation{''} learners, ``Millennial Students{''},
   ``Generation-Y{''} and ``Digital-natives{''} are terms that have been
   used to describe the 21st century learners which, due to increased
   access to the Internet and computer enabled technologies, have a
   different relationship with technology that affects the way they learn
   best.
   Learning spaces have a significant impact on student learning and
   wellbeing. Well-designed learning spaces support pedagogical practices
   that engage, challenge and equip students with the knowledge, skills and
   attributes they need to prosper in a complex, rapidly changing world.
   Innovative teachers have demonstrated that with the emergence of
   wireless broadband the classroom can now open up to the whole Campus as
   a learning space. These innovations are emerging worldwide with
   demonstrable evidence that learning outcomes are improved when teachers
   and students have choice regarding their learning environment.
   Theories today emphasise how students learn authentically, the power of
   personalised learning models, peer to peer learning, skills developed in
   problem- and inquiry-based learning, and the need for inter-disciplinary
   teaching - all in connection to flexible spaces and digital literacy.
   The gap between existing beliefs and practices and those aspired to will
   need to be bridged.
   As a response to the high levels of digital literacy, when designing
   learning spaces, we should consider the fact that learning will not only
   happen within physical space but also within virtual environments.
   In order to respond to diverse student needs, a combination of
   methodologies and modes of delivery is required resulting in a form of
   `blended learning' where a variety of environments, resources, experts,
   learners, methodologies and tasks are linked through the use of
   technology supporting synchronous and asynchronous learning to occur
   much more flexibly. Blended learning endeavours embody a `best of both
   worlds' approach that incorporates complementary online and face-to-face
   components.
   This paper will present how all the previous factors come together for
   the creation of a learning environment in which these new pedagogical
   practices are supported. It will also focus on how technology has
   enabled the implementation of these new pedagogical practices, in
   particular within innovative learning environments, and how one has
   influenced the other. Finally the paper will argue that physical space
   can and should be seen as a learning technology on its own right.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the relevance of course activities to address adult learner
   needs, the author has developed an online digital repository of
   authentic learning artifacts in his undergraduate online course
   (exploration of western classical music) as the first stage of an action
   research project for which user experience data collection will be
   performed. Authentic learning in this context is based on the author's
   initial curriculum innovation in which traditional assessments (quizzes,
   essay assignments, etc.) of recall of facts and concepts about music
   composers and compositions are augmented by a series of online music
   resources (music scores, audio/video performances) that form the basis
   of discussion and project assignments in which learning is situated in
   the authentic practice domain of music (composition and performance).
   The author describes his theoretical framework based on a review of
   research literature into situated and social learning theories and his
   research into learning style preferences of online learners as the basis
   for supporting online learners with online presentation of relevant
   audio and video materials. This framework is followed by an account of
   the rationale and techniques that were used to search and select audio
   and video material from online data repositories that conform to
   established conventions for public domain, licensed, and fair use of
   intellectual property. A description follows of how these research
   findings have guided the instructional design of learning activities and
   associated forms of (self, peer, and instructor) assessment. The author
   describes the initial implementation and informal evaluation of this
   innovation during the first course section. The paper concludes with a
   proposal for subsequent user experience evaluation that is deemed
   appropriate to the early adoption stage of this e-learning innovation.}},

Abstract = {{The current education and training needs of adults and older are the
   product of current and future development of the knowledge society, in
   which a growing renewal of skills, especially digital, requires a
   greater capacity learning.
   In this regard, Senior Citizens use information technology to a lesser
   degree than the rest of the population, which is causing to be lagging
   behind the so-called ``Information Society.{''} In this way education
   becomes the determining factor that will allow access or exclusion to
   social activities more meaningful.
   The guidelines from the Second World Assembly on Ageing in the Plan of
   Action on Ageing in Madrid (2002), address the issue of access to
   knowledge, education and training stating that the knowledge society
   requires entrenched social and educational policies to ensure access to
   education and training throughout life and where technological change
   without education can be alienating suitable for the elderly, so we have
   to introduce measures to train and prepare these people access to
   information technologies and communication.
   In this context the universities of Greater become not only a unique
   platform for training for older people - technological literacy of their
   students, but also boosters of innovation projects under the initiatives
   of the European Socrates Grundtvig, where the vast majority of
   international action in setting up matching methods and examples of
   educational innovation, where the concept of learning through research
   and the incorporation of new technologies more specific objectives and
   main, with the cultural and social integration the largest in the
   knowledge society. (Stadelhofer, 2002). This paper aims to describe the
   training content of the subject of computer science, and presents some
   of the opinions of teachers in their teaching and learning process of
   the University Programmes for elderly People, where the difficulty of
   teaching a new technological media joins the difficulty of teaching a
   new technological joins the difficulty of teaching a heterogeneous group
   as that of their elders.}},

Abstract = {{The shortage of new computer scientists is a serious threat to American
   leadership in technological innovation. The US economy is expected to
   add an estimated 1.5 million technology-related jobs in only a few years
   while this country will have only half that many qualified graduates.
   Nationwide, Computer Science undergraduate programs suffer from a
   dropout rate approaching two-thirds of incoming students. While the
   number of women entering the ``STEM{''} fields (Science, Technology,
   Engineering, Mathematics) is growing, their numbers still lag. It is
   imperative to recruit and retain more women into these fields, and
   support them until graduation. How can this be achieved? There are a
   number of approaches to solving this problem: forming relationships with
   high school guidance counselors; decreasing ``geek{''} culture;
   mentoring programs; increasing the visibility of women in the field and
   in the colleges to female students; recruiting women from two-year
   colleges into four-year colleges; making introductory computer science
   courses less intimidating; and preparing different teaching methods that
   make studying computer science as fresh and creative as opposed to
   regimented and stifling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study of a four-year eportfolio initiative at
   the University of Oregon. The eportfolio project began in the Arts and
   Administration Program with 10 students, and now eportfolios are being
   implemented across campus, catalyzing interest in reforming student
   learning and instruction, and the ways that technology is integrated
   across learning and working environments.
   Portfolios have long been used as teaching and learning tools, and in
   professional development in Schools of Education and Fine Arts Colleges.
   With the emergence of new technologies, eportfolios are revolutionizing
   how students across disciplines manage information and learning, and
   prepare for professional careers. Electronic portfolios (eportfolios)
   serve three primary purposes: to promote student-centered learning and
   reflection, professional preparation and resume development, and for
   institutional accountability. The ability to represent work in multiple
   modalities allows students a repository of research, evaluation and
   feedback from teachers, and an opportunity to self-reflect and represent
   how they construct meaning from their academic learning and professional
   experiences.
   With the emergence of web 2.0 tools and a vibrant open source community,
   the eportfolio project is embracing instructional technologies that
   employ lifelong digital communication tools in support of student
   learning and assessment. With a focus on the development of 21st century
   workforce tools - including innovation and creativity, collaboration,
   and communication - faculty and instructional support staff create
   dynamic mediated learning environments that incorporate reflection,
   analysis, and presentation across degree programs, and that transect the
   borders between classroom learning and professional growth.
   The eportfolio project is a member of the Intern/National Coalition on
   Electronic Portfolio Research. The project was included in the Eiffel
   eportfolio conference in Maastricht, the Netherlands in 2007. It is
   supported through a grant from the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.}},

Abstract = {{Within travel and tourism tertiary education, there is a growing
   emphasis on values based education as well as an increasing focus on
   sustainability and corporate social responsibility as embedded and stand
   alone curricula content in undergraduate student courses and programs of
   study.
   Using an action research approach, online modules addressing
   sustainability and corporate social responsibility were developed,
   trialled and implemented as on-going ``living{''} components of an
   undergraduate tourism enterprise management course. The learning
   materials included written text, visuals, audio recordings, links to
   related readings, video and digital media as well as self audit and
   personal calculators/indices related to sustainability and corporate
   social responsibility. A key component in both modules was the
   incorporation of a reflexive journal. Prompts, using questions and
   reflexive points embedded in the modules, initiated journal entries.
   Action research was chosen since it is an effective way to implement,
   monitor and evaluate changes to educational curricula. Paradigmatically,
   action research has an ontology or worldview that is collectively
   constructed, and an epistemology which is embodied, situated and
   hermeneutically framed. In this study, the methodology was qualitatively
   founded. Axiologically, the study was value leaden with a transformation
   intent of improving educational curricula, specifically, values related
   to sustainability and corporate social responsibility.
   The action research participants were the course convenor, tutor, and
   tourism students involved in the tourism enterprise management course.
   Empirical materials included qualitative conversations between convenor
   and tutor, convenor or tutor with students, written learning-teaching
   materials generated by students as well as reflexive journals kept by
   the convenor and tutor. The empirical materials were interpreted using
   constant comparison.
   During the semester, students engaged in the modules in lieu of regular
   face to face learning-teaching interactions. The students indicated that
   the modules were a change from face to face interaction and added
   variety to the course's suite of learning contexts. Such independent
   study experiences increased student reflections and there was a strong
   appreciation of having a teaching-learning engagement, which did not
   have to be supported by academic references but rather with student
   critical reflections.
   While on the surface, it may appear that the two modules provided
   students with stand alone learning opportunities, this was not the case.
   Students were regularly required to engage with module content in
   lectures, tutorials and assessment tasks. Further, student reflections
   on their own learning indicated that they had gained broader
   perspectives and understandings from engagement in the modules and used
   those in other learning components of the course.
   Improvements to the ``living{''} content of the two modules relate to:
   the constant need for maintenance and review for currency; offsetting
   module text density and complexity with regard to English language
   ability of students; clarifying perceptions of repetition; and coaching
   students' effective decision-making when offered diversity and choice in
   media with which to engage.
   Overall, the modules were an innovation to the course's
   learning-teaching engagements and were viewed by the students as
   effective means to reflexively engage with course content.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the requirements of the Treaty of Lisbon, of the different EU
   regulations and communications to achieve the main human and economic
   progress area in the world, it is necessary to make changes in the
   formative process of its main figures. In this sense, the European
   Higher Education Area is an opportunity for the redefinition of
   structures, teaching methods and roles of all of those implicated in
   Higher Education processes. The use of digital platforms in the ordinary
   Higher Education formative processes makes us wonder about the quality
   of the formative proposals we offer to our students.
   This work deals with the study of the usefulness of ICT tools to develop
   innovative methodologies for ``Materiales de Construccion{''} and
   ``Historia de la Construccion ``subjects at Escuela Universitaria de
   Arquitectura Tecnica de la Universidad de Sevilla; accordingly, it
   implies a transformation process of responsible lecturers in matters

Abstract = {{In order to give an incentive to innovation and improvement of teaching
   practice, the University Carlos III of Madrid, activated the
   ``Innovation Teaching Program's support{''} program in 2002. This
   program has been shown as an excellent experimental frame in which teams
   of lecturers have innovated on several issues: methodology, assessment
   systems, new skills, e-learning, etc. For some lecturers with
   responsibility in basic-core subjects such as Mathematics it has been a
   big challenge because they have had to jump the inertia associated to
   classical methodologies.
   We present the results achieved through three consecutive Innovation
   Teaching Projects that have been applied to a second course of Calculus
   in undergraduates' studies on Computer Science Engineering. The starting
   point was the analysis of students' academic results on previous years,
   showing: unmotivated students, absenteeism, low level academic grade,
   etc. These projects have deeply modified important parts of mathematical
   teaching, such as: methodology, assessment system and coordination
   between lecturers of Calculus courses. The methodology has been mainly
   changed using new technologies: video projectors, computer laboratories,
   digital presentations, professional mathematical software (Matlab), etc.
   The assessment system has evolved from a single final exam to a
   continuum assessment of students. The coordination has changed the
   classical role of ``one lecturer one course{''} to a team of lecturers
   that are involved in a Calculus course split on several groups of
   students during academic years. Some new kinds of skills were
   integrated, for example, ability to work in groups and improvement of
   oral and writing skills.
   As a main conclusion, we will show that the three innovation teaching
   projects have improved the problematic issues mentioned above. Also,
   some important parts of the projects have been directly incorporated
   during the design of Calculus subjects in the study program Bachelor in
   Informatics Engineering adapted to European Higher Education Area (EHEA)}},

Abstract = {{Digital stories have become one of the most popular methods of virtual
   storytelling with the use of digital images, videos and narration. A
   number of researchers support the use of anticipatory sets at the
   beginning of a lesson to help engage students in the learning process
   (Burmark, 2004; Ormrod, 2004) and as a bridge between existing knowledge
   and new material (Ausbel, 1978). Researchers such as Hibbing and
   Rankin-Erikson (2003) and Boster, Meyer, Toberto and Inge (2002) have
   shown that the use of multimedia in teaching helps students retain new
   information as well as aids in the comprehension of difficult material.
   As a pilot project, a third level Radiographic Pathology Course Module
   was delivered by blended learning with all content delivered online
   through Desire2Learn. A lab component with the Faculty was scheduled for
   face to face tutorial. To augment this module, several digital stories
   were created to enhance online lessons and allow discussion and better
   understanding of the presented concepts. Digital stories were used to
   represent real scenarios demonstrating a particular pathology commonly
   seen in Medical Imaging Departments. Research is currently being
   conducted to collect data for the usefulness of the digital stories, in
   terms of adding value to the student experience.
   The following questions are currently under investigation:
   1. Did the digital stories provide evidence of learning?
   2. What benefits did the digital stories provide to the students?
   3. What obstacles presented for students when accessing the digital
   stories?
   4. Is there opportunity for students to create their own digital story
   in other scenarios?
   The results from this pilot project will determine whether the use of
   digital stories was appropriate for this particular subject. It is
   anticipated that the results will demonstrate the importance of digital
   storytelling when delivering patient centered content in an online or
   blended environment.}},

Abstract = {{The present study analyses the university of Deusto (Spain) students'
   ICT competence together with the uses of ICT in academic activities and
   its impact on students learning. It also analyses students believes and
   perceptions on some aspects of the ethics of technology, such as privacy
   and security, and the uses and value they attach to social networks.
   The research sample includes 520 students belonging to five different
   university degrees. A questionnaire composed of 81 items was designed
   and structured around four categories or variables: student ICT
   identification, use of ICT for academic activities an its impact on
   learning, ICT ethics and attached value and use of social networks by
   students. Data was collected during the second week of May 2009.
   Results show that students knowledge of general tools is not
   generalized, being word processor the tool they know best, followed by
   presentation tools. Important differences among students are shown
   though, there being students who do not know how to use general purpose
   tools at all.
   A significant number of students know and use ALUD virtual platform at
   different courses although there are still some in which it is not used
   at all. Students value virtual platforms positively as communication
   facilitators, but not as opportunities to improve their creative and
   innovative capacity. At this respect, differences among degrees are
   observed, which may inform of different pedagogical uses by teachers. In
   general, platforms do not motivate students. The university library,
   particularly the digital catalogue is an under-used resource by
   students. Students have high expectations about the impact of ICT on
   their learning, overall what has to do with communication activities.
   Students perceive teachers need to improve their ICT competence, and
   invest more time and effort to support students in their use.
   The present study confirms that more than half of the study sample do
   not know neither use Web 2.0 tools. Many students seem to use them just
   because they are available, without knowing why and what for, and a
   deeper reflection on the reasons and effects of their use is missed.
   Ethical concerns are little present in relation to the use of
   technology, at least regarding the issues approached in this study such
   as the selection of one or another technology, privacy and security.
   Finally, data shows the importance of taking part in social networks
   through Internet. Just one out of ten students stands aside of them.
   Such participation generates diverse questions about types of
   information provided by each person, the limits of privacy, honesty of
   what is said, and so on. Students who invest most time on the use of
   social networks show different attitudes than the rest, with more
   concerns but more satisfied at the same time.
   As a conclusion, the present study shows that the process of
   incorporating ICT as a learning tool in the university context is a slow
   and complex process. Although great progress has been made regarding
   infrastructures and hardware aspects, together with the development and
   use of a virtual platform, teacher training is still a challenge to
   face. ICT demands teachers the development of new functions and the use
   of new educational methodologies to promote the development of students'
   competences and autonomy, therefore new teacher training objectives and
   approaches need to be faced to respond to the European Higher Education
   Area demands.}},

Abstract = {{In Degree Programs of Technical Schools, experimental and practical
   training appear as an essential complement of theoretical fundamentals.
   Nowadays, the development of e-learning platforms facilitate enormously
   the possibility to introduce new teaching models which allow the
   combination of traditional on-site laboratory assignments with other
   learning assignments conducted autonomously on-line by students.
   This paper describes a practical session of the subject `Hydraulic
   Engineering' focused on the flow analysis in a gate-valve. In practice,
   the characterization of hydraulic elements requires the measurement of
   qualitative and quantitative variables through a suitable experimental
   procedure. In that sense, one of the most innovative experimental
   approaches relies on Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV). This is a
   nonintrusive technique which allows the determination of the
   instantaneous flow fields with high spatial resolution. Here, a PTV
   approach is used to determine the average and instantaneous speed fields
   in the gate-valve under different flow conditions.
   After the on-site experimental session, the students will have at their
   disposal the results of these sessions through information technology
   applications, in order to use this information as support material of
   theoretical sessions.
   The practical experience described in this paper pursues a new
   contextualization where the student assumes an active role and adapts
   the learning process to its own personal abilities. Here, the
   experimental results are added as a didactic support resource in a
   digital format to the e-learning platform of the university
   (PoliformaT). From this moment on, the student is able to access the
   theoretical fundamentals of the subject as well as experimental results
   and pictures of the sessions described. Finally, the proposed practical
   experience would result of great interest for the students, as it would
   allow them to get in contact with the experimental techniques used in
   some of the research works developed at the University.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION
   Integration into the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) generates a
   number of substantial changes including fit out the planning skills, the
   calculation of student workload in ECTS (European Credit Transfer
   System) and a greater emphasis in student learning with the goal that
   will last through their careers.
   In our case, working with the digital portfolio was created in the midst
   of a series of actions to integrate the aforementioned provisions of the
   EHEA in the teaching of physiotherapy. Ultimately it's intended to give
   more prominence to the student in the learning process. Thus, during the
   2008-2009 academic year were offered to students in 2nd year of the
   degree of Physiotherapy at the University Miguel Hernandez enrolled in
   the General Physiotherapy course, the possibility of evaluating the
   theoretical part of one of the modules (Massage Therapy, 10 hours)
   through a digital portfolio implemented in the Moodle platform rather
   than through a final exam.
   OBJECTIVE
   Show the results of the experience of educational innovation in terms of
   temporary work load for students as well as some commentary on perceived
   satisfaction of the students in the use of this methodology.
   METHODOLOGY
   To estimate the workload, each student prepared a file to record the
   time spent on: meetings, tutorials, assignments and portfolio
   development. In order to draw conclusions about satisfaction were two
   focus groups in those who took the 20 students involved in the
   experience, who completed a questionnaire on perceived quality.
   RESULTS
   The overall assessment of the experience of working with the portfolio
   by students has been very positive (81.56\%) or fairly positive
   (16.44\%). As for the ``most positive{''}, 55\% responded ``that is a
   form of active and dynamic work, a similar percentage,{''} you are
   involved in learning more,{''} ``exercise for understanding, not only to
   learn ``(30 \%), ``work and continuous assessment, rather than all at
   once in one examination (25\%).
   As far as workload is concerned, for the student who made the course
   portfolio has an average of 28.9 +/- freelance work 1.53 hours to
   perform the tasks listed, in respect of 11.1 +/- 3.45 used by other
   colleagues who didn't work with eportfolio (final exam). On the other
   hand, the teacher's workload is also increasing exponentially since this
   methodology requires more dedication and interaction with the student.
   CONCLUSION
   The use of portfolio has been very well received and acceptance in
   students who have used it as a teaching strategy, despite putting
   further effort. The time devoted to the study of the subject is greatly
   increased when making a planning (though partial) of teaching competency
   and is used as an active methodology of the student's portfolio. This
   means more to those involved, students and teachers, especially for the
   latter which makes implementation of this method in very large groups.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional book publishers have greatly contributed to students'
   learning. However, recently, the concept of electronic publishing
   (e-publishing) has emerged and became one of the most popular topics in
   academia and the business world {[}1]. This phenomenon is fuelled by the
   need for innovation, rapid technology development, complexity of
   business environments, and the change in people's mindset and lifestyle
   but its influence on student learning has not been well explored. People
   in general learn differently, with each person having their own
   preferred learning styles {[}2, 3, 4]. Consequently, it is crucial for
   the book publishers to know students' preferred learning styles because
   the learning media that they provide, either in the forms of printed
   books or digital books, might directly influence the students' learning
   performance {[}5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Little work has been done
   explicitly to address whether digital books have a positive effect on
   students and whether e-publishing should be the future of the book
   publishing industry.
   The present study consists of two studies. In study 1, the preferred
   learning styles were explored on a sample of 270 students. In study 2,
   experiments were conducted on 56 students to examine students' learning
   performance from using various media that supported their visual,
   auditory, read/write or kinaesthetic learning style, or a combination of
   these approaches. A test was administered regarding their learning
   performance and this was then compared to their learning styles. As a
   result, it was found that, regardless of a student's preferred learning
   styles, students who use media that support multiple learning styles
   attained almost 25 percent higher average marks than those who use media
   that only support a single learning style. Traditional book publishers
   primarily concentrate on textual books with few using multimedia
   content, typically due to reduce costs {[}12]. However, based on the
   findings, this research suggests that book publishers should adopt
   e-publishing methods by incorporating illustrations, videos, music or
   other applications in a digital book to support people's multiple
   learning styles, promoting higher learning performance.}},

Abstract = {{Campus Andaluz Virtual (CAV) is a pioneer experience of globalization
   and mobility of the university teaching-learning which opts for an
   innovative methodology by integrating telematic resources. It has been
   performed by all the Andalusian Public Universities in the project
   ``Universidad Digital{''}, with the aim of developing a common work
   environment where students can take free configuration subjects. By
   means of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and,
   specifically the e-learning platform ILIAS used at the University of
   Jaen (UJA), the learning of these subjects is completely virtual and
   Internet is used for the theory notes, activities, exercises, tutorials
   and exams.
   From the beginning of CAV in the academic year 2006/2007, the Department
   of Statistics and Operations Research of the UJA has taken part in its
   formative offer with the subject entitled ``Descriptive Statistics{''}.
   In this paper, our learning experience in CAV with the subject
   ``Descriptive Statistics{''} is analyzed by using the results obtained

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the characteristics of a multimedia system for
   self-learning digital signal processing techniques. This system is
   called SIMAT-TDS ({''}SIstema Multimedia para el Autoaprendizaje de
   Tecnicas de Tratamiento Digital de la Senal{''}, in Spanish) and is used
   by students of Telecommunication Engineering in the University of Jaen
   (SPAIN).
   Among the features of this system, we emphasize:
   - Multi-environment: this tool can be used remotely via an Internet
   connection through a Web browser. Also it can be used ``in place{''}
   installing the application on the local hard disk of a PC. It is
   available for download online via Web and through the distribution of
   CD-ROM.
   - Flexible: it allows easily to extend-eliminate-modify the contents
   lodged at this one (electronic books, virtual laboratory, technological
   pills).
   - Adaptable: according to the knowledge level of the user, access to the
   contents is enabled or not.
   SIMAT-TDS facilitates the learning of the students. It offers the
   possibility of learning, independent both from the standpoint of time
   and place, avoiding the saturation for the overlapping with other
   students. It also provide a single meeting point for all students of the
   University of Jaen studying subjects related to Digital Signal
   Processing. This facilitates the exchange of experiences across the
   available tools (forums, surveys) for their participation.
   SIMAT-TDS becomes a powerful tool of autolearning, where the student
   finds sufficient information for the correct follow-up of the
   theoretical contents of the subjects, as well as the accomplishment of
   practices, personalizing them (you can alter the input signals, change
   the parameters of the functional blocks, simulating new systems).
   SIMAT-TDS tries to use the processing power of the computer, increasing
   the didactic diversity, as effective complement of the most conventional
   methodologies.
   It also includes a Virtual Lab that allows to the students to learn
   using the trial and error method. They can repeat the same practice
   without limit. They can be in the laboratory as long as they want, and
   choose the most significant practices to realize them as often as they
   want.
   The development of the system has led to the generation and collection
   of a large amount of multimedia contents. Each subject related with the
   digital signal processing will have electronic books, a library of
   graphical modules for their use in the virtual laboratory and some of
   what we have named ``technological pills{''}. These are short multimedia
   material where, in a very simple form, explains some techniques that are
   covered in the subject.
   Beyond the ``technological pills{''} proper of each subject, will be
   elaborated pills for people unfamiliar with engineering. The main
   recipient of these would be high school students in order to attract
   potential new students, but could also be used as divulgate material for
   general public.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the experience of using both a Wiki and a Blog to
   support seminar provision for a Final Year Bachelor of Arts Degree
   Programme in the School of English at University College Cork, Ireland.
   Using the Blackboard Virtual Learning Environment this innovative
   seminar encouraged students to conduct discussions on the group blog in
   response to literature they reviewed as part of their course work. Their
   assessment measured their contribution to the blogging environment as
   part of their `Attendance and Contribution' mark for the course. A group
   wiki was also implemented on the Blackboard VLE to facilitate and
   encourage collaborative work on their group project, which was an online
   publication of their responses to the digital environment and cyber
   culture.
   The course fostered creativity, imagination, communication and writing
   skills in a group of students who were unfamiliar with a blogging
   environment within the VLE and who did not `blog' per se. The shared
   community space of the blog enabled communication outside class time
   where students' responses to the texts were discussed in a less formal
   way. A list of `Rules for respectful participation' were circulated and
   adhered to. The blog allowed students to express their ability, and lack
   of ability, to engage with elements of the critical material together.
   As facilitator it made it easier for me to get a sense of their
   understanding, and their engagement with the texts when I could see and
   chart their responses online. It allowed the actual one hour per week,
   face - to - face, class time to be more fruitful, as many issues had
   been already encountered on the blog and a clear synthesis was made
   possible. Oftentimes students would not need to ask me a question
   directly as they had already asked their classmates online.
   Students learning peer-to-peer was a critical element in the success of
   the course. The students' response to a question posed online was
   usually - `yes - I thought that too' - or' I agree!'. Students reported
   that they were reassured by the blog, and after some initial hesitation,
   communicated freely with each other. Routinely a class member would
   answer another's question before I looked at the blog, my role became
   one of guidance and advice, as opposed to lecturing in the traditional
   sense. This ensured that real work was accomplished during class time,
   as opposed to checking that work was completed, or that the central
   message of the literature being reviewed was understood.
   The class explored issues of digitality, such as community building, and
   e-publishing. As part of a class project they designed, built and
   published a range of articles about digital media, scholarship and the
   humanities. Class members comprised historians, philosophers and
   musicians. Each picked a subject that reflected their personal
   interests. As they were from a range of subject areas, and many did not
   live locally, a wiki was set up to manage and develop the group project.
   It meant that while separated the group were at all times kept abreast
   of the ongoing work of others. As students of English, it was the first
   time a blog had been part of their course, and their assessment. It
   enabled them to see the direct impact of Web 2.0 on humanities
   practitioners, and successfully encouraged them to view their learning
   and writing in a new, dynamic way.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers a view on a new concept and approaches of making
   e-learning more efficient by shifting from the (text) book paradigm to a
   new digital content structure by integrating learning process management
   elements into the content workflow thus improving the efficiency of the
   e-learning process. This way the resulting content becomes ``active{''}
   (simultaneously conveying knowledge and helpging the
   self-directed/guided learners to better manage themselves) compared to
   the content created by the conventional methods widely used today.
   Elements of an innovative methodology for designing such ``active{''}
   learning content aimed at improving e-learning efficiency are described
   further in the text. This new methodology is targeted to help
   instructional designers to apply technology innovations creating more
   efficient ways of e-learning. It enables instructional designers produce
   ``autonomous{''} courses integrating knowledge and management of the
   process into the learning content thus no ``external{''} learning
   management system (LMS) is required. The ``active{''} content helps the
   learners to follow the shortest pre-designed learning path(s) on the
   knowledge map acquiring the required knowledge thus enhancing efficiency
   and quality of the whole e-learning process. The major advantage of the
   proposed innovative methodology is that the well performed self-guided
   learners get the exact required outcomes (=knowledge) with no waste of
   time (=improved efficiency).}},

Abstract = {{For keeping the competitive strengths and not being outdated, continuous
   learning is necessary. As the saying goes, it's never too old to learn.
   Only by continuous learning, people can follow the growth of knowledge
   and social economy. In this knowledge explosion learning era, how to
   learn fast becomes a goal for learners to go after. E-Learning is an
   integration of digital technology and learning methods; it manages and
   shares the variety of teaching resources. Through today's already
   developed internet environment, people are learning according to their
   own interests without constraints on space-time and other external
   conditions.
   Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (Moodle) is an open
   source coded learning management system (LMS). It can easily construct a
   free, easy to use online learning digital platform. Learning management
   system is a software application. It can be used to construct a digital
   learning platform, support all of the education activities process.
   Because of funding constraints, choices of digital teaching platform for
   current secondary and elementary schools are limited. Thus, free
   software seems to be a better choice for them, and Moodle can just
   satisfy this kind of needs.
   Davis proposed ``Technology Acceptance Model (TAM){''} in 1986 and
   Rogers proposed ``Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DIT){''} in 1962.
   Technology Acceptance Model and Diffusion of Innovations Theory today
   have been widely applied in all areas' studies. And this study plans
   used TAM and DIT to discuss the influences on elementary school
   student's acceptance of Moodle e-learning platform and the process of
   making innovation decisions, and for a further step to investigate how
   it affects student's learning intention. According to this study and the
   results of the questionnaire, some conclusions were suggested as
   follows:
   1. Using attitude of the students toward the ``Moodle{''} influenced
   their learning intension.
   2. Adoption behavior of the students about the ``Moodle{''} influenced
   their learning intension.
   3. The students of different characters are different from using
   attitudes, adoption behavior and learning intension.
   This study results can be used to make suggestions for elementary
   school's IT education and also serve as references for importing,
   developing, or amending Moodle system.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a digital signal processor based simplified
   current controller for shunt active power filter to compensate
   customer-generated current harmonics and reactive power. The compensated
   source current contains the same level of harmonic distortion as present
   in the source voltage with equal I/V ratios at all frequencies. This
   separates the contribution of the customer non-linear load and, thereby,
   forces this load to behave as a linear load at a unity power factor. The
   current-controlled voltage source inverter used in active filter
   configuration is regulated to emulate the combination of load and active
   filters as an equivalent conductance across the source voltage. An
   innovative feature of the proposed controller is to achieve conduction
   emulation without sensing the source voltage. The proposed controller is
   first realized in a MATLAB/Simulink (The MathWorks, Natick,
   Massachusetts, USA) environment under sinusoidal and distorted supply
   voltages condition with varying loads. The simulated results are
   validated experimentally by developing a laboratory prototype using a
   low-cost, fixed-point eZdsp to show the effectiveness of the controller.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the outcomes of a qualitative case study of
   implementing e-government Information Systems within the national
   digital strategy in a governmental organisation, following action
   research. The results show that although e-government is a
   socio-technical process and has to accommodate the views of all
   stakeholders, this is questioned in practice. No matter if e-government
   needs to be a tool for decentralisation and democratisation, this scope
   may be rendered futile due to the fundamental role of the political
   support required to secure future funds for implementation. While
   focusing on the changes in business processes that have to be considered
   by governmental institutions to successfully implement e-government, the
   need for a holistic model, which can embrace the back- and front-
   office, and be linked to the real citizens' needs, arises.}},

Abstract = {{Innovating Government is high on the agenda and has been proven as
   successful by using Web 2.0. This label includes a new wave of web-based
   applications that rely on the concept of the user as a producer. Web 2.0
   provides means to create a better Government. As first point,
   improvements are regarded that are based on providing feedback to
   agencies. Examples include service ratings, law enforcement and budget
   allocations. A next type of improvements concerns citizen participation
   in order to reconnect citizens with politics and policy making as to
   improve responsiveness. For this aim social media are great in
   sustaining all kind of civic society activities. Prominent examples
   include campaigning, petitioning, monitoring and urban planning. Another
   way is agency staff persons using the Web 2.0 for cross-agency
   collaboration. Collaboration at large leads to good practice exchange
   and knowledge management.}},

Title = {{Problem-based learning supported by digital archives Case study of
   Taiwan Libraries' History Digital Library}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{5-28}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper seeks to assess the differences between learning
   performance and the satisfaction of learners who use digital resources
   in the Taiwan Libraries' History Digital Library (organized digital
   resources) and the Google search engine (unorganized digital resources)
   in problem-solving learning for the same subject via the problem-based
   learning (PBL) mode. The paper aims to explore the advantages and
   characteristics of using digital archives to support PBL and to offer
   suggestions that are helpful when using digital archives to support
   e-learning.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted the quasi-experimental
   design method to assign all participants into an experimental group and
   control group to evaluate differences in learning performance and the
   satisfaction of learners who use different digital resources during PBL
   processes. A statistical analysis scheme was employed to evaluate the
   learning performance of learners during PBL supported by different
   digital resources in terms of learning processes, PBL outcomes, and a
   questionnaire.
   Findings - The study obtained the following conclusions: learning
   performance and the satisfaction of learners in the experimental group
   during PBL processes supported by digital archival resources were
   superior to those of control-group learners who were supported by search
   engine resources; compared with search engine resources, the digital
   archival resources provide benefits in the learning phase, such as
   ``action{''} (i.e. doing), in the proposed PBL mode, which has three
   learning phases; and compared with resources accessed through the Google
   search engine, PBL supported by digital archival resources should
   enhance searching performance and thereby increase learner willingness
   to use digital archives during e-learning.
   Practical implications - Using digital archives to support e-learning is
   a new trend in the library sciences field; however, few studies have
   developed useful learning modes for effective e-learning supported by
   digital archives. Evidential research related to e-learning supported by
   digital archives is also lacking; most studies used digital archives as
   digital course materials, thus ignoring the principal property of
   digital archives excellent resource organization.
   Originality/value - The paper shows that by integrating the PBL mode
   with digital archives one can identify the advantages of digital
   archives in supporting e-learning, resulting in innovative and valuable
   research.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},

Pages = {{873-890}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to propose an innovative approach to assist
   teachers in using electronic libraries to develop learning activities
   for context-aware ubiquitous learning, in which the learning system can
   detect students' behaviors and guide them to learn in the real world
   with personalized support from the digital world.
   Design/methodology/approach - An electronic library with
   context-awareness metadata for supporting learning activities conducted
   in real-world environments is presented. Furthermore, a systematic
   procedure for guiding teachers in employing the electronic library to
   develop learning activities is proposed based on an innovative approach.
   Findings - From a practical application conducted on an elementary
   school, it is found that, with this innovative approach, electronic
   libraries not only have the potential in supporting traditional in-class
   or online learning activities, but also can assist teachers and digital
   content workers in developing high quality learning activities and
   related digital learning materials to support outdoor learning.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings of this paper imply
   that, to promote the utilization rate of electronic libraries for more
   specified purposes, more features of the application domains need to be
   considered while designing the database schemas of the electronic
   libraries.
   Practical implications - From the feedback of teachers and digital
   content workers, it is found electronic libraries have high potential
   for supporting outdoor learning activities for ``Science{''} and
   ``Social science{''} courses with proper database schema design and the
   provision of user guidance.
   Originality/value - An electronic library for supporting context-aware
   ubiquitous-learning is presented and an innovative approach for guiding
   teachers to design learning activities is proposed.}},

   The course ``Discrete time signal processing{''} might seem for students
   as being quite theoretical and difficult to understand. We have
   introduced several innovations into the course at the beginning of the
   year 2008. This paper describes the experience in teaching the basics of
   discrete signal processing by using MATLAB based projects involving
   synthesis, processing and analysis of sounds as well as the variety of
   tools available in virtual learning environment. It is well known that
   information and knowledge is grasped easier if more senses are activated
   during the learning process. Thus several lab works were designed with
   the goal to synthesize the sound of the bell, to design the digital
   reverberator, to analyze the noise of computer ventilators and others.
   Modern virtual learning environments (Moodle, WebCT) are usually used
   mere as depositories of learning materials. In our case, we used almost
   all the tools available in the virtual learning environment including:
   assessments, assignments, discussion forums, electronic submission of
   lab reports, announcements and usage statistics reports as the teacher
   tool. The anonymous course evaluation results by the students are
   presented in the final part of the paper. III. 2, bibl. 14 (in English;

Abstract = {{We present a new groupware architecture model called U D-3 that
   explicitly introduces the notion of tailorability in designing
   collaborative applications. This model is based on the integration of
   web services and software agents technologies, thus using protocols of
   each while reinforcing their individual strengths in the context of
   tailorable groupware design. In our work, web services are dynamically
   invoked by software agents in order to bring new behaviors, and hence,
   enhancing the collaboration process by dynamically adapting the services
   offered in the system to the users' preferences and not the other way
   around. Web services and agents were originally developed with different
   standards, thus their integration becomes important in the context of
   groupware tailorability, giving a totally innovative approach in the
   area of CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work). We apply our model
   on the DIGITAL OCEAN project for the creation and distribution of
   multimedia files on the Internet.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical technology advances slowly and only when there is overwhelming
   need for change. Change is resisted by surgeons and is made hard by FDA
   rules that inhibit innovation. There is a pressing need to improve
   surgeon's visualization of the operative field during laparoscopic
   surgery to minimize the risk for significant injury that can occur when
   surgeons are operating around delicate, hidden structures. We propose to
   use a Digital Light Processor-based hyperspectral imaging system to
   assist an operating surgeon's ability to see through tissues and
   identify otherwise hidden structures such as bile ducts during

Abstract = {{This chapter assesses the value of Web 2.0 and its constituent social
   software tools in enhancing learning opportunities for distance students
   and addressing the traditional problems of distance education by
   enabling a greater sense of presence, community building, and
   participation. With reference to a number of examples of current
   innovative practices of distance educators, the chapter also outlines
   the transformative value of these emerging digital technologies, and
   signals emergent forms of learning and teaching that make use of the
   affordances of the new tools. The chapter focuses on three
   considerations that the authors believe are needed to effectively
   capitalize on the new possibilities of Web 2.0: (1) the use of social
   networking tools to build social presence; (2) the reconceptualization
   of the design approaches used to create and implement e-learning
   activities in distance education contexts; and (3) the consideration of
   pedagogical strategies used to support distance learners.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter presents a Dewey-inspired analysis of the role of dissent
   in the creative process. We extend and complement received knowledge on
   the role of positive affect on creativity by discussing the tensions
   between negative and positive affect. Using a netnography of three
   online communities, which bring together animators and visual special
   effect artists, we develop a grounded typology of creative conflict
   practices. By cross-referencing the creative status with creative
   objectives, we define four distinct types of creative conflict
   practices: invoke, evoke, poke, and provoke. Our qualitative findings
   further show how creatives adeptly manage tensions between positive and
   negative affects.}},

Abstract = {{We present innovations in Planar Lightwave Circuits (PLCs) that make
   them ideally suited for use in advanced defense and aerospace
   applications. We discuss PLCs that contain no micro-optic components, no
   moving parts, pose no spark or fire hazard, are extremely small and
   lightweight, and are capable of transporting and processing a range of
   optical signals with exceptionally high performance. This PLC platform
   is designed for on-chip integration of active components such as lasers
   and detectors, along with transimpedance amplifiers and other
   electronics. These active components are hybridly integrated with our
   silica-on-silicon PLCs using fully-automated robotics and image
   recognition technology. This PLC approach has been successfully applied
   to the design and fabrication of multi-channel transceivers for
   aerospace applications. The chips contain hybrid DFB lasers and
   high-efficiency detectors, each capable of running over 10 Gb/s, with
   mixed digital and analog traffic multiplexed to a single optical fiber.
   This highly-integrated functionality is combined onto a silicon chip
   smaller than 4 x 10 mm, weighing < 5 grams. These chip-based
   transceivers have been measured to withstand harsh g-forces, including
   sinusoidal vibrations with amplitude of 20 g acceleration, followed by
   mechanical shock of 500 g acceleration. The components operate over a
   wide range of temperatures, with no device failures after extreme
   temperature cycling through a range of > 125 degC, and more than 2,000
   hours operating at 95 degC ambient air temperature. We believe that
   these recent advancements in planar lightwave circuits are poised to
   revolutionize optical communications and interconnects in the aerospace
   and defense industries.}},

   for more flexible office spaces, the push towards ``greener{''} and more
   environmentally friendly buildings (such as those that meet LEED
   certification), and the importance of increased rates of innovation at
   work. The article then discusses how these trends may affect the
   relevance of past research in this area. As relevant, research from
   related fields (e.g., architecture) will be incorporated to promote
   interdisciplinary insights and integration. The chapter will conclude
   with a general discussion of how environmental psychology can best
   position itself as a discipline given work trends/changes and lay out
   research questions for future inquiry.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and situational crisis suffered by the Media in the past
   three years could have bottomed out in 2010 and started to recover
   through a profound industrial restructuring, innovation on business
   models, segmentation and optimisation of the different channels and
   market segments, digital convergence, development of new diffusion
   channels and content value engineering based on the strength, reputation
   and credibility of editorial companies. This study is based on direct
   observation of trends in the sector and quantitative and qualitative
   data from statistical surveys and financial results of the main industry
   players. The main sources of information used are: the worldwide
   association of newspapers (WAN), the IFRA professional association,
   diffusion and audiometric measurement, observed trends and market
   prospects.}},

Abstract = {{A new aggregated Hardware/Software (HW/SW) codesign approach to
   optimization of the digital signal processing techniques for enhanced
   imaging with real-world uncertain remote sensing (RS) data based on the
   concept of descriptive experiment design regularization (DEDR) is
   addressed. We consider the applications of the developed approach to
   typical single-look synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging systems
   operating in the real-world uncertain RS scenarios. The software design
   is aimed at the algorithmic-level decrease of the computational load of
   the large-scale SAR image enhancement tasks. The innovative algorithmic
   idea is to incorporate into the DEDR-optimized fixed-point iterative
   reconstruction/enhancement procedure the convex convergence enforcement
   regularization via constructing the proper multilevel projections onto
   convex sets (POCS) in the solution domain. The hardware design is
   performed via systolic array computing based on a Xilinx Field
   Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) XC4VSX35-10ff668 and is aimed at
   implementing the unified DEDR-POCS image enhancement/reconstruction
   procedures in a computationally efficient multi-level parallel fashion
   that meets the (near) real-time image processing requirements. Finally,
   we comment on the simulation results indicative of the significantly
   increased performance efficiency both in resolution enhancement and in
   computational complexity reduction metrics gained with the proposed
   aggregated HW/SW co-design approach.}},

Abstract = {{Collective action is a universal characteristic of modern human
   populations and was likely an adaptive characteristic of our Pleistocene
   ancestors. Consequently, it has been proposed that selective pressures
   associated with cooperation favored cognitive adaptations. These
   adaptations may or may not respond adaptively in novel environments of
   collective action, such as those created by recent technological
   innovations. The Internet P2P file-sharing phenomenon is an
   extraordinary example of collective action that occurs in novel online
   social environments. In P2P file-sharing networks, altruistic uploaders
   provide a collective good (i.e., digital media) despite the presence of
   a large number of non-reciprocating file down-loaders. In doing so,
   uploaders risk prosecution for copyright infringement and are more
   vulnerable to computer hackers and viruses compared with those who
   strictly download. In this chapter, we consider the hypothesis that
   uploading is a costly signal in which males engage in avoidable risk
   taking as a means to compete for status among their peers on the
   Internet as well as those they interact with in their everyday social
   lives.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a new method to find developmental descriptions
   for gate-level feed forward combinatorial circuits. In contrast to the
   traditional description of FPGA circuits in which an external bit stream
   explicitly describes the internal architecture and the connections of
   the circuit, developmental descriptions form the circuit by
   synchronously running an identical developmental program in each
   building block of the circuit. Unlike some previous works, the
   connections are all local here. Evolution is used to find the
   developmental code for the given problem. We use an innovative fitness
   function to increase the performance of evolution in search for the
   solutions, and also relax the position and order of the inputs and
   output(s) of the circuit to increase the density of the solutions in the
   search space. The results show that the chance of finding a solution can
   be increased up to 375\% compared to the use of traditional fitness
   function. The preliminary studies show that this method is capable of
   describing basic circuits and is easily scalable for modular circuits.}},

Abstract = {{In the current competitive scenario, where business relationships are
   fundamental in building successful business models and inter/intra
   organizational business processes are progressively digitalized, an
   end-to-end methodology is required that is capable of guiding business

   innovative organizational model able to leverage Internet technologies
   to perform real-time coordination of intra and inter-firm activities, to
   create value by offering innovative and personalized products/services
   and reduce transaction costs. This chapter presents the TEKNE project

   modular and flexible approach, towards the IE techno-organizational
   paradigm, taking into account the competitive environment of the network
   and how this environment influences its strategic, organizational and

Abstract = {{In an era of unprecedented technological innovation and evolving user
   expectations and information seeking behaviour, we are arguably now an
   online society, with digital services increasingly common and
   increasingly preferred. As a trusted information provider, libraries are
   in an advantageous position to respond, but this requires integrated
   strategic and enterprise architecture planning, for information
   technology (IT) has evolved from a support role to a strategic role,
   providing the core management systems, communication networks and
   delivery channels of the modern library. Furthermore, IT components do
   not function in isolation from one another but are interdependent
   elements of distributed and multidimensional systems encompassing
   people, processes and technologies, which must consider social,
   economic, legal, organisational and ergonomic requirements and
   relationships, as well as being logically sound from a technical
   perspective. Strategic planning provides direction, while enterprise
   architecture strategically aligns and holistically integrates business
   and information system architectures. While challenging, such integrated
   planning should be regarded as an opportunity for the library to evolve
   as an enterprise in the digital age, or at minimum, to simply keep pace
   with societal change and alternative service providers. Without
   strategy, a library risks being directed by outside forces with
   independent motivations and inadequate understanding of its broader
   societal role. Without enterprise architecture, it risks technological
   disparity, redundancy and obsolescence. Adopting an interdisciplinary
   approach, this conceptual chapter provides an integrated framework for
   strategic and architectural planning of digital library services. The
   concept of the library as an enterprise is also introduced.}},

Abstract = {{We use reconfigurable hardware to construct a high throughput Bayesian
   computing machine (BCM) capable of evaluating probabilistic networks
   with arbitrary DAG (directed acyclic graph) topology. Our BCM achieves
   high throughput by exploiting the FPGA's distributed memories and
   abundant hardware structures (such as long carry-chains and registers),
   Which enables us to 1) develop an innovative memory allocation scheme
   based on a maximal matching algorithm that completely avoids memory
   stalls, 2) optimize and deeply pipeline the logic design of each
   processing node, and 3) schedule them optimally. The BCM architecture
   not only can be applied to many important algorithms in artificial
   intelligence, signal processing; and digital communications, but also
   has high reusability, i.e., a new application needs not change a BCM's
   hardware design, only new task graph processing and code compilation are
   necessary. Moreover, the throughput of a BCM scales almost linearly with
   the size of the FPGA on which it is implemented.
   A Bayesian computing machine with 16 processing nodes was implemented
   with a Virtex-5 FPGA (XCV5LX155T-2) on a BEE3 (Berkeley Emulation
   Engine) platform. For a wide variety of sample Bayesian problems,
   comparing running the same network evaluation algorithm on a 2.4 GHz
   Core 2 Duo Intel processor and a GeForce 9400m using the CUDA software
   package, the BCM demonstrates 80x and 15x speedups respectively, with a
   peak throughput of 20.4 GFLOPS (Giga Floating-Point Operations per
   Second).}},

Abstract = {{Much of Scotland's uplands are covered by organic peat soils, these form
   a significant proportion of the global peat resource. Peat ecosystems
   play a key role in the global carbon cycle through sequestration of
   atmospheric carbon during peat accumulation, and release of carbon gases
   in the form of CO2 and methane when they erode. This project set out to
   find a cost-effective means of identifying peat erosion features within
   a study area of 320 sq km on the Monadhliath Mountains in Northern
   Scotland.
   An innovative, object-orientated classification system method was used.
   Within Definiens eCognition software, SPOT5, IRS P6 and ASTER satellite
   imagery were prepared, including full geometric and atmospheric
   correction. In order to obtain the spatial detail required, digital
   aerial photography was integrated into the automated processing chain.
   This image data was complemented by GIS datasets that provided a set of
   core thematic information. Using image segmentation and a rule-base the
   spatial details from the air photos were integrated with the spectral
   detail from the satellite imagery and the thematic attributes from the
   GIS layers.
   Two levels of classification were produced: `core level' data and
   `application level' data. The application level data was produced from
   the core level data in the form of peat erosion maps. Erosion features
   were successfully identified that ranged from small gullies only a metre
   across, to larger exposed bare peat areas. Overall map accuracy was
   calculated at over 84\%, with clear visual coincidence between the
   classified map and both the in-situ field data and aerial imagery.}},

Abstract = {{Land cover mapping forms a reference base for resource managers in their
   decision-making processes to guide rural/urban growth and management of
   natural resources. The aim of this study was to map land cover dynamics
   within the Upper Shire River catchment, Malawi. The article promotes
   innovation of automated land cover mapping based on remote sensing
   information to generate data products that are both appropriate to, and
   usable within different scientific applications in developing countries
   such as Malawi. To determine land cover dynamics, 1989 and 2002 Landsat
   images were used. Image bands were combined in transformations and
   indices with physical meaning; together with spatial data, to enhance
   classification accuracy. A maximum likelihood classification for each
   image was computed for identification of land cover variables. The
   results showed that the combination of spatial and digital data enhanced
   classification accuracy and the ability to categorise land cover
   features, which are relatively inhomogeneous.}},

Abstract = {{We present an innovative way to autonomously classify LiDAR points into
   bare earth, building, vegetation, and other categories. One of the most
   desired commodities for LiDAR collection is a high resolution bare earth
   product with the same resolution as the input data. The LiteSite (R)
   algorithm automatically extracts buildings and foliage from an urban
   scene and generates an accurate bare-earth product. Our inpainting
   algorithms then fill these voids utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics
   (CFD) techniques and Partial Differential Equations (PDE) to create an
   accurate Digital Terrain Model (DTM). Inpainting allows generation of
   high resolution bare-earth Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in high
   frequency terrain for urban 3-D modeling. Moreover, if buildings in the
   scene are partially obscured by trees, then the LiteSite (R) algorithm
   automatically removes these obscurations and inpaints the heights while
   preserving building edge content where vegetation has been extracted.
   Inpainting preserves building height contour consistency and edge
   sharpness of identified inpainted regions. This technology reduces
   manual editing while being cost effective for large scale global bare
   earth production. Quantitative analyses are provided using Receiver
   Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves to show Probability of Detection
   and False Alarm of ground versus non-ground features. Histograms are
   shown with sample size metrics. Qualitative results illustrate other
   benefits such as Terrain Inpainting's unique ability to minimize or
   eliminate undesirable terrain data artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{Digital government research often centers oil information technology
   artifacts designed for the purpose of improving access to or processes
   within government. Because of the centricity of the technology artifact,
   much of this research builds upon theories and prescriptions adapted
   from the information systems discipline. In information systems, the
   study of artifact design has benefitted from the adoption of the rigor
   and generalizability enabled by design science research. The purpose of
   this paper was to provide an overview of design science principles
   guiding the construction of technological artifacts, which we use to
   examine a decade of digital government research articles that fall into
   the design science camp. We assess these articles. using the guidelines
   of Hevner, March, and Park (2004) for conducting and presenting design
   science research: we identify common strengths and gaps; we recommend
   how digital government researchers may benefit from applying a grounded
   view of design to expand the generalizability of their work; and
   finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion of ways to open up the
   narrow focus of design science to a broader understanding of the impact
   of external factors, such as the environment and organizational milieu,
   on the complex setting most digital government innovation inhabits. (C)

Abstract = {{Since 2001, the United Nations (UN) and affiliated organizations have
   measured e-Government initiatives of more than 178 Member States of the
   UN, by devising ``e-Government Readiness Index{''} (e-GRI) and
   ``e-Participation Index{''} (e-PI). The UN has published rankings for
   its Member States in terms of e-GRI and e-PI, through e-Government
   Readiness Assessments (Surveys). Member States of the UN and digital
   government research community as well as academicians and practitioners
   regularly use the e-GRI and e-PI as a point-of-reference; this fact
   alone signifies the importance of evaluating the existing UN
   methodologies assessing e-Governance. Since e-Governance is one of the
   greatest innovations in the public sector, this research uses conceptual
   content analysis on the Surveys using the Innovation Management
   Measurement Framework (IMMF). which is one of the most widely accepted
   theoretical frameworks for measuring innovation initiatives. The
   resultant percentage normalized scores (PNS) lead to a set of
   recommendations for developing better informed, more balanced, and more
   powerful e-GRI and e-PI for the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) will
   use a dedicated 300-fiber, narrow-band (1.5-1.7 micron), high resolution
   (R similar to 30,000), near-infrared spectrograph to survey
   approximately 100,000 giant stars across the Milky Way. This survey,
   conducted as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS III), will
   revolutionize our understanding of kinematical and chemical enrichment
   histories of all Galactic stellar populations. The instrument, currently
   in fabrication, will be housed in a separate building adjacent to the
   2.5 m SDSS telescope and fed light via approximately 45-meter fiber runs
   from the telescope. The instrument design includes numerous
   technological challenges and innovations including a gang connector that
   allows simultaneous connection of all fibers with a single plug to a
   telescope cartridge that positions the fibers on the sky, numerous
   places in the fiber train in which focal ratio degradation must be
   minimized, a large (290 mm x 475 mm elliptically-shaped recorded area)
   mosaic-VPH, an f/1.4 six-element refractive camera featuring silicon and
   fused silica elements with diameters as large as 393 mm, three
   near-infrared detectors mounted in a 1 x 3 mosaic with sub-pixel
   translation capability, and all of these components housed within a
   custom, LN2-cooled, stainless steel vacuum cryostat with dimensions 1.4
   m x 2.3 m x 1.3 m.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter develops a conceptualised idea of advanced digital
   technologies which combines the ubiquitous computing and Augmented
   Reality (AR) concepts for lifelong learning. The featured case studies
   provide a snapshot of what is possible when teachers and students have
   ready access to a variety of digital devices which can be used to
   support teaching and learning no matter where they are located. The
   chapter also discusses the different teaching and learning methodologies
   to demonstrate the increased needs for people to improve learning with
   the aids of digital technologies. The framework underlines the primary
   principles for the integration of ubiquitous computing and AR.
   Discussion is focused on the use of digital technologies to create a
   wide variety of representations of knowledge and the ways such
   representations support abstract conceptualizations of knowledge. The
   innovative way of learning in daily life envisions ubiquitous AR
   computing in terms of computers that are embedded in the environments
   people normally inhabit, such as walls, windows, clothing, appliances,
   etc. Furthermore, they are connected to each other through wireless
   communication. Such learning environment extends beyond the traditional
   learning methodologies and introduces a more flexible and interactive
   approach to customising the needs from various types of learners with
   different backgrounds, previous skill levels, and even culture.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Pages = {{603-622}},
Abstract = {{Intellectual property, contract, and tort laws likely have some effects
   on levels of innovation in service sectors of the economy. Legal rules
   that are too strong or too strict may discourage investment in service
   innovation; yet, rules that are too weak or too loose may result in
   suboptimal investments in sound innovation. Intellectual property
   protections have traditionally been quite strong in protecting
   innovation in manufacturing sectors, but much less so in service
   sectors. Services have, for example, traditionally been unpatentable
   because they were perceived to be non-technological. Whether digital
   information services, such as web services, should be patentable is
   currently unsettled and highly controversial. Contract and tort rules
   are currently quite strict as to manufactured goods, but less so as to
   services. The emergence of digital information services raises questions
   about whether existing contract and tort rules governing goods or
   services should be applied to them, or whether some new legal rules are
   needed to promote innovation in digital information services and social
   welfare more generally.}},

Abstract = {{The LapSlapper is an inexpensive and low-technology percussive
   instrument with a digital interface. In a tactile and embodied manner it
   allows enhanced control and promotes expressive creativity when
   operating with percussive elements in digital environments. By using
   piezo-microphones, mounted on a pair of gloves and connected with a
   stereo signal to a runtime-version of a Max/MSP patch, intuitive haptic
   properties are achieved with simple means. The LapSlapper improves the
   physical feeling of playing digital rhythm instruments but the concept
   holds furthermore the potential to promote exploration and innovation of
   new, digitally founded rhythmical structures and aesthetics.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{11-49}},
Abstract = {{Coherent optical fiber communications were studied extensively in the
   1980s mainly because high sensitivity of coherent receivers could
   elongate the unrepeated transmission distance; however, their research
   and development have been interrupted for nearly 20 years behind the
   rapid progress in high-capacity wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM)
   systems using erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). In 2005, the
   demonstration of digital carrier phase estimation in coherent receivers
   has stimulated a widespread interest in coherent optical communications
   again. This is due to the fact that the digital coherent receiver
   enables us to employ a variety of spectrally efficient modulation
   formats such as M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude
   modulation (QAM) without relying upon a rather complicated optical
   phase-locked loop. In addition, since the phase information is preserved
   after detection, we can realize electrical post-processing functions
   such as compensation for chromatic dispersion and polarization-mode
   dispersion in the digital domain. These advantages of the born-again
   coherent receiver have enormous potential for innovating existing
   optical communication systems. In this chapter, after reviewing the
   20-year history of coherent optical communication systems, we describe
   the principle of operation of coherent detection, the concept of the
   digital coherent receiver, and its performance evaluation. Finally,
   challenges for the future are summarized.}},

   innovative way to strongly reduce dimension and keep relations between
   components of an image data set. Our method is validated on the Mnist
   learning database containing 70000 pictures of handwritten digits.
   Results demonstrate that the proposed approach is very efficient. It

Abstract = {{Along with Information Technology progress, E-business is becoming a key
   concept in the Internet and electronic commerce world. However, in
   today's intensely competitive business climate, innovative products
   become central to E-business development. Furthermore, changes in
   consumer perceptions regarding innovation are also important in
   E-business. Recently, creative industries are continually emerging in
   electronic commerce and have the potential to become a key trend in
   E-business. Understanding the E-business models for creative industries
   and helping designers to design ``culture{''} into products are
   important research issues, and issues not yet well covered. Therefore,
   this paper proposes an ABCDE approach to illustrate how to transform
   ``Archive{''} into ``E-business{''}. In order to turn ``Archive{''} into
   ``Business{''}, we first need ``Creativity{''} and ``Design{''}; only
   then can we transform innovative products into ``E-business.{''} Results
   presented herein create an interface for looking at the way E-business
   crosses over cultures, and illustrate the interwoven experience of
   E-business and cultural creativity in the innovation design process and
   electronic commerce world.}},

Abstract = {{Architecture is a collection of culture, art, materials, structure and
   space. Throughout the thousands years of architectural history, we see
   the vast majority of buildings were present in the world in the forms of
   cuboids, cylinder, cone and other geometric shapes. Within a long period
   of time, architect has been using the two-dimensional drawing tools to
   express three-dimensional design ideas. Habit of long-term ruler use
   Impact thinking of the architect's design limits the creation of program
   design, but also limits innovation in terms of the construction forms.
   The emergence of digital technology and virtual reality technology help
   us solve this problem. By the help of new tools, architect can come up
   with better creative thinking in the early stage.}},

Abstract = {{Libraries are in a bigger predicament to safeguard digital material as
   the preservation of digital information vastly differs from that of the
   traditional print material. Digital publications are taking the world by
   storm, whereas the storehouses of knowledge are finding it very
   difficult to safeguard these digital publications. The technological
   innovations, the obsolescence of hardware and software coupled with the
   inconsistent preservation techniques and standards pose greater problems
   for the libraries and information centres. Among myriad challenges in
   digital preservation, the important challenge is the preservation of
   digital contents within the context in which they were created. The role
   of libraries during these uncertain times especially in creating
   awareness among the creators and managers of digital documents, is to
   work towards a global digital preservation policy and invest in

Abstract = {{Although analog circuits are usually only a small part of an overall
   mixed-signal design, the time it takes to design these circuits is
   significantly longer. On the digital side, design automation and
   optimization tools have been around for a long time and are well
   established. These tools free up the designer to focus on more
   innovative tasks and allow for greater design productivity. The analog
   side, however, has yet to reach this point. There is much ongoing
   research in this area and many different approaches to try to mitigate
   the complexity of designing analog circuits. We propose an algorithm
   that utilizes the fast and efficient execution of linear programming to
   provide a solution for single objective optimization of small circuits.
   We show the results of this algorithm on three sample circuits with the
   objectives of maximizing gain and bandwidth. The results from our
   proposed optimization algorithm were within 10 percent of the maximum
   gain/bandwidth derived using traditional manual optimization methods.}},

Abstract = {{Electricity infrastructure touches us all - the key challenge, pertinent
   to this panel session, is to enable secure and very high-confidence
   sensing, communication and control of a heterogeneous, widely dispersed,
   yet globally interconnected system, which is a serious technological
   problem in any case. It is even more complex and difficult to control it
   for optimal efficiency and maximum benefit to the ultimate consumers
   while still allowing all its business components to compete fairly and
   freely. The North American power network may be considered to be the
   largest and most complex machine in the world - its transmission lines
   connect all the electric generation and distribution on the continent.
   In that respect, it exemplifies many of the complexities of electric
   power infrastructure and how technological innovation combined with
   efficient markets and enabling policies can address them. This network
   represents an enormous investment, including over 15,000 generators in
   10,000 power plants, and hundreds of thousands of miles of transmission
   lines and distribution networks. With diminished transmission and
   generation capacities, and with dramatic increases in inter-regional
   bulk power transfers and diversity of transactions, the electric power
   grid is being used in ways for which it was not originally designed.
   Grid congestion and atypical power flows have been increasing during the
   last twenty five years, while customer expectations of reliability and
   cyber-physical security are rising to meet the needs of a pervasively
   digital world.}},

Title = {{Beyond Nyquist: Efficient Sampling of Sparse Bandlimited Signals}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Wideband analog signals push contemporary analog-to-digital conversion
   (ADC) systems to their performance limits. In many applications,
   however, sampling at the Nyquist rate is inefficient because the signals
   of interest contain only a small number of significant frequencies
   relative to the band limit, although the locations of the frequencies
   may not be known a priori. For this type of sparse signal, other
   sampling strategies are possible. This paper describes a new type of
   data acquisition system, called a random demodulator, that is
   constructed from robust, readily available components. Let K denote the
   total number of frequencies in the signal, and let W denote its band
   limit in hertz. Simulations suggest that the random demodulator requires
   just O(K log(W/K)) samples per second to stably reconstruct the signal.
   This sampling rate is exponentially lower than the Nyquist rate of W
   hertz. In contrast to Nyquist sampling, one must use nonlinear methods,
   such as convex programming, to recover the signal from the samples taken
   by the random demodulator. This paper provides a detailed theoretical
   analysis of the system's performance that supports the empirical
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an intelligent judgment system to determine the exact timing
   for overtaking another car in simulated dynamic circumstances by motion
   detection and feature analysis in subsequent images based on digital
   image processing in this paper. The strategic methodology in detection
   of motion vectors extracted from the source video file can effectively
   evaluate and predict the behavior of surrounding vehicles and at the
   same time give an appropriate suggestion whether the driver could
   overtake another car, which is not only different from the traditional
   methods in computational feature-only analysis for some specific static
   image but also provides an innovative idea among the related
   applications of intelligent transportation system (ITS). Our system
   makes use of the video-typed files recorded from the rear-view mirror in
   the vehicle that should be obtained from the digital image capturing
   devices. It also constantly reevaluates the information of motion
   vectors in surrounding environments to update the useful information
   between the driver's vehicle and background. In order to tackle the
   problem of real-time processing, this paper simplifies the processes of
   feature selection and analysis for video processing in particular. The
   crucial features used to give dynamic information, motion vectors, can
   be obtained from defined consecutive images. We define a variable number
   of images according to the extent of motion variation in different
   real-time situations. Our dynamic features are composed of geometrical
   and statistical characteristics from each processed image in the defined
   duration. Our scheme can identify the difference between the background
   and object of interest, which also reveals the dynamic information of
   the determined number of images extracted from the whole video file. Our
   experimental results show that the proposed features can give the useful
   information in a given traffic condition, such as the locations of
   surrounding vehicles, and the way of vehicles' moving. The real-time
   problems of ITS are taken into consideration in this paper and the
   developed feature series are flexible to the changes of occasions. More
   useful features in dynamic environments as well as our feature series
   will be applied in our systematical mechanisms, and the improvement on
   real-time problems by motion vectors should be progressively made in the
   near future.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid transmission, such as hydraulic and pneumatic, is widely used in
   the fixtures in modern industry. But there are some disadvantages in
   these fixtures. First, too much loops and turns in the hydraulic or
   pneumatic systems have lead to lower energy utilization ratio and
   complicated structure. Second, oil emission in hydraulic system may
   cause environment pollution, and the noise in pneumatic system may cause
   pollution too. Third, fluid system always needs electro-hydraulic or
   electro-pneumatic transform elements for digital intelligent control,
   which will add the cost and the complexity of system.
   In order to overcome this disadvantage, a new kind of mechatronics
   clamping device is designed innovatively, which is driven by servo motor
   and translated along the self-locking power screw. So it was very simple
   with little transmission elements and has no high-speed mechanic
   components. By changing the geometry shape of basic link, different
   requirements for clamping forces and clamping situations can be
   satisfied.
   This new kind of clamping device has prominent advantages in green and
   digital aspects. Moreover, it can meet perfectly the requirements of
   short-cycle, high-volume production in modern manufacturing industry.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-79}},
Abstract = {{The chronic shortage of doctors in rural India seriously impacts the
   quality of health care available to villagers. In recent years, there
   has been considerable excitement in digital diagnostics as a possible
   answer to this situation by allowing non-doctors to diagnose and treat
   patients. In this article, the author focuses on one such diagnostic
   tool that has gained serious traction among transnational health
   foundations and state governments alike. The focus is on the
   customization and localization of this software through a pilot study in
   central Himalayas. A baseline survey and extensive interviews are
   conducted for categorization and population of health data content. This
   entailed analyzing the segmentation and transfer of health information
   on disease history and symptoms from the patient to the software as well
   as situating this study in the larger understanding of the healthcare
   system in this community. In doing so, the author argues that much of
   such health information is difficult to categorize and sufficiently
   vague to not provide for a confident diagnosis. Further, the data
   population of the treatment segment is deeply political and
   sociocultural. This article thereby problematizes the innate assumption
   underlying the design of such software, that it is possible to diagnose
   and treat patients based on pure information.}},

Abstract = {{The digital divide is conventionally measured in terms of information
   and communication technology (ICT) equipment diffusion, which comes down
   to counting the number of computers or phones, among other devices. This
   article fine-tunes these approximations by estimating the amount of
   digital information that is stored, communicated, and computed by these
   devices. The installed stock of ICT equipment in the consumer segment is
   multiplied with its corresponding technological performance, resulting
   in the oinstalled technological capacityo for storage (in bits),
   bandwidth (in bits per second), and computational power (in computations
   per second). This leads to new insights. Despite the rapidly decreasing
   digital equipment divide, there is an increasing gap in terms of
   information-processing capacity. It is shown that in 1996 the average
   inhabitant of the industrialized countries of the Organization for
   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had a capacity of 49 kibps
   more than its counterpart from Latin America and the Caribbean. Ten
   years later, this gap widened to 577 kibps per inhabitant. This
   innovative approach toward the quantification of the digital divide
   leads to numerous new challenges for the research agenda.}},

Title = {{Toward a Longitudinal Model of e-Commerce: Environmental, Technological,
   and Organizational Drivers of B2C Adoption}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{209-227}},
Abstract = {{Despite the important benefits for firms of commercial initiatives on
   the Internet, e-commerce is still an emerging distribution channel, even
   in developed countries. Thus, more needs to be known about the
   mechanisms affecting its development. A large number of works have
   studied firms' e-commerce adoption from technological,
   intraorganizational, institutional, or other specific perspectives, but
   there is a need for adequately tested integrative frameworks. Hence,
   this work proposes and tests a model of firms' business-to-consumer
   (called B2C) e-commerce adoption that is founded on a holistic vision of
   the phenomenon. With this integrative approach, the authors analyze the
   joint influence of environmental, technological, and organizational
   factors; moreover, they evaluate this effect over time. Using various
   representative Spanish data sets covering the period 1996-2005, the
   findings demonstrate the suitability of the holistic framework.
   Likewise, some lessons are learned from the analysis of the key building
   blocks. In particular, the current study provides evidence for the
   debate about the effect of competitive pressure, since the findings show
   that competitive pressure disincentivizes e-commerce adoption in the
   long term. The results also show that the development or enrichment of
   the consumers' consumption patterns, the technological readiness of the
   market forces, the firm's global scope, and its competences in
   innovation continuously favor e-commerce adoption.}},

Abstract = {{New model for successful urban organization in the global age is
   emerging. Municipalities can survive the increasingly intense global
   competition by the local political arrangement, but how? The electronic
   dialogue between Public Administrations, citizens and enterprises
   represents the key element for the development of the public sector.
   This interactive communication is able to carry out a sharing of
   information and knowledge that is both an instrument and the main task
   for Municipalities in the Digital Era. The e-government is a complex and
   multidimensional issue. Cities of the Future will be built along
   ``information highways{''}. These smart communities - in which each
   individual is part of the whole - promote the context for our lives and
   the fabric of our existence. If technology is a tool of transformation,
   e-government is a way to fulfill the conditions of good governance. The
   electronic government is not just ICT: it also includes rules and
   procedures, because the public administration cannot innovate without a
   normative drive. So it must operate under the Rule of Law, protecting
   general principles such as equality, administrative transparency, rights
   protection for all citizens. Democratic legal systems have to foster and
   promote civil and political rights also in the scenario of ``electronic
   cities{''}. Technology has opened up domains of information which only
   some years ago were unthinkable, and everyone - including people who are
   disadvantaged due to limited re-sources or education, age, disabilities
   - should be able to enjoy the related benefits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses principles of discrete nonlinear control performed
   towards the diagnostic quality-based interpretive software optimization
   for cardiology-based monitoring system. Thanks to the pervasive access
   to wireless digital communication, distributed biosignal interpretation
   networks may not only optimally solve difficult medical cases, but also
   adapt the data acquisition, interpretation and transmission to the
   variable patient's status and availability of technical resources. The
   adaptation is based on the innovative use of results from the automatic
   ECG analysis to the seamless remote modification of the interpreting
   software. This paper focuses on the static properties and control
   accuracy and dynamic properties of the ECG processing optimization. It
   provides also details on the automatic scoring of the performance of ECG
   interpretation procedures. Testing of the prototype, despite its limited
   scale, yields significant quantitative benefits and improvement of
   diagnostic quality.}},

Title = {{Approaching digital equity: is wifi the new leveler?}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{4-22}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Recent reports suggest the shape and size of the digital
   divide may be changing. This exploratory study aims to examine the
   relationships between demographic and situational variables and small
   and medium-sized enterprise (SME) owners' intentions to adopt and use
   free public wifi technology.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey study of 158 SME owners in the
   urban renewal community (RC) of a large Southwestern metroplex
   investigated the influence of known digital divisors - gender,
   ethnicity, age, education, and experience - on the adoption and use of
   wi-fl technologies. Partial least squares was used to test the
   hypotheses.
   Findings - Contrary to previous research, gender, age, education, and
   experience were not related to the intention to adopt wifi technology.
   Ethnicity was significantly related to intent to adopt, but the
   relationship was small. Ethnicity and age were found to be somewhat
   related to wifi usage. In marked contrast from earlier research,
   education, gender, and experience were not significant predictors of
   usage.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest that access to high-speed
   wifi has the potential to reduce and/or eliminate the digital divide.
   The projected changes in the digital divide can be expected to make a
   significant impact on SME productivity and performance.
   Originality/value - This study is one of the first to examine the
   influence of the adoption and use of public wi-fl technologies by SME
   owners on the digital divide.}},

Abstract = {{The RM3 is the new development in RM series, thanks to its innovative
   onboard drive electronics it is now possible for users to extend easily
   their systems through new functionalities.
   During this presentation you will have an overview of advantages and
   benefits of this onboard digital driver electronics both for the
   Detectors' Module makers and the End-users. Furthermore you will
   appreciate the specific performances of the RM3.
   Sofradir and SCD, both leading manufacturers of Detectors' module, have
   contributed through their expertise to evaluate successfully the RM3,
   operated by the onboard driver electronics. The results of these new
   functionalities and cryogenic performances will be revealed throughout
   the presentation.
   We plan to adapt this onboard drive electronics to the other products of
   the RM-series. The next generation of small sized camera's requires
   increasingly reliable and yet compact Cryocoolers. The customers also
   need Easy to use \& Easy to replace products. We will demonstrate how
   the RM3 can provide user-friendly solutions to meet these expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - To prepare for the increasingly important role women
   entrepreneurs are expected to play in the knowledge economy, it is
   imperative to understand, facilitate and manage women's training needs
   for full participation in the knowledge economy. The chapter introduces
   a skilling framework which integrates pedagogical, organisational and
   technological values to promote the uptake of knowledge economy skills.
   Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory study approach was adopted
   underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology. The study fused a
   literature review on knowledge economy skills and women's learning needs
   with a desktop audit of opportunities available to women entrepreneurs
   to augment their knowledge economy skills.
   Findings - Based on the two sets of data, the study found that a lack of
   attention has been paid to increasing female entrepreneurs'
   opportunities to develop to their full potential in the knowledge
   economy. Most training programmes fall short in delivering comprehensive
   digital and strategic skills required for women entrepreneurs' full
   participation in a knowledge society.
   Research limitations/implications: Given the exploratory study approach,
   researchers are encouraged to adopt and test the proposed framework.
   Practical implications - The interlinking of business and technology
   offers unique opportunities for women to engage in entrepreneurship and
   innovation. For policy makers this analysis provides insights on how to
   foster female entrepreneurship in the knowledge economy. For educators
   it provides a teaching and learning framework that encompasses evidence
   based content, gender-sensitive approaches to business skilling and
   collaborative learning environments.
   Originality/Value of chapter - This framework helps lay a foundation for
   future research on the skilling of heterogeneous women entrepreneurs in
   the knowledge economy.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of this paper originated during the Memory Line Project. The
   Memory Line Project is based on the conviction that a very important
   point is the promotion of inter and intra generational exchanges; to
   take advantage of human and social capital in order to keep the memory
   line of knowledge alive, exchange of information, social support and
   personal empowerment; while avoiding forms of isolation. The Memory Line
   Project ``aims at training groups of elderly and young citizens resident
   in the project's partner countries to collect records (stories, songs,
   poems, experiences, etc.) in order to ensure their conservation and
   dissemination with a view to creating a model of cooperation and
   inter-regional and intergenerational learning based on memory and
   communication and to promote innovative experiences within the area of
   lifelong training.{''}. In this paper we will present in detail the

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present an evaluation of the use of
   `YouTube' video broadcasting technology as an assessment modality for
   higher education nursing students using vital signs assessment as the
   focus. Approximately 150 first year undergraduate nursing students at UB
   in Victoria Australia were invited to participate in an evaluative
   survey concerning a nursing vital signs skill assessment which utilised
   `YouTube' as the medium. Whilst this study acknowledges that we must
   bring assessment into line with contemporary student populations in
   order to stimulate and satisfy the learning needs of undergraduate
   students, this study is also cognisant that higher education must be
   mindful of the added complexity that these technologies bring. Therefore
   there is a need to work towards collaborative outcomes for both student
   and academic, remaining aware not to cast the student as the digital
   victim and portray the teacher as the digital perpetrator. In light of
   the findings therein lies a dichotomy between what students see as
   assistive to learning and what the teacher sees as helpful to
   assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   copying personally identifying information. No program currently exists
   publically to create personally identifying honeytokens; we will show
   how the design we've proposed will fill this void and be another good
   tool for the computer security engineer and a vast improvement over
   previous nave and manual methods of generating fake identifying
   information. The main contribution of this work is a new and innovative
   program to produce PII honeytokens, a description of where they can be

   Reverse Engineering techniques, for the production of artificial teeth.
   Starting from the reconstructed 3D model of each tooth, first the mould
   CAD model is created and then the milling path is computed for
   machining. At the moment there is no indication of the quality of such
   innovative procedure, so it is investigated in this study by evaluating
   the deviation introduced by each manufacturing step. A machined mould
   for the production of acrylic molars and premolars is inspected by means
   of a contactless scanner and some teeth are selected as manufactured
   samples. Scan data of such samples allow to evaluate the deviations
   introduced by each operation. A comparison of two optical digitizers is

Abstract = {{The development of innovative products and their realisation by means of
   advanced manufacturing methods and process combinations is a key issue
   in industrial production, which is subsequently influenced even more by
   the possibilities that Rapid Technologies Rapid Modelling and Reverse
   Engineering, Rapid Prototyping and Tooling, Rapid Manufacturing can
   offer.
   In this paper, the implementation of a Rapid Modelling and Reverse
   Engineering (RE) based innovative design methodology called Reverse
   Innovative Design (RID) is discussed. The RID methodology facilitates
   design and knowledge reuse by leveraging RE and CAD design applications.
   The core of the RID methodology is the definition and construction of
   feature-based parametric solid models from scanned data obtained via
   various digitising devices. The solid model is constructed with feature
   data to allow for design modification and iteration.
   The paper reflects research results showing that the RID methodology
   provides an intelligent reverse engineering workflow when compared to
   the conventional reverse engineering practices, and may give rise to
   greater user and product benefits from scanning, modelling, and
   simulation to downstream applications such as Rapid Prototyping (RP) and
   prototype tooling.}},

Abstract = {{Improving energy efficiency by monitoring household electrical
   consumption is of significant importance with the present-day climate
   change concerns. A solution for the electrical consumption management
   problem is the use of a non-intrusive load monitoring system (NILM).
   This system captures the signals from the aggregate consumption,
   extracts the features from these signals and classifies the extracted
   features in order to identify the switched on appliances. An effective
   device identification (ID) requires a signature to be assigned for each
   appliance. Moreover, to specify an ID for each device, signal processing
   techniques are needed for extracting the relevant features. This paper
   describes a technique for the steady-states recognition in an electrical
   digital signal as the first stage for the implementation of an
   innovative NILM. Furthermore, the final goal is to develop an
   intelligent system for the identification of the appliances by automated
   learning. The proposed approach is based on the ratio value between
   rectangular areas defined by the signal samples. The computational
   experiments show the method effectiveness for the accurate steady-states
   identification in the electrical input signals.}},

Abstract = {{One innovative use of digital games is to facilitate learning skills
   with social components by simulating human behavior with virtual humans.
   We investigate learners' social goals to understand how they help
   learners learn intercultural skills from virtual humans in BiLAT, a
   virtual world that teaches cross-cultural negotiation. We hypothesize
   that students learn more when they approach the simulation as a social
   interaction rather than taking a trial-and-error approach perhaps
   characteristic of video gaming. In a randomized controlled experiment
   with 59 participants, we found that participants improved cross-cultural
   negotiation skills through game play. Our hypothesis that participants
   given an explicit social goal would learn more than those given
   task-related goals was not confirmed. We did, however, find a positive
   relation between students' self-reported social goals, regardless of
   condition, and their learning results. This relation was confirmed
   through analysis of log data. Although it is still an open question how
   best to promote students' approaching a simulation with a social
   orientation, the results underline the importance of such goals.}},

Abstract = {{An important approach of complex wave reconstruction in generalized
   phase-shifting interferometry (GPSI) with arbitrary unknown phase shifts
   is the combination of two (a conventional and an inverse) least square
   methods (LSMs), where the conventional LSM requires the calculation of
   solving a set of least square equations for each pixel in each
   iteration, giving rise to a heavy computation burden. Here a
   much-simplified algorithm is suggested to extract reference phase and
   then reconstruct object wave-front by replacing the conventional LSM in
   above process with our specially derived wave reconstruction formulae
   for GPSI. In this method, only one least-square equation is needed in
   each iteration to retrieve the reference phase, and the object phase can
   be calculated analytically and simultaneously. The feasibility and
   effectiveness of this algorithm have been verified by computer
   simulations with both the smooth and diffusing objects. The results show
   that this innovation can save computing time by about 20 times compared
   with previous two-LSM algorithm while still ensures its high precision.
   This approach can be used for GPSI with three or more frames in the wide
   range of unknown positive or negative phase shifts. Optical experiment:;
   have also made with satisfactory results.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining a high quality of life that encompasses work satisfaction
   and work-life balance is a critical long term need for the engineering
   practitioners. In this paper I argue that to grow professionally
   engineers need to design sustainable work environments for themselves
   through the productive use of information technology. I present a field
   study to identify `open organizing' as a model to sustain engineering
   work. Open organizing refers to development of socio-technical
   infrastructure that allows people to successfully contribute to an
   endeavor irrespective of their physical location. Through a grounded
   theory analysis of field study data collected from an organization I
   call Digitech, I outline characteristics of open organizing practices
   and discuss their benefits for the engineers who worked there and for
   the organization. Overall, the findings reveal that successful creation
   and implementation of open organizing can result in better work-life
   balance for engineers and increase productivity and innovation.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an innovative approach to citizen-led production
   of Web-based geographic information where new and/or existing digital
   map features are linked to annotations or commentary and citizens engage

   information systems (PPGISs) and the emerging challenges associated with
   volunteered geographic information. A custom-developed, open source
   software tool named MapChat is used to facilitate the citizen inputs and
   discussions. The information generated from applying the approach
   through a series of community workshops is presented and discussed in
   light of current issues in PPGIS and volunteered geographic information

Abstract = {{This article traces the emergence of a digital imperative - the belief
   in the necessity of digitising cultural expressions - in a particular
   heritage project in the Dutch city of Maastricht. The main reason for
   doing so is to contribute to the growing body of literature on digital
   cultural heritage, a perspective that pays analytical attention to the
   organisational and institutional dynamics of heritage innovation. Such a
   perspective complicates the popular assumption that digitisation will be
   beneficial to participation and instead puts forward - by drawing on
   institutional theory and the sociology of expectations - a less
   technology-centric and more contextual understanding of digital
   heritage. The conclusion highlights the potential of institutional
   analysis and the sociology of expectations for digital heritage studies.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING}},

Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{2205-2226}},
Abstract = {{An innovative method, high-accuracy surface modelling (HASM), is
   presented, which is based on the fundamental theorem of surfaces. The
   fundamental theorem of surfaces makes sure that a surface is uniquely
   defined by the first and second fundamental coefficients. Numerical
   tests of a Gaussian synthetic surface show that the Root Mean Square
   Error of the HASM method is much less than the ones of classical
   methods, such as the Triangulated Irregular Network, Spline, Inverse
   Distance Weight and Kriging methods. The HASM method gives a solution to
   the error problem that has long troubled generations of digital
   elevation models. All the methods for surface modelling are used to
   simulate a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) of Qian-Yan-Zhou Experimental
   Station for Red Soil and Hilly Land, which has a great topographical
   variety. Shaded relief maps of the simulated DEMs are developed to
   represent the terrain relief of Qian-Yan-Zhou Experimental Station,
   which shows that simulation results of the HASM method are much better
   than the ones of classical methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the predictive power of innovative and more
   conventional statistical classification techniques. We use Landsat 7
   Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal
   Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and airborne imaging
   spectrometer (HyMap) images to classify Mediterranean vegetation types,
   with and without inclusion of ancillary data (geology, soil classes and
   digital elevation model derivatives). When the number of classes is low,
   both conventional and innovative techniques perform well. For larger
   numbers of classes the innovative techniques of random forests and
   support vector machines outperform the other techniques. Compared to
   conventional techniques, classification trees, random forests and
   support vector machines proved to be better suited for the incorporation
   of continuous and categorical ancillary data: overall accuracies and
   accuracies for individual classes improve significantly when many,
   difficult to separate, classes are taken into account. Therefore, these
   techniques are definitely worth including in common image analysis
   software packages.}},

Abstract = {{An initiative to stimulate innovation by putting rural public houses

   which show that the initiative did not develop as intended and

   attempt to appropriate computer and internet technology is explained as
   a failure of social learning. In particular, whilst aiming with some
   success to assist in the configuration of the technology to the specific
   context and setting of the rural pub, the initiative failed to focus on
   developing the means and mechanisms that might have supported the
   development of a stronger learning culture. This could have provided the
   basis for the kind of social innovation required to develop and sustain
   a model of the rural `cyber pub' that might then have been more widely
   appropriable.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an innovative method for (1)verification of signature
   using parametric features based on optimal threshold selection is
   proposed. For each signature, 62 parametric feature are derived from
   horizontal place, x(t), vertical place, y(t) and pen down and up signals
   which are obtained from a digitizer plane. The weighted distance between
   each feature of a signatories and the related reference features is
   compared to a suitable threshold value and then the feature is accepted
   or not. The number of the accepted features for a person is then
   compared to another threshold, which has a suitable value for each
   signature, and then the signature will be verified or rejected. In this
   research, 1500 original signatures from 30 person and 600 forgery
   signatures are used. For each person, 30 genuine and 10 forgery
   signatures are considered for training of the algorithm and the rest are
   used in testing and validation. It is shown in the results that there is
   0.67\% false rejection ratio and 0.67\% false acceptation ratio for the
   training set and a 2.68\% and 1.99\% for the testing set, respectively.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-86}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The Internet has evolved, prompted in part by new Web 2.0
   technologies, to become a more widespread platform for interaction,
   communication, and activism. Virtual communities, or groups of people
   informally bound together by shared expertise, synthesise this Internet
   evolution and the Web 2.0 technology. Users increasingly want to engage
   online with one another and with organisations of all kinds. These novel
   Internet-based technologies dominate the new business models of the
   digital economy giving companies radical new ways to harvest the talents
   of innovators working outside corporate boundaries. One of the most
   illustrative examples of this new trend is the Open Source Software
   (OSS) projects development. This paper aims to analyse the structure and
   topology of the virtual community supporting one of the most
   successfully OSS projects, Linux. The objective is to provide
   conclusions for being successful in the development of future virtual
   communities. As companies learn to manage these virtual communities,
   they will develop smarter and faster ways to create value through them.
   Design/methodology/approach - The interactions of the virtual community
   members of an ARM-embedded Linux project website is analysed through
   social network analysis techniques. The participants' activity is
   studied and some conclusions about the participation features are
   obtained using the Gini coefficient. In particular, a participation
   inequality behaviour or a concentration on a small number of developers
   is clearly observed.
   Findings - The paper deals with the guidelines that virtual communities
   should follow to be successful. Results about the structure of a
   successful virtual community and its time evolution are provided to
   determine the mentioned guidelines.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to a
   particular virtual community engaged with the development of the
   ARM-embedded Linux OSS. Other successful virtual communities can be
   analysed, and the conclusions could be compared. Anyway, the proposed
   analysis methodology can be extended to other virtual communities.
   Originality/value - The paper fulfils the development and features of
   Internet virtual communities to be successful. Results have important
   implications over the development of new software business models based
   on virtual communities and open source software. Contributions about the
   best organisation of virtual communities leading to a successful
   development of the underlying project are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Riding on the back of the rapid expansion of the Internet, online
   virtual worlds which combine the prowess of interactive digital media
   and social networks have attained a high level of acceptance among the
   Net Generation users. This development prompted researchers to look into
   the potential of embedding learning contents into virtual worlds to
   create virtual learning environments (VLEs) that suit the need of the
   Net Generation learners. However, the special characteristics of virtual
   worlds that make them popular also pose great challenges to educators
   who wish to leverage their power. These challenges call for more
   sophisticated human computer interaction (HCI) mechanisms to assist
   learners to navigate the intriguing landscape of VLEs. In this paper, we
   demonstrate a teachable remembrance agent which acts as an intelligent
   user interface to provide innovative ways for students to interact with
   VLEs.}},

   could a phase-shift effect contribute to improved image-quality for

Abstract = {{Purpose. The aim of this study was to determine whether a
   high-resolution digital radiography system that was originally developed
   for mammography could be used for general radiographic purposes by means
   of a phantom test.
   Materials and methods. This system includes an X-ray tube with a smaller
   focal point than is generally used for general radiography, and a
   computed radiography (CR) system to provide the highest spatial
   resolution. The imaging object and CR plate are intentionally separated
   to capture an edge-enhancing effect that is the result of a phase-shift
   (phase contrast) of the X-rays.
   Results. This system showed greater sharpness and spatial resolution, as
   well as an equal level of contrast resolution compared to a conventional
   X-ray system. The image sharpness in this system appears to be at least
   partially attributable to an edge-enhancing effect produced by the
   phase-contrast effect, which occurs when X-rays pass the surfaces of
   objects.
   Conclusion. This technique may be suitable for clinical use and may
   contribute to improved image-quality in general radiography.}},

Abstract = {{This paper puts forward a novel concept of tetrahedron model of chart
   cartography error analysis and quality control which is necessary for
   introducing user to the former triangle model of error analysis and
   quality control, i.e. Reality-Producer-Chart-User. For the human being,
   high quality does not necessarily represent high accuracy, but represent
   a concept that what is fit for use. Classical cartography error theory
   coming from physics and mathematics will no longer meet the requirement
   of users, so the new concept deriving from communication and cognition
   sciences will compensate for the research. New model should adopt
   thought science which is from humanities. In tetrahedron model, producer
   refers to people who provide data, who manipulate data and who check
   data. User is considered as a quality controlling factor which has equal
   status with producer. Data quality control has changed from
   ``Check-Driving{''} to ``User-Driving{''}. The words for quality
   assessment change from error or uncertainty to practicability or
   applicability. Reality here refers to ocean and coastal zone. From a new
   viewpoint, the chart has been redefined as chart set. And characters of
   chart differing from terrain map and the specific quality assessment
   indexes have been discussed. Some innovative ideas of the research work
   were as follows: 1) Establishing a new tetrahedron model of quality
   control. The relationship between error and quality assessment was
   analyzed and practicability was adopted to assess the quality of chart
   product. 2) Defining the chart set. After changing from paper chart to
   electronic chart or digital chart, chart product become a set of
   digitizing collecting, storing and renewing data. 3) Building up the
   user assessment system of the chart product, which would perform
   real-time chart quality control.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and realisation of a low-cost automated
   internet geoinformation service, named Kingston Automated Geoinformation
   Service (KAGIS), that provides the United Kingdom's academic community
   with fully processed quasi-realistic GIS maps of spatial population
   distribution, known as dasymetric maps. The key innovative aspect of the
   service is that it undertakes spatio-temporal interpolation for census
   area statistics and enable users to overcome the difficulties associated
   with inconsistent boundaries used by different census events. It is
   designed and programmed to carry out live, on-demand online integration
   of Edinburgh University's geospatial data service (EDINA) and Manchester
   University's census data service (MIMAS), to automatically geoprocess
   and deliver digital dasymetric maps for any of 2001, 1991 and 1981
   census years and any area of interest at all census area levels in the
   United Kingdom as per user's request. The system is capable of
   automatically handling large GIS datasets in accordance with users
   issuing requests. The system unleashes a large amount of geospatial and
   census data held in these formerly isolated digital repositories and
   carries out all necessary data processing to generate the requested
   spatial information products in a novel workflow. The online data
   transmission, retrieval, integration, processing and generation of
   quasi-realistic spatial population (dasymetric) GIS maps at the English
   county level typically take 2 minutes.
   KAGIS enables census data special interest group in the UK's academic
   community to access and utilise this newly available geoprocessing
   service for a wide range of applications, such as analysing population
   changes over the time and undertaking fine resolution detailed spatial
   population estimation for planning at various scales and areas of
   interest. Online interactive selection of datasets and the entire
   procedure of online heterogeneous data integration, areal interpolation
   and data processing for dasymetric maps with ancillary landuse maps
   derived from remotely sensed imagery are automated to offer end users
   opportunities to simply follow a few instructive checkbox and
   button-clicking steps to obtain resultant digital dasymetric maps.
   The design of KAGIS adopts the service oriented design architecture to
   couple the latest web portal technology and ArcGIS Server technology to
   realise the new secure internet geoinformation service with a set of
   specially designed and coded geoprocessing programs performing coherent
   chained actions in a novel workflow and it is programmed as a novel
   stateful application to be able to provide the runtime online data
   integration, processing and resultant GIS map delivering service to
   concurrent internet users.
   Novel aspects of KAGIS include its operation as a new fully integrated
   service system that acts as an automated online integrator, data
   processor, e-content generator and secure service deliverer. The system
   innovatively carries out live, flawless, on-demand combination of
   formerly isolated geospatial and census data-only repositories and
   services according to user requests. The novel design of coherently
   chained modules and workflow enables fully automated processes for
   real-time digital data acquisition, real-time data processing for
   on-demand GIS model generation and service delivery.
   The whole and parts of the secure online service technology of KAGIS are
   generic and universally applicable in any countries in the world. With
   the process of globalisation and development, all countries have been
   and are undergoing significant development and change. The technology
   and know-how experience of KAGIS can assist any country in the world to
   develop its secure internet GIS services, integrating geographical
   information for specific decision making systems as well as providing
   low-cost and efficient ways to process and utilise existing geographical
   data for a multitude of purposes such as development planning.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores antecedents to sector based e-business use. Sectoral
   e-business studies are valuable to understand the absorption of
   e-business in different economic sectors, the specific challenges of
   using e-business across different sectors and the potential of different
   sectors to integrate into the global digital value chain. Drawing from
   the perceived e-readiness model (PERM) and the Organizational,
   Technological and Environmental (OTE) framework, an integrated
   e-business use model is proposed. Data were collected from a survey of
   firms in the horticulture sector in Australia. Empirical analysis of the
   integrated model show that e-business use within the horticulture sector
   is at the initial state of maturity. In terms of the antecedent factors,
   this research shows that technology competence, financial commitment,
   perceived environmental e-readiness and organizational size are
   influential factors that directly affect e-business use. Perceived
   organizational e-readiness has an indirect influence on e-business use.
   The implications of these findings to both global IT management and
   e-business research are discussed. Practitioners such as governments,
   horticulture associations, growers and growers associations and digital
   marketplace operators, through understanding these factors affecting
   e-business use, can make effective decisions to develop their support,
   capabilities and offerings respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Hazard and risk maps are tools for both mitigating against risk and
   informing and preparing the general public. Recent studies have
   highlighted that volcanic hazard and risk maps used during emergencies
   can be difficult to interpret. Our research focuses on evaluating and
   improving the efficacy of currently available maps of Stromboli volcano
   on Stromboli island (Italy) for the communication of volcanic hazard and
   risk information. Stromboli is an active volcano characterised by
   persistent explosive activity, sporadic lava effusions and landslides on
   the volcanos northwestern flank, which sometimes generates tsunamis,
   most recently in 2002. This study used semi-structured interviews
   conducted with local legislators, administrators and `enforcers' to
   understand their perceptions of available risk information; to evaluate
   the respondents mental spatial maps; and to determine the most important
   components in encouraging risk-reducing behaviour in a hazardous
   situation. Respondents were asked to evaluate a contour map, an aerial
   photograph, a digital elevation model (DEM) and an innovative 3D tsunami
   risk map. These results enabled the development of different volcanic
   risk maps for use by `experts' and `tourists' using a contour map and a
   DEM (Scale 1:12.500). A 3D map focused on the tsunami risk (Scale
   1:6.500) area was also produced.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The present retrospective analysis was performed to assess the
   effectiveness of sialoendoscopic treatment of chronic obstructive
   parotids.
   Materials and Methods: The study group included 87 parotid glands with
   stricture as the only cause of gland obstruction. After sialographic and
   sialoendoscopic evaluation, sialoendoscopic 4-step surgical treatments
   were performed. The treatment protocol was designed.
   Results: Sialoendoscopy proved to be a successful procedure in 94.7\% of
   the affected parotid glands we treated.
   Conclusion: The minimally invasive technique of sialoendoscopy for
   treatment of strictures of the salivary glands could be a welcome
   innovation, helping to avoid radical surgical treatment of salivary
   gland disease. (C) 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial

Title = {{Sales Forecasting in High-Technology Markets: A Utility-Based Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{115-129}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Accurate sales projections are of vital importance to the profitability
   and long-term survival of high-tech companies. This is especially true
   in the growth stage of product innovation, because major investments and
   marketing decisions are made in this phase. By examining recent
   empirical studies focusing on consumer behavior in high-technology
   markets, several factors are identified that can affect individual
   buying decisions and aggregate sales, namely, interpersonal
   communication, democratization of innovation, direct and indirect
   network effects, forward-looking behavior, and consumer heterogeneity.
   Against this background the diffusion-modeling and the utility-based
   approach are reviewed in terms of their basic conception and their
   applicability to the markets concerned. Based on this investigation a
   sales forecasting model for high-tech products, specifically in the
   growth stage, is developed. The model has a utility-theoretic background
   and a logistic structure. Since data are scarce in this early stage of
   the product life cycle two versions of the new approach are discussed,
   an extended version considering forward-looking behavior and a more
   parsimonious ({''}myopic'') one. The performance of the new model is
   demonstrated using real sales data on the CD player, the DVD
   player/recorder, and the digital camera market. The empirical
   comparisons include alternative specifications of the Bass diffusion
   model as well as a proportional hazard model and consist of two steps.
   First, the models are checked as to whether they are able to represent
   the sales data at all. It is shown that both versions of the proposed
   model are at least equivalent, if not superior, to the models used as
   benchmarks in terms of fit. In the next step, the models are applied to
   predict future sales in the three markets. The resulting forecasts show
   that the proposed model performs significantly better than its
   benchmarks. Its parsimony enables reliable predictions, even in cases,
   where only short time series are available for parameter estimation. The
   model is able to anticipate decreasing diffusion rates as they occur at
   the end of the growth stage and, thus, helps to avoid overoptimistic
   sales forecasts, which may cause severe economic damages. The new
   approach is easy to calibrate and can be applied without specialized
   econometric expertise.}},

Abstract = {{A new protocol for making an immediate provisional eyeglasses-supported
   nasal prosthesis is presented that uses laser scanning, computer-aided
   design/computer-aided manufacturing procedures, and rapid prototyping
   techniques, reducing time and costs while increasing the quality of the
   final product With this protocol, the eyeglasses were digitized, and the
   relative position of the nasal prosthesis was planned and evaluated in a
   virtual environment without any try-in appointment This innovative
   method saves time, reduces costs, and restores the patient's aesthetic
   appearance after a disfiguration caused by ablation of the nasal pyramid
   better than conventional restoration methods Moreover, the digital model
   of the designed nasal epithesis can be used to develop a definitive
   prosthesis anchored to osseointegrated craniofacial implants}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to contribute to contemporary debates about
   screenwriting as a process of developing the screen idea; about the ways
   in which formatting conventions from an earlier era of cinema may
   restrict innovation in screenwriting; and about shifting practices of
   screenwriting in a digital era in which images and sound play a
   potentially more significant role. Additionally, it questions the use of
   terms such as `blueprint' to describe the relationship between the
   screenplay and the proposed film that it represents. The article draws
   on the author's body of practice-led research as a writer and director
   of feature films and documentaries, as well as histories of
   screenwriting, film production, comics and the graphic arts.}},

Abstract = {{The open source movement has grown steadily and matured in recent years,
   and this growth has been mirrored by a rise in open source related
   research. The objective of this paper is to pause and reflect on the
   state of the field. We start by conducting a comprehensive literature
   review of open source research, and organize the resulting 618
   peer-reviewed articles into a taxonomy. Elements of this taxonomy are
   defined and described. We then draw on a number of existing
   categorization schemes to develop a framework to situate open source
   research within a wider nomological network. Building on concepts from
   systems theory, we propose a holistic framework of open source research.
   This framework incorporates current research, as represented by the
   taxonomy, identifies gaps and areas of overlap, and charts a path for
   future work.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},

Pages = {{52-57}},
Abstract = {{Inspired by the design method of digital image, based on gamut weaves
   design and the established weave database, a study has been carried out
   to reform the traditional design approach of jacquard textiles via the
   deployment of digital-layered combination design mode towards the
   creation of digital jacquard. To this end, the structural design method
   has been reinvented under layered design mode. This article presents an
   innovative design method called `full-colour' compound structure design
   by which digital jacquard fabric is made possible by non-backed
   structure. This `full-colour' technique offers a novel-colour shading
   effect on the surface of a digital jacquard fabric where the colour
   threads juxtapose in an even orderly fashion, e. g. 1:1, 1:1:1:1, etc.
   Moreover, this innovative design approach befits well the
   computer-programmed design that meets the technical requirement of
   balanced interlacement, and thus fabrics produced by this method pose no
   problem in mass production.}},

   The Case of Computer Science}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{157-172}},
Abstract = {{Generally, Computer Science (CS) classifications are inconsistent in
   taxonomy strategies. It is necessary to develop CS taxonomy research to
   combine its historical perspective, its current knowledge and its
   predicted future trends - including all breakthroughs in information and
   communication technology: In this paper we have analyzed the ACM
   Computing Classification System (CCS) by means of visualization maps.
   The important achievement of current work is an effective visualization
   of classified documents from the ACM Digital Library: From the technical
   point of view, the innovation lies in the parallel use of analysis
   units: (sub)classes and keywords as well as a spherical 3D information
   surface. We have compared both the thematic and semantic maps of
   classified documents and results presented in Table 1. Furthermore, the
   proposed new method is used for content-related evaluation of the
   original scheme. Summing up: we improved an original ACM classification
   in the Computer Science domain by means of visualization.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the first lab-on-a-chip platform for complete mammalian
   cell culture. The new method is powered by digital microfluidics (DMF),
   a technique in which nanolitre-sized droplets are manipulated on an open
   surface of an array of electrodes. This is the first application of DMF
   to adherent cell culture and analysis, and more importantly, represents
   the first microfluidic platform capable of implementing all of the steps
   required for mammalian cell culture-cell seeding, growth, detachment,
   and re-seeding on a fresh surface. Three key innovations were required
   to implement complete cell culture on a microfluidic device: (1) a
   technique for growing cells on patterned islands (or ``adhesion
   pads{''}) positioned on an array of DMF actuation electrodes; (2) a
   method for rapidly and efficiently exchanging media and other reagents
   on cells grown on adhesion pads; and (3) a system capable of detachment
   and collection of cells from an (old) origin site and delivery to a
   (new) destination site for subculture. The new technique was applied to
   cells from several different lines which were seeded and repeatedly
   subcultured for weeks at a time in 150 nL droplets. Cells handled in
   this manner exhibited growth characteristics and morphology comparable
   to those cultured in standard tissue culture vessels. To illustrate an
   application for this system, a microfluidic method was developed to
   implement transient transfection-we propose that the combination of this
   technique with multigenerational culture allows for ``on-demand{''}
   generation of transiently transfected cells. Broadly, we anticipate that
   the automated cell microculture technique presented here will be useful
   in myriad applications that would benefit from automated mammalian cell
   culture.}},

Abstract = {{Reflective practice is an integral component of a teacher's classroom
   success (Zeichner and Liston, 1996; Valli, 1997). There is a need to
   further develop a more effective and efficient process that encourages
   reflective practice. Recent technological video advancements have
   provided tools to support new research. This chapter presents an
   innovative process that proposes to improve teacher reflective practice
   by using an enhanced video analysis technique. The findings suggest the
   video-enhanced reflection process provides solutions to the barriers
   that have traditionally prevented reflection from being meaningful and
   long lasting. The qualitative analysis suggests that video-enhanced
   reflection had a positive impact on teacher reflective abilities.}},

Abstract = {{The theory and lessons of knowledge exchange, in both a physical and
   virtual environment, suggest a framework for understanding the specific
   requirements for a digital design class in Second Life. Through teaching
   and observing students who were asked to complete a machinima project,
   our research provided examples of the strengths and the weaknesses of
   using Second Life for knowledge exchange. Learning is a process of
   creating knowledge, and so we observed the input and the output of the
   process. A literature review of knowledge creation considering the
   exchange of both tacit and explicit knowledge exchange informs our
   theory. Teaching occurred both remotely and, in person, in a media lab
   that included a physical presence of 33 students using networked
   computers and also allowed virtual presence in Second Life. The students
   also experienced a mixed-reality environment in which they collaborated
   sometimes in close physical proximity and sometimes only together in the
   virtual space. The exchange of tacit knowledge in a shared physical
   environment was regarded as a benchmark for knowledge exchange in Second
   Life, and we will conclude this article with some suggestions how that
   could be more closely simulated.}},

Abstract = {{`The way we are now' is an innovative photo-ethnographic project. It
   originates from both practice led research into creativity, technology
   and embodied mind funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council,
   and research into wellbeing, funded by the Economic and Social Research
   Council. The research into creativity is underpinned by the writings of
   Merleau-Ponty, including his claim `that modes of thought correspond to
   technical methods', and that to use Goethe's phrase `what is inside is
   also outside', a position similar to that taken by social
   anthropologists seeing technology as skilled practice. The research into
   activity and well-being in daily life uses the experience sampling
   method (ESM). Traditionally, the method uses questionnaire diaries and
   electronic pagers which are pre-programmed to bleep at randomly selected
   times during the day to indicate response times. The research discussed
   here uses a mobile phone to indicate responses eight times a day for
   seven consecutive days, extended to include images taken at each signal
   with the mobile phone/camera, which has not been done before. The
   research extends both the subject matter of digital fine art, and the
   portrayal of subjective well-being and quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{AT\&T's Bell Laboratories produced a prolific number of innovative
   digital art and experimental color systems between 1965 and 1984.
   However, due to repressive regulation, this work was hidden from the

   creative work not related to telephone technologies, the atmosphere had
   changed so dramatically that despite a relaxation of regulation,
   cutting-edge projects were abandoned. This paper discusses the struggles

Title = {{Preparing for a Linked Data Enterprise}},
Booktitle = {{LINKING ENTERPRISE DATA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Pages = {{51-64}},
Abstract = {{The cost of building a business application in the early 1990's that was
   both resilient and could handle additional data sources, let alone third
   party content, was many times the cost of building a simple application.
   The use of Web tools and techniques has changed that. The use of Web
   architecture within enterprises started in the mid-1990's and continues
   today. The introduction of Web architecture within the enterprise has
   had many benefits which include shortened development cycles, improved
   product innovation and increased product and service quality. The
   Semantic Web, a concept introduced in 2000, introduced the concept of
   machine-understandable content. The benefit of having computers (or
   computer programs) understand content is to retrieve and present more
   relevant information to people. Linked Data, a concept introduced in
   2006, is the next evolution and uses the Semantic Web to link related
   but previously unconnected content in new and meaningful ways. Later
   chapters in this book discuss both early and current efforts to showcase
   enterprise data and drive new value and insights.
   In a world that contains vast amounts of digital data, Linked Data is
   emerging as the scalable and generalized approach to link previously
   unconnected information. This chapter highlights the characteristics of
   an organization that is prepared to embrace this decentralized approach
   for wrapping and exposing content for data discovery. Linked data brings
   us closer to the benefits touted by proprietary data management and
   analysis vendors, but in an open, non-proprietary and ground-up manner.
   The successes enjoyed by the early adopters suggest that Linked Data
   techniques are likely to have a major impact on enterprise architectures
   in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{The question of creativity comes from ancient times The etymological
   understanding of creativity is based on perception that creativity is a
   person's ability to find something new It explains creativity as a
   result of divergent thinking of what is concurrent with originality and
   novelty; the condition of suitability is not necessarily applied. Most
   often creativity is related to literature and arts, but today's science
   agrees more and more that creativity is the essence of inventions and
   innovations. So creativity is important to fields like business, the
   economy, architecture, industrial design, graphic arts, mathematics,
   music, physics, chemistry, natural sciences, engineering, educology etc
   The economy is being created on basis of information and communication
   technologies The new information context and digital technologies open
   new spaces and reduce the costs One of the main features of a creative
   economy is the consumption of information while creating one's own
   context The impact of the creative economy is biggest not through
   traditional creative industries but through the exercise of skills and
   business models creating organizational value and managing intellectual
   capital Organizations are becoming more dependent on creativity because
   traditional raw materials are being changed with intellectual stock}},

   grassroots inventors as supply side community to invent what country
   needs, moreover help them to commercialize their inventions, would give
   opportunity to overcome lack of inventions and bridging the cognitive

Abstract = {{Advances in medical imaging technologies are assisting radiologists in
   more accurate diagnoses. This paper details an autostereoscopic static
   volumetric display, called CSpace (R), capable of projecting
   three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging data in 3D world coordinates.
   Using this innovative technology, the displayed 3D data set can be
   viewed in the optical medium from any perspective angle without the use
   of any viewing aid. The design of CSpace (R) allows a volume rendering
   of the surface and the interior of any organ of the human body. As a
   result, adjacent tissues can be better monitored, and disease diagnoses
   can be more accurate. In conjunction with CSpace (R) hardware, we have
   developed a software architecture that can read digital imaging and
   communication in medicine (DICOM) files whether captured by ultrasound
   devices, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT)
   scanners. The software acquires the imaging parameters from the files'
   header, and then applies the parameters on the rendered 3D object to
   display it in the exact form it was captured.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing molecular contamination (MC) at part-per-billion (ppbV) or
   part-per-trillion volume (pptV) levels in cleanroom air and purge gas
   lines is essential to protect lithography and metrology tools optics and
   components. Current lithography and metrology tool manufacturer's
   specifications require testing of some contaminants down to single digit
   pptV levels. Ideally this analysis would be performed with an on-line
   analyzer (capable of providing almost instant results): the best
   analyzers currently available are only capable of providing 100 pptV
   detection. Liquid impinger sampling has been the dominant sample
   collection method for sub ppbV acidic and basic MC analysis. Impinger
   sampling suffers from some inherent problems that can dramatically
   reduce the collection efficiency such as analyte solubility and
   evaporative losses. An innovative solid-state trapping technology has
   been recently developed by SAES Pure Gas along with the CollectTorr
   sampling system. NIST traceable gas phase standards have been used to
   compare the collection efficiency of the traditional impinger technology
   to that of the solid state trapping method. Results varied greatly for
   the different acid gases with sulfur dioxide showing comparable
   collection efficiencies while hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid
   showed much lower recoveries in the impingers than the solid-state
   traps. Ammonia collection efficiencies were slightly higher for the
   solid state traps and were improved in the impingers when an acidified
   solution was used as the collection media. The use of solid-state traps,
   besides being much simpler from both the handling and logistical stand
   point, eliminates the analyte solubility and evaporation problems
   frequently seen with the impinger sampling.}},

   signal quality to cost and footprint, from control, monitoring and alarm
   (CMA) systems to built-in test (BIT) features. Significant performance,
   cost and footprint advantages can be realized in terminals of all sizes,
   large, medium and small. A Digital IF initiative can yield early and
   disproportionately high yields on a modest investment because no new
   technology is required to begin the migration to all-digital MILSATCOM
   terminals. Such a migration offers clear paths to unprecedented growth
   of services to the warfighter. Work is now in progress to study digital
   IF architectures and to experimentally prototype digital terminal
   systems, subsystems and signal formats {[}2].
   The overwhelming potential of Digital IF for MILSATCOM terminals, and
   recent progress in its development, both beg the question: What must the
   MILSATCOM community do now in order to achieve the earliest and maximum
   return on a modest Digital IF investment? This paper addresses this
   question by considering MILSATCOM terminal Concept of Operations
   (CONOPS) and digital IF standardization. For purposes of this
   manuscript, MILSATCOM ``CONOPS{''} is addressed in a broad sense. This
   paper considers a broad range of terminal characteristics and
   operational aspects. These include architecture, RF performance,
   equipment complement, terminal installation, certification, network
   planning, equipment configuration, security, testing, network monitoring
   and technology migration.
   The purpose of broadly addressing CONOPS is to feed the strategy of
   appropriately optimizing an open commercial interface standard for
   Digital IF in MILSATCOM terminals. A standard is required for ensuring
   plug-and-play interoperability of terminal equipment from all vendors
   over all terminal platforms. A single uniform open commercial standard
   not only maximizes the advantage to the community, the operator and the
   warfighter; it also fosters innovation and competition among vendors,
   increasing the number and commitment level of commercial stakeholders.
   The benefit is additional compound improvement of service and value to
   the community and to the warfighter.
   It is to these ends that the process of developing and introducing an
   appropriate digital IF standard is considered. The single most important
   step right now towards quickly achieving the compelling advantages of
   the all-digital terminal is the development and community-wide
   acceptance of a single common open commercial interface standard. This
   paper reports progress to date and the way forward towards achieving
   such a standard within the MILSATCOM community.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology provides a distinctive,
   innovative, accurate and cost effective approach to forest inventory.
   ALS data is used for information extraction with respect to the
   detection of tree characteristics like height, diameter at breast height
   (dbh) and crown diameter. Also, timber volume and biomass can be
   estimated from this information. Forest studies and applications aim to
   achieve the operational fast methods and reliable results. It is
   possible if the data contain dense point clouds. The first step to
   generate high resolution canopy height model (CHM) is to normalize
   digital surface model (DSM) by subtracting DTM from DSM. Thus, CHM
   contains the same X, Y coordinates as DTM and tree height as Z value.
   CHM accuracy is mostly affected by the accuracy of DTM and DSM. The
   interpolation method in high density point does not cause considerable
   error while corresponding filtering methods have the most effect. Recent
   studies show that, moderate to dense forest, estimations tend to
   underestimate tree height. In this work a technique based on the
   searching of local maximum canopy height is used to detect individual
   tree with variable window size and shape. The performance of this
   technique for the detection of the tree height is more than 90 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires prevention, monitoring and extinguishing operations in
   complex orography regions present dramatic problems related to hard
   environmental conditions, low population density and accessibility
   limitations affecting interventions activities and damage assessment. In
   the scientific landscape, there are many existing image geo-referencing
   tools. They are developed in order to rectify images, which come from
   fixed ground station and/or satellite platforms. Some of these use
   satellite images to geo-reference complex orography regions and ground
   images to geo-referencing plane orography regions by using Ground
   Control Point collections. The present work describes an innovative
   projective geo-referencing algorithm able to geo-reference complex
   orography regions using a fixed ground station images. Besides, it does
   not need the collection of Ground Control Points, which is a very hard
   task in complex orography environments. The system is an innovative
   image geo-referencing tool conceived for decision support aid for
   wildfire fighting in alpine regions. The system is operating within a
   monitoring system in the Piedmont area (Northwestern Italy) and operates
   on images sensed by a fixed monitoring network. The geo-referencing
   software operates with a geometric and projective algorithm based on a
   Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The algorithm is built up of three main
   modules: sensors lens aberration correction, field-of-view localization
   on DEM, image geo-referencing. As said before, the system does not need
   any collection of Ground Control Points to rectify images. At the output
   of the system, each image pixel is linked to its geographical (Lat/Lon
   and UTM) coordinates. The final products are: a collection of scenario
   images sensed in the visible band; geo-referenced images with
   highlighted alarm pixels with overlaying DEM levels; topographic layers
   containing information to be used in case of intervention. Final images
   contain geo-referenced information about the sensors' field of view on
   the analysed area, hot-spot positions, helicopter landing spot
   positions, water supply positions, intervention squad's localization and
   so on. When fire is detected, the system identifies fire latitude and
   longitude, indicates accessibility to a hot spot and puts in evidence
   territory characteristics and available resources. The algorithm is part
   of a more complex system in which it complements an integrated fire risk
   evaluation and monitoring system, in order to enhance early warning
   processes and intervention and to more efficiently manage damage
   assessment.}},

   all at one quarter the power consumption of competing TFT-LCDs.
   At the heart of this technology is a MEMS-based Digital Micro Shutter
   device that enables the low power, high speed light modulation in the
   Pixtronix displays. The Digital Micro Shutter is a laterally translating
   element, which is supported on a patented dual compliant actuator. Each
   pixel has one shutter, which is used to show all colors in a Field
   Sequential Color, Time Division Multiplexed driving scheme. The pixel
   has been demonstrated over a density range of 100 PPI to 300 PPI. The
   Digital Micro Shutter also supports an optical recycling approach
   through which 60\% of the light from the backlight becomes available to
   the viewer - compared to less than 8\% efficiency in liquid crystal
   based displays. This paper highlights some of the design innovations and
   corresponding display results achieved in the Pixtronix Digital Micro

Abstract = {{Next generation navigation systems demand performance enhancements to
   support new applications with longer range capabilities, provide robust
   operation in severe thermal and vibration environments while
   simultaneously reducing weight, size and power dissipation. Compact,
   inexpensive, advanced guidance components are essential for such
   applications. In particular, Inertial Reference Units (IRUs) that can
   provide high-resolution stabilization and accurate inertial pointing
   knowledge are needed. For space applications, an added requirement is
   radiation hardening up to 300 krad over 5 to 15 years. Manufacturing
   specifications for the radiation-induced losses are not readily
   available and empirical test data is required for all components in
   order to optimize the system performance.
   Interferometric Fiber-Optic Gyroscopes (IFOGs) have proven to be a
   leading technology for tactical and navigational systems. The sensors
   have no moving parts. This ensures high reliability and a long life
   compared to the mechanical gyroscopes and dithered ring laser
   gyroscopes. However, the available architectures limit the potential
   size and cost of the IFOG.
   The work reported here describes an innovative approach for the design,
   fabrication, and testing of the IFOG and enables the production of a
   small, robust and low cost gyro with excellent noise and bandwidth
   characteristics with high radiation tolerance. The development is aimed
   at achieving a sensor volume < 5 cubic inches. The new IFOS gyro uses an
   open loop configuration, utilizes extremely small diameter
   radiation-hard fiber with customized all-digital signal processing. The
   optics is packaged using a combination of highly-integrated optical
   component assemblies with an all-fiber approach that leads to a more
   flexible yet lower cost optical design.
   The IFOS gyro prototypes are implemented using a distributed
   architecture, where the light source, electronics and receiver are
   integrated in an external package, while the sensor head is integrated
   in a robust and environmentally rigid package. The sensor package design
   is compatible with the most severe environmental requirements foreseen
   for the target applications.
   This paper presents the current state-of-the-art performance of the
   prototype gyros and the potential for further reduction of size with
   improved performance. The gyro sample and data rates are extremely high
   and can be close to the modulation frequency (up to 80 kHz). IFOS has
   shown that the noise at high frequencies is not flattening out and
   extremely high bandwidth operation is possible without any degradation
   of the operational stability.
   IFOS has also demonstrated the potential for a future, smaller and
   extremely robust IFOG. The next phase design will include highly
   radiation-resistant integrated, compact optical circuits based on InP
   technology that includes the light source, splitter and receiver in one
   package, a gyro coil that utilizes small diameter, radiation-hard fiber
   and a small fiber phase modulator with > 300 krad radiation tolerance.
   This gyro offers the low noise, low drift, low vibration sensitivity,
   high accuracy, high bandwidth and high radiation tolerance solution
   required for next generation systems. We will present both theoretical
   modeling and experimental results obtained to date.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing demand for new applications and services, continuous
   technology innovation, and rapidly changing economics are motivating the
   creation of a fundamentally new architecture for 21st century digital
   communications. Traditional architectural models for communications have
   been oriented toward meeting exacting requirements of a finite set of
   well-defined services, essentially, a fixed set of modalities, with well
   known and well defined parameters. Consequently, this infrastructure has
   become a restrictive barrier to the deployment of new and enhanced
   services and capabilities. Meeting the many requirement challenges of
   continual change requires replacing traditional rigid designs with those
   that are significantly more flexible and customizable. Often, advances
   in networking are measured only by increased capacity, and certainly
   substantially more capacity is required. Fortunately, advanced optical
   technologies have been created to support 100 Gbps and higher
   capabilities. However, high capacity alone does not guarantee high
   performance, and high performance capability does not guarantee required
   flexibility and determinism. Today, new types of digital communications
   infrastructure are being designed, prototyped, and provisioned in early
   implementations. These new design provide for a foundation
   infrastructure consisting of discoverable, reconfigurable resources that
   can be dynamically integrated and used. This infrastructure can be
   considered a programmable platform that can support many more services
   than traditional deployments, including highly differentiated and
   deterministic services.}},

Abstract = {{Administering critical resources has never been more difficult that it
   is today. In a changing world of software innovation where major changes

Abstract = {{Tourism industry is paid attention by countries all over the world, and
   considered as the major growth industry in the 21st century. However,
   the present travel agents still only provide consumers with the
   traditional guide methods, such as paper guide manuals. The kind of
   guides, limiting to static text and picture, cannot provide consumers
   with more profound experiences. In the way of guide service, if the
   information and communication technology (ICT) and related products can
   be applied to the concept of tourism environment, not only help the
   tourism industry develop more value-added applications, but enhance the
   consumer's usage and traveling desire.
   The guide in technological tourism, which base on the information and
   communication technology and related products, take point of interest
   (POI) as its content The POI is belonged to the category of digital
   content In the e-commerce transaction model, physical goods has been
   widely discussed and accepted, but delays in the digital publication is
   not implemented because of incomplete commercial transaction model of
   digital publication and protection mechanism of digital rights
   management The study will refer to the mechanisms and standards of
   digital rights management and the concept of e-marketplace and use
   role-based access control for designing the business models for POI
   guide in technological tourism, which can suit a variety of trading
   scenario. And define what the participants and their roles to achieve
   the technological tourism. Provide innovative business model in

   Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) recently completed a joint project to
   provide web access to hydrographic survey metadata from the NOS
   Hydrographic Survey Metadata Database (HSMDB). The new online metadata
   display is offered on the NGDC web site
   (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/bathymetry/hydro.html) under the product
   name Rap Sheet. One innovative feature of this view is a link to the
   growing database of seabed ``bottom type{''} derived from samples
   collected during surveys. These samples provide seabed type annotations
   for nautical charts, but also have applications outside the navigation
   community.
   Bottom samples must have a source with adequate geographic location and
   description. This paper examines the four sources of HSMDB bottom
   samples: Oceanographic Log ``M{''} Sheets, Descriptive Report tabular
   listing, digital feature files in CARIS. hob format, and survey Detached
   Position plots. Preliminary results of the author's ongoing review
   suggest that adequate bottom type information exists for only seventy
   percent of the 8,400 surveys with verified metadata in HSMDB (H08000, c.
   1952, to the present).
   This paper will discuss efforts to address the remaining thirty percent
   of surveys for which there is currently incomplete and/or conflicting
   bottom sample information in the database. Specifically the discussion
   will focus on: 1) Auditing the current post-H08000 HSMDB bottom sample
   holdings, 2) Finding ``M{''} log sheets or survey tabular lists for
   uncorroborated data and resolving NGDC cruise and HSMDB display
   conflict, 3) Extracting bottom sample metadata from modern survey
   digital feature files in CARIS. hob format, and 4) completing all HSMDB
   Rap Sheet bottom samples with matching NGDC display and NOS count from
   the best available source}},

Abstract = {{For today's customers there is a need for integrated products and
   service bundles, e.g. a trip with flights, accommodation, local
   activities, home care during absence etc. To define such bundles, the
   collective intelligence of customers can be used. Thus, more
   customer-oriented products (bundles) can be created and the quality of
   bundles can be increased through the participation of many customers. By
   letting the collective in the form of customers participate, a solution
   is being created, which is better than any solution defined by a single
   company or any individual of the collective. To achieve this, swarm
   intelligence, as it can be found with social insects, is being
   transferred into an innovative digital platform. This platform enables
   customers to work together as a swarm and provides the means for
   customers to collectively design bundles and learn from each other.}},

Abstract = {{Highlighted are novel innovations in hybrid optical design physical
   sensors for extreme environments. Various hybrid design compositions are
   proposed that are suited for a particular sensor application. Examples
   includes combining freespace (wireless) and fiber-optics (wired) for gas
   turbine sensing and combining single crystal and sintered Silicon
   Carbide (SiC) materials for robust extreme environment Coefficent of
   Thermal Expansion (CTE) matched frontend probe design. Sensor signal
   processing also includes the hybrid theme where for example Black-Body
   radiation thermometry (pyrometry) is combined with laser interferometry
   to provide extreme temperature measurements. The hybrid theme also
   operates on the optical device level where a digital optical device such
   as a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) is combined with an analog optical
   device such as an Electronically Controlled Variable Focal Length Lens
   (ECVFL) to deliver a smart and compressive Three Dimensional (3-D)
   imaging sensor for remote scene and object shape capture including both
   ambient light (passive) mode and active laser targeting and receive
   processing. Within a device level, the hybrid theme also operates via
   combined analog and digital control such as within a wavelength-coded
   variable optical delay line. These powerful hybrid design optical
   sensors have numerous applications in engineering and science
   applications from the military to the commercial/industrial sectors.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of research has explored the factors that impede
   established firms' responses to radical technological changes. While it
   is widely acknowledged that managers face pressures from financial
   markets to choose strategies that maximize shareholder value, little
   work in the technological change literature has considered the possible
   influences of public equity markets and the securities analysts who
   mediate them on incumbent firms challenged with technological change. In
   this paper, I begin to address the topic by empirically exploring how
   securities analysts react to the different strategies undertaken by
   incumbent firms faced with radical technological change. I study the
   question in two settings: the shift to digital technology in photography
   and the advent of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology in
   wireline telecommunications. I find evidence that analysts are more
   attentive and positive toward incumbents' strategies that extend and
   preserve the existing technology than toward strategies that respond
   directly to the new technology. In these settings, analysts largely
   ignore incumbents' strategies that directly incorporate the new
   technology for several years following the discontinuity. This study
   provides insights into the nature and direction of analysts' reactions
   to firms' strategies in the context of technological change, and is a
   first step toward better understanding of the potential role of
   analysts' and financial markets in incumbent adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Displaying aspects of ``aboutness{''} by means of non-verbal
   representations, such as notations, symbols, or icons, or through rich
   visual displays, such as those of topic maps, can facilitate
   meaning-making, putting information in context, and situating it
   relative to other information. As the design of displays of web-enabled
   information has struggled to keep pace with a bourgeoning body of
   digital content, increasingly innovative approaches to organizing search
   results have warranted greater attention. Using Worldmapper as an
   example, this paper examines cartograms - a derivative of the data map
   which adds dimensionality to the geographic positioning of information -
   as one approach to representing and managing subject content, and to
   tracking the diffusion of knowledge across place and time.}},

Abstract = {{Self organization is the property of sonic natural systems to organize
   themselves without a central coordination unit to perform specific
   tasks. Swarm Intelligence is a bioinspired paradigm coming from the
   observation of natural swarms, such as honey bees and bird flocks.
   Swarms exploit self organization to achieve coordination, speed-up and
   fault tolerance. This interesting paradigm has been applied in different
   research fields, mainly in robotics and optimization algorithms. Our
   pioneering studies about the application of this powerful paradigm to
   digital VLSI systems demonstrated that Swarm Intelligence can be applied
   to the design of scalable computing architectures composed of a large
   set of self-coordinated hardware agents. In this Chapter we present this
   approach with a review of our research works in this field from the
   first explorations to the latest results: the FPGA implementation of a
   coprocessing architecture expressly conceived resorting to the Swarm
   Intelligence principles. Some experimental results are presented to
   evaluate the main features of this innovative approach, which shows
   interesting performance improvements without any programming effort and
   without complex tools for compilation and mapping, compared to other
   state-of-the-art coprocessing architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Past research suggests that men perceive women with large pupils as
   especially attractive. We employed an innovative methodology to examine
   whether this effect influences consumer decision-making. A popular
   psychology book was published with two slightly different front covers.
   Both covers contained the same photograph of a woman; however, the
   woman's pupils on one cover were digitally enlarged. Readers indicated
   whether they were male or female, and whether they possessed the cover
   with small or large pupils. A significantly greater percentage of men
   than women had chosen the cover with the large pupils. None of the
   participants who attempted to guess the nature of the experiment was
   correct, suggesting that the influence exerted by pupil size was
   unconscious. These findings provide further support for the notion that
   people's judgments are unconsciously swayed by pupil size, and
   demonstrate that this effect operates in a real world setting.}},

Abstract = {{Electronics is under development in this country in an organized and
   institutional way since the beginning of 30-ties of the previous
   century. It grew up from electrical engineering of weak currents and its
   first name used popularly was communications. It was time when
   television was born and the radio was maturing. Electronics is a branch
   of research and technology which deals with generation and processing of
   electrical and electromagnetic signals. A subject of telecommunications
   is signal transmission for a distance. Electronics and
   telecommunications (ET) includes or is combined with other branches
   like: microelectronics, radioelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics,
   acoustoelectronics, magnetronics, bioelectronics, energoelectronics,
   material engineering, semiconductor physics, automation and robotics,
   mechatronics and microsystems, informatics, teleinformatics, software
   engineering and other. Devices and functional systems of ET such as
   computers, data warehouses, cell phones, TV sets, Internet, GPS are
   build of electronic components and circuits. ET is a branch which
   belongs to hi-tech area, where the products gather a large load of
   knowledge of value overcoming frequently the price of work and material.
   ET has recently turned to an active participant of the processes of
   generation, storing, processing, transportation, distribution and usage
   of knowledge in the society. ET started to create artificial
   intelligence, co-creates intellectual property, searches for knowledge
   in big data sets, aids medicine, extends virtual/augmented reality,
   builds Internet of persons and things, strengthens security, protects
   natural environment, facilitates our life, aids our decisions, activates
   individuals, equalizes chances, provides convenient personal
   communications and access to data, starts building a penetrating
   ubiquitous infrastructure, ceases to be only a branch of technology,
   grows into the social space, touches culture, sociology, psychology and
   art. Such an important role of ET is combined with the existence in the
   society of an adequate infrastructure which recreates the full
   development cycle of high technology embracing: people, institutions,
   finances and logistics, in this also science, higher education,
   education, continuous training, dissemination and outreach, professional
   social environment, legal basis, political support and lobbying,
   innovation structures, applications, industry and economy. The digest of
   chosen development tendencies in ET was made here from the academic
   perspective, in a wider scale and on this background the national one,
   trying to situate this branch in the society, determine its changing
   role to build a new technical infrastructure of a society based on
   knowledge, a role of builder of many practical gadgets facilitating
   life, a role of a big future integrator of today's single bricks into
   certain more useful unity. This digest does not have a character of a
   systematic analysis of ET. It is a kind of an arbitrary utterance of the
   authors inside their field of competence. The aim of this paper is to
   take an active part in the discussion of the academic community in this
   country on the development strategy of ET, choice of priorities for
   cyclically rebuilding economy, in competitive environments. The review
   paper was initiated by the Committee of Electronics and
   Telecommunications of Polish Academy of Sciences and was published in
   Polish as introductory chapter of a dedicated expertise, printed in a
   book format. This version makes the included opinions available for a

Abstract = {{Electronics is under development in this country in an organized and

   century. It grew up from electrical engineering of weak currents and its

   television was born and the radio was maturing. Electronics is a branch
   of research and technology which deals with generation and processing of
   electrical and electromagnetic signals. A subject of telecommunications
   is signal transmission for a distance. Electronics and
   telecommunications (ET) includes or is combined with other branches
   like: microelectronics, radioelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics,
   acoustoelectronics, magnetronics, bioelectronics, energoelectronics,
   material engineering, semiconductor physics, automation and robotics,
   mechatronics and microsystems, informatics, teleinformatics, software
   engineering and other. Devices and functional systems of ET such as

Abstract = {{An embedded system, a digital electronic system being embedded in a
   larger device, is the system to be configured to fulfill specific
   demands of customers from some market segmentations. This nature
   complicates the design of an embedded system itself. Traditional
   embedded system marketers usually defined the systems based on their
   intuition, which could be subjective and misleading. To fulfill
   different customers' demands from various market segmentations, the
   concept of ``user-centered design{''} can be leveraged. Thus, this
   research aims to resolve this issue by introducing a novel fuzzy
   multiple criteria decision making (FMCDM) based embedded system design
   method by introducing the concept of ``emotional design{''}. By using
   this method, customer needs can be elicited through explorations of
   their emotions. The fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (FAHP) will be
   leveraged for deriving the relative weights. Further, considering the
   characteristic of inter-dependences between criteria, the non-additive
   fuzzy integral method will be introduced to aggregate the performance
   scores on each component of the embedded system platform. In this paper,
   an empirical study on an embedded system design of a handset being
   designed by one of the world's largest IT (information technology)
   manufacturers will be leveraged for demonstrating the feasibility of
   this framework. A satisfying mobile phone can be designed based on the
   newly proposed FMCDM framework. And this methodology can be used to
   configure any embedded system to be embedded in other consumer
   electronics products.}},

Abstract = {{With great efforts over the past two decades, Taiwan has become one of
   leading countries in E-government practice. People have benefited from
   the efficiency of E-government services and Taiwan government will
   develop the next stage E-government, which is integrated, innovative,
   real time, interactive, and personalized, to establish a virtually
   trusted society that connects each citizen via the Internet. At 1:47
   a.m. on September 21, 1999, a massive earthquake measuring 7.3 on the
   Richter scale struck central Taiwan. This earthquake is a terrible
   disaster that causes tragic loss of life, severe property damage, and
   sharp decline in living standards and the regional prosperity. The
   earthquakes of the last decade also brought to light the importance of
   Earthquake Disaster Management (EDM) operations. As a result, there is
   an urgent call for applying digital services, broadening geographical
   service scope, enriching service options, and lowering costs for the
   reconstruction areas. This study employed the Analytic Hierarchy Process
   (AHP) to analyze the Taiwan government's supply and demand of the
   information services in the reconstruction areas to heed the call for
   reducing uneven opportunities on availability of information and
   telecommunication technology.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile learning development is, most of the time, the privilege of
   practitioners with support from a technical team. The deep learning
   curve involved understanding the native mobile operating systems and
   developing mobile applications keeps most of the non-technical teachers
   and researchers away. We explore what innovation mobile technologies and
   Web 2.0 can bring that allows teachers to author their own mobile
   learning environment and how best we can leverage the emerging
   technologies to better prepare students for the digital world. We hope
   our study will help build teachers' confidence and skills through
   learning the affordance of mobile Web 2.0 technologies in the process of
   developing mobile learning environments for their courses. In this paper
   we will describe our design-based research in our efforts to 1) develop
   a generic mobile learning based platform for all (MEPA) that allows easy
   access to device's core functions as well as web-based learning contents
   and social tools; 2) encourage instructors without a programming
   background to implement these functions for teaching and learning; 3)
   document lessons learned to inform future research.}},

Abstract = {{The economic challenges confronting governments have been exacerbated by
   the recession while the social challenges are ever more complex.
   Governments as drivers of social and economic development seek
   innovative ways of confronting the challenges of inclusion,
   accessibility and power distribution. EGovernment interventions have
   been designed to communicate information, deliver services and offer
   citizens and businesses additional avenues to interact with and
   participate in government. Accordingly, eGovernment is perceived to
   increase government efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency, improve
   citizen-government interactions and foster social and economic
   development. However, a `digital divide' is evident in both the economic
   and social spheres, with problems being particularly intense in rural
   areas. Consequently, coherent government policies and strategies are
   needed to ensure that digital technologies and services reach all
   regions and socioeconomic groups. To achieve the digital dividend,
   long-term vision, targeted policies and consistent, even-handed policy
   implementation are required. This paper examines the role of eGovernment
   in social and economic development in rural areas. It adopts a
   predominantly qualitative approach to explore the nature of social and
   economic development problems in rural areas and the potential of ICT as
   a government tool to counter those challenges. The paper begins by
   reviewing conceptualisations of eGovernment, the perceived benefits for
   social and economic development and the implications of the digital
   divide. In addition to the general barriers to eGovernment adoption,
   some specific challenges which arise in the rural context are
   identified. Then, research emanating from the DARRA project is used to
   provide evidence from Finland, Norway, Sweden and Ireland of regionally
   generated visions of ICT utilisation and EGovernment and e-business
   solutions which foster economic and social development in those regions.
   Thus, the paper serves to document the problems and the potential of ICT
   interventions and demonstrates the influence of such interventions in
   promoting economic and social development which results in better
   connected individuals and communities, more competitive businesses and
   more effective public services.}},

Abstract = {{In the late `90s, the Flemish government put a transparent and easily
   accessible government for all citizens high on the political agenda.
   Citizens needed an easier and faster way to know what the impact of new
   policies and regulations would be on their lives. They had increasingly
   high expectations of the government with regards to information
   provision. The government decided to set up a Single Point of Contact
   for public information, to help and to serve citizens in a professional
   and user friendly way with all their questions regarding Flemish
   government. Next to high-quality telephone support, citizens also had to
   be served via other communication channels. The green light for the
   realization of a multi-channel contact center for the Flemish government
   was given mid 1998. The contact center was baptized as the Vlaamse
   Infolijn (= Flemish Info line) and expressed from the very beginning
   clear ambitions regarding quality, growth, and innovation. Strategic
   decisions were made to set up the contact center as a Public Private
   Collaboration, to consider knowledge management as one of the main
   drivers for success, to maintain excellent relations with the different
   administrations of the Flemish government, to become a pioneer in the
   use of leading-edge contact center technology and to focus on delivering
   a high-quality public information service. The Vlaamse Infolijn went
   live in 1999 with 8 front-office agents and a core support team of 4
   employees. In the first year the Vlaamse Infolijn registered 55.000
   citizen contacts, handled via the (+32) 0800 30201 green number. After
   more than 10 years of intensive operations and growth, the Vlaamse
   Infolijn - renamed into Contactpunt Vlaamse Infolijn - evolved to a
   world class multi-channel contact center in the public sector, with more
   than 1.7 million citizen contacts a year through a diversity of
   channels: telephone, email, web chat, sms and digital TV. The
   organization evolved to 105 call agents and a core support team of 18
   employees and has been awarded several times for contact center
   excellence. During the last few years, a strategic shift has taken place
   from providing just first line information towards offering
   transactional services. The launch of the short telephone number `1700'
   in the year 2007 was a crucial breakthrough to facilitate communication
   and easy access for citizens and to pursue the concept of a single point
   of contact for all citizen interactions with the Flemish government.
   This paper describes the objectives of the multi-channel contact center
   and the evolution during the last 10 years in relation to the number of
   contacts, the supported services, the supported channels, the technology
   used and the organisation model. The paper aims to prove - by means of
   this real-life testimonial - that within the constraints of the public
   sector, a multi-channel contact center can be set-up and managed
   successfuly in a spirit of growth, leadership and innovation.}},

Abstract = {{eGovernment initiatives are in their infancy in many countries at this
   phase of digitization. The success of these initiatives is not only
   dependent on the government support but also on the citizens'
   willingness to adopt eGovernment services. This study mainly
   investigates the factors that influence the adoption of EGovernment
   services by the citizens. The influential factors have been encountered
   in the previous research work. These factors are mainly categorized
   based on the demographic characteristics including age, education and
   gender; user characteristics including perceived risk, perceived
   control, and Internet usage experience; website design including
   perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and paralingual support;
   quality of service including system quality and service quality;
   security covering the aspects of transaction, network, information and
   application; and finally E-readiness including ICT. The purpose of this
   research is to develop a conceptual model for the adoption of
   eGovernment services by integrating the factors which have been
   highlighted by the various researchers into a single comprehensive model
   and also to bring forward the neglecting factors to present the full
   depiction of all the influential factors for the adoption of eGovernment
   services. The conceptual model is designed to be followed by an
   empirical study and is partially based on the factors from the existing
   user acceptance models: Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), DeLone and
   McLean (D\&M) IS Success Model and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) Model.
   This research is concluded by providing the conceptual model to move
   forward for the evaluation of eGovernment services from the citizens'
   perspective.}},

Abstract = {{The uniqueness of wool, its functionality, morphology, physical/
   mechanical behavior, and aesthetics, continue to be topics for
   innovative research to improve properties and create novel products. The
   perennial problems of yellowness, discomfort in wear, and shrinkage have
   been addressed over time as isolated and combined topics of
   investigations altering morphology and chemistry with processes designed
   to prevent or limit negative impact on wool's appearance and
   performance. Chemical bleaching with alkaline peroxide and
   shrinkproofing with chlorination have limited economy and ecological
   acceptance. The ARS Process for bleaching, biopolishing, and
   shrink-proofing wool requires near-room-temperature conditions with
   short exposure times to reach high levels of whiteness, softness, and
   dimensional stability, and the design has implications for
   sustainability with low energy and low impact on the environment.
   Scanning electron micrographs of fibers from ARS-treated fabrics showed
   erosion of wool's surface scales without fiber damage to limit felting
   shrinkage to less than 2\%, the indication of a mercerizing effect on
   cotton limiting shrinkage to 4\%, and complete shrinkage control of
   viscose challis. After processing, the mechanical properties of the
   fabrics and the structural integrity of the fibers were preserved. High
   concentration ARS bleaching when applied with high concentrations of
   bath constituents produced parchment wool jersey fabric with permanent
   stiffness and 45.5 \% increase in sheerness as determined pixel
   segmentation using digital image analysis to isolate yarn intersticies.
   The ARS Process is described as a novel development based outcomes and

Abstract = {{With the advent of Web 2.0 technologies, the Virtual Design Studio (VDS)
   has been revived in many schools of architecture around the globe. The
   recently evolving online Social Networks (SN) Platforms, as instruments
   for learning, have provided a potentially fruitful operative base for
   VDS. Yet these platforms have not enabled the VDS to explore new
   frontiers. All participants come from the same professional field and
   learn elements directly related to their existing design curriculum. The
   development of the VDS for interprofessional learning moves design
   education beyond conventional boundaries. The Interprofessional VDS
   (IPVDS) is an innovative method of teaching students from two different
   professional faculties the skills required for successful consultancy
   and promotional communication in the public realm. The IPVDS enabled
   students to develop consultancy skills and evidence-based communication
   strategies appropriate for disparate target audiences. It employed a
   digital SN learning platform to engage remotely-located students in
   acquiring new skills, transferring knowledge and achieving learning
   outcomes that enrich their professional experience. The paper presents
   details of the IPVDS, its methodology, outcomes, and evaluation of the
   studio, and discusses how the IPVDS is effective in enabling
   architectural students to understand and use communication and
   consultancy skills for collaboration across professional disciplines for
   the purpose of community engagement.}},

Abstract = {{Neural networks present a fundamentally different model of computation
   from the conventional sequential digital model. Modelling large networks
   on conventional hardware thus tends to be inefficient if not impossible.
   Neither dedicated neural chips, with model limitations, nor FPGA
   implementations, with scalability limitations, offer a satisfactory
   solution even though they have improved simulation performance
   dramatically. SpiNNaker introduces a different approach, the
   ``neuromimetic{''} architecture, that maintains the neural optimisation
   of dedicated chips while offering FPGA-like universal configurability.
   Central to this parallel multiprocessor is an asynchronous event-driven
   model that uses interrupt-generating dedicated hardware on the chip to
   support real-time neural simulation. While this architecture is
   particularly suitable for spiking models, it can also implement
   ``classical{''} neural models like the MLP efficiently. Nonetheless,
   event handling, particularly servicing incoming packets, requires
   careful and innovative design in order to avoid local processor
   congestion and possible deadlock. Using two exemplar models, a spiking
   network using Izhikevich neurons, and an MLP network, we illustrate how
   to implement efficient service routines to handle input events. These
   routines form the beginnings of a library of ``drop-in{''} neural
   components. Ultimately, the goal is the creation of a library-based
   development system that allows the modeller to describe a model in a
   high-level neural description environment of his choice and use an
   automated tool chain to create the appropriate SpiNNaker instantiation.
   The complete system: universal hardware, automated tool chain, embedded
   system management, represents the ``ideal{''} neural modelling
   environment: a general-purpose platform that can generate an arbitrary
   neural network and run it with hardware speed and scale.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for environmental, social, and economic advances enabled
   by information and communication technologies (ICTs) is tremendous:
   `Smart Grid' systems hold promise for resource conservation and climate
   change mitigation; innovations in ICT help transition countries from
   industrial to knowledge economies, and bridging the digital divide in
   developing countries can help achieve Millennium Development Goals
   worldwide: ending poverty, enabling universal education, and creating
   global partnerships. However, the benefit possible from global use of
   ICTs cannot be realized without a corresponding build up of digital
   infrastructure. This projected increase in ICT products is of particular
   concern to environmental sustainability, in large part due to the global
   health, safety, and environmental effects of managing these products in
   the waste stream. The ability to quantify and manage environmental
   impacts of ICT products is complicated by continuous evolution of
   product form and function. The work described herein provides an
   assessment of how changing form factor and material composition in
   common consumer electronics - desktop and notebook computers - may
   influence the electronic waste stream in the U.S. Results indicate that
   dematerialization on a per product basis is largely offset by increasing
   volumes of the total waste stream. From an economic standpoint,
   end-of-life value will be enhanced by the increasing use of lightweight
   materials such as aluminum and magnesium but potentially impacted by
   decreasing precious metal content. This paper also suggests that common
   design for end-of-life heuristics may be less applicable to ICT products
   undergoing rapid technological progress, as exemplified by the changing
   form factor and lightweighting of the consumer notebook computer.}},

Abstract = {{RFID implants for humans have been used in a variety of contexts since
   their commercial inception in 2003. The VeriChip product which typically
   carries a 16 digit number was first marketed as an identification device
   in the ehealth space (e. g. for emergency response), then as an access
   control mechanism (e. g. security), and finally as an epayment solution
   (e. g. the purchase of drinks at clubs). This paper investigates the
   story behind RFID implants for club patronage access control and
   epayment. The study uses a two-fold qualitative approach in the
   collection of data for the single case study of the Baja Beach Club in
   Barcelona, Spain. A single semi-structured interview was conducted with
   the IT Manager who created the application at the club that utilised the
   human chipping product. The full length interview was conducted in
   Spanish, translated into English, and analysed using content analysis.
   The interview was supported by an exhaustive search online for documents
   that met the criteria ``Baja Beach Club + implants{''}. The documents
   returned by this search included academic articles, government policy
   documents, publicly accessible blogs and media commentary. Search engine
   results online uncovered one other dominant document type-that of
   popular religious literature linking implantable microchips in humans to
   end-time prophecy in the Book of Revelation, the last book of the New
   Testament. The findings indicate that despite the successful application
   of RFID implants for club patrons, the complexity of the technology
   during trialability led to its stilted diffusion. The paper draws on
   Roger's (1995) diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory to describe the poor
   uptake of the technology for access control worldwide but points to the
   possibility that this is only a short-term trend. The paper also ponders
   on whether the slow rate of adoption of humancentric implantables will
   continue and what factors might need to be overcome before widespread
   diffusion can occur.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an innovative multifrequency and low-cost
   Software Defined Radio receiver architecture able to track new and/or
   modernized Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, focusing
   on GPS L5 (at the moment transmitted only from IIR-20M GPS satellite,
   SVN 49, PRN 63).
   The main advantages of the proposed architecture are:
   the presence of a single Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), which means
   having a simple and low-cost front-end able to receive multiple GNSS
   signals in a unique data stream; the flexibility and the
   interoperability among two or more bands and different systems.
   This approach paves the way for an easy design of novel receiver
   algorithms, leading to better performance, robustness and
   reconfigurability at the cost of an increased computational burden. In
   detail it allows the implementation of aiding strategies able to exploit
   the acquisition of a simple signal (e.g. GPS L1 C/A) for aiding the
   acquisition of another more complex signal (e.g. L5), or the development
   of novel ``smart{''} tracking algorithms.
   Complete analysis results related to the proposed architecture are
   presented in the paper, performing validations and tests with GNSS
   signals from different bands (L5 and L1). In addition, a further
   validation using real signal samples collected with a demonstrative
   front-end is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Geostationary satellites of the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
   offer a novel, robust, and cost-effective means of synchronizing time at
   widely-separated ground facilities, to levels of similar to 50ns,
   without the need for dedicated long-distance wired communication
   networks. However, reliance on satellite-based signals for time
   synchronization in high-reliability applications is problematic without
   explicit hardening against radio frequency interference (RFI). The
   primary innovations to be discussed in this paper are: (1) adaptive
   electronically-steered multi-element antenna arrays and signal
   processing strategies for RFI mitigation, (2) live signal, synthetic
   interference, and hardware-in-the-loop testing of jammer cancellation
   algorithms, and (3) preparations for over-the-air interference tests
   which will probe the effects of front-end saturation on digital
   beamsteering performance. We describe a hardware system assembled from
   readily-available commercial building blocks (data acquisition system,
   antennas, etc.), and a critical goal of this research is to realize
   significant GPS anti-jam performance in an open-architecture (or
   non-defense-related) platform. Therefore, the central innovations in
   this research enable adaptive electronic beamsteering with
   high-dynamic-range signals (14-bit I/Q digitization), employing
   commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and computer systems, and
   targeted for a civilian high-reliability, high-volume (many hundreds of
   deployed systems) GPS timing application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the usefulness of the metaphor of knowledge
   intensive organization as a rock band. The classic rock band consists of
   a drummer, a bass player, a rhythm guitarist and a lead singer. In this
   metaphor, the rhythm section provides the foundation (finance, logistics
   and fundamental business conditions); the guitar provides the harmonic
   viable bridge between the HRM/product policy and the end result of the
   business process. The CEO is the front man/woman similar to the lead
   singer; CEO's are often the core finders of intellectual capital and
   initiators to innovations. Steve Jobs or Bill Gates can be compared to
   Sting or Bono as guardians of the intellectual capital, which is similar
   to the compositions gathered in a catalogue. Songwriters and business
   strategists are both increasingly cautious to operate with the
   difficulty of protecting their intellectual capital due to the digital
   transparency. After exploring the similarities based on empirical
   research, this paper will try to answer the question ``Can
   knowledge-intensive organizations learn from the recent behavior of rock
   bands in the music industry?{''} Record companies and music publishers
   traditionally took over all related business activities of rock bands.
   They financed and marketed recordings and compositions in order to sell
   as many physical products as possible. The catalogue of compositions is
   owned by the music publishers and the composers; the master recording is
   financed and owned by the record companies. Composers gained most income
   out of royalties on recordings via mechanical copyrights. Royalties on
   performing rights (live-entertainment, television and radio) were
   inferior. Live-performance was mainly a promotional activity in order to
   sell CD's. Digitization changed the music industry, the margin on
   products declined and digital piracy became a huge threat. As a
   reaction, rock bands started branding themselves on the internet and
   started to sell digital content (downloads) next to CD's. Due to the
   loss of income in mechanical copyright, live-entertainment becomes
   crucial for surviving and takes the music industry back to its root
   existence. There are three elements of added value for consumers which
   are needed for recent success; news value (exclusivity and experience),
   security (privacy and authenticity) and consumer social responsibility
   (brand bonding and loyalty). This also accounts for knowledge intensive
   organizations. If it is hard to protect your intellectual capital, you
   need to go back to your root existence and take these three elements
   into account to be able to survive and to maintain successful.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is part of an ongoing PHD project on the integration of an
   educational computer game called Mingoville in teaching and learning
   English as a second language in two private primary schools in Nigeria.
   The paper reports a qualitative study of teachers' thoughts on the
   integration of the Mingoville game carried out to discover teachers'
   reactions to the use of educational computer games as a learning tool in
   the English language curriculum in Nigeria. The paper identifies factors
   that might hinder the acceptance of education computer games in learning
   English as a second language in Nigeria primary schools. It also
   recommends strategies to solve the challenges presented by the teachers.
   English language has occupied a premier position in Nigeria for many
   years, so English has enjoyed an unchallenged position in Nigerian
   education. However, a World Bank report found that Nigerian graduates
   have low proficiency in English. They stated that the 22\% unemployment
   rate in the metropolitan areas in Nigeria is a result of poor quality of
   the graduates, particularly in communication skills. According to them,
   these graduates exhibit ``poor abilities in the oral and written
   expression in English language. Recognizing these problems, there is a
   need to think about the education methodology that will suit the young
   generation to master English skills. According to Prensky, (2001)
   contemporary learners think and learn differently because they have
   grown up exposed to digital gaming environments for both pleasure,
   learning, and games, elicit motivation and provide the experience of
   engagement. He argues for changing the present learning environment from
   the predominantly ``tell test{''} framework currently employed by a
   majority of educational institutions to ones that harness the potential
   of digital game based learning. The question remains, though regarding,
   how Nigerian primary school teachers perceive and accept the integration
   of educational computer games in teaching English as a second language?
   Education computer game is a new phenomenon in teaching and learning
   English as a second language in Nigeria. Egenfeldt-Nelsen (2006), the
   role of the teacher is crucial in achieving the learning outcomes from
   game based classroom be it declarative or affective. Egenfeldt-Nelsen
   (2006), The integration of computer games depends on the attitudes of
   teachers, so it is necessary to understand teachers' thoughts,
   acceptance and understanding of this innovation in teaching and
   learning. The findings of this study will help the teachers to learn
   more about the best strategies to motivate the students to learn English
   and to understand their own changing role in a digital classroom. The
   teachers will also be motivated as they see their students increased
   interest in learning English.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years different ways of accessing information and
   computer resources available to users have increased dramatically.
   Therefore South African businesses are forced to keep abreast of their
   international counterparts to compete internationally. Currently
   traditional Executive Information Systems (EISs) provide information to
   executives and top management, but the need exists to expand EISs to
   other decision-makers, problem-solvers and users in business. This in
   turn means that a need exists for innovation and fast forwarding to a
   standard Business Information System (BIS). The BIS is used as a
   strategic business management tool that: focuses on an information
   system that is in a standard format to enable users to access
   information quickly, is user-friendly, is interactive and includes the
   global business environment. Users need systems that provide them with
   access to diverse types of information in order to make decisions, to
   solve problems and to be competitive. Businesses have chosen information
   technology to provide relevant and accurate information to users. The
   study is an exploratory study and the research methods are of a
   quantitative and qualitative nature. The data was acquired through
   distributing a questionnaire via e-mail to 334 listed Johannesburg Stock
   Exchange (JSE) companies and conducting interviews with top management
   and users of EISs. The research questions investigated were to establish
   what traditional EISs offered in order to identify unmet needs to
   determine the need for a standard BIS, and to establish a BIS that would
   ensure sustainable strategic competitiveness for businesses. In
   addressing these problems both these systems were compared along several
   dimensions which were derived from the definitions, characteristics,
   capabilities and functions. The value of the study explains that the
   trend has increasingly shifted towards employee empowerment and
   decision-making at all levels of the businesses. The findings of the
   study concludes that companies which operates in a traditional EIS
   environment are continually forced to fast forward from a traditional
   EIS to a standard BIS in an ever-changing digital environment in order
   to ensure a competitive strategy. This changing environment requires
   businesses to adapt to this `new' environment to exploit opportunities
   to their advantage. The results of the questionnaire indicated that
   nearly 60\% of the respondents have an EIS or planning to implement an
   EIS of which 50\% proposed a standard BIS for all businesses. Reasons
   for implementing a standard BIS varied: it is an excellent management
   tool which makes use of standard tools and built-in features, critical
   for real-time decision-making, familiar to users in businesses, a
   competitive edge for competitors and it is not the technology that
   matters but how the information is used. In conclusion it can be stated
   that a strategic business management tool, a standard BIS, was
   introduced to support the evidence gathered.}},

   innovation/creativity and entrepreneurship skills that can be encouraged
   (and gradually exercised and learnt) through gameplay. The final
   objective of this evaluation is twofold: firstly, to locate
   similarities, differences, strengths and weaknesses of the games
   currently available, that can help identify specific needs for digital

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to study the development and success of
   Internet-banking in Finland. The focus will be on two social innovations
   that have played a major role in the digitalisation of the Finnish
   banking industry. The evolution of Internet banking will be studied by
   looking at the changes in payment systems provided by the banks: how did
   we get from paying our bills over-the-counter to modern day on-line
   services. The paper is empirical in nature and it has qualitative
   research approach. The development in electronic commerce is often
   illustrated with a cube having three dimensions: the product, the agent
   and the process. Usually the digital process is the last missing
   dimension but in this case it is the one starting the entire process.
   The first social innovation took place in the 1960 when employers
   started paying wages directly to employees' bank accounts using digital
   data transmission based payment systems. The banks started to develop
   their virtual processes and products which, with the help of on-line
   technology, lead to the introduction of bank cards and PC-banking in
   1975-1984. In the late 1980s a large number of private companies and
   institutions had on-line technology and thanks to the liberal human
   resource policy the employees were allowed and even encouraged to use
   the computers for their own purposes. This way many people were
   introduced to PC-banking at a time when it was still fairly rare to have
   a computer at home. This was the second social innovation. In 1995 there
   were 260 000 households and entrepreneurs using PC-banking, which means
   one computer on-line for every 19 people. This gave the customers the
   freedom to pay their bills whenever they wanted but, compared to the
   on-line banking we know now, they were tied to a one particular computer
   signed up for the task. The Internet provided the missing dimension, the
   virtual agent. At this point the Finnish banks as well as their
   customers had plenty of experience and knowledge of digital banking and
   the whole country was able to shift easily to Internet banking and
   customers were able to pay their bill whenever they wanted, wherever
   they wanted.}},

Abstract = {{The success of eLearning heavily relies on the design of Learning
   Objects to communicate in an effective way. This article proposes to
   discuss the design issues of learning objects in eLearning 3.0. A period
   of collaboration through Social Networking has passed by in eLearning
   2.0 phase and we're out here to create our own avatars in eLearning 3.0.
   What would be the implications of learning objects in this environment?
   This paper sheds some light on what will be the new methodologies that
   will improve the realm of digital learning for both the students and the
   trainers. Despite the promoted benefits of eLearning 2.0, learners' full
   participation in the learning process is lacking. It only indicates that
   these Learning objects for eLearning, has not been designed with
   end-users, i.e. the learners, in mind. It is imperative that eLearning
   must provide ways to actually improve the learning process. The aim of
   the article is to analyze existing LO's in eLearning 2.0 and to discuss
   the design issues related to the modifying these LO's to categorize them
   under eLearning3.0. A generic architecture that can be applied to
   various domains in eLearning 3.0 would be proposed and the set of
   attributes related to the context in which the LO is used, would be
   defined. This would ensure more participation from learner's side to
   take up responsibilities for setting up their own activities. Further
   the most important issue of interoperability among the different
   e-Learning systems that would enable different LOs to be exchanged and
   reused among the different eLearning platforms would also be taken into
   consideration for designing LO's for eLearning 3.0. This transition is
   not any more optional, it becomes inevitable and can be perceived as not
   just new set of methods, but new, innovative ways to make the learners
   creatively design their own methods of learning.}},

Abstract = {{To be effective in the 21st century, citizens and workers must be able
   to exhibit a range of functional and critical thinking employability
   skills related to information, media and technology. Due to the global
   economic crisis, for the graduating students or students looking for a
   job it is perhaps more hard than ever to success on the job market. They
   must use every tool they know to express them, and to reflect their
   knowledge, competences and related skills. As digital storytelling and
   ePortfolio are innovative tools which could be successfully used in
   teaching and learning, we have been tried to combine them and to extend
   their usability for a job searching learning experience. Through the
   L@JOST project, by learning from ex-students successful digital stories
   experiences, by employers points of view and feedback, and,
   consequently, by providing some ePortfolios construction tips we hope to
   avoid such situations for students going to graduate and to guide them
   to successfully approach the job market, and more than that, to find a
   proper job, according with their competences, abilities and skills.
   Through this paper, according with the target group feedback, and,
   consequently, through the project outputs, we will offer some insightful
   inputs from Romanian perspective and for students going to graduate and
   who are looking for a job.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, cost estimation methods are used to predict costs only
   after a product model has been built, and not at an early design stage
   when there is little data and information available. The traditional
   cost models and systems used require a large amount of detailed data
   before a cost calculation can be made. This research has identified
   that, one of the main challenges to improve this situation in modelling
   cost is data identification and collection. The aim of this paper
   therefore is to discuss the methods of developing an extended-enterprise
   digital data library, data searching and data transfer mechanisms to
   support through-life cost estimation in the innovative product
   development processes. The paper begins with an introduction of relevant
   research in data modelling in cost estimation. This is followed by a
   section, which highlights problems of performing cost estimates for
   innovative low volume products, and subsequently the proposed solutions
   and example applications.}},

   from digital, virtual, real, and communication parts in conjunction with
   human knowledge and skills. The main areas of EDMS are modelling,
   simulation, analysis, and change management. The integrated activities
   of EDMS are discussed from the viewpoints of augmented intelligence and
   integrated collaboration activities. The theoretical application areas
   of the past, present, and future and the process from ideas to
   innovative solutions are presented. A real-life example of a laboratory
   demonstration of a robot manufacturing cell in which several aspects of
   the EDMS framework are utilised is introduced.}},

   be summarized by the inherent contradiction between boosting and
   detecting local innovation (so that group learns from its entities) and
   coding, standardizing and transferring good practices and organizational
   capabilities (so as group teaches its entities). This article describes
   some theoretical mechanisms to solve this ``learner/teacher{''} duality.
   Then a digital system is proposed to manage and assess locally and
   globally this organizational learning, illustrated by its use in an
   automotive supplier group. Finally, new developments are made so as to
   make the learning system more sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{The European Union's Lisbon strategy confirmed that the knowledge and
   innovation are the engines of sustainable growth. A common agreement has
   been reached, that it is essential to build a fully inclusive
   Information Society, based on the widespread use of information and
   communication technologies (ICTs) in public services, small and medium
   enterprises (SMEs) and households. The European Commission developed a
   new strategic framework, ``i2010 - A European Information Society for
   growth and employment{''}, which promotes an open and competitive
   digital economy and emphasises ICTs as a driver of inclusion,
   eGovernment and quality of life.
   ``i2010{''} formulated three priorities for Europe's Information Society
   and media policies:
   the completion of a Single European Information Space which promotes an
   open and competitive internal market for Information Society and media;
   strengthening Innovation and Investment in ICTs research to promote
   growth and more and better jobs;
   achieving an Inclusive European Information Society that promotes growth
   and jobs in a manner that is consistent with sustainable development and
   that prioritises better public services and quality of life.
   As this year is the final point for the initiative ``i2010{''}, the
   paper analyses some aspects of the implementation of the 3(rd) priority
   in Europe and in Greece on the background of its implementation in
   European Union. In addition the paper is presenting how this strategy
   affects and formulates new eGovernment strategies in the Member States
   and more specifically in Greece.
   eGovernment is part of a wider Information Society strategy to enhance
   Greece's competitiveness and improve quality of life. The availability
   of eGovernment services, for citizens and enterprises, in this country
   is below the EU average, though it has grown substantially in recent
   years. Greece's recent efforts have lead to a stable and relatively high
   eGovernment usage among business, but the take up of eGovernment
   services by citizens is very low and has not shown much improvement.
   The aim of this study is to assess the stategy's targets, activities and
   directions that were successfully fulfilled or not. Furthermore, we wish
   to pinpoint the causes and the reasons why certain parts were
   implemented correctly or not. Taking these conclusions in mind, in the
   future other countries that will apply similar strategies could avoid
   replication of the same mistakes that were observed during
   implementation of ``i2010{''} in European countries and more
   specifically in Greece.}},

Abstract = {{The computer is no longer isolated devices in the vast commercial
   community, and takes the role as a multi-transformer along the value
   conversion chain in all facets of the business world ranging from daily
   business transactions to analysis to processing and reasoning with
   information concerning national security. Some executives in particular
   countries still maintain a concrete-like paradigm to treat the computer
   as an appliance to serve a sole purpose, however the Internet boom
   around the Year 2000 made a lasting change in the world of computer
   networks. The Information Superhighway advocated by former US President
   Bill Clinton has become a tangible matter in the 21st century. Though
   the global equity market melted down severely when the Internet bubble
   burst in 2001, followed by large number of mergers \& acquisitions among
   technology companies, computers nowadays cluster themselves swiftly in
   the paradigm of the Cloud pervasively. Analogous to the effect of Crowd
   Sourcing in Communities of Practice, there is a material number of
   delinquencies, with some operated by teenagers who are eager to build up
   a virtual community in order to show off their talents by breaking into
   other computers. Even frightening, some organized gangs in the Soviet
   Union Bloc countries have quietly established some sorts of gifted
   developer networks to trade for those computer-hacking tools. The model
   of Do-It-Yourself, or DIY is noted. From an academic perspective, the
   vandals are certainly practicing knowledge sharing and retention in the
   dark side of the Internet. Computer crimes had a long history since the
   1930s, and fraud can also occur in traditional mainframe computers.
   ``Cyber Crime{''} has emerged recently to tackle organized, unauthorized
   break-in of computer systems in commercial entities, financial
   institutes, public authorities and confidential information leakage in
   peer networks for the sake of profit. One good example is the blackmail
   of schoolmasters in Japan by some pornography operators using illegal
   hacking tools. Drawing on some extensive connections in the Asia Pacific
   forensics network of one of the authors, this paper traces out the
   knowledge clusters among the commercial operators and non-governmental
   organizational bodies of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in
   Singapore, China, Australia, Hong Kong and Beijing; a software giant's
   Regional Digital Crime Investigation Unit, the latest Malaysia Cyber
   Crime Defense Center, and a US-based Professional Security Organization
   called ISC2. The Self-organization mechanism among these knowledge
   networks is drilled deep down, supplemented by Complexity Theory, which
   plays an key role in generating innovative methods to locate the
   Internet Bandits at all times and on the international scale. Owing to
   the sensitivity involved, the released content in this paper will only
   cover the leadership in knowledge sharing and the congruent way of
   discovering new threats real time. The research methodology used is
   predominately private interviews, literature review and Internet search.}},

Abstract = {{This article tries to be both a review and an agenda-setting piece. It
   argues that knowledge management suffers from conceptual and
   definitional ambiguity, oversimplification of its development processes,
   and methodological limitations. Nevertheless, there is a consensus in
   business and academia that knowledge is a key component of success and
   allows firms to achieve and sustains competitive advantages. In a
   digital era, these advantages arise from the potential of data and
   information that can be gathered, processed, shared, and used to improve
   eBusiness activities. Thus, this research bridges the gap in the
   assessment of knowledge management and eBusiness relationship, by
   applying a structural equation model to a large database sample of KM
   activities performed by European and American firms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical framework focusing on the processes of
   teaching. The framework can be used for analysis of teaching and
   learning practice, as well as analysis of the intended processes
   proposed and supported in teaching/learning materials; on the other
   hand, the framework can be used when planning teaching and designing
   learning materials, in casu digital learning platforms. Processes are
   examined at the micro-level, identified as interaction sequences, and at
   the meso-level as workflows. The macro-level, the level of modules, is
   only addressed sporadically in this paper. A course consists of several
   modules integrating several workflows, each of which comprises several
   interaction sequences. Two common processes are identified. At the
   micro-level, the most common interaction sequence is (the teacher's)
   Initiation- (student's) Response-(teacher's) Feedback (IRF) while an
   equally widespread process at the meso-level is a workflow called
   Lecture-Recitation-Seatwork-Plenary session (abbreviated as LeReSeP).
   These two structures are discussed and analysed, and they are criticised
   on a theoretical basis for being too teacher-centred, and leaving
   insufficient room for developing more complex competences in students. A
   number of alternative interaction sequences and workflows are described
   and discussed. These alternatives all have their advantages, but they
   are evaluated as more complex, troublesome, and inconvenient to work
   with. Teaching and learning materials support interaction sequences and
   workflows in a variety of ways by helping the teacher and students carry
   out their respective tasks. With digital technologies, it is possible to
   develop far more sophisticated support for the processes of teaching and
   learning. In the last part of the paper, an innovative type of digital
   learning platform, called Practice Scaffolding Interactive Platforms or
   PracSIPs, is presented, followed by two examples of how such platforms
   can support, project-oriented workflows by structuring the students'
   work, organising their collaboration, managing their products,
   presenting relevant subject matter knowledge and methods when it is
   needed, etc.}},

Abstract = {{The paper first proposes a panorama of the changes that IT/ICT are
   producing in different educational contexts. Soon after it focuses on
   the analysis of two experiences which will be held in two schools and
   will involve teachers, students and their families. The discussion of
   the projects is preceded from a short summary of the most important
   Italian national proposals for teaching-learning innovation. Soon after
   the features of the projects to be activated in school year 2010-2011 in
   the two schools are presented (i.e., the instruments and strategies for
   teaching innovation, based on the use of IWB, LOs and eLearning platform
   are discussed). The analysis of the differences in the two projects is
   mostly concerned with school organizational management and
   school-families communication so that the main elements under discussion
   are: the instruments both hardware and software, to be used in the two
   situations, the information flow and the process management due to the
   information system adopted in the first case, compared with the simple
   communication of final data in the second one, the involvement of all
   stakeholders and the attention to the feedbacks coming from them, with
   respect to the simple acquisition of information from the families. A
   description of the more general problem of digital competence assessment
   follows, and the results from former investigations are reported so that
   a better comparison of the two issues can be made.}},

Abstract = {{The participatory practices (Jenkins 2006) surrounding web 2.0 services
   at first sight appear attractive to harness for the purposes of peer
   assessment (Falchikov 2007). But specifically what practices act as
   enablers for effective feedback (Nicol \& MacFarlane-Dick 2006) and what
   tensions occur when web 2.0 practices for peer assessment are introduced
   into formal teaching and learning settings? This paper seeks to shed
   light on these questions through presenting, analysing and discussing
   the findings from a small scale participatory study in which two cohorts
   (n=18, n=15) of first year undergraduate students created, peer reviewed
   and assessed each others' digital story (McDrury \& Alterio 2003)
   productions using the Voicethread web 2.0 service
   (http://voicethread.com). A key component of this innovative assessment
   practice (now in its second year) is the central role of the student,
   specifically in negotiating appropriate assessment criteria. A critical
   evaluation of data from student surveys, focus groups and comments left
   as peer feedback will be used to discuss insights into: The impact on
   the student experience of adopting web 2.0 practices for assessing their
   peers. The extent to which the affordances of the web 2.0 service
   enabled or constrained the assessment. In the light of the findings from
   this study the paper will conclude by exploring the usefulness of the
   concepts outlined in the `big ideas' (Anderson 2007) in guiding the
   adoption of web 2.0 practices for peer assessment and whether any
   reinterpretation is helpful when deploying web 2.0 services for
   assessment in formal academic contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Modernization and informatization of education leads to changes in the
   concept of university electronic library. Today e-library should
   correspond to the existing trends in education and be the tool of human
   resources development; e-library today contains regional specific
   features. It may be used as a tool to oppose demographic decline,
   complex migrant processes, and the outflow of manpower. The research
   devoted to the analysis of the trends in human resources development in
   Krasnoyarsky krai was carried out at the Siberian Federal University in
   2009. It included the forecast for the period 2010-2030. Most
   technological innovations which provide opportunity to retain and
   develop human resources are being applied within the traditional scheme
   of in-person interaction, while around 70\% of young people, according
   to sociological research, get information from electronic networks. In
   this respect the authors of the research pay special attention to the
   opportunities of electronic libraries. It is a widely-held opinion that
   the potential of electronic libraries has not been studied sufficiently
   yet and the understanding of what opportunities electronic libraries may
   offer is limited. Connecting universities and schools by means of
   broadband digital data exchange will considerably shorten the time of
   data transmission for end users - secondary school students, teachers,
   and parents. Free access to information becomes the most important
   factor for successful development, sharing innovative experience,
   scientific cooperation on the regional, national and international
   level. Working out the social and educational content of the SFU
   e-library will optimize funding in the social sphere and support most
   vulnerable categories of people in Krasnoyarsky krai. Developing social
   services and organizing recruiting agencies within the SFU e-library
   environment will help attract manpower. Why? The main idea is to use the
   e-library for human resources development and solving important social
   problems at Krasnoyarsky krai. A university library becomes not only the
   scientific but also the social centre. The extended target audience
   includes university students, teachers, senior classes of secondary
   schools, parents and other groups of people.}},

Abstract = {{Our society has witnessed major growth and innovation in technology.
   However, one of innovation's fundamental aspects, designer creativity,
   is still largely unsupported by information technology (IT) tools. This
   paper establishes a bridge between efforts to use cyberinfrastructure to
   generate design alternatives and a designer's ability to explore and
   evaluate concepts.. The research presented provides a method of
   synthesizing a web-based representation of a product concept using
   inform ation from a digital design repository, an automatic concept
   generator, and results from a clustering analysis. A visualization
   interface is developed to provide designers with multiple
   representations of product concepts. The development of this approach
   establishes a computing infrastructure to support an investigation into
   the effect of information technology on designer creativity and provides
   a foundation for the development of further support technology. The
   architecture is implemented and the result is illustrated with an
   example in order to show the capabilities of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Computer hardware and software have played a significant role in
   supporting the design and maintenance of pipeline systems. CAD systems
   allowed designers and drafters to compile drawings and make edits at a
   pace unmatched by manual pen drawings. Although CAD continues to provide
   the environment for a lot of pipeline design, Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS) are also innovating pipeline design through routines such
   as automated alignment sheet generation.
   What we have seen over the past two or three decades is an evolution in
   how we manage the data and information required for decision making in
   pipeline design and system operation. CAD provided designers and
   engineers a rapid electronic method for capturing information in a
   drawing, editing it, and sharing it. As the amount of digital data
   available to users grows rapidly, CAD has been unable to adequately
   exploit data's abundance and managing change in a CAD environment is
   cumbersome. GIS and spatial data management have proven to be the next
   evolution in situations where engineering, integrity, environmental, and
   other spatial data sets dominate the information required for design and
   operational decision making.
   It is conceivable that GIS too will crumble under the weight of its own
   data usage as centralized databases become larger and larger. The Geoweb
   is likely to emerge as the geospatial world's evolution. The Geoweb
   implies the merging of spatial information with the abstract information
   that currently dominates the Internet. This paper and presentation will
   discuss this fascinating innovation, it's force as a disruptive
   technology, and oil and gas applications.}},

Abstract = {{Several innovative prediction methods of strain range have been
   developed in order to apply to the Generation IV plants. In a component
   design at elevated temperature, `strain range' is used to calculate the
   fatigue and creep-fatigue damage. Therefore, prediction of `strain
   range' is one of the most important issues to evaluate the components'
   integrity during these lifetimes. To verify the strain prediction method
   of discontinues structures at evaluated temperature, low cycle fatigue
   tests were carried out with notched specimens. All the specimens were
   made of Mod.9Cr-1Mo, because it is a candidate material for a primary
   and secondary heat transports system components of JSFR (Japanese Sodium
   Fast Reactor). Deformation control fatigue tests and thermal fatigue
   tests were performed by ordinary uni-axial push-pull test machine and
   equipment generating the thermal gradient in the notched plate by
   induction heating. Stress concentration level was changed by varying the
   notch radius in the both kind of tests. Crack initiation and propagation
   process during the fatigue test were observed by the digital micro-scope
   and replica method. Elastic and inelastic FEAs were also carried out to
   estimate the `strain range' for the prediction of fatigue life. Then the
   ranges of several strain predictions and estimations were compared with
   the test results. These predictions were based on the sophisticated
   technique to estimate the `strain range' from elastic FEA. Stress
   reduction locus (SRL) method, simple elastic follow-up method, Neuber's
   rule method and the methods supplied by elevated temperature design
   standards were applied. Through these results, the applicability and
   conservativeness of these strain prediction and estimation methods,
   which is the basis of the creep-fatigue life prediction, is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Mixed Reality in the product development process is emerging
   as a promising solution that combines the advantages of virtual and
   rapid prototyping. A mixed prototype is usually based on a physical
   mock-up on which the visual appearance of the product is superimposed
   thanks to the augmented reality technologies. An open issue in mixed
   prototyping is the reduction of time and efforts required to generate
   and update the behaviour model of the product.
   This paper presents a Mixed Reality environment in which the product
   behaviour is simulated using the same models and the same software
   employed by the engineers in the design phase. This approach guarantees
   the reliability of the simulation and allows a strong reduction of the
   time needed to develop the digital prototype.
   Moreover the paper presents an innovative technique, specifically
   studied for the simulation of electrical appliances, that aims to make
   the user able to naturally interact with the mixed prototype. This
   technique is able to manage the occlusion between real and virtual
   objects and the interpretation of the user's gestures while he/she is
   interacting with the elements of the product interface. The novelty of
   the technique is that it does not require any specific device like
   data-gloves or tracking systems.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Ecosystem is an innovative high-tech environment with the
   purpose of supporting the activities among species within the business
   ecosystem. In this paper, we concern about the research issue of service
   retrieval within such an environment. Due to the fact that species are
   heterogeneous and geographically dispersed, to precisely and quickly
   locate a service provider becomes an issue. In addition, the Digital
   Ecosystem environment urgently requires the structualization of service
   information and a set of unified QoS measurement for service ranking and
   evaluation. In order to unfold the issues in detail, we use the means of
   case study and literature survey. Eventually we formulate the research
   issues in this domain and provide a possible solution.}},
