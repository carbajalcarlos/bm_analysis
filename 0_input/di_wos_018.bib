Abstract = {{Therapeutic genome engineering is a hallmark of gene therapy but only
   recent technological advances have permitted the modification of complex
   genomes in a targeted fashion. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) have
   developed into a major playmaker in the genome engineering field and
   have been employed to trigger the targeted editing of genomes at over 50
   gene loci in 11 model organisms, including fruitfly, zebrafish and rat,
   with allelic frequencies reaching the double digit percentage range.
   Moreover, ZFN-mediated genome surgery in primary human cells has become
   a reality and two phase I clinical trials aiming at knocking out the
   CCR5 receptor in T cells isolated from HIV patients to protect these
   cells from infection with the virus have been initiated. Considering
   that specificity is closely linked to ZFN activity and ZFN-associated
   toxicity, this parameter has been and will be a key quality in any
   therapeutic application of the designer nucleases. This review
   summarizes the technological innovations that have successfully
   catapulted ZFNs into the genome engineering arena and provides an
   overview of the current state of the art of these nucleases with
   reference to human gene therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The earliest known shaking table, driven by hand-power, was constructed
   in Japan at the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th
   century developments had moved to the Stanford University in the U.S.
   with the introduction of an electric motor to produce a more refined
   oscillatory motion in one direction, the response of the testpiece being
   recorded mechanically by pens on a rotating drum. Major earthquakes in
   the 1920s prompted renewed interest at Stanford resulting in a
   uni-directional table moving on rails, activated either by a pendulum
   striking at one end-the other being resisted by springs-or by a wheel
   with an eccentric-mass attached to the table. A valuable feature here
   was that the size of the eccentric mass could be varied as the harmonic
   motion continued, thereby providing a method of control. In the 1950s, a
   similar pendulum input was used on a table constructed at the University
   of California, but instead of rails, it was supported by a group of
   vertical bars flexible in one direction only, and the 1939-1945 war had
   resulted in the availability of electrical devices for measuring
   response. Also, in Italy at this time the use of pendulums was augmented
   by contra-rotating mass input devices giving better frequency control;
   arrays of several electrodynamic exciters were also used. In Japan,
   motion was induced by the release of compressed springs.
   The idea of producing input by an oil-filled piston was introduced at
   MIT after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake to a table suspended from above
   by wires. Two other innovations here were of the greatest significance.
   First was an analogue device for using an actual earthquake record as
   input, and the second was control of the motion by an error-driven
   electrically controlled feedback loop. The development of these ideas
   into the shaking tables, which we use today, had to wait upon the
   general development of control engineering during the 1939-1945 war,
   followed by progressively greater speeds in digital computation. This
   history ends (c.1985) after the continuation of these advances made
   possible full 6-DOF control using many oil-filled actuators, but before
   they became able to give us real-time control with the attendant
   abilities of multi-support input and the experimental study of inelastic
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is on how the state sets up discriminatory
   structures, how immigrants work out ways of managing those structures
   and how in this process they construct flexible and innovative
   identities. Two main issues are explored. The first is the relationship
   between state control and exclusion and immigrant resistance. The paper
   shows how, despite increased surveillance and digital nets mounted by
   European states to keep immigrants out of their territory, the British
   state is ambivalent towards irregular immigrants. At the same time, it
   is in the interstices of ambiguity that immigrants, by buying, renting
   and borrowing documents, have found ways through their networks and
   communities to resist or get around exclusionary and contradictory
   regulations. Second, the paper is concerned with the construction of
   innovative and flexible identities. The research reveals how immigrants
   occupy rebellious spaces and construct identities in difficult
   situations at the intersection of self and structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a CMOS digitized silicon condenser microphone for
   acoustic applications is newly proposed. The proposed CMOS digitized
   silicon condenser microphone is attractive due to the fact that the
   sensor and all the circuits are robustly and compactly integrated.
   Another innovation of this proposed CMOS digitized silicon condenser
   microphone is that it could be operated without charge pump circuits.
   Thus, the sensor and circuits can be performed at the same power supply.
   Based upon 0.35 mu m 2P4M CMOS technology with 3 V power supply,
   measurement results have successfully verified the correct function and
   performance of the proposed CMOS digitized silicon condenser microphone.
   The area of the proposed CMOS digitized silicon condenser microphone is
   1444 x 1383 mu m(2) and the FOM of the sigma-delta modulator is 163.85
   dB. The proposed CMOS digitized silicon condenser microphone is suitable
   for mobile phones, laptops, PDAs, and hearing aids, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Huntington's disease (HD) causes severe motor impairments that are
   characterized by chorea, dystonia, and impaired fine motor control. The
   motor deficits include deficits in the control of the forelimb, but as
   yet there has been no comprehensive assessment of the impairments in
   arm, hand and digit movements as they are used in every-day tasks. The
   present study investigated the reaching of twelve HD subjects and twelve
   age-matched control subjects on a reach-to-eat task. The subjects were
   asked to reach for a small food item, with the left or the right hand,
   and then bring it to the mouth for eating. The task assesses the major
   features of skilled forelimb use, including orienting to a target,
   transport of the hand to a target, use of a precision grasp of the
   target, limb withdrawal to the mouth, and release of the food item into
   the mouth, and the integration of the movements into a smooth act. The
   movements were analyzed frame-by-frame by scoring the video record using
   an established movement element rating scale and by biometric analysis
   to describe limb trajectory. All HD subjects displayed greater reliance
   on more proximal movements in reaching. They also displayed overall
   jerkiness, a significant impairment in end point error correction (i.e.
   no smooth trajectories), deficits in timing and terminating motion
   (overshooting the target), impairments in rotation of the hand,
   abnormalities in grasping, and impairments in releasing the food item to
   the mouth. Although impairment in the control of the distal segments of
   the limb was common to all subjects, the intrusion of choreatic
   movements produced a pattern of highly variable performance between
   subjects. The quantification of reaching performance as measured by this
   analysis provides new insights into the impairments of HD subjects,
   allows an easily administered and inexpensive way to document the many
   skilled limb movement abnormalities, and relates the impairments to a
   real-world context. The protocol can serve as a useful clinical tool to
   evaluate innovative therapeutic interventions in HD such as
   physiotherapy, drug therapy, or functional neurosurgical procedures. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper we report on the fabrication and performance of a portable
   and low cost optoelectronic platform integrating a double color tuned
   light emitting diode as light source, an amorphous/nanocrystalline
   silicon photodetector with a flat spectral response in the wavelength
   range from 520 nm to 630 nm and integrated electronic for signal
   acquisition and conditioning constituted by current to voltage
   converter, a filter and an amplification stage, followed by an analog to
   digital converter, with appropriate software for full automation to
   minimize human error. Incorporation of the double color tuned light
   emitting diode provides for a simple yet innovative solution to signal
   acquisition independently from the light intensity and/or solution
   concentration, while considerably decreasing production costs. Detection
   based on Au-nanoprobes constitutes the biorecognition step and allowed
   identification of specific sequences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   complex, namely Mycobacterium bovis and M. tuberculosis in biological
   samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   (DHP) lead-acid battery (LAB) charger. The main control unit P89LPC933
   real-time collects the voltage and current of the charger. Then the unit
   sends out the control signal to pulse width modulator SG3525A,
   controlling the voltage and current. It co-operates the external circuit
   as well. This paper innovatively proposes 4-stage charging control
   method and strategy. This paper compares the typical chargers on the
   market with the one proposed by the authors in terms of horizontal and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for automatic detection of clustered
   micro calcifications (both malignant and benign) in digitized
   mammograms. Compared to previous works, the innovation here is that the
   processing is performed by labeling the texture regions in the original
   image. This new method uses the labeling the textures of the
   mammographic images on the basis of UIQI (universal quality index). Once
   labeling is performed, mammogram is segmented into various regions and
   further thresholds are used to separate the clustered micro
   calcifications. By comparing our results with those found in the
   literature, we proved that the method enormously reduces the computing
   time as UIQI utilizes simple statistical features like mean, variance
   and standard deviations only. In this paper, an automatic segmentation
   and classification of massive lesions in mammographic images is
   evaluated on Mini-MIAS database consisting 320 digitalized mammograms.
   Furthermore, classification rates enhancements were also revealed by
   testing our method compared to existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter reviews the study of individual differences in information
   behaviour; those differences which are not due to demographic factors
   such as age, gender, education or occupation, but rather to personality
   factors and to learning and thinking styles. It examines studies of
   patterns in information behaviour and of personality and similar factors
   in groups of information-focused occupations, as well as studies which
   have explicitly sought to relate information behaviour to such factors.
   The aim of the chapter is to assess how far we have come in being able
   to identify and measure `information style', a quality different from
   any other categorisation of personality or of intellectual styles. If
   this goal were achieved, it would be a valuable concept for the academic
   study of information-related behaviours, as well as being of practical
   usefulness for the design of information systems and services, the
   evaluation of the effectiveness of such systems and the training of
   users. It could also allow a tailored provision of information,
   particularly for creative or innovative purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Audretsch and Thurik (2002) is one of the rare attempts to link
   entrepreneurship to economic performance. Whereas its theoretical
   background highlights the role played by small firms (henceforth SF) in
   the conduct of innovation, the empirical model it is based on does not.
   Rather, it compares SF contribution to economic growth to that of large
   firms without illustrating how innovation is instrumentalized for
   entrepreneurship. This is the purpose of our paper which arguments that
   absorption capacity as a device can help in such a project. For this, it
   mixes conceptions of entrepreneurship as innovation conduct with that of
   entrepreneurship as opportunity exploitation. It suggests to distinguish
   economic agents involved in entrepreneurship from opportunities sources
   being exploited. The paper elaborates on how to turn the process into
   variables, measure and introduce them into a model for regressions and
   tests at an aggregated level. Specifically, literature on SF and
   innovation helps to define entrepreneurial capacity which is for a
   country or industry its share of SF whereas the vast work on
   technological change is useful to quantify opportunities. Variables
   interact and entrepreneurship matters when ones obtain a significant
   coefficient suggesting absorption or exploitation. It happens for
   critical levels of SF presence which must be considered carefully for at
   least two reasons: (1) critical levels of firm size are specific to our
   dataset and moving from them for country or industry purposes need
   subsequent works. (2) Respective influences of entrepreneurship
   components are not of same intensities, that of opportunities being the
   most important, it incentives for interest in other agents involved in
   exploitation. Our dataset documents heighten manufacturing industries
   (ISIC Rev.3 with two digits) and countries such as France, USA,
   Great-Britain, Italy, Denmark, Finland and Germany.}},

   services equalization. It is one of the vital conditions for achieving
   information service equalization to eliminate poverty, promote economic
   development and build a harmonious society. Academic library is an
   important component of social information system, and it is the base of
   university and social infomationization. Therefore, the academic library
   should base on universities, face society, serve the nation and take
   responsibility of information service equalization. This paper analyzes
   the nature of the information service equalization and influence of
   promoting information service equalization by digital gap, explores the
   advantages for academic library to promote the equalization of

Abstract = {{Future automobiles will be equipped with hundreds of processors. Some
   will control vehicle functions (i.e. anti-lock brakes, traction control,
   and engine management). Others will continuously monitor the vehicle
   surroundings and extract and Interpret relevant Information to enhance
   safety. Integrated digital cameras are an important feature for next
   generations of customer products. From low light sensing pixel
   technology, to high speed video sensors, to SOCs (System on A Chip) with
   sophisticated image processing algorithms. OEMs is constantly looking to
   put the latest advances in imaging into products for our customers. Key
   specifications of such cameras are resolution, sensitivity, power
   consumption, manufacturing and packaging costs-as well as the overall
   size. Drivers are passionate about imaging technology and that passion
   drives the innovation that makes no limit in imaging driving solutions.
   The recent improvements of CMOS image sensors would allow a further
   miniaturization. The main points in image sensor development are how to
   make their advantages even better and how to reduce their noise and
   sensitivity disadvantages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper will summarize the potential use cases and impacts of
   competences and skills in the new area, often called ``Digital Age{''}:
   It will highlight the roles and benefits of standards and metadata for
   HR development and points out the special support that competence models
   can provide for the quality development in learning, education, and
   training. In this regard, the main characteristics of this innovative
   approach called competence modelling and its relevance in vocational
   education and training (VET) can only be summarized. A general
   competence model with a standardized competence structure and taxonomy
   of levels is introduced and discussed for the general application
   scenarios and for the specific use cases in vocational education and
   training. It can be shown that competence modelling and the presented
   competence model lead to an improvement of the working places, of the
   organizational and individual development, to an increase of the
   mobility worldwide as well as to a higher transparency and recognition
   of competences and skills. Finally leading European initiatives on
   competence modelling are introduced and the current standardization
   activities are highlighted.}},

   million records and includes services such as fulltext search, automatic
   keyword assignment, ingestion and automatic display of LaTeX, citation
   analysis, automatic author disambiguation, metadata harvesting,
   extraction of figures from fulltext and search in figure captions. In
   order to achieve high quality metadata both automatic processing and
   manual curation are needed. The different tools available in the system
   use modern web technologies to provide the curators of the maximum
   efficiency, while dealing with the MARC standard format. The project is
   under heavy development in order to provide new features including
   semantic analysis, crowdsourcing of metadata curation, user tagging,
   recommender systems, integration of OAIS standards and innovative

Abstract = {{Postgraduate education is currently engaged in curriculum reform in
   China. With the on-going reform, many potential problems are exposed
   gradually. In this paper, the ideas and methods of reforming the
   postgraduate curriculum teaching and the way based on general education
   are presented, adopting ways such as strengthening the teaching
   materials, applying the heuristic teaching and bilingual teaching, as
   well as importing some novel approaches, like MB-OFDM synchronization
   approach the author of this paper made, into graduates core curriculums,
   Modern Digital Communication, as a trial. The postgraduates under such
   education would be trained into qualified talents and have a strong
   foundational knowledge, practical ability, spirit of innovation and
   integrated quality. As a consequence, the idea of this reformed
   postgraduate curriculum provides a specific direction for the further
   reform of postgraduate education in China.}},

Abstract = {{Low power demonstrators are commonly used to validate novel control
   algorithms. However, the response of the demonstrator to network
   transients and faults is often unexplored. The importance of this work
   has, in the past, justified facilities such as the T45 Shore Integration
   Test Facility (SITF) at the Electric Ship Technology Demonstrator
   (ESTD). This paper presents the use of real time digital simulation and
   hardware in the loop to de-risk a innovative control algorithm with
   respect to network transients and faults. A novel feature of the study
   is the modelling of events at the power electronics level (time steps of
   circa 2 mu s) and the system level (time steps of circa 50 mu s).}},

Abstract = {{Inverting and porting are two of modular operators identified by Baldwin
   and Clark (2000) in Design Rules to characterize changes of system
   modularity. The objective of this article is to examine the economics of
   inverting and porting and to infer their implications to platform
   strategy. The result is that for inverting to be beneficial, the module
   must have technological nature of a platform, which is to interact with
   many modules, and to succeed in inverting, transactional mechanisms and
   marketing initiatives must be devised because suppliers and consumers
   are linked by modular compatibility resulted from standardized
   interfaces. Porting can be applied passively to deliver benefit of
   insurance or actively to advocate new value propositions. Active porting
   starts a window of opportunity for the module to invert to become a
   platform. The case of the leading digital music service provider in
   Taiwan, KKBox, is discussed as an illustration.}},

Abstract = {{For recent years, we have seen technology represent an increasing
   percentage of the core competencies of many industries. The challenge of
   product innovation is the possibility of effectively taking advantage of
   digitalization and the internet to create a new reading experience,
   rather than simply imitating the experience of reading a real book.
   Though the textbook industry has been resistant to change, it is
   undeniable that an electronic book (e-book) with a plausible and viable
   electronic distribution scheme is better than a physical book for
   several applications.
   This paper describes a study on e-book among on-line readers. The main
   purpose of this study is to conceptual the on-line customers acceptance
   model of three pre-factors as digital structure, design, and content for
   intention to e-book acceptance. The acceptance model is based on on-line
   customers' perceptions on perceived usefulness of the on-line readers.
   To examine our hypotheses, we collected data from 336 respondents who
   focused their responses from using experience of e-book. Results
   demonstrate that the complementary effects of these infrastructural
   related factors significantly impact both perceptions of and commitments
   to e-book acceptance.}},

Abstract = {{From a labour-intensive and paper-based door-keeping function Customs
   control is aiming now towards international trade facilitation in a way
   that is both efficient and secure. Digitalization of documents and
   automation of processes plays an important role in this transition.
   However, the use of modern technology, in particular SOA, is not yet
   optimal. The research objective of this paper is to explore the
   potential of SOA for innovating Customs processes by developing a
   service-oriented auditing approach and evaluating its added-value in the
   area of Customs control. Service-oriented auditing is a promising tool
   to implement the ideals of continuous and online monitoring.}},

Booktitle = {{LINKING GOVERNMENT DATA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Pages = {{205-219}},
Abstract = {{Governments around the world have been releasing raw data to their
   citizens at an increased pace. The mixing and linking of these datasets
   by a community of users enhances their value and makes new insights
   possible. The use of mashups - digital works in which data from one or
   more sources is combined and presented in innovative ways is - a great
   way to expose this value. Mashups enable end users to explore data that
   has a real tangible meaning in their lives. Although there are many
   approaches to publishing and using data to create mashups, we believe
   Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies solve many of the true
   challenges in open government data and can lower the cost and complexity
   of developing these applications. In this chapter we discuss why Linked
   Data is a better model and how it can be used to build useful mashups.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation in technology together with evolution in pedagogical
   approaches is encouraging increased integration of technology-supported
   interventions in mainstream teaching practices. One area attracting
   particularly close attention in this respect is Serious Games (SGs),
   which offer considerable potential for facilitating both formal and
   informal learning experiences in supported and standalone contexts.
   Advances in technology and in technology enhanced learning are raising
   learners' expectations for immersive and engaging game-based
   experiences. This trend is underpinned by the emergence of young
   learners adept at using digital technologies and the internet; there is
   an attendant risk that, as students, they may be alienated by
   traditional education and its failure to engage them fully in a lifelong
   learning process and prepare them adequately for the challenges of the
   21st Century. SGs would appear to offer an attractive solution in this
   regard. However, there are a number of inhibitors preventing their wider
   take-up in mainstream education, with the result that the considerable
   potential on offer has yet to be fully exploited. This situation is the
   background for the joint efforts of partners in the Games and Learning
   Alliance (GALA), an EC-funded Network of Excellence on SGs, especially
   the sub-group dedicated to the pedagogical dimension of SGs. In its
   discussions on the key challenges for more wide-scale and effective SG
   use, the group has focused in particular on aspects related to the
   central role played by the educator in formal education settings.
   Specifically, discussion has focused on the challenges posed when
   educators are called on to modify their practice, adopting the new roles
   and approaches demanded for effective SG deployment. This paper presents
   the outcome of the group's exploration. It frames the question of the
   educator's central role by drawing on research work that, in the view of
   the different authors, embodies the major references for shedding light
   on this multi-faceted aspect. As well as the new role that the educator
   assumes in games-based learning environments, particular attention is
   also dedicated to the innovative pedagogical approaches that can be
   applied to SG deployment, especially those inspired by peer
   collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{With handhelds, it is possible to mix virtual with real-world data
   (i.e., locations and contexts) connecting virtual worlds to real life.
   Handheld games can be used to engage students with learning in their
   (school) environment. In a project called `Games Atelier' innovative
   pedagogy was developed that stimulated students to create content with
   the use of mobile technology. The premise underlying Games Atelier is
   that the process of creating games improves students' learning
   experiences. In this paper experiences of 80 students from both
   pre-vocational and lower secondary education working with 7scenes (a
   platform to create games) were described. The aim of this investigation
   was to indicate how 7scenes was used in secondary education, how many
   lessons were needed to create a meaningful game, how students
   experienced working with seven scenes and what students and teachers
   perceived as possible learning outcomes of creating and playing games.
   Preliminary results showed that in 12-14 lessons a meaningful game can
   be created. For the students it was hard to place themselves in the
   position of the player of the game when creating the assignments and
   they needed more guidance from their teacher especially in formulating
   the questions in a way that they would be clear to the player. Students
   mostly learned technically how to design a game. In addition to these
   technical skills, students learned very few other things such as
   measuring the temperature of water and the meaning of traffic signs.
   Several improvements were suggested such as working in two consecutive
   lessons, use of planning and predefined assessment and making the
   platform more user-friendly.}},

Abstract = {{Joseph Campbell's Monomyth not only provides a well-proven pattern for
   successful storytelling, it may also help to guide teams and team
   leaders through the challenges of change and innovation processes. In
   project ``HELD: Innovationsdramaturgie nach dem Heldenprinzip{''}
   researchers of the University of the Arts Berlin and the Berlin
   Gameslab, part of the University of Applied Sciences HTW-Berlin, team up
   to examine the applicability of the Hero's Journey to change management
   using an adaptation of Campbell's pattern called,
   ``Heldenprinzip(R){''}. The project's goal is not to simply teach the
   stages of the Monomyth as mere facts but rather to enable the
   participants of training courses and interventions to actually
   experience its concepts using a portfolio of creative and aesthetic
   methods. While a pool of aesthetic methods - like drawing, performing,
   or role-playing -is already being used, the Gameslab subproject
   qualitatively researches the potentials for enriching and complementing
   these methods with interactive digital media and games. This paper
   discusses two types of treatment and three game-based learning scenarios
   to be used in training and intervention sessions in general and their
   pros and cons for our use-case. The first option for treatment is
   providing the participants with a game that follows the Hero's Journey
   and inducing them to reflect on the experience and its relation to the
   learning goal. An alternative strategy is to make participants go
   through a game sequence or interact with a digitally enhanced setup
   (e.g. play-acting with motion capturing and real-time rendering of a
   virtual character) while creating a situation that represents a stage of
   the journey (e.g. ``Refusal of the Call{''}). Both treatments have their
   merits and pitfalls, which are discussed in relation to the identified
   game-based learning scenarios: self-study, blended game-based learning,
   and face-to-face sessions. Furthermore, these scenarios are compared and
   specific techniques (e.g. knowledge transfer by storytelling) and
   boundary conditions, like varying levels in gaming experience between
   participants, are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{The interactive web-based games learning environment ``A Letter - A
   Story{''} is part of an innovative multimedia learning package aimed at
   teaching the Greek alphabet through entertainment. The package is
   produced by the Department of Educational Radio-Television of the Greek
   Ministry of Education, Lifelong Learning and Religious Affairs:
   www.edutv.gr The interactive games are based on the cartoon educational
   television series comprising 24 five-minute animated surrealistic
   stories. Each story corresponds to one of the 24 letters of the Greek
   alphabet. The multimedia package also includes a printed as well as an
   e-book interactive game edition, both of which will be developed in the
   near future. In designing the interactive games, the contemporary trends
   in emergent literacy and the development of educational objectives
   outlined by B. Bloom were taken into account. Although the interactive
   games are targeted at children 5 to 7 years of age; they can also be
   used by younger children, and can be effectively used in a school class
   (smart board), a computer lab, and at home. In that ``A Letter - A
   Story{''} was designed to stimulate most of the senses, it supports
   students' active participation and decision-making, gives control to the
   players, provides opportunities for exploration, reinforces the skills
   of attention, concentration, seeing, listening, and of course, memory.
   Through play and active participation, the interactive games aim to
   reinforce preschool learning skills that lead to progressive written
   literacy in the first grade, thus meeting educational objectives such as
   emergent literacy; phonological awareness of the letters; recognition of
   the written phonetic symbols of the language and their position in
   words; exposure to the written language; understanding the function of
   letters in words; listening; and proper production of sounds. This paper
   presents the pilot application of the interactive web-based games of the
   first episode of the television series ``A Letter - A Story{''} titled
   ``The Uncombed Cow{''}, which corresponds to the Greek letter A and its
   sound.}},

   processing units utilize the Nios processor in FPGA as controller.
   Control unit uses EP1C20 FPGA chip from ALTERA as FFT processing unit so
   as to manage the FIFO operations. This unit can handle 128 FFT
   operations. This system design approach is tested on Matlab. The results
   indicate that the calculation speed is much faster than common DSP

Abstract = {{Cyber technology is a term that refers to a set of digital technologies
   based on emerging media (including virtual reality, social network, and
   multimedia), soft computing, cloud computing, and mobile computing.
   These new technologies have made a profound impact on both corporate
   business operations and the daily lives of ordinary individuals. They
   have also opened up enormous innovative opportunities for both
   educational institutions and individual educators. In many ways they
   will redefine how the education program is to be created and delivered.
   But even more so, they can help reduce operation costs, enhance learning
   effectiveness, and create innovative educational activities that cannot
   be done in traditional education environments. More importantly, these
   technologies will allow schools to provide their students with an
   education that meets modem industrial demands and up-to-date technical
   skills. They will further allow life-long learning to evolve from a mere
   concept to an achievable reality. In this paper, the historical
   relationship between modem technology and modem education will be first
   explored. Then, the recent developments in cyber technology will be
   presented, followed by a discussion of the possible direct impacts and
   challenges that these new technologies may have on future education.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic Government systems are often seen as panacea in the remedy of
   all failings of governance. With a history span of almost two decades,
   eGovernment implementations have often reached dead ends and have
   regularly failed to deliver the promise that the governments that have
   initiated them have made to their citizens. Despite an abundance of
   development models and best case scenarios identified in literature,
   eGovernment services are continually failing to attract the citizens and
   to capture their trust and faith. The main reason quoted for such
   failures is the lack of innovation and inclusivity in the way a service
   is designed and delivered. The digital divide is the major risk of
   marginalizing sectors of society or even whole continents due to lack of
   access to web based services. In the developing world it is mainly the
   lack of, or poor infrastructure that maintains and often widens the
   divide, while in the developed world it is lack of skills and difficulty
   of accessing services that leads citizens to abandon their efforts in
   using services online. Whatever the reason that leads to non-access of
   services the effect is similar and those citizens that fall victim to it
   are increasingly consumed into the trap of the digital divide. Efforts
   and initiatives to address the divide have primarily focused on building
   the infrastructure and providing access to the web. However, the quality
   and accessibility of online services is quite often then reason why
   citizens distance themselves from web-based services and the internet in
   total. This paper attempts to explore the shortfall in criteria for
   evaluating a government's efforts in planning, implementing and
   delivering services that address the operational requirements of
   efficient government, but equally cater for the needs of the citizens as
   end users of the service.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the research conducted to test a visual measurement
   model of the Human Capital and ICT dimensions to develop a framework of
   a Knowledge-based Society for Malaysia towards an Innovative Digital
   Economy. Based on an initial analysis on Knowledge-based Society (KS),it
   was found that Human capital and ICT represent important enabling
   dimensions in a KS framework. The content domain to measure both these
   dimensions were developed based on empirical data and literature
   available. It was then tested using a sample of 450 respondents from
   both government and private sectors as well as NGOs. Four factors were
   extracted from the exploratory factor analysis based on 44 items
   proposed in the survey questionnaire. For the Human Capital dimension,
   42 items were loaded into the four factors, and 2 items were deleted due
   to loadings less than 0.3; whilst for the ICT dimension, 39 items were
   loaded into the four factors and 2 items were also deleted due to
   loadings less than 0.3. The visual measurement model was validated using
   the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The confirmatory factor
   analysis results indicated that generally, Human Capital and ICT
   dimensions provided a reasonably good fit measurement model, thus
   necessary to be used as a guide in the development of a KS framework in
   Malaysia.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of power system, Conventional current transformers
   (CTs) show a growing number of shortcomings. For better performances,
   Electronic Current Transformers (ECTs) are researched to replace CT. But
   high price, unsatisfactory life and unpredictable reliability hold back
   their industrializations. Employing the insulation structure of
   traditional inverted SF6 transformers and the new sensing principle at
   the same time, using high-precision digital integration algorithm which
   has higher precision to extracting the power frequency signal, an
   innovative electronic current transformer is introduced in this paper.
   Test results show that the transformer has high accuracy, low price,
   good stability, wide frequency response and long life.}},

Abstract = {{The cost effective delivery of scientific and policy requirements is a
   key driver for the realization of global sustainability research,
   integrated assessment and supporting innovative systems. The next
   generation of geospatial information infrastructures is proposed as a
   possible solution. Still, questions such as `what does all this mean to
   environmental information systems' and `what is expected to change',
   have only partially been answered. In this paper, we describe the recent
   challenges for eEnvironment services in Europe, specify desired
   capabilities and derive according requirements. We identify affected
   stakeholder communities and depict their involvement in the overall
   value chain of environmental knowledge generation. Specific examples
   illustrate individual needs, while a derived description of the value
   chain indicates more general outcomes. Developmental requirements of
   future information systems are discussed. The presented work answers the
   questions above by bridging the gab between stakeholder needs,
   Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development and higher
   level concepts, such as Digital Earth and Future Internet.}},

   digital marketplace and business models we argue that the features of

   marketplaces. We suggest that before designing a digital marketplace
   initiative it is necessary to undertake a context assessment that
   ensures a better understanding of the firms' preparedness to the usage
   of this kind of platforms in terms of technological infrastructure,
   human resources' capabilities and skills, integration and innovation
   level among firms. It is essential to start with feasible initiatives
   and build up steadily the qualifications necessary for facing
   hindrances. However, starting at the right point and in the right way
   doesn't automatically guarantee success and competitive advantage of
   SMEs, but can represent a way to start admitting the fundamental role of
   the innovation in a high complex environment.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed computing ecosystems' collaboration and mass integration
   between partners require extensive digital identities processing in
   order to better respond to services' consumers. Such processing is
   increasingly implies loss of user's control over identity, security
   risks and threads to privacy. Digital identity is represented by a set
   of linked and disparate documents distributed over computing ecosystems'
   domains. We suggest an innovative approach based on metadata management,
   which would make digital identity documents less visible, foster trusted
   partnership. and therefore encourage trusted collaboration among
   networked computing ecosystems. Furthermore, an XRD-based implementation
   of digital identity document metadata is provided and explained.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an innovative combinational algorithm to improve the
   performance of multiclass problems. Because the more accurate classifier
   the better performance of classification, so researchers have been
   tended to improve the accuracies of classifiers. Although obtaining the
   more accurate classifier is often targeted, there is an alternative way
   to reach for it. Indeed one can use many inaccurate classifiers each of
   which is specialized for a few dataitems in the problem space and then
   s/he can consider their consensus vote as the classification. This paper
   proposes a new ensembles methodology that uses ensemble of classifiers
   as elements of ensemble. These ensembles of classifiers jointly work
   using majority weighted voting. The results of these ensembles are in
   weighted manner combined to decide the final vote of the classification.
   In empirical result, these weights in final classifier are determined
   with using a series of genetic algorithms. We evaluate the proposed
   framework on a very large scale Persian digit handwritten dataset and
   the results show effectiveness of the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The invention of public-key cryptography was of central importance to
   the field of cryptography and provided answers to many key management
   problems for large scale networks. For all its benefits, however,
   public-key cryptography did not provide a comprehensive solution to the
   key management problem. Indeed, the possibilities brought forth by
   public-key cryptography heightened the need for sophisticated key
   management systems to answer questions such as the following:
   `'How can I easily encrypt a file once for a number of different people
   using public-key cryptography?{''}
   ``If I lose my keys, how can I decrypt all of my files that were
   encrypted with those keys?{''}
   `'How do I know that I really have Alice's public key and not the public
   key of someone pretending to be Alice?{''}
   `'How can I know that a public key is still trustworthy?{''}
   The paper discusses public key cryptography and its use in applications
   such as Key Agreement, Data Encryption and Digital Signature. The paper
   discusses some public key algorithms such as DH, RSA, and DSA and also
   gives working explanations of these algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the gap between the innovative potential of
   technologies and their current use in classrooms in Europe. It argues
   that although significant progress has been made in implementing
   technologies in schools, ICT is still mainly used by teachers and
   students outside the school environment. The empirical basis of these
   findings come from a 2009 online survey with 7,659 primary and secondary
   school teachers, and from 80 interviews with educational stakeholders.
   Almost all the teachers surveyed are positive about the potential of ICT
   for learning and are using the internet as a resource for information
   and preparing lessons. The use of ICT in the classroom is less
   widespread. Few of the teachers surveyed recognized the benefits of
   interactive and collaborative technologies for learning. In addition,
   digital games and mobile phones are widely underestimated. These
   findings contrast with the potential of technologies to transform
   educational practices.}},

Abstract = {{Collaboration using social media is a good way of jointly constructing
   knowledge. This study aims at better understanding collaborative
   knowledge construction processes by applying innovative (micro-)task
   detection approaches. We take a closer look at the interactions of a
   user with a shared digital artifact by analyzing the captured
   interaction data. The goal is to identify domain-independent interaction
   patterns, which can serve as indicators for knowledge development
   (operationalized as accommodation). We designed an empirical study under
   laboratory conditions that used our method. The applied task detection
   approach identified accommodation with a rate of 77.63\% without
   resorting to textual features. This result instantiates an improvement
   as compared to a previous study in which the text in focus was
   identified as the feature with best discriminative power. We discuss our
   hypothesis that our method is independent from the used knowledge
   domain.}},

Abstract = {{A growing interest has recently been observed in energy sensitive pixel
   array for high flux X-ray imaging. These devices provide compositional
   analysis of the imaged objects and would be useful in a wide range of
   applications in the field of security, non destructive testing and
   medical imaging. CEA-LETI has developed a CdTe linear array pixel
   detector coupled with a novel 16-channels fast readout circuit. For each
   channel, the signal is continuously digitized by a 100 MHz 12 bit ADC
   and a FPGA controls acquisition and reconstructs the energy spectra on
   256 bins. The readout circuit is coupled with a 3 mm thick CdTe 16
   pixels linear array detector 0.8 mm pixel pitch.
   Thanks to this innovative architecture of the read-out circuit it is
   possible to perform advanced signal processing in real time including
   pile-up rejection and charge sharing correction.
   In this work, we study the possibility of correcting the effect of
   charge sharing. Although the pixel size is relatively large, charge
   sharing events contribute to 40 to 60 \% of all events and significantly
   degrade the spectrometric response of the detector. By summing the
   amplitude pulses from two neighboring pixels, we can recover the
   accurate information from the photon energy. This correction technique
   has been successfully tested with a monochromatic X-ray micro beam at
   ESRF.}},

Abstract = {{The design, production and distribution of small series of health
   fashionable goods for specific target groups of wide impact in terms of
   market for the European industry as elderly, disables, diabetics and
   obese people represents a challenging opportunity for European companies
   which are asked to supply the demand with affordable price and
   eco-compatible products. Added to this challenge, textile, clothing and
   footwear manufactures seek for innovative collaborative networking
   solutions that could provide an entire digital life-cycle for the
   products and services required by the market. Aligned with this need,
   the EU CoReNet project aims to design and develop a new smart
   collaborative consumer-driven framework with the related services and
   components. This paper addresses the multidisciplinary complexity of
   customer-oriented and eco-friendly networks for health fashionable goods
   in particular addressing business requirements analysis, value chain
   issues, co-planning production and co-design topics in collaborative
   business processes tailored for high variability of the consumers demand

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize customer
   understanding that is needed in industrial service innovation and
   development. The empirical study focuses on industrial B2B services that
   support customers' business processes and play a strategic role to the
   customers.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports findings from a Finnish
   research project that aimed at enhancing customer understanding in
   industrial companies developing their services. The research design of
   the study encompassed nine Finnish case studies and an online survey
   targeted to the same industries as those of the case companies mainly in
   Finland, Sweden and Germany.
   Originality/value - The paper suggests a new conceptual construct
   ``Wheel of customer understanding{''} by bringing the concepts of
   customer intelligence, customer knowledge and service management
   together.
   Practical implications - The importance of engaging marketing
   personnel's skills and capabilities at the higher level of the
   organization as well as in service innovation and development already at
   the beginning of the development project was identified in the study.
   Furthermore, the study revealed the need for better customer information
   collecting practices and information utilization in the service
   development. Today, information and capabilities needed in service are
   scattered in digital systems and embedded in individuals from different
   functions. The tacit knowledge of. floor level. personnel is not
   adequately utilized in creating and maintaining customer understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The objective of this study is to investigate how non-profit
   institutions, especially higher educational business schools, utilize
   social media in their promotion mix. We aim at revealing the differences
   in digital marketing communication strategy management between Finnish
   business schools and the world's most prestigious business schools.
   Design/methodology/approach - We propose benchmarking case study as a
   methodological approach. Social media practices are investigated by
   observing the world's top ten business schools, and the results are then
   compared to a Finnish business school.
   Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence that the top ten
   of business schools are very active in social media whereas its Finnish
   counterpart is not. The leading business schools have clearly invested
   time and money in social media to serve their customers and interest
   groups better.
   Practical implications - The outcomes of the application reveal that the
   world's leading business schools actively take advantage of social media
   in their communication whereas its Finnish counterpart just has started
   social media activities. In the future the Finnish schools as well
   should start to use social media more actively in their marketing and
   promotion. According to this study managing co-creation of marketing
   communication needs considerable attention from business schools'
   managers because of customers' important role in knowledge management}},

Abstract = {{The widespread adoption of digital mobile devices has paved the way for
   the development of many innovative applications. Mobile devices provide
   a lot of services in commercial environment like Mobile ticketing,
   Mobile banking, Mobile location based services, Mobile auctions, Mobile
   purchasing and so on. One area in which a mobile device can provide
   tremendous benefit is in the area of health care. Till today nurses use
   the pager system only for informing the doctor about emergency condition
   of a patient. Even today they still rely on the paper based file system
   to maintain the patient's health records. With the usage of mobile
   devices, we can improve the health care system by incorporating such ICT
   technology as research is underway in improving the services in the
   Health industry, which is evident from the literature. With all these in
   mind, we here have developed a mobile health record system which would
   allow doctors and nurses to directly access a patient's health record
   from a mobile device form almost anywhere, giving them the ability to
   initiate treatment and also be more efficient in providing the best care
   to patients. Our proposed system also aims in entering and deleting the
   patient's record too, based on the need. The implementation has been
   carried out using JADE-LEAP agent development kit in Java enabled
   handset.}},

Abstract = {{Complex systems are mainly integrated in CMOS technology, facing issues
   in advanced process nodes, in particular for power consumption and heat
   dissipation. Magnetic devices such as Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ)
   have specific features: non-volatility, high cyclability (over 10(16))
   and immunity to radiations. Combined with CMOS devices they offer
   specific and new features to designs. Indeed, the emerging hybrid
   CMOS/Magnetic process allows integrating magnetic devices within digital
   circuits, modifying the current architectures, in order to contribute to
   solve the CMOS process issues. We present a high performance innovative
   non-volatile latch integrated into a flip-flop which can operate at high
   speed. It can be used to design non-volatile logic circuits with ultra
   low-power consumption and new functionalities such as instant startup.
   This new flip-flop is integrated as a standard cell in a full Magnetic
   Process Design Kit (MPDK) allowing full custom and digital design of
   hybrid CMOS/Magnetic circuits using standard design tools.}},

Abstract = {{This article explains the working methodology followed to carry out a
   project in which the 3D laser scanner survey of San Martin's Church
   (placed in Plaza Juan Bravo, in the historic city centre of Segovia
   Spain), has been undertaken. There is also a virtual tour through the
   nearby streets, which lead us to the Jewry Museum, going through the
   Paseo del Salon. The final aim is to obtain derivative CAD products such
   as technical plans, solid models and different videos, as well as a
   simplified 3D model. This project has been funded by the MICINN
   (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion {[}Department of Science and
   Innovation]), within the project ADISPA, BIA2009-14254-C02-01, and will
   constitute a mathematical base of a scenario of augmented reality which
   will make accessibility for disabled people possible. This will be
   framed within the ``PATRAC{''} project (PATRIMONIO ACCESIBLE: I+D+I para
   una cultura sin barreras {[}ACCESSIBLE HERITAGE: R+D+I for a culture
   without barriers]).}},

Abstract = {{In the last ten years, the world has witnessed immense advances in media
   and Internet technologies. Through examination of the use of social
   media, virtual collaboration platforms, and live streamed access to
   images, graphics, and video, this chapter offers a new approach to
   education which calls for leaders to use technology to inform and
   connect teachers, students, and the community. Similar to the changes in
   the entertainment industry, educational institutions can adopt an
   interactive, collaborative, and socially aware model of knowledge
   creation to engage more students and encourage innovation in issues of
   global scope. The value of making this change is examined through
   curricula that stress multidisciplinary projects and provide hands on
   experiential learning. Lacking the market forces of the entertainment
   industry, being primarily supported by public funds, education
   institutions face more legal, political and business model barriers.
   However, the benefits of digital media so far outweigh the risks that
   the next decade will see the emergence of learning environments that
   provide as much of a quantum leap in pedagogy as did the advent of the
   printing press more than five hundred years ago. Examples of the
   emotional appeal of digital media combined with the relatively low cost
   of scaling with the Internet are provided as impetus to overcome
   resistance to change in creating new institutions of learning.}},

Abstract = {{Superimposition-effect jacquard fabric is a kind of digital jacquard
   fabrics featuring novel effect that only can be approached by digital
   layered-combination design mode. In this paper, design principle and
   method of superimposition-effect jacquard fabric are introduced with
   appropriate design illustrations. The innovative fabrics constructed
   with one warp and two/four wefts were produced by full-colour compound
   structure under layered-combination design method. Design principle and
   method are that designing digital image into grey mode and then
   replacing greyscales of grey image by tailor-made gamut weaves,
   resultant fabric where the colour threads juxtapose in an even orderly
   fashion, e.g., 1:1, 1:1:1:1, can express superimposition-effect after
   combination of fabric structures. The colouring weft yarns on face of
   fabric cannot be covered by each other so that full-colour effect of
   weft yarn in each layer of compound structure is realized, and final
   jacquard fabric is capable of expressing superimposing-like effects with
   mega-level mixed colours on the face of fabric. It is envisaged that the
   results obtained from this study are of tremendous benefit to the
   creation of new jacquard fabric designs, toward the fulfilment of the
   ever-demanding requirement of today's fabric creation.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-warp jacquard tapestry, a typical product of traditional western
   cotton fabrics, features low density. Its colour presentation is based
   on warp colouring technology and grouping colour warp yarns. However,
   Chinese silk brocade is a kind of traditional Chinese brocades figured
   by colour wefts with high density. In this paper, an innovative design
   principle and method on 4-colour warps jacquard silk fabric with high
   density was proposed based on the application of digital design
   technology after the analysis of structure and product technical
   characteristics both in western multi-warp tapestry and Chinese silk
   brocade. Four basic colours of physiology (red, yellow, green and blue)
   and two achromatic colours (black and white) were employed for designing
   warp and weft yarns. The principle and method of structural design was
   based on the design of gamut weaves and weave databases. There were
   three parts during structural design using warp colouring technology,
   i.e., face weave design, backing weave design and stitching weave
   design. As a result, weaving pattern produced on the face of fabric was
   capable of imitating the colour and pattern effect of created by a
   digital image. And the resultant fabric structure met the requirement of
   balanced interlacement and posed no problem in mass production.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the increasing role of Web 2.0 tools as enabler of SME
   collaboration. The author analyses how innovative Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) like Digital Business Ecosystems (DBE)
   could help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to reduce the gap with
   large corporations. Nowadays Web 2.0 is permitting to perform some tasks
   unimaginable only few years ago. Individuals have evolved from a passive
   to an active role and currently are the main actors creating Internet
   content. However, compare to individuals, business still in the first
   stage of Internet revolution and are not taking profit of all the
   possibilities of Web 2.0. Most of them are using these tools only to
   improve existing procedures but not for creating new ways of doing
   business or interact with other SMEs. In this scenario, DBE has emerged
   as a new paradigm to solve some of these problems and to permit
   businesses behave in a similar way to what individual users are doing
   nowadays. In this work, after an analysis of the nature of co-operative
   behaviour and the importance of Web 2.0 facilitating its emergence by
   promoting self-organisation of their participants, the author evaluates
   this new paradigm in order to determine if it is a valid approach for
   SMEs. Finally, based on previous works of the author about the needs of
   SMEs, the study concludes with the definition of MADBE, an innovative
   multi-agent Digital Business Ecosystems inspired by natural ecosystems
   which aims to facilitate collaboration between SMEs.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing use of low cost imaging devices and the innovations in
   terms of media distribution technologies induce a growing interest on
   technologies able to protect digital visual media against malicious
   manipulations of the visual contents. One of the main problems addressed
   in this research area is the blind detection of traces of forgery on an
   image obtained through the internet. Specifically, in this paper we
   consider the context of communications, where malicious image
   manipulations should be detected by a receiver. In the proposed method,
   an image hash based on the Bag of Visual Words paradigm is attached as
   signature to the image before transmission. The forensic hash is then
   analyzed at destination to detect the geometric transformations which
   have been applied to the received image. This task is fundamental for
   further processing which usually assumes that the received image is
   aligned with the original one, as in the case of tampering detection
   systems. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms
   state-of-the art methods by obtaining a good margin in terms of
   performances.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of network technology and the advent of the
   information society, cyberspace has become the new place of exchanges,
   participation in economic and political life. The appearance of network
   lead the transformation of traditional social to network society,
   individual users are increasingly becoming the ``new digital
   democracy{''} citizens, which will help build an interactive platform
   for e-government between civil and government, to promote the
   enhancement of civic awareness. However, the network is double-edged
   sword, its effect on civil society building and stability in both
   positive and negative side, therefore, we should give full attention and
   play a positive role in online media, and strengthen guidance and
   management work together to promote civil society and build Chinese
   characteristics. Network leads new public management scholars on the
   media and government media management, public management model and
   service-oriented future values of government and direction of new
   research. This article explores the establishment of the network
   management of multiple subjects just for the participation of community

Abstract = {{Traditional approaches to educating university students, where the
   instructor ``transmits{''} content from the front of the class to
   students, are still popular at universities in Australia. It is clear
   that these approaches are increasingly failing to engage a digitally
   connected generation of social learners. Traditional lectures provide
   students with little opportunity to explore lecture content, collaborate
   with peers, or interact with the instructor. Monash University has been
   developing a collaborative learning environment that encourages students
   to participate in a personal learning journey independent of their
   physical location. This is enhanced by flexible learning spaces designed
   to facilitate a peer-based educational approach. Initial results
   indicate that these educational innovations are transforming the
   pedagogy, space, and technology of education to better meet the needs of
   twenty-first century learners.}},

Abstract = {{With the continuous innovation of advanced Internet technology,
   Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system emerges as an important information-sharing
   system for the widespread exchange of resources and information among
   thousands of users. In this study, we applied properties of arrangement
   graphs to design a newly structured overlay system, named as Arrangement
   Graph-based Overlay (AGO). In such an overlay, the IDs between the two
   adjacent nodes differ only one digit and thus, the joining and leaving
   processes are easy while keeping the low maintenance cost. Furthermore,
   the searching performance in the AGO system is efficient, adaptive and
   scalable. Analyses of experimental results show that the establishment
   of the system and the node searching could achieve better performance
   than those obtained in the Chord system.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In veterinary medicine computed tomography (CT) imaging has
   gained importance in recent years, especially for diagnostics in pets,
   but also during the course of experimental studies in animal models for
   human medicine. In this study the applicability of CT as an imaging
   method for the depiction of the porcine thorax and in particular of the
   pig lung was evaluated. Material and methods: CT examinations were
   performed with 11 healthy pigs of two age groups. For evaluation, CT
   findings were related to clinical, radiological, macroscopical,
   microscopical, and microbiological findings. Results: Clinically
   relevant anatomical structures were determined and recorded using
   transverse slices. In ventral recumbency, lung parenchyma density
   measurements at the levels of the second, fourth and seventh thoracic
   vertebrae resulted in significantly higher densities of the ventral in
   comparison to those of the dorsal lung quadrants. Conclusion and
   clinical relevance: Computed tomography is a valuable tool for the
   high-contrast depiction of the porcine lung without superposition. In
   future studies this CT reference base for unaltered pig lungs may
   facilitate the identification of anatomical structures within the
   porcine lung as well as the assessment of pathological lung alterations.}},

   built to rescue itself from the unknown states for returning normal

   innovatively provided to detect the fast electrical transients during
   the system-level ESD events. The output digital thermometer codes of the
   transient-to-digital converter can correspond to the different ESD
   voltages during system-level ESD tests. The proposed solution has been
   applied in some display panels to automatically recover the system
   operations after system-level ESD test.}},

Abstract = {{In social groups, some individuals have a better say than the others.
   Thus, when it comes to sharing new ideas and making decisions, their
   voice is better heard over the others. This can be considered as a
   situation, where power dynamics are applied in social learning. With the
   advancements of social media, organizations and the knowledge management
   community have started thinking of creating platforms to co-create value
   by getting the involvement of multiple stakeholders for learning and
   innovation. Such platforms results larger societies of stakeholders with
   divergent interests, where power dynamics are more likely to occur.
   Given that the influence of power is not adequately researched in social
   and organizational learning domains, in this paper, we present an
   agent-based computational model of a learning organization to evaluate
   the impact of individuals' informal power on learning outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative designs of transport vehicles need to be validated in order
   to demonstrate reliability and provide confidence. The most common
   approaches to such designs involve simulations based on Finite Element
   (FE) analysis, used to study the mechanical response of the structural
   elements during critical events. These simulations need reliable
   validation techniques, especially if anisotropic materials, such as
   fibre reinforced polymers, or complex designs, such as automotive
   components are considered. It is normal practice to assess the accuracy
   of numerical results by comparing the predicted values to corresponding
   experimental data. In this frame, the use of whole field optical
   techniques has been proven successful in the validation of deformation,
   strain, or vibration modes {[}1]. The strength of full-field optical
   techniques is that the whole displacement field can be visualized and
   analyzed. By using High Speed cameras, the Digital Image Correlation
   (DIC) method can be applied to highly non-linear dynamic events and
   deliver quantitative information about the three-dimensional
   displacement field {[}2].
   The objective of the present paper is to integrate full-field optical
   measurement methodologies with state-of-the-art computational simulation
   techniques for non-linear transient dynamic events, in order to improve
   both methods. Whilst the impact of homogeneous panels is a relatively
   straightforward task, the simulation of impact and subsequent
   development of damage in a composite panel is probably at the leading
   edge of current knowledge.
   In this frame, flat rectangular composite plates of dimensions 0.2 x 0.1
   m, as well as, a car bonnet frame structure of dimensions about 1.8 x
   0.8 m, shown in Fig.1a and Fig.2a, respectively, are considered. Both
   structures have been manufactured of PolyPropylene (PP) and PolyAmide
   (PA) glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic materials. Aiming to assess
   the panels and bonnet energy absorbing capability, they have been tested
   in hard-body low velocity, low energy, mass-drop impact loading, in a
   drop-tower, with impact energies ranging from 20.J to 200J. In parallel,
   simulation models of the plates and the car bonnet frame have been
   developed, as shown in Fig. 1b and 2b. Both structures are modelled
   using layered shell elements. A node-to-surface contact definition is
   introduced for modelling the physical contact of the impactor to the
   bonnet.}},

Abstract = {{Considering general weakness in the current development of assembly, the
   paper analyses the structure of former fuselage and the function of
   assembly. After a thorough investigation and research on extensive
   analysis, this paper completes three-dimension structural design of
   former fuselage assembly using digital flexible assembly technology. The
   three-dimension structural design includes the design of transmission,
   the design of power sector and the design of actuator combining
   innovative design methods. The paper completes modeling of front
   fuselage assembly based on the modular design thought. The module mainly
   includes the base module, the guide module, the driver module, the
   execute module and the connection module. And then, the paper
   accomplishes overall tooling of front fuselage assembly and collision
   analysis of assembly by using CATIA software. Finally, the paper also
   completes making the animation by using 3DVIA Composer software. The
   animation depicts the movement of former fuselage assembly and completes
   the dynamic simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Creation, ownership and protection of Intellectual Property (IP) has
   become a complex system with the all pervasive technology changes in the
   field of Electronics, communication, Information Technology,
   Biotechnology, Nano-technology and Bio-informatics. Intellectual
   Property legislation has undergone a sea-change after its compliance
   with Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
   (TRIPS). The IP Management is being introduced as a course curriculum
   through a number of full-fledged diploma and degree courses as a faculty
   of Legal Study in India. The course is of immense value even for the
   researchers, technologists, bureaucrats and other professionals for
   their survival in a knowledge economy. Due to lack of proper educational
   framework other than Law, they fail to appreciate the newly devised
   management techniques to be implemented by a number of legal,
   techno-legal or digital/electronic mechanism. This techno-legal approach
   in IP pedagogy is considered to show a new direction to cater a much
   wider section of users.
   The paper aims to develop an open courseware based infrastructure to
   facilitate teaching learning process in IP. While developing the
   syllabus, lecture plan, practical assignment and case study for the
   paper `Techno-legal Dimension of IP Rights', it has been observed that
   there are some conceptual gaps between the theoretical principles, a
   legislative framework and equivalent global aspects provided through a
   number of relevant web services. These problems and some of their
   solutions implemented successfully are discussed as a case-study in this
   paper. An innovative evaluation process and statistical feedback system
   is also developed. Being Chief Investigator of the project, `Development
   of educational Content and Associated Depository of Web Services for
   Intellectual Property Rights', various IPR tools and databases are
   exploited in the curriculum on IPR of one semester duration. The
   curriculum designed is a combination of the following:
   1. Survey course (IP as a faculty of law and its implication in WTO-WIPO
   regime) aiming to learning breadth and complexity of application of IP
   Laws and rules.
   2. Specialized Course (Application sector wise in-depth study with
   economic implication) to give an overview of IP Law.
   3. Advance Seminars
   4. Practice courses:
   - Practical computer based assignment and training
   - Preparation of the case studies
   The major objective of the curriculum is to achieve a sound base of IPR
   Strategy for engineers and researchers in science and technology with
   the four above stated pillars. The concept learning through
   well-balanced courses becomes effective to accommodate the changes in IP
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Development of two innovative linacs is discussed. (1) High-efficiency
   normal-conducting accelerating structures for ions with beam velocities
   in the range of a few percent of the speed of light. Two existing
   accelerator technologies - the H-mode resonator cavities and transverse
   beam focusing by permanent-magnet quadrupoles (PMQ) - are merged to
   create efficient structures for light-ion beams of considerable
   currents. The inter-digital H-mode accelerator with PMQ focusing
   (IH-PMQ) has the shunt impedance 10-20 times higher than the standard
   drift-tube linac. Results of the combined 3-D modeling for an IH-PMQ
   accelerator tank - electromagnetic computations, beam-dynamics
   simulations, and thermal-stress analysis - are presented. H-PMQ
   structures following a short RFQ accelerator can be used in the front
   end of ion linacs or in stand-alone applications like a compact mobile
   deuteron-beam accelerator up to a few MeV. (2) A large-acceptance
   high-gradient linac for accelerating low-energy muons in a strong
   solenoidal magnetic field. When a proton beam hits a target, many
   low-energy pions are produced almost isotropically, in addition to a
   small number of high-energy pions in the forward direction. We propose
   to collect and accelerate copious muons created as the low-energy pions
   decay. The acceleration should bring muons to a kinetic energy of
   similar to 200 MeV in about 10 m, where both an ionization cooling of
   the muon beam and its further acceleration in a superconducting linac
   become feasible. One potential solution is a normal-conducting linac
   consisting of independently fed 0-mode RF cavities with wide apertures
   closed by thin metal windows or grids. The guiding magnetic field is
   provided by external superconducting solenoids. The cavity choice,
   overall linac design considerations, and simulation results of muon
   acceleration are presented. Potential applications range from basic
   research to homeland defense to industry and medicine.}},

Abstract = {{As the tectonic plates of technology shift across human networks,
   dedicated and determined educators understand that the integration of
   digital mediated texts and the new literacies competencies they
   engender, amount to little without pedagogical ingenuity, innovative
   adaptation, and creative application. This article is a response to the
   rapidly expanding digital engagement of youth and the young. New
   literacies proponents are looking at literacy practices and literacy
   events of the young and through their scholarship they call on schools
   and educational institutions to embrace the new media landscape and its
   participatory cultures for the learning potential they offer. Research
   out of the UK based London Knowledge Lab, tells us that whilst the young
   and youth are increasingly engaged in digital environments there are
   only `a few embryonic signs of criticality, self-management or
   metacognitive reflection' (Luckin, Clark, Graber, Logan, Mee \& Oliver,
   2009).}},

Abstract = {{Most forestry machines being produced today include a personal computer
   that monitors and controls the harvester head, and an information system
   that stores data on every action the driver or the machine performs.
   Information and communication technologies (ICTs) thus provide an
   opportunity to improve efficiency and competitiveness and possibly also
   opens up new ways of working for actors in the forestry industry. The
   purpose of this study is to investigate how ICT can enable the
   transformation from selling products to selling services in the forestry
   industry. We investigate such transformation through conducting a case
   study including a number of actors from the forestry industry in
   northern Sweden. First, we investigate the barriers for establishing an
   open innovation system in forestry. Then we describe how the use of ICTs
   can enable the establishment of such a system. The case study shows that
   the forestry industry as a whole is dominated by the salient traditional
   value chain where the raw materials are refined to paper products and
   that many of the actors are committed to a closed innovation paradigm.
   We argue that the ICT component in forestry machines constitutes a
   latent potential that can be fully captured in the context of an open
   innovation system.}},

Abstract = {{To make human computer interfaces more immersive and intuitive, a new
   dimension could be added. Real-time brain state recognition from EEG
   including emotion recognition and level of concentration recognition
   would make an access to information more adaptive and personalized.
   Modern EEG techniques give us an easy and portable way to monitor brain
   activities by using suitable signal processing and classification
   methods and algorithms. We proposed a new subject-dependent
   fractal-based approach to brain state recognition and innovative
   applications based on EEG-enable user's interaction. The algorithms of
   the ``inner{''} brain state quantification including emotion recognition
   would advance research on human computer interaction bringing the
   proposed novel objective quantification methods and algorithms as new
   tools in medical, entertainment, and even digital art methodology
   applications, and allowing us an integration of the brain state
   quantification algorithms in the human computer interfaces. In this
   paper, we describe our fractal-based approach to the brain state
   recognition and its EEG-enable applications such as serious games,
   emotional avatar, music therapy, music player, and storytelling.}},

Abstract = {{As far as the use of the Internet for election campaigns is concerned,
   the most interesting experiences seem to draw an evolution from the
   traditional party organization to a more innovative digital
   participative organization. On the one hand, the associative dimension
   of the parties, based on membership and on local rootedness (party on
   the ground), is deemed to be in crisis by a large number of scholars
   (Kartz and Mair 1995). This decline is linked to a loss of legitimacy
   and trust in political parties (Dalton 2002). On the other hand, the
   evolution of the Internet creates the opportunity for supporters to find
   the operative and organizational tools necessary to get involved in
   consensus-developing activities. In this scenario it would be simplistic
   to consider the Internet a mere means of communication, instead we need
   to focus on its mobilization, organization and participation potential.
   This paper focuses on the way of generating participation on Facebook,
   by analysing UK General Elections 2010. In particular, the analysis
   investigates which are the communication strategies used by the three
   main party that are able to elicit participation of Facebook users.
   The study is based on data collected on the Facebook pages of the three
   main candidates: on this basis, we verify the following research
   questions.
   1. Participation level increases with the number of posts written by the
   party?
   2. Participation level increases by writing call to action posts?
   3. Participation level increases by writing posts about the candidate?
   4. The issues addressed in the post influence the participation level?}},

Abstract = {{Social networking is changing the world of international government,
   finance and business. Amongst other things members of social networks
   are demanding greater transparency in corporate and government
   institutions. Research shows that there is a change in the balance of
   power in decision making and this in turn is leading to more innovative
   and sustainable solutions. Community led (bottom - up) innovation
   projects using social networking technology are emerging as a leading
   source of creative power engaging the wisdom of crowds as opposed to the
   single - mindedness of policy makers. Research shows that transparency,
   shared commitment, empathy and trust play an essential role in their
   success. Consequently, for community led networks to be effective, their
   members must be competent in building and maintaining excellent inter;
   intra; and extra - personal relationships. Analysing data from multiple
   sources participating in the European Commission's ``Digital Agenda
   2020{''} programme, the paper concludes that the success of this and
   programmes like it will depend on the desire of members to acquire
   history - making identities by maintaining identity defining commitments
   across the network. Implications for theory and research are discussed.}},

   historical property of images, and builds on users' visual experiences
   with certain prior imagery. Historicity of digital visuality seems to be

   This paper suggests to take into account not only aspects from image
   theory but also art history and science studies that suggest ways of
   dealing with the historicity of images for successfully creating
   ``new{''} visual form. Furthermore HCI's own history bears opportunities

Abstract = {{This paper deal with crystallizers diagnostics, which is part of
   continuous casting devices. The diagnostics is made by software analysis
   of vibration spectrums respectively of acoustics emission. These
   emissions can cause when unexpected situation occur. Principle of this
   method is analysis of spectrum of gained signal, its processing in
   Matlab environment and subsequent verification in Statistica software.
   Last step is most important, because thanks to it we are able to tell,
   with certain confidence, in which state the examined object occur. If
   the initial neural network has good starting data, it is able to analyze
   other samples and with successfulness over 70\% tell, in which state the
   current objet remain, eventually if occur a critical (limiting) state
   (untighten screws in critical spots and so on). Data from accelerometer
   (microphone) are evaluated in Matlab environment and special filter is
   applied on them. Thos filter will highlight relevant data. Analog signal
   is digitized with special I/O module from National Instrument company.
   Type prefix is NI PCI 6221. From FFT result is obvious correlation of
   power spectrum and the inner state of examined object. Far in this paper
   will be described process of solving this problematic and current
   result. To achieve sufficient results, we are using multilayer neural
   networks with help of Statistica program. Resulting diagnostics system,
   which should be the final solution, should dramatically innovate and
   rationalize optimization problems of preventive maintenance of
   crystallizers desks, where principle of control on maximum relevant data
   basis should take apart. Relevant data are obtained from maintenance
   department.}},

Abstract = {{The domain of learning context for people with special needs is a big
   challenge for digital media in education. Usage of mobile technology is
   growing, and it affects other technologies by bringing in new innovation
   and methods. The reason for this growth is not only ease of use and
   mobility, but also improvements in interaction and functionality in
   different contexts. Meanwhile, the difference between cell phones and
   handheld computers is becoming less and less evident. Such convergence
   offers the opportunity of ubiquitous learning ``anytime, anywhere{''},
   so that the learners do not have to wait for a fixed time and place for
   learning to take place. Mobile learning can be seen as a bridge between
   higher level of abstracted knowledge and practical experiences, which
   supports the personalization in a learning process.}},

Abstract = {{As we move more to a digital economy and integrate technology every more
   completely in all aspects of life there is a looming crisis for a
   growing number of increasingly marginalized individuals. The
   accessibility technologies we have are meeting the needs of only some,
   at high cost - and will not work with many new technologies. In
   addition, the pace and path of technological change predestines these
   approaches to fail in the very near future. At the same time, the
   incidence of disabilities is increasing as our population ages. The same
   technical advances however hold the key for a radical paradigm shift in
   our approach to accessibility that can harness the pace of innovation
   and have it work for us rather than against us. Proposed is the
   development of a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) that can
   tap the unprecedented ability to pool resources and match demand with
   supply enabled by the Cloud to deliver accessibility to every individual
   where they need it, when they need it and in a way that matches their
   unique requirements; automatically so that they do not need to
   negotiate, explain, qualify or justify.}},

Abstract = {{Modular design rules are rooted in a tradition of process design for
   physical production. In response to an emerging information systems
   research agenda for design logic in the realm of services and digital
   goods, and through the lens of dynamic capabilities theory, the research
   presented here re-examines traditional modular design in the context of
   a service-centric volatile marketplace. A complex adaptive systems
   simulation artifact from prior literature is augmented with a novel
   operationalization of market volatility, and a series of hypotheses are
   tested that demonstrate a need for revision of modular design rules in a
   dynamic context. Rules that have historically isolated the modular
   design decision to characterizations of task interaction are expanded to
   incorporate a new objective: adaptive parity with the environment. It is
   the goal of this continuing research stream to make early contributions
   in the recently proposed agenda for new organizing logic in digital
   innovation and services.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a simple method for learning a dictionary of deformable
   patches for simultaneous shape recognition and reconstruction. Our
   approach relies on two key innovations introducing a pre-defined set of
   transformations on patches to enrich the search space, and designing a
   parallel framework on Graphical Processors (GPUs) for matching a large
   number of deformable templates to a large set of images efficiently. We
   illustrate our method on two handwritten digit databases - MNIST and
   USPS, and report state-of-art recognition performance without using any
   domain-specific knowledge on digits. We briefly show that our dictionary
   has many desirable properties: it includes intuitive low- and mid-level
   structures, it is sufficient to synthesize digits, it gives sparse
   representations of digits, and contains elements which are useful for
   discrimination. In addition, we are the first dictionary learning method
   to report good results when transferring the learned dictionary between
   different datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Remote Engineering is one of the future directions for advanced
   teleworking/e-working environments not only in engineering and science
   (economics, informatics), but also in all other fields affecting
   society. In the last decade, considerable advances have been made
   regarding the design and development of remote and virtual laboratories,
   but it requires a lot of new specialists. As an attempt to improve the
   situation, several European universities started a joint Master Study
   Program in Remote Engineering (MARE) including in its curriculum a
   course of ``Rapid Prototyping of Digital Systems{''} designed by the
   Ilmenau University of Technology in Germany. This course required an
   extensive use of laboratory equipment to carry out several exercises and
   therefore the implementation of an Online Lab turned out to be a good
   solution to ensure better learning outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The high-performance Geospatial Information System (GIS) is expected to
   provide an innovative infrastructure for Earth sciences, enabling
   near-real-time data and processing services. Stereo-matching software
   has often been used in generating a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from a
   pair of satellite imagery data sets to compute height from a parallax
   views using two photographic images. There is a need to reduce the
   computation time required for processing large images. We optimize
   stereo-matching software on multi-core/many-core processors, including
   Xeon, Cell and GPGPU. We describe optimization approaches of the
   correlation calculation part which occupied about 55\% of the ovarall
   computation time. After porting and optimizing software for
   multi-core/many-core processors, we achieved processing time of 4.79
   second (Xeon), 2.28 second (Cell) and 0.97 second (GPGPU) on each

Journal = {{IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition by researchers, businesses, and
   policymakers of the value of integrating the systems of systems of which
   cities are comprised. It is less clear how this can be achieved, in
   practice, from a technical and organizational standpoint. This paper is
   concerned with one element of this integration, namely, the integration
   of physical infrastructures and digital technologies. We argue that
   technological innovation has historically been crucial to the
   development of cities and will also be crucial in future smart cities.
   Cities become ``smarter'' when they make use of the increased
   availability of data and analytical techniques to improve effectiveness
   and efficiency. The better integration of physical and digital
   infrastructures can significantly contribute to these objectives. The
   engineering tools and models used in the design, construction, and
   operation of a city infrastructure can now utilize a suite of
   technologies and processes to assist this integration. This is
   particularly necessary and challenging when the collaborative
   involvement of diverse parties is required and different vintages of
   infrastructure and technology must be combined. This paper is based on
   case studies of IBM and the construction company Laing O'Rourke. It
   provides examples showing how these ``innovation technologies'' improve
   opportunity and reduce risk in physical-digital integration and provides
   questions for further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The thematic of Digital Educational Resources (DER) and digital
   educational repositories at primary and secondary education levels is of
   growing centrality in the educational themes in the international
   debate. In order to make it easier for teachers and students to find the
   best and relevant learning resources and to encourage teachers' uptake
   of innovative materials and learning styles, authorities and/or
   companies in European countries have launched web based educational
   repositories. Following this trend, about two years ago, three major
   institutions in Portugal have launched their repositories: Portal das
   Escolas (ME), Casa das Ciencias (FCG) and BOA (INESC-ID). After
   examining the state of the art of educational repositories in Europe, it
   was found that those three Portuguese repositories are not mentioned in
   recent European reports and so the study here presented seemed to be
   very relevant. This work aims to develop a descriptive and comparative
   study, in order to characterize the reality of the Portuguese
   repositories and compare it with European examples of good practices. To
   guide this investigation, the following question was theorized: ``How
   are the Portuguese institutional repositories, for primary and secondary
   education levels, positioned in what concerns international quality
   criteria?{''} Our methodology design is a qualitative one and of type i)
   descriptive, as it is intended to characterize the main Portuguese
   institutional DER repositories for primary and secondary school
   education, aiming to assess the key dimensions that affect their quality
   and ii) comparative since it has in view comparing those repositories
   with reference European ones. In this sense, Lektion in Sweden and
   Scoilnet, Portal for Irish Education in Ireland are considered. The
   study was undertaken from the view of the DER producers and users. As a
   tool for data collection it was used a framework of analysis built on
   the Guia para la Evaluacion de Repositorios Institucionales e
   Investigacion (GERII), a joint publication of the Spanish Ministry of
   Science and Innovation and other organizations in the fields of
   Education, Science and Technology (Villar et al, 2010). The GERII guide
   includes a set of guidelines for the creation and evaluation of a
   repository, bringing together a battery of 31 evaluation criteria,
   distributed over seven dimensions that any repository must accomplish to
   meet quality and therefore was considered an excellent basis for our
   analysis. Comparing the three Portuguese repositories, target of this
   study, with two reference European repositories in order to
   contextualize the national reality in the international arena will stand
   for the Portuguese institutions that hold the repositories as an
   opportunity for improvement. Thus, Portuguese teachers will have an
   increased chance to access an eclectic collection of quality resources,
   in order to diversify their teaching strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Digital libraries are an important headstone for distant education.
   Thereby, modern digital libraries encounter not only the classical
   provision of documents, but also other related services like publishing
   portals or lists of hot topics. Another upcoming challenge is the
   connection with Web 2.0. Thus, the functionalities of online libraries
   will change and becoming more and more complex. Accordingly, the
   usability evaluation of these complex functionalities has to be assured
   and adapted to the new challenges. The proposed methodology of
   sophisticated usability evaluation follows a spiral model for
   prospective recommendations. The usability evaluation is done by an
   iterative process. This is in line with the state of the art and most
   modern models in usability engineering. However, in contrast to the
   existing models, we propose an explicit combination between systematic
   quantitative investigations and focused usability studies. The proposed
   multi-method approach addresses different important elements of a
   sophisticated scientific usability evaluation. The core elements of the
   cyclic process are repeated usability benchmarking, focused usability
   studies, derivation of recommendations and decision on the planned
   improvements in the face of the overall strategy. The repeated
   benchmarking allows a quantitative measurement of advantages and
   drawbacks as well as improvements and impairments. The quantitative
   benchmarking data can also help assigning the gravidity of
   usability-problems or the importance of a specific innovation. Depending
   on the requirements of the users and the developments of the digital
   library, the specific usability-studies could be qualitative or
   quantitative or a mixture of both. The overall aim of these studies is
   the formulation of concrete practical recommendations. The
   recommendations have to be aligned with the technical possibilities and
   strategic decisions. After the improvements and innovations were
   implemented, a new benchmarking cycle can take place. The four elements
   can be flexible combined. This procedure ensures not only a holistic and
   sophisticated usability evaluation, but also the openness for new
   challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. The described approach
   will be exemplarily explained by the ZBW - Leibniz Information Centre
   for Economics.}},

Abstract = {{Teacher Training has undergone major changes in recent years, with the
   development of digital information transfer, virtual learning
   environments(VLE) and simulations integrated in learning management
   systems having a significant effect on it. Online resources like Edu 2.0
   and Second Life (SL) encourage a sense of collaboration and community
   which now needs to be embraced through teaching and learning practice.
   Researchers, as a result of 4 years research study of global e-learning
   training needs in 25 countries analyzed the needs of the teachers'
   e-education requirements and their preferred e-learner environments.
   Although, there were some common needs like ``knowledge and skill of
   preparing e-quizzes{''}, they found that there was a divide among
   teachers' skills and knowledge's. Hence, the necessary steps to develop
   proper ICT infrastructure required for e-Learning are taken. As a result
   of all the findings in the literature, courses are decided to be
   delivered to bridge these. A global strategy is decided for moving
   towards and encouraging teachers towards deploying e-Learning for their
   courses. Syllabus is prepared, online evaluation is required and
   suggestions are taken from experts coming from different walks of life,
   from 25 countries. This process ended in 4 months. After having
   rewritten the syllabus, course material is prepared and carefully proof
   read by English teachers and e-education experts. The course environment
   is used by 51 experts and is redesigned by the researchers according to
   their suggestions. After 6 months of work, the last form of VirtualNeu

Abstract = {{This paper is a work-in-progress: it outlines the earliest stages of a
   larger inquiry into the affordances of academic blogging as a vehicle
   for professional development. During this time I have been immersing
   myself in the online environment and grappling to figure out what
   academic blogging means to me. To offer the reader a rich insight into
   this experience I present a reflective account together with an analysis
   of these formative experiences of social media. Higher Education (HE) in
   the Western world is currently grappling to position itself in a
   shifting landscape of economic rationalisation, too-fast-to-keep-up
   technological innovation, and escalating marketisation (OLTF 2011).
   Blended learning and social media are being explored as potential
   solutions to these pressures. In this paper I explore the potential
   opportunities and challenges afforded by academic blogging for
   professional development. The concepts I have used as a framework for
   discussion are: exposure, engagement and networking. It is argued that
   these features combined with the non-hierarchical structure of social
   media (Siemens and Weller 2011) mean that academic blogging has the
   potential to create a self-organising, highly responsive and digitally
   reflexive staff, for a relatively low cost. However, not all academics
   or institutions will be comfortable with the time investment or risk
   associated with writing in the public domain. However, if institutions
   refuse to accept blogging as a form of scholarly activity then academics
   may struggle to position themselves as public intellectuals in the
   digital age (Kirkup 2010).}},

Abstract = {{Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is widely adopted in
   neuro-engineering to partially alleviate diseased functions in the
   brain, retina and cochlea. We present a 32-channel wirelessly powered
   constant current stimulator and low power recording amplifier for FES
   based applications. The biphasic stimulator utilizes innovative
   techniques for matched positive/ negative currents and thus improves
   charge balance. Electrode discharging scheme is added for stimulation
   artifact suppression. An improved low power amplifier is incorporated
   for evoked response measurements. Electrical performance is
   characterized using simulated electrode-electrolyte impedance.
   Closed-loop stimulation and recording experiments have been performed.
   Stimulation current magnitudes of 2 mu A-200 mu A and up to 400Hz rate
   have been realized. Theory and limitation of discharging scheme is
   explored while suppressing artifacts down to 3ms. Alternate anodic-first
   and cathodic-first stimulation pulses are adopted for enhanced charge
   balancing. The low power amplifier exhibits gain of 1200 and bandwidth
   350Hz-1.02KHz. A multiplexer/ demultiplexer is used to share the
   front-end among 32 electrodes. The inductively coupled wireless energy
   harvester works at 125KHz-135KHz that can remotely deliver 1.4mW at 1cm
   distance to an equivalent of 10K load. The system can accommodate
   multielectrodes with impedance up to 100K Omega. The entire hybrid
   analog-digital system consumes 360 mu W quiescent power. Miniaturization
   makes it suitable for in-vivo applications.}},

Abstract = {{Tandem-L is a mission proposal for an innovative interferometric L-band
   radar instrument that enables the systematic monitoring of dynamic Earth
   processes using advanced techniques and technologies. The mission is
   science driven aiming to provide a unique data set for climate and
   environmental research, geodynamics, hydrology and oceanography.
   Important application examples are global forest height and biomass
   inventories, measurements of Earth deformation due to tectonic processes
   and/or anthropogenic factors, observations of ice/glacier velocity field
   and 3-D structure changes, and the monitoring of soil moisture and ocean
   surface currents. The Tandem-L mission concept consists of two
   cooperating satellites flying in close formation. The Pol-InSAR and
   repeat-pass acquisition modes provide a unique data source to observe,
   analyse and quantify a wide range of mutually interacting processes in
   the bio-, litho-, hydro- and cryosphere. The systematic observation of
   these processes benefits from the high data acquisition capacity and the
   novel high-resolution wide-swath SAR imaging modes that combine digital
   beamforming with a large reflector antenna. This paper provides an
   overview of the Tandem-L mission concept and its main application areas.
   It is planned to realise the Tandem-L mission in cooperation with
   NASA/JPL. The mission concept was developed in detail in a joint
   two-year pre-phase A study and it will be further studied in the next 18
   months. This will allow a cost-effective implementation, whereby each
   partner contributes its predevelopments and experience. According to
   current planning, the Tandem-L satellites could be launched in 2019.}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces and studies a new transistor layout style, called
   Fish SOI MOSFET using 3D numerical simulations, where two trapezes
   compose the transistor gate area, generating a ``smaller than (<){''}
   mathematical signal shape. This innovative layout structure is an
   evolution of the Diamond SOI MOSFET. The Fish structure was carefully
   designed to be used in the digital integrated circuits applications,
   because now its channel length can be implemented with the minimum
   dimension allowed by the manufacture process, in contrast to Diamond
   transistor in which this is not possible. The Fish transistor also uses
   the Longitudinal Corner Effect (LCE) to increase the resultant
   longitudinal electric field along to the channel length, that results in
   an improvement in the average carriers drift velocity in the channel, in
   the drain current, in the transconductance and in the on-state series
   resistance parameters.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing demand to limit energy consumption in Western
   countries. Actual challenges are to provide products compatible with
   classical lamp socket and voltage. Emerging technologies are Compact
   Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) and LEDs, but there are some drawbacks mainly
   concerning CFL and compatibility with dimmers. In this paper we present
   the design of an innovative LED driver integrated circuit based on mixed
   analog/digital control. We present also the methodology for integrating
   the digital computation by means of a Field Programmable Gate Array
   (FPGA) based development platform allowing to precisely adapt and test
   the parameters needed for maximum efficiency and dimming compatibility
   before integration into an IC. The VHDL-based design for the digital
   part allows final implementation by means of synthesis to either an FPGA
   or a full custom netlist. Experimental results are given to demonstrate
   the validity of the proposed circuit and methodology of implementation.}},

Abstract = {{As integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing entered the nano-scale era,
   defect observability has greatly diminished. As a result, test-fail data
   diagnosis and mining are playing an indispensable role in providing
   feedback for yield learning. Accurate simulation of defect behavior is
   vital to this process but, unfortunately, cannot be achieved with
   simulation at the logic-level alone. This work proposes a framework to
   enable fast and accurate defect simulation, by making use of existing
   and well-developed mixed-signal simulation technology (traditionally
   used for design verification). While previous work has considered this
   topic before, the innovation here centers on two aspects: (i) accuracy
   resulting from defect injection taking place at the layout level, (ii)
   speedup resulting from careful and automatic partitioning of the circuit
   into digital and analog domains for mixed-signal simulation, and (iii)
   complete automation that involves defect injection, design partitioning,
   netlist extraction, mixed-signal simulation, and test-data extraction.
   The mixed-signal framework developed can be applied in a variety of
   settings that include diagnosis resolution improvement, defect
   localization, fault model evaluation, and virtual failure data creation.
   Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is scalable to
   handle large designs efficiently. A second set of experiments
   demonstrates how defect localization can be dramatically improved (>
   53\%) by more accurate defect simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Computed tomography (CT) requires high-speed detector with wide dynamic
   range (WDR) and high linearity. CMOS CT detectors have been demonstrated
   with WDR and quantum-limited noise. However, existing CMOS CT detectors
   have low linearity, which cause artifacts during the image
   reconstruction. They also require high-resolution off-chip
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to quantize the WDR. In this work, a
   new synchronous partial quantization technique is developed for
   highly-linear CMOS CT detectors. System-level and circuit-level
   innovations enable the new detector to extend the dynamic range with
   constant potential well size, which results in high linearity. The new
   monolithic detector includes a low-resolution ADC to quantize the
   residual voltage. A prototype detector is fabricated in a 0.35 mu m CMOS
   process. The new detector has 75.5\% geometrical detective quantum
   efficiency with the ADC and the voltage reference. Measurements show the
   detector can quantize signal currents from 6 pA to 63.4 nA with relative
   deviation lower than 0.06\% at 1.1kHz frame rate, which removes the
   detector-induced artifacts after the image reconstruction. The
   electronic noise of the detector is smaller than the X-ray Poisson noise
   in the whole signal range. The minimum detector noise is 0.6 pA(rms). As
   a result, the detector achieves 16.7 bits dynamic range.}},

Abstract = {{Smart cities have been recently pointed out by M2M experts as an
   emerging market with enormous potential, which is expected to drive the
   digital economy forward in the coming years. However, most of the
   current city and urban developments are based on vertical ICT solutions
   leading to an unsustainable sea of systems and market islands. In this
   work we discuss how the recent vision of the Future Internet (FI), and
   its particular components, Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of
   Services (IoS), can become building blocks to progress towards a unified
   urban-scale ICT platform transforming a Smart City into an open
   innovation platform. Moreover, we present some results of generic
   implementations based on the ITU-T's Ubiquitous Sensor Network (USN)
   model. The referenced platform model fulfills basic principles of open,
   federated and trusted platforms (FOTs) at two different levels: the
   infrastructure level (IoT to support the complexity of heterogeneous
   sensors deployed in urban spaces), and at the service level (IoS as a
   suit of open and standardized enablers to facilitate the composition of
   interoperable smart city services). We also discuss the need of
   infrastructures at the European level for a realistic large-scale
   experimentally-driven research, and present main principles of the
   unique-in-the-world experimental test facility under development within
   the SmartSantander EU project.}},

Abstract = {{In regional innovation systems (RIS), there is a need to identify the
   knowledge bases that firms draw upon and differentiate innovation
   policies accordingly. From this premise, the main aim of this paper is
   to compare two Finnish industries, intelligent machinery and digital
   content services, that draw upon different kinds of knowledge bases. The
   three main research questions discussed here are as follows: (a) do
   knowledge sources of the firms representing two different industries
   with two different knowledge bases differ from each other, and how; (b)
   how do the knowledge sources differ between different types of RIS and
   (c) what kind of extra-regional pipelines do the three different cases
   have? The RIS under scrutiny represent fragmented metropolitan (Helsinki
   metropolitan area), old industrial (Tampere region) and organizationally
   thin (South Ostrobothnia) RIS.}},

Abstract = {{Visual Effects Production, despite being fundamentally an artistic
   endeavor, is a very technically oriented business. Like many other
   businesses in their early ages, it still requires constant innovation
   and in many cases a great amount of craftsmanship. Given these premises,
   most VFX companies (especially those at the leading edge) are hungry for
   novel and better solutions to the problems they encounter everyday. Many
   published machine vision algorithms are designed to be real-time and
   fully automatic with low computational complexity. These attributes are
   essential for applications such as robotic vision, but in most cases
   overkill or ill-conditioned for Motion Picture Digital Visual Effects
   facilities, where massive computation resources are commonplace and
   expert human interaction is available to initialise algorithms and to
   guide them towards an optimal solution. Conversely, motion pictures have
   significantly higher accuracy requirements and other unique challenges.
   Not all machine vision algorithms can readily be adapted to this
   environment. This talk outlines the requirements of visual effects and
   indicate several challenges and possible solutions involved in adopting
   image processing and machine vision algorithms for motion picture visual
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the findings from an in-depth, exploratory research
   project designed to understand how consumers create, use and behave in
   response to content on consumer review websites. Based on data from
   members of a consumer review site, it seeks to capture the experiences
   and behaviours of consumers, and to convey their voice as users of
   social media and other digital sources. Consumers, who are part of
   Generation C, constitute a significant proportion of the membership on
   consumer review websites. In this paper, the nature of this generational
   category is discussed and situated within their use of social media.
   Reflecting calls in this journal for an innovative and open research
   agenda, the methodology is designed to reveal new forms of informational
   behaviour among this group of consumers, who are at the forefront of
   social media adoption. The research reveals that activities within
   consumer review sites are embedded in broader social media behaviours,
   and that this influences the creation and use of consumer-generated and
   marketing content. The identification of such new forms of consumer
   activity forms the basis for further research and the incorporation of
   Generation C into successful marketing strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Blow moulding is a process whereby a cylindrical parison is extruded
   first, then pinched between the two halves of a mould and, finally,
   blown into the product. Parison size and shape result from complex
   interactions between mandrel and die geometries, processing parameters
   and viscoelastic properties of the polymeric material. Moreover, parison
   size changes with time due to sag. An innovative, contactless and online
   measurement technique of the parison is shown to be an effective tool to
   measure precisely parison diameter and thickness and to capture
   dimensional changes with time. This technique employs laser lighting of
   the parison and hinges on the refractive properties of molten polymer.
   Images taken with a digital camera are processed to give a precise
   measurement of diameter and thickness, at different time step during
   extrusion. Thus, parison swell and sag have been recorded for a
   commercial HDPE. Influence of processing parameters such as the
   rotational screw speed or die gap width can be brought forward.
   Thickness swell is found to possess a different behaviour from diameter
   swell. Swell is a purely viscoelastic phenomenon, therefore requiring a
   numerical modelling with an integral viscoelastic constitutive equation.
   On the other hand, sag has been measured and could be modelled from a
   Newtonian perspective using one dimensional convected coordinates. A
   sagging susceptibility coefficient of the polymer is deduced.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to achieve the long-standing dream of realizing scalable
   learning algorithms for networks of spiking neurons in silicon have been
   hampered by (a) the limited scalability of analog neuron circuits; (b)
   the enormous area overhead of learning circuits, which grows with the
   number of synapses; and (c) the need to implement all inter-neuron
   communication via off-chip address-events. In this work, a new
   architecture is proposed to overcome these challenges by combining
   innovations in computation, memory, and communication, respectively, to
   leverage (a) robust digital neuron circuits; (b) novel transposable SRAM
   arrays that share learning circuits, which grow only with the number of
   neurons; and (c) crossbar fan-out for efficient on-chip inter-neuron
   communication. Through tight integration of memory (synapses) and
   computation (neurons), a highly configurable chip comprising 256 neurons
   and 64K binary synapses with on-chip learning based on spike-timing
   dependent plasticity is demonstrated in 45nm SOI-CMOS. Near-threshold,
   event-driven operation at 0.53V is demonstrated to maximize power
   efficiency for real-time pattern classification, recognition, and
   associative memory tasks. Future scalable systems built from the
   foundation provided by this work will open up possibilities for
   ubiquitous ultra-dense, ultra-low power brain-like cognitive computers.}},

   application and a Digital Storage Oscilloscope with NI LabVIEW Signal
   Express. In the first step, students have calibrated wavelength in terms
   of x- position using a standard Mercury light source. Then this
   calibration has been used to display and measure the emission spectra of
   various light sources. Various measurements performed include
   characterizing various LEDs in terms of wavelengths emitted for use in
   measurement of Planck's constant, measuring characteristic wavelengths

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the rationale and the preliminary results of a
   research project devoted to the appropriate and innovative use of
   remotely sensed data for water management in semi-arid regions. The
   study area is the district of Yatenga, northern Burkina Faso in the
   sub-Saharan belt of West Africa, where extreme climate conditions cause
   several problems: drought, floods, soil erosion. The data comes from the
   Italian Space Agency (ASI) Cosmo-Skymed program, which provides high
   resolution (1 meter) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Crucial
   peculiarity of the project is the use of open source software for data
   processing and hydrological modeling. Two different hydrological models
   have been selected. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to be
   employed for the design of appropriate water management plans and soil
   erosion mitigation measures. The Width Function Instantaneous Unit
   Hydrograph (WFIUHD) model can to employed for the prevision of flood
   events and therefore for the planning of risk mitigation. The paper
   shows the preliminary results of the project obtained by the processing
   of the first available high resolution SAR data. In particular, the
   first step is the realization of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). GIS
   tools have been set up for the DEM-processing in order to derive the
   needed hydro-morphological basin attributes to support the
   geo-morphological rainfall-runoff (WFIUHD) modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Globalization and digitization have reshaped the communication
   landscape, affecting how and with whom we communicate, and deeply
   altering the terrain of language and literacy education. As children in
   urban contexts become socialized into communities of increasing cultural
   and communicational connectivity, complexity, and convergence (Jenkins,
   2004), and funding for specialist second language (L2) support declines,
   classrooms have become linguistically heterogeneous spaces where every
   teacher is a teacher of L2 learners.
   This article has two purposes: The first is to give an overview of the
   concept of multimodal literacies, which utilize diverse media to
   represent visual, audio, gestural, spatial, and tactile dimensions of
   communication in addition to traditional written and oral forms (Cope \&
   Kalantzis, 2009a). Since the New London Group's manifesto on
   multiliteracies in 1996, which merged language and literacy education
   agendas in L2 teaching, language arts, media literacy, and cultural
   studies, new basics have developed that apply to all classrooms and all
   learners. Second, this article reviews and reports on innovative
   pedagogical approaches to multimodal literacies involving L2 learners.
   These are grounded theoretically (Cope \& Kalantzis, 2009a, 2009b;
   Kress, 2003, 2010; New London Group, 1996) and epistemologically (de
   Castell \& Jenson, 2003; Gee, 2009, 2010; Kellner, 2004; Lankshear \&
   Knobel, 2003, 2006).}},

Abstract = {{Design for (every)one is a macro framework that attempts to identify,
   share and use `hidden solutions' in community-based rehabilitation
   contexts and translate them into disruptive assistive devices built with
   local resources or appropriate technology. Within healthcare contexts,
   local solutions are frequently more effective as they reflect the
   physical, emotional and cognitive needs of specific patients and engage
   all stakeholders in a specific local context. By using open horizontal
   innovation networks, where assistive devices can be easily shared and
   physically hacked by other allied health professionals, general patterns
   can be detected and translated into standard universal design objects.
   This generative design thinking approach is more than feasible with
   digital trends such as crowd sourcing, user-generated content and peer
   production. Cheap and powerful prototyping tools have become easier to
   use by non-engineers; it turns them into users as well as
   self-manufacturers of their personal assistive artefacts. This paper
   discusses the different aspects of this open innovation process within a
   `design for disability' context and suggests the first steps in an
   iterative co-design methodology that brings together expertise from
   professional designers, occupational therapists, patients and other
   stakeholders. The overall aim is to gain more insights into designing
   qualitative occupational experiences for disabled users.}},

Abstract = {{With the widely use of healthcare information technology in hospitals,
   the patients' medical records are more and more complex. To transform
   the text-or image-based medical information into easily understandable
   and acceptable form for human, we designed and developed an innovation
   indexing method which can be used to assign an anatomical 3D structure
   object to every patient visually to store indexes of the patients' basic
   information, historical examined image information and RIS report
   information. When a doctor wants to review patient historical records,
   he or she can first load the anatomical structure object and the view
   the 3D index of this object using a digital human model tool kit. This
   prototype system helps doctors to easily and visually obtain the
   complete historical healthcare status of patients, including large
   amounts of medical data, and quickly locate detailed information,
   including both reports and images, from medical information systems. In
   this way, doctors can save time that may be better used to understand
   information, obtain a more comprehensive understanding of their
   patients' situations, and provide better healthcare services to
   patients.}},

   versions, with four and twelve analog inputs. The 4-input module
   replaces the original 21-bit version, produced until 2009. The 12-input
   module is intended to be deployed in small-aperture seismic arrays. The
   whole set consists of four 3-channel detached modules that can be
   interconnected with the main module using a cable of up to 100 m in
   length. This design increases signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by placing the
   A/D part as close to the seismograph as possible in order to transmit
   digital data for storage. All channels are sampled coherently so that
   all four sensors are automatically synchronised. It allows the detection
   of local events even though the sync-Signal is absent. In other words,
   the 12-input module is suitable for ad-hoc field measurements even in
   places where there is no GPS signal. All arrays operated by the
   Institute of Rock Structure and Mechanics (IRSM) are going to be
   upgraded to use these modules and some new sites will also be set-up
   with this innovative equipment (e.g. Lazy in Western Bohemia and Dobra
   Voda in Slovakia).}},

Pages = {{488-505}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study proposes a mobile learning model that employs
   digital libraries to support investigative learning activities. A
   student-centered mobile learning activity with self-guided exploration
   for physical ecology observation has been conducted to demonstrate the
   benefits of using digital libraries to support investigation-based
   ecology learning activities.
   Design/methodology/approach - An investigation-based mobile learning
   model is proposed and an experiment is designed to show the
   effectiveness of the learning model, in which the students are asked to
   answer a series of questions by observing the real-world learning
   objects and searching for supplemental materials from a digital library.
   Findings - The instructional experiment conducted in an elementary
   school with 64 sixth grade students shows that the innovative approach
   is able to improve the learning achievement, learning effectiveness, as
   well as the learning attitudes of the students.
   Practical implications - The findings of this paper imply that the use
   of the investigative learning model will significantly promote the
   utilization rate of digital libraries.
   Originality/value - An investigative model for using digital libraries
   to support mobile learning is proposed in this paper. It provides good
   guidance to teachers for designing learning activities with digital
   libraries, and a good way for students to learn, utilizing the materials
   in digital libraries.}},

Pages = {{506-522}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss different attempts
   that have been made to bridge the digital divide in Bangladesh, with
   special focus on the Community Information Centers (CICs), which are
   playing a unique and innovative role in reducing the digital gap.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a case study and is based on
   a survey method for collecting information through telephone (outbound
   call center). Besides these, internet, personal visits (as a project
   member) and other secondary sources such as research reports,
   Grameenphone internal reports, articles are used.
   Findings - This paper highlights the existing initiatives which are
   bridging the break to build digital Bangladesh and focuses on how CIC is
   bridging the divide.
   Research limitations/implications - This study will usher a new era for
   its internal values and the findings can be used by the advisory
   committees. The outcome of this study may, however, empower policy
   makers to make a decision and it is suggested that discussion and
   further writings are needed to bridge the digital divide in Bangladesh.
   Originality/value - This paper is one of the very few studies which
   focus on the prospects of Community Information Centers in Bangladesh,
   particularly breaking the digital discrimination between rural and urban
   areas.}},

Number = {{2-4}},
Pages = {{109-122}},
Abstract = {{The literature on disruptive technologies has previously stated that
   those innovations often emerge in low-end segments or in new markets and
   as the performance improves it eventually displaces the old technology.
   This article aims to explain how and why a technology may prosper in
   high-end or mainstream markets despite its initially lower performance
   and does so through three in-depth case studies. The findings suggest
   that those technologies may compensate the inferior performance by
   simplifying and removing work for customers. For instance, digital
   imaging emerged in high-end segments since these customers were willing
   to trade-off the initially lower image quality in order to remove the
   usage of film. Based upon these results, the paper concludes that the
   literature on disruptive technologies needs to maintain a more nuanced
   view of value and how it is created and distributed inside the
   customer's organisation.}},

Journal = {{ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{255-271}},
Abstract = {{This article presents an overview of the growth of internet piracy in
   the global marketplace. The ethical perceptions (or lack of) of the
   younger generation is addressed, in terms of their willingness to
   consume counterfeit goods on the web. Firms face the task of educating
   the consumer that downloading music, software, movies and the like,
   without compensation, is unethical. This awareness is critical for
   decreasing the demand for counterfeit goods in the virtual marketplace,
   where a consumer can exhibit a rogue behaviour with a limited fear of
   prosecution. We address the pyramid of internet piracy, which
   encompasses sophisticated suppliers/facilitators, such as the Warez
   group. Recent sting operations, such as Operation Buccaneer, are also
   depicted to highlight successful tactical manoeuvres of enforcement
   agencies. An overview of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the No
   Electronic Theft Act is included to debate the controversy surrounding
   this legislation. A discussion of enterprise enforcement mechanisms and
   novel anti-piracy technology for cyberspace is provided to reveal some
   of the tools used to fight the pirates, such as innovations in digital
   watermarking and NEC's recently announced video content identification
   technology. Enterprise information systems and its interdependence on
   the internet are also demanding new technologies that enable internet
   investigators to rapidly search, verify and potentially remove pirated
   content using web services. The quality of service of web services
   designed to efficiently detect pirated content is a growing
   consideration for new anti-piracy technology.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Digital media has been firmly established in contemporary
   society and now is a time of unprecedented growth and innovation in the
   world of digital technologies. Conversely, before and during this
   period, physical public space has diminished in quantity and quality.
   The purpose of this paper is to suggest that creating and intensifying
   connections between digital space and physical public space might open
   up new possibilities to reactivate urban places.
   Design/methodology/approach - Historically, art has provided a territory
   in which new ideas could be introduced and tested. For example, the
   great landscape gardens of Versailles provided a model for the later
   development of the urban structure of Paris. Many artists in the last
   few decades have experimented with how digital/virtual environments
   might be related to real physical space. It is reasonable to assume that
   these experiments will be applied in broader contexts and will most
   likely have impact at the scale of the city. This essay contextualizes
   current interactive installations within an overview of selected
   forward-looking precedents.
   Findings - The analysis of early experiments in collapsing the realms of
   virtual and physical environments demonstrates that the implications of
   a fuller integration have not reached its potential in contemporary
   applications.
   Originality/value - Walter Benjamin's speculation that media could
   contribute to urban space of heightened interaction is a promise still
   waiting realization. Art installations that promote interactive
   relations between the spectator and physical space are used as
   instigations for speculations at an urban scale. In particular,
   attention is given to the development of improved interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Therapy management is a critical clinical process in terms of patient
   safety, traceability, and accountability. Chemotherapy is even more
   challenging, because of different professionals working together, strict
   protocols, dangerous procedures, costs. Thus, process control,
   consolidated organizational knowledge and ICT supporting tools become
   essential for safety and management. Unfortunately, literature does not
   provide an integrated approach to these issues; national networks of
   innovation and research can provide better help. Fondazione IRCCS
   Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milan leads ``Towards a complete
   competence framework and an integrated solution for patient safety in
   chemotherapy{''}, a project funded by the Italian Ministry of Health now
   assessing guidelines, process configurations, risk levels and ICT
   solutions, in over 20 Italian healthcare organizations. Major results of
   organizational and technology assessments are here discussed, focusing
   on the Istituto as a major example of process reengineering and ICT,
   dealing with Pharmacy centralization, advanced automation,
   digitalization of drug management, also drawing interesting
   considerations about impacts and benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to evaluate and improve FPGA-based
   digital circuits, which implement recursive specifications. Recursive
   sorting algorithms over binary trees are considered as a case study to
   evaluate and demonstrate new techniques and their advantages. Since
   recursive calls are not directly supported by hardware description
   languages, they are implemented using the model of a hierarchical finite
   state machine (HFSM). The paper presents analysis and comparison of
   alternative and competitive techniques for describing recursive
   algorithms in hardware. The experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed innovations allow to achieve better performance. Obviously, the
   results of this paper are not limited to recursive sorting alone. They
   have a wider scope and can be applied effectively to numerous systems
   that implement recursive algorithms over tree-based data structures.

   TECHNOLOGIES}},

Pages = {{29+}},
Abstract = {{1. For example, more than 330,000 customers started to use mobile
   broadband in Chile in 2008-09 (Anta and Albi, 2010).
   2. As mobile phone technology is evolving quickly (for example, with the
   arrival of smart-phone technology), the concept of a mobile phone itself
   is changing from a simple instrument of communication to a far more
   sophisticated digital tool with multiple applications. Although the
   overall access gap between countries of Latin America and the Caribbean
   and OECD countries might be narrowing, a burgeoning mobile phone
   ``quality{''} gap cannot be disregarded, if, as expected, new mobile
   phone technologies are spreading faster in the OECD countries than in
   Latin America and the Caribbean.
   3. The available international indicators for access to computer
   hardware do not control for differences in the ``quality{''} of the
   equipment, so the difference between Latin America and the Caribbean and
   OECD regarding information storage, processing capacities, and
   applications may not be fully reflected in the raw numbers. A recent
   study shows that the differences in hard disk storage capacity per
   capita between OECD and Latin American and Caribbean countries
   dramatically increased, rising from 3,780 megabits in 1996 to 750,000
   megabits in 2006 (Peres and Hilbert, 2009)
   4. Beyond penetration rates, consider Latin America's considerable delay
   in terms of connection quality. Vicente and Gil-de-Bernabe (2010)
   computed a ``Broadband Quality Score,{''} an index that combines three
   key performance parameters for the quality of a connection (upload and
   download speeds and latency). Brazil and Mexico, the only two Latin
   American countries included in the index, performed poorly, ranking
   thirtieth-eighth and fortieth out of forty-two countries, respectively.
   5. A national innovation system is the `` network of institutions in the
   public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate,
   import, modify and diffuse new technologies{''} (Freeman, 1987, p. 1).
   6. For example, Stoneman, Battisti, and Girma (2010) report that India
   did not match the level of phones per capita in the United States as of
   1910 until 90 years later.
   7. Following Pritchett, Woolcock, and Andrews (2010), this study first
   determined the annual rate of progress in diffusion for each country in
   the region, computing the difference between the current and initial
   rates of penetration and then dividing it by the number of years since
   the moment when the technology was made available: 1975 for PCs, 1980
   for mobile phones, 1988 for the Internet, and 1998 for broadband. For
   fixed telephony, the initial values reported by ITU in 1960 or the
   earliest year were used. Second, the digital gap in 2008 between the
   OECD average and each country of Latin America and the Caribbean was
   computed, and this gap was divided by the diffusion annual rate of
   progress (obtained from the previous step). This methodology renders
   information about the number of years it would take for each country in
   the region to reach current OECD average levels under a
   business-as-usual scenario.
   8. The ICT production function suffers from economies of scale and scope
   in the different services, generating a type of natural monopoly barrier
   to entry. Efficient provision of ICT services requires adequate
   regulation in order to keep prices close to the average production
   costs.
   9. Trade openness is included under the assumption that in countries
   with more open economies, inhabitants will value connectivity more for
   business purposes.
   10. This result is in line with the literature on the determinants of
   ICT adoption using microdata, which highlight the strong role played by
   income and education (see, for example, Vicente and Lopez, 2006; Grazzi
   and Vergara, forthcoming).
   11. Data on broadband are not included, as household surveys do not
   report data on the access of this technology yet.
   12. Households in the highest quartile in the OECD have 2.25 times more
   access to the Internet than households in the lowest quartile;
   inequality is about ten times lower than the averages of Latin America
   and the Caribbean (EUROSTAT, 2009; ECLAC and ICA, 2010).
   13. The use of the number of subscriptions as an indicator of the
   diffusion of a technology in a country is open to criticism. These
   supply-side data collected by Internet operators have many limitations,
   mainly due to possible double counting of individuals with more than one
   subscription, the lack of distinction between commercial and private
   subscriptions, the presence of inactive accounts, and the sharing of a
   subscription among multiple users (see ITU, 2010).
   14. The EU15 comprised the following fifteen countries: Austria,
   Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
   Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (OECD,
   2007).
   15. When comparing Internet use between Latin America and the Caribbean
   and Europe, the data do not control for the duration of use, as such
   information is not available. Thus, the gaps discussed in this section
   are likely to be severely underestimated.
   16. Robert Solow, ``We'd Better Watch Out,{''} New York Times Book
   Review, July 12, 1987, p. 36.
   17. There are a few exceptions. See, for example, the work of Gordon
   (2000, 2003).
   18. Providers of ICTs services tend to focus on the development of
   solutions for large firms and traditional sectors, such as finance,
   insurance, logistics, agro-industry, and wholesale trade, but the supply
   of solutions is limited for SME needs. Working with this group of firms
   is normally complex because the group is heterogeneous and transaction
   costs are high.
   19. Data are from the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey.
   Survey questions ask for response on a scale from a low of 1 to a high
   of 7. For each survey question, individual responses from the 2008 and
   2009 editions of the survey are combined and aggregated in order to
   produce country scores. For more information on the Executive Opinion
   Survey, see chapter 1 (WEF, 2010).
   20. Productivity is measured by income per capita. Human capital is
   proxied by years of schooling. Regulatory quality and infrastructure are
   measured by Internet subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.}},

Abstract = {{In optical security (protection against forgery and counterfeit of
   products and documents) the problem is not exact reproduction but the
   production of something sufficiently similar to the original. Currently,
   Diffractive Optically Variable Image Devices (DOVID), that create
   dynamic chromatic effects which may be easily recognized but are
   difficult to reproduce, are often used to protect important products and
   documents. Well known examples of DOVID for security are 3D or 2D/3D
   holograms in identity documents and credit cards. Others are composed of
   shapes with different types of microstructures yielding by diffraction
   to chromatic dynamic effects.
   A maskless interferometric lithography technique to generate DOVIDs for
   optical security is presented and compared to traditional techniques.
   The approach can be considered as a self-masking focused holography on
   planes tilted with respect to the reference optical axes of the system,
   and is based on the Scheimpflug and Hinge rules. No physical masks are
   needed to ensure optimum exposure of the photosensitive film. The system
   built to demonstrate the technique relies on the digital mirrors device
   MOEMS technology from Texas Instruments' Digital Light Processing.
   The technique is linear on the number of specified colors and does not
   depend either on the area of the device or the number of pixels, factors
   that drive the complexity of dot-matrix based systems. The results
   confirmed the technique innovation and capabilities in the creation of
   diffractive optical elements for security against counterfeiting and
   forgery.}},

Title = {{Ergonomics Methods and the Digital Factory}},
Booktitle = {{DIGITAL FACTORY FOR HUMAN-ORIENTED PRODUCTION SYSTEMS: THE INTEGRATION
   OF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Pages = {{23-34}},
Abstract = {{This chapter discusses the ergonomics approach used to develop the
   digital factory solution for the European-funded DiFac project
   (IST-5-035079). The main aim of DiFac was to develop an innovative
   solution for small-to-medium enterprises which, based on a foundation of
   good human factors, would support their activities in the digital
   factory. Ergonomics focuses on understanding people and their
   capabilities to improve their interaction with hardware, software, other
   people, and their environments. The ergonomics approach of participatory
   design was applied to the iterative development of the technologies.
   This chapter describes this approach and the ergonomic methods selected
   to assess the various iterations of the DiFac technologies. A case study
   is provided illustrating the specific improvements to an emergency

Abstract = {{The high rate of innovations being introduced on high-tech products
   requires fast and efficient approaches for information and knowledge
   transfer, especially in the area of service and maintenance tasks. The
   Digital Factory, with its methods and tools, can help to improve the
   service quality and at the same time reduce the costs associated with
   maintenance operations. The developed tool for augmented reality (AR)
   based maintenance supports the creation of AR-based workflows and their
   execution within a collaborative environment. Targeted to small and
   medium enterprises, the DiFac development is based on the three
   theoretical pillars of presence, collaboration, and ergonomics. The
   achieved results are continuously validated by end users and human
   factors experts. This chapter presents the conceptual training framework
   developed within the DiFac project, its realization for the task of
   AR-based maintenance, and the evaluation of the developed components.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the Semantic Web (SW) in eGovernment is reviewed. The
   challenges for the introduction of SW technology in eGovernment are
   surveyed from the point of view both of the SW as a new technology that
   has yet to reach its full potential, and of eGovernment as a complex
   digital application with many constraints, competing interests, and
   drivers, and a large and heterogeneous user base of citizens. The spread
   of SW technology through eGovernment is reviewed, looking at a number of
   international initiatives, and it is argued that pragmatic
   considerations stemming from the institutional context are as important
   as technical innovation. To illustrate these points, the chapter looks
   in detail at recent efforts by the UK government to represent and
   release public-sector information in order to support integration of
   heterogeneous information sources by both the government and the
   citizen. Two projects are focused on. AKTive PSI was a proof of concept,
   in which information was re-represented in RDF and made available
   against specially created ontologies, adding significant value to
   previously existing databases. Steps in the management of the project
   are described, to demonstrate how problems of perception can be overcome
   with relatively little overhead. Secondly, the data.gov.uk project is
   discussed, showing the technical means by which it has exploited the
   growth of the Web of linked data to facilitate re-representation and
   integration of information from diverse and heterogeneous sources.
   Drawing on experience in data.gov. uk the policy and organizational
   challenges of deploying SW capabilities at national scales are discussed
   as well as the prospects for the future.
   This chapter will consider the specific issues pertaining to the
   application of the Semantic Web (SW) to eGovernment, and look at some of
   the ways that the Semantic Web community has tried to address them. The
   first section will examine some of the challenges and opportunities for
   Semantic Web technologies within eGovernment, and review progress made.
   The next section will describe a detailed example of the UK's
   data.gov.uk program to represent government data on the linked data Web.
   It will also review pilot work that preceded the data.gov.uk work and
   which was important in providing insights as to the pragmatic deployment
   of SW technologies in the public sector. A set of resources will be
   given for further study, before a discussion of likely future directions
   of research in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The People's Collection Wales aims to collect, interpret,
   distribute and discuss Wales' cultural heritage in an online
   environment. Individual users or local history societies are able to
   create their own digital collections, contribute relevant content, as
   well as access digital resources from heritage institutions. This paper
   aims to provide an overview of the development of the People's
   Collection Wales, which is being funded through CyMAL: Museums, Archives
   and Libraries Wales.
   Design/methodology/approach - Work on digitising various collections in
   Welsh cultural heritage institutions, such as Culturenet Cymru, the
   National Library of Wales, the National Museum Wales, and the Royal
   Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales has been in
   progress since the 1990s. An overview of this work is given, along with
   details of how the People's Collection Wales project has developed
   between 2009 and 2011.
   Findings - Material available from the People's Collection Wales is
   available in a variety of media, including: film; images; video and
   audio clips; maps; photographs; and text. The web site also uses global
   positioning system technology to allow users to travel over the
   landscape of Wales, and view artefacts in three dimensions.
   Originality/value - People's Collection Wales is an example of a service
   resulting from a convergence of libraries, archives and museums, and
   which showcases user involvement in the creation of digital content. A
   number of innovative applications, including mobile technologies, are
   being implemented within the project.}},

Abstract = {{The model of learning best suited to the future may be one which sees
   learning as the process of managing the different kinds of participation
   an individual might have in complex social systems. Learning capability
   and engagement is thus dependent on the relationship between an
   individual identity and social systems. We report on the incorporation
   of machinima, a Web 2.0 technology, as part of an interdisciplinary and
   collaborative project where the focus is not on the mastery of the tools
   or the acquisition of predetermined knowledge, but on the development of
   learning engagement. We provide the case study of a pilot project
   involving students across two Arts disciplines collaborating via the
   game, World of Warcraft, to produce an animated adaptation of one of
   Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Their contributions were
   differently assessed according to the pre-existing requirements of their
   home disciplines. We argue that the assessment in such projects, in
   conjunction with innovations and experimentation with Web 2.0
   technologies, should shift from an emphasis on product to process. We
   believe that this has a sound pedagogical and theoretical foundation,
   and also fits better with the increasingly digitalised, unfixed and
   interdisciplinary world that students will face on graduation.}},

Abstract = {{The ATLAS Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeters consist of an electromagnetic
   barrel calorimeter and two end-caps with electromagnetic, hadronic and
   forward calorimeters. A total of 182,468 signals are digitized and
   processed real-time on detector, to provide energy and time deposited in
   each detector element at every occurrence of the Level-1 trigger. A
   luminosity upgrade of the LHC will occur in the years similar to 2020.
   The current readout electronics will need to be upgraded to sustain the
   higher radiation levels. A completely innovative readout scheme is being
   developed. The front-end readout will send out data continuously at each
   bunch crossing through high speed radiation resistant optical links, the
   data will be processed real-time with the possibility of implementing
   trigger algorithms. This article is an overview of the R\&D activities
   and architectural studies the ATLAS LAr Calorimeter Group is developing.}},

Abstract = {{Internal-frost damage is one of the major problems affecting the
   durability of concrete in cold regions. This paper presents
   micromechanics models and innovative sensor technologies to study the
   fundamental mechanisms of frost damage in concrete. The crystallization
   pressure due to ice nucleation with capillary pores is the primary cause
   of internal-frost damage of concrete. The crystallization pressure of a
   cylinder pore was formulated using interface energy balance with
   thermodynamics equations. The obtained crystallization pressure on the
   pore wall was input for the fracture simulation with the developed
   Extended Finite Element Model (XFEM). The XFEM fracture simulation on a
   homogeneous beam sample with a vertical cylinder pore leads to a
   straight line. The XFEM simulation was also conducted on the generated
   digital sample. The simulation results were favorable compared with the
   middle-notched single edge beam bending specimen due to the open-mode
   fracture behavior in both cases. An innovative Time-Domain Reflectometry
   (TDR) sensor was developed to nondestructively monitor the freezing
   process. The experimental data shows that the TDR sensor signals can
   detect the freezing degree, an important input parameter to
   micromechanics models. These studies indicate that the developed
   micromechanics models and TDR sensor techniques can be used by the
   practitioners to evaluate internal-frost damage of concrete. Future work
   will incorporate the TDR sensor measurements into micromechanics models
   to real-time predict the internal-frost damage process in concrete
   specimens. The predicted freeze-thaw damage process will be verified
   with acoustic emission detection.}},

Abstract = {{Participation in online courses in both traditional universities and
   newer for-profit organizations is burgeoning. Indeed, students entering
   higher education increasingly have experienced online education at the
   secondary and even primary levels. Students have immense wherewithal
   with digital media use through messaging, gaming and mobile platforms.
   Reference librarians in the epoch of Wikipedia and Google are
   experiencing a steady decline in the number of in-person reference
   questions. However, disruptive innovations in teaching technologies such
   as multiuser-virtual-environments (MUVEs) now enable quasi-face-to-face
   consultations by librarians with students. The use of virtual
   environments might well be bolstered by the unsustainability of the
   traditional brick-and-mortar based educational facility grounded
   interaction due to the new financial strictures on many educational
   institutions and their stakeholders. In many ways libraries and other
   elements of higher education are evolving away from physical onsite
   usage to an online interface that in many ways reflects gaming
   interfaces. That is, geographically separated learners can meet with
   librarians together as teams to get informational and technical support
   through a variety of platforms and interfaces. This chapter is a report
   on providing the support of an experienced reference librarian through
   the Second Life virtual world interface. Included are descriptions of
   Second Life sites and resources and how they might be utilized for
   library functions. Educational venues in Second Life are describes and
   explained, as are learner avatar use and Second Life educational
   experiences. Second Life is a technology that invites experimentation
   and growth for those in higher education.}},

Abstract = {{Applied Technology Associates (ATA) is developing a field-programmable
   gate array (FPGA) based processing platform to transition our
   state-of-the-art fast-steering mirrors (FSM's) and optical inertial
   reference units (OIRU's) from the laboratory environment to field
   operation. This platform offers an abundance of reconfigurable
   high-speed digital input/output (I/O) and parallel hardware-based
   processing resources in a compact size, weight, and power (SWaP) form
   factor with a path to a radiation-hardened version. The FPGA's
   high-speed I/O can be used to acquire sensor data and drive actuators
   with minimal latency while the FPGA's processing resources can
   efficiently realize signal processing and control algorithms with
   deterministic timing. These features allow high sampling rates between
   20 KHz - 30 KHz. This will result in higher open-loop bandwidths in our
   FSM's and OIRU's. This will subsequently result in improved disturbance
   rejection in our FSM's and improved base motion jitter rejection in our
   OIRU's.
   This paper briefly presents the embedded system requirements of ATA's
   FSM's and OIRU's and the FPGA-based computational architecture derived
   to meet these requirements. It then describes the FPGA cores and
   embedded software that have been developed to efficiently realize
   interfacing, signal processing, and data collection tasks. Special
   attention is given to ATA's high-performance floating-point co-processor
   and innovative design approach that translates signal processing and
   control algorithms developed in MATLAB (R)/Simulink (R) into their
   equivalent implementation on the co-processor.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{In the models of piezoelectric actuator (PEA) systems, the hysteresis
   effects are often described by the concise Bouc-Wen models; however,
   these models are nonlinear and non-smooth because of the existence of
   terms which involve the absolute-value function. In particular, a
   challenging control problem is posed when, due to the properties of
   certain materials, such absolute-value terms are of high order. This
   control problem has been rarely studied. This article proposes the use
   of the approximated scalar sign function (ASSF), which is a numerically
   stable and differentiable nonlinear function, to represent the
   hysteresis function, with single-order or high-order absolute-value
   terms. This innovative step leads to a nonlinear but sufficiently smooth
   model. Then, a systematic digital design methodology is presented, which
   involves the following steps: (1) establish an optimal linear model
   based upon the resulting smooth model, (2) adopt a PI-based analogue
   controller and (3) apply the prediction-based digital redesign technique
   for digital implementation. A digital observer is also developed for
   state reconstruction, and to improve the input disturbance rejection.
   The positioning control of a PEA system with a high-order hysteretic
   Bouc-Wen model is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed ASSF based modelling and controller design approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet is argued to be the most participatory telecommunications
   medium ever developed-it is, in essence, a vast commons-originally
   developed with taxpayer funding and built to ensure that no one entity
   owned (or could control) the entire network. Developed using an
   end-to-end architecture, the Internet places the intelligence at the
   network's edges, allowing users to define what applications and services
   to run and which hardware and devices to use. However, the democratic
   potential of the Internet is being threatened by structural changes
   that, if left unchecked, will limit future innovation and participation.
   If these trends continue, the Internet will devolve into a feudalized
   space-one that limits democratic freedoms while enriching an oligopoly
   of powerful gatekeepers. While incumbent phone, cable, and software
   companies stand to gain financially from these enclosures, as this
   chapter documents, the negative outcomes stemming from this digital
   feudalization will have profound detrimental impacts on democratic and
   affordable communications. This chapter highlights specific policy
   debates, both within United States and internationally, that undergird
   these vulnerabilities, and illuminates normative understandings about
   the role of the Internet in supporting a democratic, civil society.
   Using the seven-layer OSI model as a framework, our analysis catalogs
   current threats to this telecommunications commons and examines the
   policy provisions that should be implemented to prevent the
   feudalization of the Internet.}},

Abstract = {{The game industry is currently exploring the development of designs that
   can appeal to a wide market with users exhibiting different tastes,
   tenancies, behaviors, abilities, and life styles. This problem requires
   the industry to look for innovative design solutions and tools.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be used to adapt the game
   experience to players' skills, behaviors, and abilities. Recently,
   several adaptive systems have been proposed including adaptive character
   AI {[}Spronck et al., Online adaptation of game opponent ai in theory
   and practice. In: 4th International Conference on Intelligent Games and
   Simulation (GAME-ON 2004), pp. 93-100,2003] and game design {[}Charles
   et al., Player-centred game design: Player modelling and adaptive
   digital games. In: DIGRA 2005 - Changing Views: Worlds in Play
   Electronic Proceedings (2005); Yannakakis and Hallam Real-time game
   adaptation for optimizing player satisfaction. In: IEEE Transactions on
   Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, pp. 121-133, 2009]. In this
   chapter, we discuss an intelligent adaptive system that adapts lighting
   in a 3D game to enhance the users' experience. Lighting design is well
   known among designers, directors, and visual artists for its vital role
   in influencing viewers' perception by evoking moods, directing gaze to
   important areas (i.e., providing visual focus), and conveying visual
   tension. The intelligent lighting systems discussed in this chapter
   adapt lighting qualities, in terms of visual attention and affective
   properties, by integrating a constraint optimization system built based
   on cinematic and theatric techniques. The system has been in development
   and refinement for 9 years. In this chapter, we will discuss the systems
   as well as their evaluation through different game prototypes,
   specifically highlighting their effect on the users' experience.}},

Abstract = {{The engagement of parents with the education and learning of their
   children is known to have beneficial effects (Harris \& Goodall (2007),
   Ofsted (2007) and DIES (2007a)). Following on from the article by
   Strickley (2009) which looked at the holistic view of a parental Gateway
   to Educational Services (GES) this paper focuses on the work, during
   2009, towards the GES Connect Digitally vision (GES, 2009a). It looks,
   specifically from a technological standpoint, at the programme's core
   services namely Online School Admissions (OSA), Online Free School Meals
   (OFSM), Cashless Schools and Online Payments. It then sets out the
   approach used by the technology workstream and examines the work done so
   far in establishing best practice, developing and enhancing existing
   technology standards and looking at new and innovative initiatives.
   Utilising the above framework the paper attempts to resolve the question
   of what the minimum features and relationships are for establishing a
   portal that enables the vision of multi-channel access to a core set of
   services for parents (GES, 2009a). It concludes that, whilst there is
   still a year to go for the programme, increased take-up for OSA and use
   of the OFSM Eligibility Checking Service (ECS) are very encouraging with
   signs that work on the other two areas will result in the vision stated
   above becoming a reality. However this needs to be tempered with the
   significant technological challenges of digital inclusion, identity
   management, open standards and interoperability.}},

Abstract = {{We present an innovative way to autonomously classify LiDAR points into
   bare earth, building, vegetation, and other categories. One desirable
   product of LiDAR data is the automatic classification of the points in
   the scene. Our algorithm automatically classifies scene points using
   Compressed Sensing Methods via Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithms
   utilizing a generalized K-Means clustering algorithm to extract
   buildings and foliage from a Digital Surface Models (DSM). This
   technology reduces manual editing while being cost effective for large
   scale automated global scene modeling. Quantitative analyses are
   provided using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves to show
   Probability of Detection and False Alarm of buildings vs. vegetation
   classification. Histograms are shown with sample size metrics. Our
   inpainting algorithms then fill the voids where buildings and vegetation
   were removed, utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques
   and Partial Differential Equations (PDE) to create an accurate Digital
   Terrain Model (DTM) {[}6]. Inpainting preserves building height contour
   consistency and edge sharpness of identified inpainted regions.
   Qualitative results illustrate other benefits such as Terrain
   Inpainting's unique ability to minimize or eliminate undesirable terrain
   data artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, Sun Innovations demonstrates an innovative emissive
   projection display (EPD) system. It is comprised of a fully transparent
   fluorescent screen with a UV image projector. The screen can be applied
   to glass windows or windshield, without affecting visible light
   transmission. The UV projector can be based on either a DLP (digital
   light processor) or a laser scanner display engine. For a DLP based
   projector, a discharge lamp coupled to a set of UV filters can be
   applied to generate a full color video image on the transparent screen.
   UV or blue-ray laser diodes of different wavelengths can be combined
   with scanning mirrors to generate a vector display for full windshield
   display applications. This display combines the best of both worlds of
   conventional projection and emissive display technologies. Like a
   projection display, the screen has no pixel structure and can be
   manufactured roll to roll; the display is scalable. Like an emissive
   display (e.g. plasma or CRT), the quality of the image is superior, with
   very large viewing angles. It also offers some unique features. For
   example, in addition to a fully transparent display on windows or
   windshields, it can be applied to a black substrate to create the first
   front projection display on true ``black{''} screen that has superior
   image contrast at low projection power. This fundamentally new display
   platform can enable multiple major commercial applications that can not
   be addressed by any of the existing display technologies.}},

Abstract = {{In 1975 Aldo Giorgini developed a software program in FORTRAN called
   FIELDS, a numerical visual laboratory devoted entirely to art
   production. Working extensively as both artist and scientist, Giorgini
   was one of the first computer artists to combine software writing with
   early printing technologies, leaving an aesthetic legacy in the field of
   the digital arts. His individual process was innovative in that it
   consisted of producing pen-plotted drawings embellished by the artist's
   hand with painting, drawing, and screen-printing. This paper is the
   product of a multi-year study of Giorgini's primary source materials
   provided by his estate. The authors examine the methods used by Giorgini
   during the 1970s that allowed him to create computer-aided art, in the
   hope that publishing this work will ensure that future generations of
   digital artists, technologists and scientists can be educated in
   Giorgini's contribution to the history of the digital arts.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Pages = {{365-380}},
Abstract = {{Parameter variation and component aging are becoming a significant
   problems for all digital circuits including FPGAs. These effects degrade
   performance, increase power dissipation, and cause permanent faults at
   manufacturing time and during the lifetime of an FPGA. Several
   techniques have been developed to tolerate variation and aging in ASICs;
   FPGA designers have been quick to adopt and customize these strategies.
   While FPGAs can use many ASIC techniques verbatim, they have a distinct
   advantage to aid in the development of more innovate solutions:
   reconfigurability. Reconfigurability gives us the ability to spread wear
   effects over the chip which is not possible in ASICs. This chapter
   examines the impact of variation and wear on FPGAs and notes the benefit
   that can be gained from variation and aging tolerance techniques that
   operate open-loop.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Flat-jack tests have been employed for decades for the assessment of
   stresses and Young moduli in possibly deteriorated concrete dams and
   masonry structures. We propose a procedure for such tests that includes
   several innovations: identification of Young moduli and shear modulus in
   the presence of orthotropy, of pre-existing normal and shear stresses,
   and of tensile and compressive strength and fracture energy; use of
   full-field displacement measurements by digital image correlation
   (instead of extensometers); computer simulations performed
   once-and-for-all and productive of results which are subsequently
   processed out by proper orthogonal decomposition and its truncation; and
   identification of parameters in situ, soon after the tests, by portable
   computer with software able to perform inverse analyses by mathematical
   tools newly introduced into this context. The proposed procedure is
   validated by means of pseudoexperimental numerical exercises, by
   employing comparatively, as central computational tools, artificial
   neural networks and a trust region algorithm implying only first-order
   derivatives (with respect to the sought parameters) of the discrepancy
   function to minimize.}},

Abstract = {{Aortic dissection is a real problem of public health, it is a medical
   emergency and may quickly lead to death. Aortic dissection is caused by
   aortal tissue perforation because of blood pressure. It consists of
   tears (or holes of the intimal tissue) inside lumens. These tears are
   difficult to detect because they do not correspond to a filled organ to
   segment; they are usually visually retrieved by radiologists by
   examining gray level variation on successive image slices, but it
   remains a very difficult and error-prone task.
   Our purpose is to detect these intimal tears to help cardiac surgeons in
   making diagnosis. It would be useful either during a preoperative phase
   (visualization and location of tears, endoprothesis sizing); or during a
   peroperative phase (a registration of tears on angiographic images would
   lead to a more accuracy of surgeon's gestures and thus would enhance
   care of patient).
   At this aim, we use Aktouf et al.'s holes filling algorithm proposed in
   the field of digital topology. This algorithm permits the filling of
   holes of a 3D binary object by using topological notions - the holes are
   precisely the intimal tears for our aortic dissection images, after a
   first preprocessing step.
   As far as we know, this is the first time that such a proposal is made,
   even if it is a crucial data for cardiac surgeons. Our study is a
   preliminary and innovative work; our results are nevertheless considered
   satisfactory. This approach would also gain to be known to specialists
   of other diseases.}},

   Layout System for Custom Chip IC Design) {[}2, 3, 6, 8], BEAR {[}7]
   layout system, BAGEL (Gate Array Layout) {[}17], RAMP (Resistive Analog
   Module Placement) {[}5], PROUD (Sea of Gates Placement) {[}28] to
   congestion, timing, and low power driven placement, Prof. Kuh always
   starts with innovative theoretical construction, software system
   building, and applications with impact on productivity.
   Physical layout is an indispensable software system for VLSI Design with
   millions of modules. Placement is the key component of about 500 million
   dollars market for physical synthesis. In the layout design flow, the
   placement is the core of the system integrating with other synthesis and
   analysis tools.
   For building block layout, Kuh's group tackled the nonslicing
   architecture. They devised the tile plane to represent the topology of
   the floorplan and the bottleneck of the routing. A routing order is
   derived to guarantee 100 percent routing completion {[}12]. The
   methodology and algorithms of building block placement {[}2] were
   adopted by companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation and ECAD,
   which was later renamed as Cadence.
   For standard cell placement, RAMP placement is devised using the analogy
   of a resistive network {[}12]. The minimization of the circuit power
   corresponds to the quadratic wire length reduction. The approach
   provides a convergent solution in the era of interconnect dominance. As
   the technology scales, interconnect becomes dominating the system
   performance in terms on delay and power consumption. Performance driven
   logic synthesis, signal interconnect with repeater insertion, power
   ground and clock distribution strongly rely on the physical layout
   information. On the other hand the placement requires the synthesis
   result to perform the task. This mutual dependence has caused serious
   design convergence issues in the 1990s.
   The work was performed at a time when simulated annealing method became
   a fashion in the EDA field. In 1983, Kirpatrick et al. {[}15] adopted
   the annealing method for placement and achieved excellent results. The
   annealing method takes the analogy of thermal annealing to perturb the
   partial solution with a probability according to the simulated
   temperature of the process. The strategy derives excellent results on
   some difficult problems at the expense of many random trials of the
   perturbations. Since most of EDA problem are known to be NP complete,
   annealing approach was considered as the right tool to solve the
   problem. Significant resources and efforts have thus been focused on
   annealing method in placement and other EDA subjects.
   The RAMP placement 5 method falls into the category of the analytical
   method. In 1979, Quinn and Breuer {[}23] introduced a force model to
   determine the state of equilibrium. They applied Hook's law to attract
   the modules connected by signal nets and repulsive forces to separate
   the modules with no connection. The repulsive forces cause a large set
   of nonlinear equations in the formulation, which complicates the
   calculation. An improvement has been proposed by Antreich, Johannes, and
   Kirsh {[}1] using the same force-directed method but with a more
   systematic formulation of equations. Kuh's approach removes the
   repulsive forces to simplify the nonlinear programming problem. His
   group demonstrated the feasibility of the global optimization approach
   via fast sparse matrix solvers {[}27]. The RAMP placement package was
   first installed at Hughes Aircraft Company to automate the placement in
   an in-house EDA project in 1983. The system had been used by the gate
   array design group since then. In 1988, in Kuh's group, Ren-Song Tsay
   developed PROUD to replace the matrix solver with successive over
   relaxation method. In 1992, at Cadence, CAD engineer, Louis Chao,
   implemented the algorithm and coined the placement tool as Qplacer to
   emphasize the usage of the quadratic cost function in the formulation.
   The Qplacer is the main placement tool of the ASIC design community for
   a long time. In the same year (1992), Ren-Song Tsay implemented the
   quadratic placement package at a start-up company which was later
   renamed as Avanti and acquired by Synopsys. The Qplacer became the main
   placement tool of the ASIC design community. Up to now, all major EDA
   companies, i.e. Cadence, Magma, Mentor Graphics, and Synopsys adopted
   the quadratic placement strategy and its extension by the group of
   Johannes. The placement is integrated with timing analysis and
   interconnect synthesis to provide convergent solutions for the
   designers.
   For the usage of the quadratic placement, it took 104 seconds at IMIPs
   machine to place 136 modules as the tool was installed at Hughes in
   1983. In 1991, Kleinhans et al. {[}16] reported to take 2500 seconds at
   15MIPs machine to place 6417 modules. In 1998, Eisenmann and Johannes
   {[}9] took 2031 seconds at Alphastation 250 4/266 (266MHz) to place 25K
   modules. As the quadratic placement method become popular, more features
   are integrated into the software package. In current designs, a state of
   art package can handle 6-7M components with 30-40 transistors. The limit
   is set by the memory capacity used for the analysis routine. Kuh's group
   has hosted a thriving set of Ph.D. students and visiting scholars to
   study placement. Margaret Sadowska has been a mentor to many in the
   group. The building block layout was contributed by Nang-Ping Chen,
   Chi-Ping Hsu, Chao-Chiang Chen, Wayne Dai, Bernhard Eschermann, Massoud
   Pedram, Yasushi Ogawa, and Margaret Sadowska. The channel ordering
   scheme for the layout {[}6] was published by Wayne Dai and Tetsuo Asano.
   The gate array layout {[}17] was constructed by Margaret Sadowska,
   Jeong-Tyng Li and C.K. Cheng. The standard placement has been studied by
   C.K. Cheng, Ren-Song Tsay; the low power placement by Massoud Pedram;
   the timing driven placement {[}9, 20] by Shen Lin, Srinivasan Arvind,
   Michael Jaskson, Henrik Esbensen, and Margaret Sadowska; the IO
   assignment {[}22] by Massoud Pedram, Narasimha Bhat, Kamal Chaudhary,
   Deborah Wang, and Margaret Sadowska. Dong-Min Xu developed gate matrix
   layout {[}29, 30]; Minshine Shih studied partitioning {[}29, 30];
   Pinhong Chen worked on floorplan sizing {[}4]; Hiroshi Murata extended a
   floorplan representation, sequence pair, to handle a mixture of soft and
   hard modules {[}18].
   As a second wave, renowned visiting scholars went back and continued to
   contribute to placement. Prof. Hidoshi Onodera used branch and bound
   approach for building block placement at Kyoto University in 1991
   {[}21]. Prof. Xianlong Hong devised an efficient floorplan
   representation, corner block list at Tsinghua University in 2000 {[}10].
   Prof. John Lillis devised a new placement tool, Mongrel using hybrid
   techniques for standard cell placement at University of Illinois,
   Chicago in 2000 {[}11]. Prof. Andrew B. Kahng's group at UC San Diego
   developed an APlacer which won ACM International Symposium on Physical
   Design placement contest in 2005 {[}13, 14]. At Kuh's group, we had the
   privilege to meet many leaders in placement, e.g. Satoshi Goto, Tatsuo
   Ohtsuki, Brian Preas, David Liu, T.C. Hu, Jerry Lee, Scott Kirkpatrick,
   Melvin A. Breuer, Ulrich Lauther, and Kurt Antreich.
   The placement with analogy of resistive network was inspired by Kuh's
   book entitled ``Basic Circuit Theory{''}. Kuh's group continues to
   investigate circuit analysis and synthesis. In 1991 {[}31], Shen Lin and
   Margaret Sadowska constructed an efficient timing simulator using a Step
   Wise Equivalent Conductance (SWEC) for nonlinear devices. In 1999
   {[}32], Janet Wang and Qingjian Yu simplified transmission line analysis
   using model order reduction. In recent years (2005-2009), Kuh has
   advised analysis and synthesis of transmission lines using passive
   equalizer {[}33-38] and circuit simulation techniques {[}39-41].
   VLSI placement is a challenge task with the increasing complexity of the
   circuit. The size of the modular placement cases scales with the advance
   of VLSI technologies. In 1961, Steinberg introduced a case of 34
   modules. In 1972, Stevens in his thesis posted the ILLIAC IV boards with
   67-151 modules {[}26]. In 1983, the test case from Hughes ranges from
   300 to 500 modules. By 1991, the largest test case released by MCNC
   Center for Microelectronics is 15K modules. Moreover, subjects in
   placement such as mixed module placement, placement of heterogeneous
   circuits, placement integrating with behavior synthesis, 3-dimensional
   placement, and parallel placement are related to geometry handling,
   circuit performance, and advancement of the technologies and call for
   further study in the field.}},

Abstract = {{with the rapid development of digital printing, the method and standard
   of quality detection for digital printing become focus of research. The
   main work and innovations in this paper include: (1) Computer image
   analysis method was applied to ink-jet printing quality detection for
   the first time; (2) Compared with traditional printing quality test, ink
   dot, line, color patch and MTF (Modulation Transfer Function) were
   selected as measurement and control elements. And the test proofs for
   detecting printing quality were designed; (3) The detection algorithm
   and the overall detection process were put forward in this paper. The
   result of the experiment demonstrates: the detection method based on
   capturing measurement and control elements by CCD can accurately
   accomplish the objective quality evaluation for ink-jet printing.
   Detection method of print was improved to extend the scope of detection
   by this research, which could be generalized as a standard method for
   the detection of ink-jet printing quality.}},

Title = {{DRIVER: building a sustainable infrastructure for global repositories}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{249-260}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - DRIVER embodies a bold vision that of worldwide networks of
   scientific data repositories. This paper seeks to examine the aims of
   the European Union funded project, to explore the development of a
   distributed infrastructure that enables enhanced interoperability of
   data, resulting in a global knowledge infrastructure supporting the
   scholarly communication of the future.
   Design/methodology/approach - The primary objective of DRIVER was to
   establish a flexible, robust, and scalable infrastructure for all
   European and world-wide digital repositories, managing scientific
   information in an open access model increasingly demanded by
   researchers, funding organisations and other stakeholders. Adopting a
   result-driven approach, activities focused on the expansion of the
   content base with high quality research outputs, including textual
   research papers, data sets and other scholarly publications.
   Findings - The release of the D-NET v1.0 open source software proved a
   successful basis for a distributed service-oriented architecture,
   enabling enhanced interoperability of data and service-providers, and
   offering wide-ranging functionality including search; recommendation;
   collection building, and personal profiling as innovative tools for
   repository managers. In addition, it was found that in building a robust
   network of voluntary content providers, known as the DRIVER
   Confederation, the infrastructure came to support a durable
   organisational structure, now formally constituted as the Confederation
   of Open Access Repositories (COAR). The international repository
   organisation enables further collaboration between research communities
   in a co-ordinated network comprising a growing number of institutional
   repositories, national federations and research institutions and data
   aggregators.
   Practical implications - The development of COAR is the extension of the
   EU-based infrastructure to global research communities in China, India,
   Africa and Latin America, deploying a vigorous awareness and advocacy
   programme. Evolving from the DRIVER Confederation, COAR aims to provide
   an ongoing support service for repository managers, in a dynamic set of
   guidelines aimed at data interoperability, and to provide the strategic
   support required to implement new forms of scholarly communication.
   These issues are addressed in terms of technical infrastructure
   developments but will focus on strategic issues of policy development,
   improved services and additional functionality offered to the scholarly
   community.
   Originality/value - This paper outlines DRIVER's unique response to the
   changing global information environment. Concepts of strategic
   international collaboration are pursued in COAR, based on the scientific
   and technical collaboration achieved in DRIVER. The paper addresses
   significant repository development goals that currently challenge
   repository managers, librarians, scholars and funders and that indicate
   the future of Open Access publication in the ultimate goal of a global
   and interactive representation of human knowledge.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{213-229}},
Abstract = {{The contemporary recycling of biological analogy in architecture, in
   tandem with computational techniques of parametric design and building
   information models, raise the prospect of a return to a twenty-first
   century version of biotechnical determinism. This current dalliance with
   morphology and optimisation, raises the wider issue of how architecture
   has typically engaged with science: is the use of metaphor or other
   looser translations more likely to stimulate innovative practice than
   literal application? This question is considered here in relation to a
   particular casethe notion of the field, as informed from developments in
   nineteenth-century physics. An episodic tracing of the influence of
   field concepts takes in Italian Futurism, urban morphology and the
   topological to suggest the potency of a multi-various interpretation of
   science for architecture. The essay concludes with an argument for the
   concurrent evaluation of the quantitative and the qualitative, through
   performance simulation and mixed-reality visualisation. That utilisation
   of a range of analogue and digital technology may enable the balanced
   evaluation of design quality, architecture conceived in metaphor and
   poised between pragmatics and poetry.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of broadcasting networks with the emerging Digital Video
   Broadcasting - Handheld (DVB-H) standard and broadband cellular
   communication networks, produces a hybrid network with interesting
   potential for mobile multimedia tourist applications. This hybrid
   network allow tourists to access tourist multimedia contents while on
   the destination, combining several telecommunication networks in order
   to provide innovative added-value services. This paper presents the
   design, implementation and evaluation in a small destination of a hybrid
   network composed of point-to-multipoint technologies for the provision
   of general information about the destination (points of interest,
   agenda, food and beverage, accommodation) that are the same for all
   tourists; and point-to-point technologies for a point-to-point
   interaction to access personalized added-value services (ticket
   purchasing, personalized contents).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative computer literacy course that focuses
   solely on developing skills needed for life in a networked world in
   which one must protect oneself from identity theft, be careful posting
   on social networks, and use credit and debit cards wisely. The course
   emphasizes ethical responsibility and information literacy. Its target
   audience, first-year, non-computer science majors, learn what they need
   to know to use technology safely, effectively, efficiently, and
   ethically. The course is grounded in active learning, such as posting in
   a class wiki, and critical thinking. It is a radical alternative to a
   traditional software packages approach.
   The paper documents the need for this course, The Digital Person, and
   its blend of content and pedagogy. Data from three years of offering the
   course provide an assessment of its effectiveness and value to those who
   have taken it. A review of SIGCSE literature in the last ten years finds
   no representation of this creative approach.}},

Abstract = {{Soil maps are an important and integral component of national geospatial
   data infrastructures. The creation of these maps involves a
   geovisualization exercise whereby soil scientists develop cognitive
   models that correlate observable landscape features to soil occurrence.
   This is traditionally an analog process, cognitively demanding, time
   consuming, and invariably non-collaborative. A new geovirtual soil
   mapping technique is proposed in this paper in the form of an innovative
   Experiential GIS (EGIS) environment. This immersive environment enables
   soil maps to be constructed through experiencing and interacting with
   spatial data through immersion in 3D geovirtual scenes. The system
   outlined integrates GIS, immersive geovisualization, and robust
   geodatabase capabilities. Four soil scientists with extensive soil
   mapping experience ranging from 5 to over 20 years are concurrently
   immersed in the same 3D geovirtual landscape which more closely mirrors
   the way in which we view the world around us. The soil scientists are
   immersed within the 3D scene where they are essentially freed from the
   laws of physics, and may roam anywhere across the landscape as if in a
   virtual helicopter. The landscape is draped with any combination of
   orthoimagery and GIS-derived data allowing soil scientists to interpret,
   digitally delineate, and attribute soil boundaries. Exploiting the EGIS
   technology while maintaining the centrality of the soil scientist in
   soil interpretation and soil map production, promises considerable
   resource efficiencies than those achieved in traditional soil survey The
   paper lays out the nature of this potential paradigm shift in soil
   mapping. The results of using this technology to construct soil
   geographic knowledge are also discussed in terms of soil map detail,
   cost efficiencies, time effectiveness, system usability,
   geocollaborative soil mapping advantages, and the reduced cognitive
   workload on practicing soil scientists.}},

Abstract = {{Technology adoption research has a tradition of using and improving
   Davis' (1989) oTechnology Acceptance Modelo (TAM) and extended versions
   of it. This article suggests a break with this tradition by showing that
   the TAM is limited in its understanding of technology adoption. Two
   alternative approaches are proposed that focus on the role of knowledge
   and user-technology match, and on the role of temporary dynamical
   contexts in the process of adoption decision-making. Together with the
   TAM, both approaches were empirically tested and compared to the TAM by
   incorporating them in a questionnaire regarding the adoption intention
   of HDTV in the Netherlands. Results show that the constructs of both
   approaches show significant relations with the respondents' adoption
   intentions of HDTV and, together, offer a good alternative to the TAM.
   This result can be seen as a basis for more future research that uses
   technological and contextual factors as a starting point for adoption
   research. Using this starting point will contribute to a better
   understanding of future technology adoption processes.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency spectrum is a limited shared resource, nowadays interested by
   an ever growing number of different applications. Generally, the
   companies providing such services pay to the governments the right of
   using a limited portion of the spectrum, consequently they would be
   assured that the licensed radio spectrum resource is not interested by
   significant external interferences. At the same time, they have to
   guarantee that their devices make an efficient use of the spectrum and
   meet the electromagnetic compatibility regulations. Therefore the
   competent authorities are called to control the access to the spectrum
   adopting suitable management and monitoring policies, as well as the
   manufacturers have to periodically verify the correct working of their
   apparatuses. Several measurement solutions are present on the market.
   They generally refer to real-time spectrum analyzers and measurement
   receivers. Both of them are characterized by good metrological
   accuracies but show costs, dimensions and weights that make no possible
   a use ``on the field{''}. The paper presents a first step in realizing a
   digital signal processing based measurement instrument able to suitably
   accomplish for the above mentioned needs. In particular the attention
   has been given to the DSP based measurement section of the instrument.
   To these aims an innovative measurement method for spectrum monitoring
   and management is proposed in this paper. It performs an efficient
   sequential analysis based on a sample by sample digital processing.
   Three main issues are in particular pursued: (i) measurement performance
   comparable to that exhibited by other methods proposed in literature;
   (ii) fast measurement time, (iii) easy implementation on cost-effective
   measurement hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is an optical measurement method
   capable of providing visualisation of velocity field of particle flow in
   fluids. After analysis of data acquired in the form of an image
   sequence, it is possible to retrieve information about flow parameters
   as mean values of velocity, vorticity, shear and normal strain. This
   paper presents the results of high pressure experiments using this
   method applied to triolein and oleic acid samples in their phase
   transition region. A high pressure optical chamber, He-Ne laser and
   light-sheet optics together with a digital camera and image acquisition
   computer allow us to study the motion of particles in high pressure
   conditions. The set-up was similar to that presented in Ozmutlu et al.
   {[}Momentum and energy transfer during phase change of water under high
   hydrostatic pressure, Innov. Food Sci. Emerg. Technol. 7(3) (2006), pp.
   161-168] and Kulisiewicz et al. {[}Visualization of pressure-shift
   freezing and thawing of concentrated aqueous sucrose solutions, High
   Press. Res. 27(2) (2007), pp. 291-297]. The analysis of phase transition
   dynamics in triolein and oleic acid is an extension to the work
   presented in Tefelski et al. {[}The investigation of the dynamics of the
   phase transformation in triolein and oleic acid under pressure, J.
   Phys.: Conf. Ser. 121(142004) (2008), pp. 1-6]. Oleic acid is a
   monounsaturated fatty acid and has a bent rod shape. Triolein is a
   triglyceride and has a ochairo-like shape. It is the base particle of
   many vegetable oils, especially olive oil. Triolein consists of three
   chains of oleic acid bound by a glycerol part. Information obtained by
   the study of phase transitions dynamics is important for food science
   and food technology processes which involve high pressure treatment. The
   PIV method shows differences in the solidification process of both
   substances in time, the existence of inhomogeneities (layers of
   different densities in the observed flow) and allows us to calculate the
   parameters of flow using the PIVview2C software from PIVTEC GmbH.}},

Abstract = {{Although potential applications abound, small-scale unmanned aerial
   vehicles have not yet been widely used for environmental remote sensing.
   Several challenges remain to be overcome until widespread adoption is
   possible. One problem is the challenge inherent in flying fragile
   small-scale aircraft with low weight limits and narrow center of gravity
   tolerances. Other challenges include: (1) the hostile natural
   environment in which the aircraft fly; (2) the limits of on-board power;
   (3) the paucity of commercially available sensors; (4) the difficulties
   involved in managing and analyzing the large imagery volume generated
   during a sortie; and (5) the federal regulations in the United States
   designed to ensure the safety of commercial and private air travel. Each
   of these challenges is formidable, and overcoming them will require the
   use of technologies that are currently experimental. However, within
   each challenge are opportunities for researchers willing to act as
   innovative pioneers in the remote sensing community.}},

Abstract = {{The digital revolution has changed how audiences use and interact with
   audiovisual media. The National Film Board of Canada (NFB) has been
   preparing for this inevitable revolution for several years, developing
   partnerships and carrying out research on image and sound processing,
   innovative transfer techniques, accessibility, and distribution to
   facilitate the transition to digital technology. In recent years, the
   technical and operational infrastructure has undergone significant
   upheavals. The NFB has taken up the gauntlet. The new digital reality is
   more sophisticated than past technologies but also more open and
   promising. Our aim is to exploit the full potential of these new and
   constantly evolving technologies.
   Today, the NFB is at a crossroads of innovation, bringing its tradition
   of trailblazing to the multiplatform, 21st-century digital universe. The
   challenge: Making its collection available to everyone on the platform
   of their choice while preserving this priceless audiovisual legacy for
   generations to come. To ensure fast and efficient access to its
   collection, the NFB will implement material exchange format(1-2)
   standards and protocols for the creation of a mezzanine file for each
   title that includes its various versions (length, language, subtitling,
   etc.). On demand, a specific version will be assembled from this
   mezzanine file package to produce all required deliveries for that
   specific version.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (20) convolution is a basic operation in digital signal
   processing, especially in image and video applications. Although its
   computation is conceptually simple, a sum of products of constants by
   variables, its implementation is highly demanding in terms of
   computational power, especially when addressed to real-time embedded
   systems. This work brings an innovative approach oriented to dynamically
   reconfigurable hardware. A flexible 2D convolver is deployed on a
   SRAM-based FPGA split in two parts: a static region and a partially
   reconfigurable region (PRR). Just to provide a universal solution, all
   the configurable aspects of the convolver (kernel dimensions, operands
   resolution, constant coefficients, pipeline stages, etc.) fit allocated
   in the PRR. In this way, the computer can self-adapt its structure on
   the fly, according to the characteristics of the image to be processed
   each time. Although there are many research articles in the literature
   encompassing the design of 20 convolution computers, to the best of the
   authors' knowledge, this is the first work that implements a 2D
   convolver based on run-time reconfigurable hardware, while other
   approaches synthesize it either directly in software or in hardware as
   fully static designs. This pioneer alternative exploiting key
   implementation aspects like parallelism, pipeline, flexibility and
   functional density overcomes both computational performance of software
   solutions and cost-effectiveness of static hardware designs, while
   delivering an outstanding level of adaptability. The balanced time-area
   trade-off achieved with this technology makes it appropriate for
   high-performance low-cost embedded systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This article describes an innovative and unique practice involving two
   classes of information technology (IT) major student teachers, who
   created digital learning resources and assessment rubrics by utilizing a
   Web 2.0 tool. The project spanned more than two weeks and data were
   collected from a number of sources, such as the content of the wiki
   sites, comments posted by the students, and their selected assessment
   rubrics and reflections. The findings indicated that this pioneering
   practice helps students develop various generic skills, such as IT
   skills, collaboration skills, and organizational skills. The study also
   established that assessment rubrics are a feasible means of assessing a
   wiki site. The conclusions reached by this study were that wiki-based
   activities are useful in developing a diverse range of student teacher
   capabilities and can play a significant role in their learning. (C) 2010

   Chinese calligraphy produced in different historical periods and
   geographic areas, the excavated ancient Chinese documents are vivid
   demonstrations of stylistic variations, structural complexity and
   aesthetic principles of ancient Chinese scripts. I argue that an

Abstract = {{Traditional multiplierless digital filter design techniques try to solve
   the Multiple Constant Multiplication (MCM) problem by implementing the

Abstract = {{The trend in semiconductor manufacturing over the last decade has been
   an accelerated rate for both materials integration and wafer fabrication
   process development. While the cutting edge of semiconductor technology
   is driven by digital logic and memory applications, several other
   technology sectors benefit from innovation by the leaders. Of these
   technology sectors, image sensor manufacturers have realized many
   benefits from the selective use of developments within advanced
   technology node manufacturing.
   The motivations for the imaging industry to pursue Moore's Law type of
   scaling are comparable to that of the broader semiconductor industry.
   Additionally, image sensor companies seek a reduction of camera module
   form factor, an increase in pixel resolution, and an increase in pixel
   array performance.
   Today, semi-professional grade digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) pixels
   have scaled down to the size of what were state-of-the-art ``small
   pixel{''} consumer grade camera phone sensors just a few years ago. The
   pixel size of recent camera phones has shrunk to 1.12 mu m. The
   resolution for recent camera phones has reached 16.4 Mp. Beyond silicon
   foundry processes, imaging companies must also concern themselves with
   the optical systems and packaging solutions required to integrate their
   silicon devices with the consumer electronics supply chain.
   Chipworks, as a supplier of competitive intelligence to the
   semiconductor and electronics industries, monitors the evolution of
   image sensor technologies as they come into production. Chipworks has
   obtained charge-coupled devices (CCD) and CMOS image sensor (CIS) chips
   from leading manufacturers and performed structural, compositional, and
   design analyses to benchmark the technology of the market leaders.}},

Abstract = {{While switched Ethernet is emerging as a communications network of
   choice, network topologies vary widely with no established industry
   practice. This situation is further complicated by the wide variety of
   power system applications, ranging from systems internal to industrial
   facilities up to critical high-voltage (HV) and extra-high-voltage (EHV)
   transmission systems.
   The use of digital communication, including IEC 61850 Generic
   Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE), on these switched Ethernet
   networks has created opportunities to eliminate hard-wired copper
   terminations to exchange status values among intelligent electronic
   devices (IEDs).
   Global experience demonstrates that over 50 percent of copper
   terminations, associated cost and labor, and opportunities for mistakes
   are eliminated via the use of digital communication among peer IEDs.
   This paper discusses the methods developed to document and test the
   virtual wiring, which replace traditional wiring drawings and end-to-end
   continuity testing.
   Discussion of the evolution of best engineering practices based on
   experiences from numerous installed systems provides valuable insight
   for testing, commissioning, and maintaining routable Ethernet networks
   using one or more of the IEC 61850 protocols for peer-to-peer data
   exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Charles Sturt University (CSU) desires to produce graduates who are on
   the path to cultural competence and to support students into the posture
   of what cultural competence may mean for them when they graduate into
   their professions. In 2011 a project called Getting into the posture
   recognised that there is a combined need to help students (especially in
   preparing for practicum placements) with some training in cultural
   competence that alerted them to what they may encounter on their
   placements and /or help in their understanding of the situations that
   face Indigenous Australians and their critical reflection of this.
   Working very closely with Indigenous Australian Elders, a combined
   disciplinary project team coordinated by the Indigenous Curriculum and
   Pedagogy Coordinator constructed a digital learning resource that
   exposes students to the general issues of cultural competence in
   preparation for their education of Australia's past historical practices
   and contemporary issues. Cassie's Story: Dyan Ngal is a resource that
   seeks to value-add to those initiatives already underway at CSU;
   specifically the embedding of Indigenous curriculum and pedagogy in all
   undergraduate on-shore courses by 2015. Cassie's Story: Dyan Ngal is a
   generic cultural competence resource that is leading several add-ons
   specific resources to the issues identified by various Faculty and

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore a multimedia workshop that took place in a
   primary school in which children developed digital literacies helped by
   their families. In this presentation we are going to analyse the
   different skills related to publishing on the Internet, in the journey
   from being receivers to becoming active producers of digital contents.
   We will see how the adults support becomes a key issue. Even when adults
   don't feel confident with these technologies, they can provide support
   in other practices related to the reflection about the contents
   (Buckingham, 2003).
   They participate in a digital literacy process using multiple
   technologies to publish a newspaper on the Internet. In the context of
   our work, we understand literacy as the ability to critically manage
   different tools such as new technologies or the media (Mercer, 2000).
   These new literacies are related to specific skills that help children
   to face new media in a clever way. Exploring the construction of
   knowledge in this setting, we can see how the use of the Internet means
   much more than managing the tool: it also means the commitment to become
   digital producers.
   In this study we adopted an ethnographic perspective (Atkinson, Coffey,
   Delamont, Lofland \& Lofland, 2001; Spindler \& Hammond, 2006), which
   helped us to understand school as a cultural or institutional context in
   which the activity of individuals acquires meaning. In this context, we
   adopted a case study methodology that enabled us to analyse in more
   depth the activity of one of the families (Yin, 2003; Stake, 2006). From
   this approach, we analyse how children who participated in the workshop
   with their families progressively constructed a community of learners
   (Barton \& Tusting, 2005) in which a dialogical interaction among
   children and adults developed (Kemmis, S., McTaggart, R., 2005). Thus,
   our question is: How could we develop in the school useful learning in
   different contexts? Could the school educate children as competent
   citizens facing the new challenges that are raised by the new
   technologies and mass media? Some children develop skills to manage
   these new contexts through their interaction in informal communities by
   learning in daily situations. Almost all the new literacies imply social
   abilities developed through the collaboration and participation in
   networks. These competences are based on the traditional literacy and
   practical skills - related to critical analysis and research-that are
   usually taught in the classrooms. This could be a reason that
   facilitates the school to introduce these abilities within the basic
   competences that usually develop, as a medium to integrate itself in an
   emergent participatory culture (Jenkins et al., 2006).
   From this perspective, it seems necessary to create shared settings and
   to generate contributions, arisen from the applied research, that help
   teachers and families in the social activity of constructing knowledge
   and sharing it through mass media.}},

Abstract = {{With this present work, the authors' intent is to describe and explore
   an on-going approach to self-learning using technologies and specific
   environments in non-formal learning and development motivating contexts
   in an out-school activities, to promote vocational trends in
   engineering. On this work, will be developed according to the case study
   approach methodology and grounded on the tutorial model designed for
   accompanying the activity ``F1 in Schools{''} (F1S) from the wider
   project `` Think Industry and Technology Project{''} (TITP). This is one
   hands-on, out-of-school program focused on experiencing engineering and
   promoting self and informal learning on alternative contexts. The paper
   will be grounded on the Technological Centre for the Metal Working
   Industry' (CATIM) experience as a member of Association of the
   Technological Centres of Portugal (RECET) being one of the promoters of
   F1S for Portugal. CATIM has TITP running since 1995 and it has
   encompassed more than 71.000 youngsters with ages between 13 and 17
   years old. The main objective for TITP and all of its activities is to
   develop a positive vision of the industry, engineering, employment
   opportunities and technical careers in the industrial sector, towards a
   sustainable and active citizenship. The F1S is an International
   competition, which evolved 38 different countries in 2010 and more than
   362160 youngsters worldwide. The teams compete regionally, nationally
   and internationally, the ultimate concretization in the F1 in Schools
   World Championship Trophy. The e-learning tutoring F1S intends to
   support teams for the following aims: a) design and construct the
   fastest and most innovative miniature F1 car; b) prepare and support
   verbal presentation; c) help in the conceptualization, design and
   operationalization of the marketing display and ``pit{''}. Last national
   championship we supported 102 youngsters, with ages between 14 and 17
   years old, separated into 19 groups. As main outputs: a) the winning
   regional and national team was one that followed this e-learning schema;
   b) learning communities based on-line were mentioned has being very
   important for the task completion; c) divergent e-learning and
   development strategies were developed by the youngsters; d) different
   stakeholders were actively evolved on the tutoring.
   The authors will centre on the e-learning tutoring model experience
   adopted for accompanying the F1S learners. The adopted model for
   accompanying the F1S is the Technology Integration Matrix (TIM), which
   incorporates five interdependent characteristics of meaningful learning
   environments: (a) active, (b) constructive, (c) goal directed (i.e.,
   reflective), (d) authentic, and (e) collaborative which associates five
   levels of technology integration: (1) entry, (2) adoption, (3)
   adaptation, (4) infusion, and (5) transformation.
   The TIM is a valuable tool for our F1S e-tutors to use for supporting
   their understanding of how technology can be effectively integrated and
   add more opportunity to interact with students into their distance
   interaction. After a one year of experience, F1S training coordination
   have received positive feedback from the tutors, mentioning the need for
   more exploration and integration of the TIM tool.
   The challenge for all is one of understanding and exploring how best to
   use technological resources to support learning and engaging users on
   the activities leading to the learning and development taking in account
   the new ways for learning in the digital age (multi tasking, gaming,
   non-linear approaches) focused in their contexts and environments.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main changes that is suffering education nowadays, is the
   shift from a passive to an active education model, mainly based on the
   student, that needs to promote new competences in accordance with the
   current labor market that demands highly skilled professionals able to
   deal with technology in every single aspect of modern life; on the other
   hand, a new generation of students is coming, digital natives who have
   new values and a different perspective of life, so that, the role of
   teachers have also changed from being the only source of information in
   the classroom to become a mentor who guides the students on an ocean of
   information. Authors believe that there are three main changes that need
   to be performed in order to improve education to overcome the challenges
   of nowadays society: (1) students' competences, (2) teaching methods,
   and (3) values. In this paper authors share a teaching experience, in
   order to empirically corroborate whether or not leadership, commitment,
   and solidarity are encouraged and learned in a traditional university
   engineering class; besides authors present a proposal to assess, through
   a quantitative method that is based on monitoring and assessing the work
   and tasks developed by students when they are asked to solve problems
   and to develop projects working collaboratively, if leadership is
   encouraged in a traditional engineering class, and commitment and
   solidarity are fomented among students.}},

Abstract = {{The indexical properties of real photographs impart a compelling link
   with previous generations and past events in social and economic
   history. However, the fragility of photographic material, means that
   rare photographs are consigned to the archive and in the context of
   children's heritage education, which relies heavily on photographic
   resources, this materiality of the photograph is inevitably transformed
   reducing the quality of the learning experience. Ongoing innovations in
   multi-touch small screen technology are opening up new opportunities in
   the context of heritage education which give users thin and lightweight
   mobile hand held devices which are fingertip driven and ideal for
   examining and manipulating images. Intuitively, the iPad has some
   commendable design features, particularly for children, but just how
   these impact upon children's experiences and responses to viewing
   archive images has yet to be fully investigated.
   This work sets out to explore the use of the iPad within the context of
   a Victorian classroom experience at the Old Donnison School Museum in
   the Sunderland Heritage Quarter, a regeneration project in the North
   East of England. In this paper we review the broad outcomes of this
   pilot into the use of the iPad in heritage education and draw some
   conclusions as to the use of this versatile technology for the effective
   deployment of the digital archive for children.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important indicators in the European Higher Education
   Area is considering learning as a lifelong activity. In this sense, ICT
   plays a dominant role in the education of students and professionals.
   ICT represents a decisive advance in innovation processes that generate
   and transmit knowledge, in continuing education, in the possibilities to
   practice autonomous learning, and in breaking space and time barriers in
   order to learn.
   That said, we note with {[}1] Adell (2011) that results show that while
   old courses of New Technologies were offered as common training,
   nowadays courses depend on each university, which results in better or
   worse training. If we add that teachers of teaching degrees consulted in
   the preparation of the White Book think that the need for ``knowledge of
   computer science relative to the field of study{''} is discreetly
   necessary, 2.23 / 4.00, average of the choice, and the competence, ``the
   ability to manage information,{''} is also discreetly necessary,
   according to the same opinions, 2.38/4.00. We agree that teachers'
   pedagogical beliefs are a considerable disadvantage.
   The generic competence of our concern not only deals with digital
   literacy, already reached by the majority of students entering the
   university, but also shows two new options: proper information
   management by students and the acquisition of appropriate training that
   combines teaching models to combine didactic models and to be able to
   implement them into digital platforms. It aims to achieve a training
   situation in which prospective teachers successfully use a personal
   computer. But it is not only about acquiring ICT training for the future
   practice of the profession. ICT skills are necessary to communicate with
   teachers during tutorials, to access blogs or participate in seminars
   away from their universities.
   ICT offer students first-rate resources for expression and
   communication, for the access to sources of information such as document
   and data filing for presentation tasks, for learning, research and for
   cooperative work. Its use is related to planning and organizing,
   reflexive thinking, written communication, adjustment to the environment
   and innovation, among other competences.
   In the present communication we show an exploratory and descriptive
   study to see what level of knowledge students who begin the first year
   of undergraduate degree in Primary Education have of digital literacy,
   management and use of ICT to collect, file and select the most suitable
   information. In the same way, it is also interesting to know the level
   of ICT competence acquired by the students before starting these
   university studies to determine if students of the Teaching School of
   Ubeda have a reasonably homogeneous level, or on the contrary, their
   levels are very different and unbalance the group. Finally, we try to
   find out whether certain demographic variables affect the evaluation
   level of ICT competence of new students, depending on the options
   considered by them. Thus, we consider it necessary to determine whether
   students differ in their level of ICT competence taking into account the
   fact of being male or female, the age at which they completed their
   secondary education, the population of the locality where they reside
   (having more or less opportunity to be trained in ICT), the studies that
   gave the access to this undergraduate degree, and finally, the fact of
   devoting time exclusively to study or combining study and work.}},

   teacher educators all over the Europe is presented. It came to meet
   teachers' and teachers educators' requirements for quality and efficient
   preparation and implementation of teacher training through searching and
   sharing of high quality learning resources. The context of evaluation in
   Bulgaria of the Share.TEC portal interface and usability, as well as
   methodology used is introduced. On next place, the paper presents
   observations made during the process of validation done in parallel in
   several European countries. The data collected during the testing and

Abstract = {{My presentation showcases a very creative way of engaging students into
   using a combination of free or inexpensive tools - photos, digital
   video, lecture capture, visualization and team work to create a web site
   that offers a virtual trip to a place of interest. Using free web
   creation software by Weebly my students have designed a unique web site
   to display their individual assignments as part of a class project
   created to allow them to participate in a virtual field trip to the MIT
   Museum.
   Simulating a virtual field trip has allowed these digital natives to
   combine their learning experience in a digital classroom with the real
   trip to a museum, share the knowledge acquired during the trip with
   their peers in creative ways by contributing to the creation of a
   website meant to immerse everyone in this unique experience of choosing,
   learning and experimenting hands-on with various pieces exhibited in the
   museum.
   Students were assigned to go visit the MIT Museum. Each one had to
   choose one robot in the exhibit and learn about it, take pictures and/or
   small video clips, then present their choice in a ``virtual gallery{''}.
   Using free web creation software, they uploaded their assignments in a
   web site called Virtual field Trip to the MIT Museum. The idea was that
   someone who would use the site should get an experience comparable with
   visiting the museum.
   Students have worked as a team to also provide overall information about
   the museum - directions, hours, admission, general information, historic
   facts, etc.
   This has proved to be an excellent learning experience - students took
   ownership of this assignment, not only providing amazing pictures, video
   clips of themselves standing by their chosen items and explaining how
   they work, but providing links to web sites discussing various aspects
   of artificial intelligence, applications etc. They have formed this
   ad-hoc online community to collaborate in the process of designing the
   virtual field trip and have opened it to the outside world by including
   a blog who would allow visitors to express their opinions.
   My presentations will show the work in progress - the web sites created
   by my students using Weebly and Google docs.
   This presentation can be of interest to a large audience - from the
   faculty/instructors to the IT support staff to administrators interested
   in creative ways of exploring reality.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Teacher knowledge and application of new technology in
   schools has gradually gone from being an exception to being an
   educational necessity. As pupils are now thoroughly familiar with this
   technology in every aspect of their socio-educational interaction, the
   adoption of this new methodology has become inevitable as a way of
   optimising resources to improve pedagogical effectiveness and
   adaptation. Objective. Based on our accumulated teaching experience, we
   have summarised the points that we consider essential for an appropriate
   process of implementing new technology in the secondary school teaching
   context with the aim of facilitating the adoption of the methodology by
   teachers in the induction stage of their careers. Development. As in all
   teaching, a prior clarification of the objectives and competencies of
   the specific subject in question is required. In recognising that the
   application of new technology is not merely a matter of formal
   innovation or digital competence, we believe that it is important to be
   aware of its inherent limitations, such as the absence of the verbal and
   non-verbal communication that is characteristic of traditional teaching
   and learning, which must be incorporated to compensate for the
   shortcoming. We also stress the importance of an essential objective of
   education, which must be considered when applying new technology,
   consisting of educating within a more profound structure of thought
   following the traditional concept of ``learning to learn{''}. In
   connection with these foundations, we propose a set of criteria that we
   can graphically summarise through the following principles: ``virtue can
   be found in the golden mean{''}, ``good taste lies in simplicity{''},
   ``the limits of my language are the limits of my world{''}, ``what is
   not practical, should never be beautiful{''}, ``technique is the effort
   to save effort. Moreover, with respect to the specific technical steps
   to carry out in general, we propose creating a Word document containing
   a list of all of the materials that the teacher plans to use with the
   aim of creating any digital format at a later stage (digital magazine,
   power point presentation, etc.). Later, after converting the material
   into a PDF format and before sending it to students via email, it is
   preferable to use two systems: personalised sending by email through
   Dropbox or other free software systems that enable the material to be
   viewed publicly on a website or blog. Furthermore, the use of all
   existing interactive resources, such as digital whiteboards, should be
   explored and exploited, and not avoided, with the aim of encouraging
   pupil creativity and involvement. Conclusions. Adapting to new
   technology in the classroom is a necessary and gradual learning process
   for the teacher, leading to improved use of such resources in his or her
   teaching.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The use of new technology in our classrooms is gradually
   becoming an essential and inevitable tool in teaching, quite different
   from its former supplementary role in traditional methodology. From the
   various resources available, some of which became popular early on,
   experiences that synergistically combine a wider range of digital
   technology gain importance. Objective. To describe a recent teaching
   experience in the context of a Geography and History class from an
   upper-sixth Social Sciences course with the aim of presenting its
   various findings and results. Development. Firstly, a blog was created
   in which basic information was included, such as calendars, pupil
   opinions and comments, photographs of the group, forms created through
   Google Docs, etc. Then, we designed a website linked to the blog with
   photographs and videos, as well as documents with notes, along with
   multiple external links, including timelines and Dipity. In turn, notes
   and activities were sent via email indicating the availability to answer
   any questions raised by the pupils; we consider it advisable that, in
   order to enable the teacher to download, pupils' materials should be
   sent openly, and not as an attachment. The use of the interactive
   whiteboard in the classroom showed the pupils the versatility of its
   features and turned them into the real protagonists. Conclusions. A more
   comprehensive approach to new technology involving the exploitation of a
   number of technological resources in a given subject produces a positive
   synergistic effect for both pedagogical effectiveness and the pupils'
   educational environment.}},

Abstract = {{The Portuguese Technological Plan for Education (TPE) was established to
   modernize schools and to consolidate the role of Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) in order to promote the academic
   success of students and allow schools to be transformed into
   technological enhanced environments through a significant learning and
   knowledge building in a participatory, collaborative and sharing logic.
   With this work we aimed to establish dynamical interactions
   students-content-teacher in order to overcome a diagnosed students' lack
   of effort towards studying curriculum chemistry content.
   Our methodology design is a non experimental and descriptive one,
   carried out in a secondary school during a whole school year, in order
   to answer the question ``How to improve the engagement of K-12 students
   in chemistry classes?{''}. Students, gathered in small groups, were
   asked to create digital learning resources (DLR) during classes. The
   teacher assumed the role of the supervisor, coacher and facilitator of
   every task that had to be taken or chosen by the students. To enhance
   interaction student-student and student-teacher, a Twitter account and a
   Ning community were created for the class. Both supported the Social
   Learning Environment (SLE) that was intended to be created. The data
   collected - DLR created, participation of each student in the Ning
   community, teacher observations and students' opinions - led us to
   satisfactory results in what concerns the goals of this exploratory
   study.
   We based our research in the following facts: i) the development of a
   technological basis in education is a social demand and therefore its
   adoption in a systemic way is no longer a matter of choice; ii) our
   ``digital native{''} students have different learning styles not
   considered by traditional instructional practices; iii) SLE promotes and
   supports collaborative learning through the use of student-created
   content; iv) involving innovative pedagogical approaches opens up
   opportunities to engage students in creative learning and can possibly
   help bridge gaps between innovative and conventional pedagogical
   approaches and v) the use of well-structured technology, in certain
   contexts, may have a significant and positive effect on students'
   achievements.
   SLE has been shaped by experience and this study is about that: web 2.0
   tools, social media and student-generated content were used to answer to
   a combination of curriculum very specific skills and the needs and
   desires of the students.
   The affordances and constraints of SLE as an open architecture that has
   potential to facilitate collaborative learning are delineated.
   The methodology followed out allowed an interaction from many to many
   and an increased students' engagement in the proposed tasks. SLE
   developed ICT skills and established itself as a cognitive tool:
   students accessed information about learning content and turned it into
   knowledge.
   The results seem to demonstrate that TPE, by allowing the ubiquity of
   computers in schools, let students to be more engaged in working and
   came out to be a facilitator for integrating ICT in the curriculum.
   Our findings are important for the Portuguese teachers who still
   withstand, before these ``Net Generation{''} students, to experimenting
   pedagogical approaches that integrate ICT into real teaching contexts
   which is now an imperative cause.
   Future work should focus on mechanisms that allow assessment both of the
   methodology used and the students' generated content in order to improve
   students' learning in this environment.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2005, the Arts and Administration Program at the University of
   Oregon has been implementing an eportfolio process for students, which
   has evolved to encompass courses, department and academic programs, and
   students in multi-disciplinary learning communities. With the emergence
   of web 2.0/3.0 tools and a vibrant open source community, the eportfolio
   project is embracing instructional technologies that employ lifelong
   digital communication and learning tools in support of student learning
   and assessment. With a focus on the development of 21st century
   workforce skills - including innovation, creativity, collaboration, and
   communication - faculty and instructional support staff create dynamic
   mediated learning environments that incorporate reflection, analysis,
   and presentation across degree programs, and that transect the borders
   between classroom learning and professional development.
   Research suggests that participation in eportfolio learning in a web
   2.0/3.0 environment enhances student engagement, critical reflection and
   analysis, and fosters a collaborative teaching-learning environment.
   Preliminary findings in a two-year study suggests that significant
   changes in pedagogical approach on the part of faculty are also
   occurring, leading to transformations in the ways that students (and
   faculty) are assessed. This paper will present a case study of a
   five-year initiative to develop eportfolio learning processes across a
   research university in the U.S.. Challenges to implementation, including
   navigating institutional approaches to learning and assessment, and
   larger implications for higher education as a result of participation in
   building communities of learners in blended and virtual environments,
   will also be explored.}},

Abstract = {{Learning objects (L.O.) have become central in the latest development of
   the field of Education and E-Learning. According to the Higher Education
   Academy in the UK the definition of an L.O. is:
   ``... a particular type of online electronic learning material that is
   generally defined as a small, digital and self-contained unit of
   learning that can be broadly (but not exclusively) described as context
   independent, reusable and adaptable.{''}
   So according to the definition, three dimensions are central to defining
   what could and could not be an L.O.: the `Content' dimension, the
   `Technological' dimension and the `Pedagogic' dimension.
   However, a central question when creating an L.O. is: `How small is
   small enough?' This issue becomes a huge complication factor for anyone
   trying to define the scope of an L.O. and can only be answered with the
   inclusion of a fourth dimension: the `Communication' dimension. Without
   support from communication theories and recent advancements of audience
   awareness, there will be difficulties in creating truly usable L.O.s.
   We present a case study of defining an L.O. in the field of Animal
   Welfare education. Animal Welfare Indicators (AWIN), a project that is
   being supported by the European Community, is tackling the L.O.
   methodology to generate truly exemplar L.O.s that can become templates
   to universities and other stakeholders interested in the field. Some
   existing L.O.s in the area of animal pain assessment are presented, as
   are suggestions for future ones, focusing mainly the `Communication'
   dimension.
   The question of ``How small is small enough{''} is discussed here, using
   examples from other mass media channels. Today, we are dealing with a
   new generation of students with shorter attention spans and that are
   used to multitasking in the digital world. Therefore, L.O.s should not
   exceed more than 30 minutes. However, being able to focus a large amount
   of complex information into such a short time span is the main barrier
   to success in this area. We suggest that each new L.O. should be tested
   within the primary target audience to test for efficacy, comprehension
   and ease of use.}},

Abstract = {{Students of today have a different cognitive learning pattern - they
   study, play and relax using digital gadgets. Having short attention
   span, these digital natives desire instant feedback when they interact
   with others. They also want to have a say in what they learn, why they
   learn and how they learn. We can no longer engage them with conventional
   teaching methods. We need to find innovative and creative ways to engage
   them, so that they find learning meaningful and would eventually be
   self-directed learners with 21st Century skills and dispositions.
   A Microsoft Mentor School, Ngee Ann Secondary School (Singapore) has
   created an Heuristic Online Learning Agent (HOLA) on Microsoft Network
   (MSN) Messenger platform to aid students' learning of the Periodic Table
   in Chemistry classes. Using Artificial Intelligence, this chat bot is a
   virtual peer tutor that taps on the digital natives' savvy usage of
   Instant Messaging on MSN Messenger. Unlike other chat bots which
   dispenses information in a cut-and-dry manner, HOLA is a lifelike,
   conversational virtual agent that provides a uniquely stimulating and
   interactive way for students to get answers in a fun, lively and
   personal manner; exchanging information like a buddy would and allowing
   students to learn at their own pace anytime, anywhere. Built primarily
   on a Socratic questioning animated framework, the HOLA also incorporates
   thinking routines to scaffold students' learning of The Periodic Table
   in Chemistry lessons.
   This paper examines the effectiveness of adopting the HOLA in building
   students' understanding of The Periodic Table in the Chemistry classes
   of a Singapore secondary school. The study will highlight the importance
   of considering the pedagogical approach on which the technology is based
   - by showing how the choice of a Socratic-like questioning approach as
   the pedagogical style of an animated agent which amalgamates both
   technology and pedagogy well.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to give a brief account of an ongoing work at
   the University of Porto (U. Porto) which aims to promote and disseminate
   the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) inside all
   the educational activities and also encourage the development and use of
   innovational services.
   Based on this innovation goal through its unit for New Technologies in
   Education (NTE) the University adopted in 2003 a pilot-project to
   develop pedagogical contents for Learning Management System (LMS). The
   main idea was to complement face-to-face classes with a online
   teaching/learning component - in this paper the online courses should
   intended a blended-learning support for presential courses. The most
   important and more common pedagogical support gave by the office to
   those teachers interested in blended-learning methodology are the
   personal work meetings with them, usually followed by presentations of
   the platform to the students on their first presential class. After a
   few years with more than 774 online courses the NTE office, composed of
   a multidisciplinary team of eight persons, gives not only technical and
   pedagogical support to the academic community that is using the
   institutional e-learning platform - Moodle U.PORTO - but also makes
   available other services, encourages and supports their use.
   Despite all the obstacles inherent in the implementation of a
   Computer-Based Assessment (CBA) strategy in a traditional and large
   university like U. Porto, the office is engaged in supporting
   e-assessment. Although the online assessments that have been taking
   place are individual experiences, they are of major importance since
   they allow the identification of problems and definition of the
   necessary improvements. All the online assessments have been performed
   in Moodle.
   Aware of the importance of e-contents as a way to enhance students'
   knowledge the office provides a service of educational multimedia
   objects development for teachers that have online courses. The objects
   are developed by a small sub-team and the most common types of
   multimedia contents requested are videos sessions, animations, graphic
   works, and some simulations.
   A free of charge videoconference studio and a telepresence room, both
   managed by NTE, are also available to the academic community. The
   persons from the office who are responsible for those infrastructures
   also provide technical support for Educast - software for web broadcast
   - and Colibri - software that allows web conference. In the last few
   years the office have presented and is trying motivate more discussion
   on pedagogical issues like digital accessibility or the viability of
   e-portfolios as an instrument to meet the changing needs of teaching and
   learning. So to improve the knowledge and performance of teachers and
   students in ICT issues - and therefore promote the NTE services
   described above - the office has conducted continuing education courses,
   workshops and small events some of them with guest speakers experts in
   areas such as comparative judgment assessment, e-assessment or
   electronic portfolios.
   The feedback obtained over the years has shown that the existence of an
   office that works so closely to the academic community facilitates not
   only the implementation of projects like these but also allows create
   foundations for more innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Much like immigrants who leave the cultural comfort of their home
   societies and move to places with very different cultures and social
   practices, those who teach online leave the familiarity of the
   face-to-face classroom for the uncharted terrain of the online
   environment, whose constraints and affordances often lead to very
   different practices. The trans-classroom teacher who moves between the
   two environments, transferring ideas, strategies, and practices from one
   to the other, is a mental migrant. The transformations-of the teacher
   and of the course-that occur in these migrations and the two-way
   interactions between face-to-face and online teaching are the focus of
   this study. As teachers adapt their courses for the online environment,
   they are forced to re-examine the course design, reconsider curriculum
   strategies, and make many decisions about what to take out and what to
   keep, what to add and what to substitute. The implication for faculty
   who would like to implement mobile learning in their online or
   traditional courses is that they can begin by making content and
   information available to students in formats easily accessible by mobile
   phone or laptop computer. This would be a logical first step, since a
   majority of students and faculty already use these tools in many of
   their daily activities. Other tools, such as video iPods and MP3
   players, can be phased in gradually. The following ideas could be
   implemented immediately with little to no additional cost. Most basic
   cell phones today can send and receive text messages, voicemail, and
   e-mail. E-mail is a convenient way to communicate information to the
   learning community, so the instructor can begin by sending class-wide
   ``broadcast{''} e-mails that students can access via a variety of mobile
   devices}},

Abstract = {{In an age where digital innovation knows no boundaries, research in the
   area of brain-computer interface and other neural interface devices go
   where none have gone before. The possibilities are endless and as dreams
   become reality, the implications of these amazing developments should be
   considered.
   Some of these new devices have been created to correct or minimise the
   effects of disease or injury so the paper discusses some of the current
   research and development in the area, including neuroprosthetics.
   To assist researchers and academics in identifying some of the legal and
   ethical issues that might arise as a result of research and development
   of neural interface devices, using both non-invasive techniques and
   invasive procedures, the paper discusses a number of recent observations
   of authors in the field.
   The issue of enhancing human attributes by incorporating these new
   devices is also considered. Such enhancement may be regarded as freeing
   the mind from the constraints of the body, but there are legal and moral
   issues that researchers and academics would be well advised to
   contemplate as these new devices are developed and used.
   While different fact situation surround each of these new devices, and
   those that are yet to come, consideration of the legal and ethical
   landscape may assist researchers and academics in dealing effectively
   with matters that arise in these times of transition. Lawyers could seek
   to facilitate the resolution of the legal disputes that arise in this
   area of research and development within the existing judicial and
   legislative frameworks. Whether these frameworks will suffice, or will
   need to change in order to enable effective resolution, is a broader
   question to be explored.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: The use of instructional technology in institutions of higher
   education is increasing around the world, but few have successfully
   incorporated a rapidly changing array of web-based tools into curriculum
   development efforts. Contributory to this process is that trainees'
   insights are essential in the development of educational curricula and
   evaluation, even though participatory approaches are less frequently
   implemented. Methods that integrate digital technologies with curriculum
   development and educational evaluation with input from trainees are
   needed for greater reach and participation of trainees during all
   program stages while taking advantage of the unique aspects of the web.
   Objective: To demonstrate how trainee participatory methods for
   curriculum development and evaluation can be implemented using web-based
   and cell phone communication technology for the enhancement of skills
   acquired by the public health workforce in conducting comparative
   effectiveness research.
   Methods: A case study was conducted with a group of eight public health
   professionals from the College of Public Health at the University of
   South Florida. Possessing diverse areas of expertise, including
   medicine, epidemiology, biostatistics, and the social sciences, each
   participant collaborated during the formative stages of an e-learning
   program for the enhancement of public health workforce skills in
   comparative effectiveness research. A participative learning climate was
   facilitated through a trainer-trainee partnership during the needs
   assessment process, implementation, and formative evaluation of the
   comparative effectiveness research e-learning/mobile-learning series
   using a variety of internet and communication technology tools, such as
   text messaging, audience response system, online surveying, emailing,
   blogging, and social media. Logic model development and a modified
   Delphi evaluation were conducted to determine useful elements of the
   program, sources of satisfaction, weaknesses, and suggestions for
   program improvement.
   Results: Participants demonstrated appreciation of the integration of
   web-based and cellphone communication technology into the implementation
   and assessment of the learning series. Five main themes summarizing the
   utility of the series emerged from the evaluation: use of digital
   technology, analytical software exercises, real world application,
   readings, and social interactions with professionals of diverse
   disciplines. Subsequent rounds of the Delphi indicated that there was
   general agreement on the aspects most useful for e-learning, including
   the flexibility of online learning and the use of mobile technologies to
   communicate and assess the course. Participants revealed opportunities
   for improvement, including additional content, variety in assessment
   strategies, in class exercises, a revamped learning management system,
   and an increased level of interaction. Open dialogue using blogs,
   revealed factors contributing to program deficiencies permitting to
   establish an ongoing quality improvement of future e-learning endeavors.
   Conclusion: Instructional and communication technology advances can be
   successfully integrated into curriculum development efforts providing
   unique advantages to enhance trainees' participation and foster program
   improvement. Instructors at institutions of higher education could take
   advantage of educational informatics technology to enhance professional
   experiences and learning methods.}},

Abstract = {{I have had the privilege of being a founding member of a new
   comprehensive professional art school in Singapore, The School of Art
   Design and Media at Nanyang Technological University. I was brought into
   the Digital Animation department to help develop the animation
   curriculum, particularly the stop motion courses, and to design and
   build classroom facilities. The original plan for the stop motion
   curriculum was to assign various exercises which would reinforce basic
   animation principals and modeling skills to enhance their 3D work in the
   future. However, throughout the years, students coming out of these stop
   motion courses have produced more than just exercises. Many have
   consistently produced innovative and award winning shorts films.
   This paper is a reflection on the increased level of interest in stop
   motion animated filmmaking, paricularly in Singapore within the last 6
   years, as well as around the world. I will speculate as to why I believe
   there has been this resurgence why and this old method of animation did
   not disappear with the advances in 3D technologies. I will then
   introduce a few successful projects from my own stop motion courses
   which merge various artistic disciplines, including photography, design,
   writing, theatre, sculpture, and visual communications.}},

Abstract = {{People's work and life style has been changed by the development of
   information and communication technology (ICT) that can provide the
   necessary information of economy and society faster and cheaper than
   ever before to the people live in the remote mountainous areas to
   improve their competitiveness in the economy. Therefore ICT is the
   important means of bridging the digital divide, reducing poverty and
   narrowing the gap between rich and poor and building a socialist
   harmonious society. In this paper, the empirical analysis was used.
   Dependent variables were telephone numbers (include mobile phone) per
   ten thousand people, computers per thousand people and internet users
   per thousand people. Independent variables were the levels of per capita
   income, urbanization, higher education, market openness and
   technological innovation. Eviews statistical analysis software was used.
   The empirical result showed that each independent variable had a
   positive correlation with the telephone penetration level, the level of
   urbanization and market openness had no significant effect on the
   Internet user penetration level and higher education level and market
   openness were not closely related to computer penetration level.}},

   preliminary results of the proposed system. The technique works by
   taking pictures of the object from multiple view angles. The series of
   pictures were post-processed via feature point extraction, point match
   and 3D surface reconstruction. In comparison with the traditional method
   such as laser scanning, the major advantages of our instrument include
   the lower cost, compact and easy-to-use hardware, satisfactory
   measurement accuracy, and significantly less measurement time. Besides
   its potential applications in prosthetics and orthotics surface
   measurement, the simple setup and its ease of use will make it suitable

Abstract = {{This paper presents our experiences and results in developing and
   delivering two core Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) courses
   with laboratory components completely online using an internet based
   distance learning delivery system and the Mobile Studio technology and
   pedagogy. The challenge in offering ECE courses online is the fact they
   have a very intensive hands-on component, such as design and laboratory
   experiments, that require students to use expensive laboratory equipment
   to complete and demonstrate their projects. This implied that until now,
   institutions offering ECE laboratory courses had to have students attend
   the laboratory courses on their campuses. Our ECE department is in the
   process of redesigning and delivering all 200-level and 300-level
   electrical/electronic engineering core and laboratory courses utilizing
   unique and innovative distance learning technologies.
   We successfully developed and delivered two pilot courses, ``Electric
   Circuits{''}, and ``Introduction to Electrical Laboratory{''} completely
   online during the summer of 2010. Both courses, and a third course
   called ``Introduction to Digital Design{''} are currently being offered
   completely online to students enrolled in our regular ECE program. This
   paper will present a detailed explanation on how we used the Mobile
   Studio technology to redesign and offer ECE laboratory experiments that
   can be conducted by students without using regular laboratory space and
   equipment. We also present detailed description on how we used the Adobe
   Connect (TM) software to allow the students to demonstrate their design
   and laboratory experiment circuits to the course instructor from a
   remote location. The results have shown that the students were able to
   conduct most of the design and laboratory experiments required in the
   regular courses without the need to be on campus. All the students
   enrolled in the pilot summer courses successfully completed the two ECE
   courses and are currently enrolled in the follow-up courses.}},

Abstract = {{The proposed Computer Engineering Technology program is designed to meet
   industry's overwhelming need for employees with an in-depth knowledge of
   both hardware and software. There is a shortage of individuals who could
   implement hardware-software integration in design and development. The
   proposed degree curriculum plan will bridge the gap between these two
   disciplines, and will provide the students a solid foundation in each.
   The proposed curriculum will integrate the knowledge in the areas of
   electronics, computer and software with intensive classroom and
   laboratory experiences.
   From a software perspective, the proposed curriculum would draw its
   resources and would include most of the existing courses from the
   Computer Science curriculum within the department of Mathematics,
   Computer Science, \& Statistics. Students will gain proficiency in
   software design and development using programming languages currently
   used in industry. The proposed curriculum would allow the students to
   draw courses from the areas like Algorithms, Image Processing,
   Distributed Systems, Automata and Computability, Database systems,
   Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence and Numerical Analysis.
   Students learn industry standard approaches to application software
   development as well as state-of-the-art problem solving techniques.
   The hardware focus of the proposed curriculum would draw its resources
   from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology curriculum. The
   curriculum provides a fresh look at Electrical Engineering Technology
   curriculum from the perspective of System Design. It examines the
   subject areas that prepares the student to pursue the discipline of
   System Design from at least four different perspectives; via: 1)
   PLD/FPGA centric system design, 2) Microcontroller based Embedded System
   Design, 3) PC based Network-oriented Distributed System Design and 4)
   DSP based Real-time Processing based System Design(1). The hardware
   focus is in the areas of PLD design, Analog Electronics Embedded System
   design, Electronic fabrication, Biomedical Electronics, Computer
   Networking, Distributed Systems and Digital Signal Processing (DSP).
   This proposed plan emphasizes on both disciplines (Electrical and
   Computer Engineering Technology and Computer Science), along with a
   solid math, science and general education background, to enable industry

Abstract = {{Advancing personalized learning is recognized as one of the grand
   challenges facing engineers in the next century. Technology has provided
   advancements in instruction which were not previously available, but
   there is often resistance to adoption of new technologies. Our research
   group introduced the use of tablet computers in a first year engineering
   fundamentals course initially as part of a study of students'
   problem-solving strategies, a key skill for students to master and
   succeed in engineering. A custom tablet computer software application
   called MuseInk (c) was utilized to capture problem solving procedures in
   a manner that emulates handwritten solutions, but uses digital ink to
   record the solutions. This technology permits different classroom
   activities beyond the use of hand written solutions typical of
   traditional courses where assignments are completed with pencil and
   paper, and adds valuable information beyond the final solution. As with
   any new implementation of technology, there is a period of resistance
   and a mixture of feelings toward adoption of the technology that must be
   overcome to get benefit from the technology. As educators work to make
   instruction more personalized, effective, and interactive, research on
   the adoption of new technology is imperative to understand what drives
   these adoption behaviors to better mitigate resistance to technology
   implementation. Our research group surveyed students on their attitudes
   and behaviors toward the use of tablet computers and the MuseInk
   software technology introduced into the classroom. Diffusion theory is
   used as a framework to examine the technology adoption behaviors.
   Overall, the attitudes and behaviors associated with the introduction of
   tablet computers and MuseInk software followed adoption patterns
   typically seen with typical diffusion of innovations.}},

Abstract = {{There is agreement amongst educators, policy makers and professionals
   that teaching and learning in STEM areas at the K-12 level must be
   improved. Concerns about the preparedness of high school students to
   improve the innovation capacity of the United States are leveled
   following data showing US students performing below students in other
   industrialized nations on international math and science tests(1). To
   address both the preparedness for and the appeal of engineering,
   technical education programs have emerged that provide hands-on,
   project-based curricula that focus on the integration of mathematics and
   science knowledge with engineering activities. Learning Sciences
   research emphasizes that integration of new ideas with prior knowledge
   must be made explicit to learners in order to promote successful
   transfer to novel problem-solving and design contexts(2). Thus,
   integration of mathematics and engineering is important both for
   mainline (general education) as well as pipeline (career preparation)
   goals for engineering education(3).
   Increasingly, research on high school engineering curricula is focused
   on the nature of classroom instruction and its impact on student
   learning. The current study uses actual classroom observations to try to
   understand how students in the high school classroom learn and integrate
   mathematics and engineering skills and concepts based on the teacher's
   actions in a portion of the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Digital
   Electronics (TM) curriculum. Digital Electronics (TM) is a unique course
   in that it utilizes mathematics concepts such as Boolean algebra that
   are beyond the scope of most high school mathematics standards. Thus,
   while students are likely to have little direct prior knowledge, there
   is a greater need for explicit introduction and integration of the math
   that is used in this curriculum than is typical for K-12 engineering
   curricula overall(4,5,6).
   To summarize our major findings: The PLTW Digital Electronics (TM) (DE)
   curriculum introduces a great deal of mathematics to students that goes
   above and beyond the national high school mathematics standards. The
   mathematics taught in DE is equally skills and conceptually based.
   Students learn about numbers, Boolean algebra (its notation,
   transformation and various important theorems), truth tables and
   Karnaugh maps. These learning opportunities are primarily through
   project work and tutorials, which constitute 74\% of the instruction
   time in our sample. Process standards of mathematics such as problem
   solving, reasoning and making connections are also used to complete
   projects. The engineering skills and concepts used in this curriculum
   are focused on wiring circuits, and solving (Boolean) logic problems
   related to circuit design. Explicit connections between mathematics and
   engineering were observed 78\% of the time. This is primarily because
   the mathematics and engineering in digital electronics work is
   practically inseparable. That is, in order to achieve the project goals,
   students must be taught mathematics skills and concepts, which then form
   the basis for the primary engineering skills and concepts of the
   lessons.}},

   Virtual Instrumentation Suite (NI ELVIS) is an education platform
   designed to address both instructor and student needs and is the ideal

Abstract = {{In this paper, an AC 2-degree freedom hybrid magnetic bearing (HMB) is
   proposed, which is driven by a 3-phase AC power inverter. The
   configuration and the operating principle producing magnetic suspension
   forces of the AC 2-degree freedom HMB are introduced. By using
   equivalent magnetic circuit method, the calculation formulas of magnetic
   suspension forces and the mathematics models of the system are deduced.
   Nonlinearities of suspension forces and cross coupling between different
   degree freedoms are studied further by calculating the suspension forces
   at different displacements and control currents to validate the
   feasibility of the mathematics model. Then based on the mathematics
   models of the AC 2-degree freedom HMB, a digital control system of this
   novel bearing is designed based on TMS320F2812 DSP. The performances of
   digital control system of the AC 2-degree freedom HMB has been test by
   experiment. The anti-disturbance experiment has shown that the control
   performances of the digital control system of the AC 2-degree freedom
   HMB are well. This innovated AC 2-degree freedom HMB can be applied in
   high speed machine tool spindle with lower manufacturing and operation

Abstract = {{new generation of telecommunication applications requires highly
   efficient processing units to tackle with the increasing signal
   processing algorithmic complexity. They also need to be flexible for
   handling a large range of radio access technology with specifications
   moving very fast. As devices including telecommunication features are,
   per nature, mobile, the high level of flexibility must be achieved while
   preserving very low power consumption. In this paper, a high performance
   low-power application-specific processor is proposed for complex signal
   processing. Thanks to dedicated control architecture, this processor
   exhibits an average 81\% utilization rate of its principal operator, a
   complex MAC for a 3GPP-LTE application. The main innovations are the use
   of a reconfigurable profile and instruction cache strategy to reduce
   power consumption. This leads to a 10x reduction of the control power
   consumption. As a result, an average 50 mW power consumption is measured
   after implementation in a low-power 65 nm technology while delivering
   3.2 GOPS. Finally, a comparison with state-of-the-art low-power DSP
   shows at least 24 \% gain.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past forty years, the number of fighter aircraft controlled
   flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents per flight hour has not improved
   despite the addition of multiple manual warning systems. The Air Force
   Research Laboratory (AFRL) has undertaken a program to develop an
   automatic system that will take over when the pilot can no longer
   recover the aircraft, perform an automatic recovery and quickly return
   control to the pilot. It is called the Automatic Ground Collision
   Avoidance System or Auto GCAS. This system has been successfully
   demonstrated on a Block 50 F-16 with a digital flight control system as
   shown in Figure 1 and is transitioning to operational Block 40/50 F-16s.
   Until now the technology could not be applied to early model F-16s with
   analog flight control systems because of the lack of a high authority
   autopilot needed for the automatic recovery and the absence of a way for
   the flight control system to ascertain system integrity to insure safe
   operation. AFRL is now focused on finding a technical solution that will
   allow the implementation of Auto GCAS on aircraft with analog flight
   control systems. The effort is called Analog Auto GCAS.
   The Analog Auto GCAS project has developed an innovative method of
   adding redundant digital processor modules to the existing analog flight
   control computers of pre-block 40 F-16' s. This will not only allow Auto
   GCAS to be added to F-16s with analog flight control computer but
   demonstrates a technical path forward for incorporating Auto GCAS onto
   other older aircraft with analog flight control computers. This paper
   provides a description of Auto GCAS, discusses the changes needed to
   implement Auto GCAS on an analog aircraft, and covers the results to
   date as well as the future path forward for implementing Auto GCAS on
   the pre-block 40 F-16 fleet.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, technological advances have lead to a society with
   communication platforms like iPhone and Kinect Xbox that are able to
   inject sensing presence into online social networks (OSNs). Thus, it is
   possible to create large-scale opportunistic networks by integrating
   sensors, applications and social networks and this development could
   also promote innovative collaborative cyber security models. In this
   position paper, we discuss how social informatics will play a crucial
   role in trustworthy pervasive computing. With regard to security, our
   primary computing paradigm is still about processing information content
   only in order to make decisions. Given the availability of both
   digitized social informatics and sensor content, we now have the option
   to examine these sources simultaneously. We refer to this new era as the
   Social Computing Paradigm, and we argue that it could be particularly
   useful in conjunction with opportunistic sensing.}},

Abstract = {{In advanced applications such as digital radar, frequency hopping
   encryption data links, Micro-Wave Waveform Design Systems, Ultra Wide
   Bandwidth communications and software defined radio, the need for
   instantaneous bandwidth often drives system design decisions. The
   availability of powerful signal processors able to handle broadband
   signal vectors is not an issue anymore; the bottleneck is now the
   availability of high sampling rate and high linearity data converters,
   ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter) for reception and DAC (Digital to
   Analogue Converter) for transmission. Access to high speed data
   converters enabling up and down conversion directly in the L Band, S
   Band and C Band will allow system architects to operate in the digital
   world ever closer to the antenna, thus simplifying drastically receiver
   or transmitter architecture by removing costly Intermediate Frequency
   stages. Broadband DAC's are key enabling components which open up new
   design opportunities for direct digital Synthesizer systems.
   In this regard, this paper describes an innovative multimode 12 Bit
   3GS/s MuxDAC, offering 46ps full swing rise time (that is 7.5 GHz
   analogue output bandwidth), based on a 200 GHz SiGeC bipolar Technology,
   which enables direct micro wave signal generation of up to 1.2 GHz width
   arbitrary waveforms directly in the high IF (L S or C Band) region
   closer to the Antenna.
   Beyond system and DAC design considerations this paper includes extended
   capability measurement performed on silicon. This DAC is turning
   Software Defined Micro-Wave or Direct Micro-Wave Synthesis (DMWS) from
   pure concept into proven reality up to C-Band.}},

Abstract = {{Gonzaga University's Smart Antenna and Radio Laboratory (SARL) equipment
   was obtained in Q4 of 2010 via a Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)
   grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The lab enables
   innovators to address issues in wireless communications by facilitating
   the design, simulation, and testing of interference-reducing,
   high-performance communications, radios, algorithms, and antenna
   systems. The complexity and performance of wireless digital
   communication systems has increased substantially in recent years.
   Nearly all new wireless standards use multi-antenna techniques to
   increase spectral efficiency and resulting system bandwidth. The
   laboratory reduces the barrier-to-entry for companies and educational
   institutions requiring access to the tools required to develop designs
   and conduct research.
   The SARL at Gonzaga University will lead to improved reliability for
   life-critical first responder communications, smart grid energy, and
   natural resource management. It provides collaborative research and
   educational opportunities for faculty and students at three
   participating universities and one community college. Many local
   wireless technology companies are committed to collaborating with member
   institutions and utilizing the equipment. Native American summer science
   and other science, engineering and math related programs expose at least
   1000 K-12 students annually to Gonzaga University's faculty, students
   and entrepreneurs.}},

Abstract = {{The development of front-end converters for power factor correction and
   DC link voltage control of power electronics converters such as, UPS,
   Inverters, and Switched Power Supplies, has been attracting great
   interest from the scientific community that works toward the
   achievements of cost reduction, high efficiency, and reliability. In
   this context, this paper proposes an innovative microprocessed control
   technique for sinusoidal input line current imposition in front-end
   sensorless Boost converters, named in this work as PFC-BOOST-CSL. The
   proposed method is based on experimental acquisition of gate-drive
   signal sequences for different load conditions. These signals correspond
   to a complete cycle of the AC input voltage and are recorded in the
   microcontroller memory in order to be reproduced when used in a Boost
   converter without current sensor. In the operation of PFC-BOOST-CSL, a
   suitable switching sequence is sent to drive the power switch in order
   to minimize output voltage error and maintain a sinusoidal input
   current. Aiming to prove the proposed digital control concept, a 600W
   PFC-BOOST-CSL prototype was built and analyzed in laboratory and the
   main experimental results are presented herein.}},

Abstract = {{The necessity of restructuring engineering education has been recognized
   for many years, but for a number of reasons reform is becoming
   increasingly urgent. It is not just that current engineering education
   methods are increasingly obsolete; student cognitive patterns are
   changing in unpredictable ways, and the complexity of the environment
   within which engineering is practiced is also increasing dramatically.
   Half measures that might have been seen as adequate a decade ago are no
   longer sufficient. What is required is a thorough rethinking of the
   engineering education framework, centered around a division of
   engineering students into technical, single expertise, and design

Abstract = {{Network economics appear to be one of the best solutions when it comes
   to solving the tragedy of the digital commons problem in Peer-to-Peer
   networks. Various solutions have been proposed based on bartering or

   currency. Its novelty lies in the usage of the supply and demand laws
   and the usage of microeconomic tools. Furthermore, a regulation of the
   prices and a protection from the misbehavior of other users is provided.
   An innovation of SPECT is the introduction of a financial instrument,
   the debt obligations, based on the real world bonds. Using debt
   obligations, peers are able to profit from being in the network even if
   they do not share resources with other peers.
   The authors outline the architecture of the SPECT market and the

   emergency power supply system based on digital signal possessor (DSP)
   was developed. The main strategy for this design is that using fuel
   cells as the main power supply while using a small battery as an
   auxiliary power supply. Thus, the power-on time of EPS is immensely
   extended. In addition, the hardware can automatically switch when the
   utility grid power down. Also, the switching time can be controlled
   within 10ms. Finally, the FC EPS system has been tested. The results
   show that the design has a series of advantages: safe and reliable, the
   power-on time is long enough and the switching time is incredibly short,
   and it has a strong practical value.}},

   improve their competitiveness in the economy. Therefore ICT is the
   important means of bridging the digital divide, reducing poverty and
   narrowing the gap between rich and poor and building a socialist
   harmonious society. In this paper, the empirical analysis was used.
   Dependent variables were telephone numbers (include mobile phone) per
   ten thousand people, computers per thousand people and internet users
   per thousand people. Independent variables were the levels of per capita
   income, urbanization, higher education, market openness and
   technological innovation. Eviews statistical analysis software was used.
   The empirical result showed that each independent variable had a
   positive correlation with the telephone penetration level, the level of
   urbanization and market openness had no significant effect on the
   Internet user penetration level and higher education level and market
   openness were not closely related to computer penetration level.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development architecture of complex CNC machine tool and its
   key technologies were studied in order to promote the capabilities of
   self-development and innovation of the native machine tool enterprises.
   The research focus on the integration framework of system and modeling
   methodology, which help to construct a development system with
   knowledge-driven and application system-embedded processes, that is to
   say, modular design of machine tool, performance optimization and
   simulation, product cost estimation and evaluation, etc., should be
   real-time embedded. The design modules of system, such as conceptual
   design, performance test, product cost estimation and evaluation, were
   developed based on client/server framework. Moreover, the further
   development based on CATIA V5, ANSYS and ADAMS were performed by using
   VisualBasic. NET, as well as using ADO.NET to access Oracle 9i stored
   procedures, The system maintenance module and project management module
   were developed based on browser /server framework. On the other hand,
   the modeling methodology of intelligent digital mock-up based on

Abstract = {{Creativity and innovation are critically important to the well-being of
   many enterprises, including those offering engineering-and
   technology-based services. Cross-functional teams are traditionally
   employed by companies to pursue projects involving creativity and
   innovation. These teams comprise of participants in face-to-face
   settings. Alternatively, asynchronous virtual teams may also be engaged
   to enable identifiable participants to interact via digital means from a
   distance. Asynchronous virtual teams are especially convenient to
   participants at global locations in multiple time zones.
   The objective of this paper is to suggest a third kind of teams, the
   virtual teams with anonymity and structured interactions (VTASIs), in
   which participants remain anonymous, follow a modified Delphi
   brain-storming process, communicate with one another asynchronously via
   electronic means, apply a set of streamlined idea generation strategies,
   and conduct multiple rounds of structured interactions under the
   guidance of a knowledgeable team leader.
   Described in details are the advantages of VTASI teams from the design
   team's perspectives, as supported by an original study conducted in 2010
   at University at Buffalo involving two VTASI teams of a total of 14
   graduate engineering students, who developed new ideas to enhance the
   operations of the United States Postal Service. Key results are
   presented and conclusions are offered.
   For global operations, the VTASI teams outlined in this paper represent
   an advanced form of team design and operation which has the potential to
   be especially effective for creative pursuits. Such teams could be
   particularly useful to enhance the relative competitiveness of many
   engineering-and technology-based global service firms.}},

Abstract = {{As industrial policies play an increasingly critical role in national
   competitiveness, many nations follow the concept of traditional
   strategic planning, by external environmental scanning, forecasting and
   the competitive advantage analysis. After deciding promising industries,
   with export-led, the government then invests sufficient resources to
   support related actors to foster the development of several domains.
   Consider, for example, Taiwan is well positioned to expand in the
   development of information and communication technologies (ICT)
   industries as the planning model. However, when faced with rapidly
   changing and unpredictable future, this model may result in resource
   rigidity. For promoting emerging industries, many researchers state that
   the demand-driven innovation policy is more effective because of the new
   technological structure could be generated by constructing an innovative
   ecosystem which as a way of setting vision more explicit, has concerned
   with interactions among different players.
   As a result, this study introduces the project of ``Vision 2025{''},
   which is the first experimental policy formulation project in Taiwan. We
   identify four major stages for vision-setting, and further propose
   digital storytelling should be adopted at the beginning to provide an
   interaction schema.}},

Abstract = {{With the advances of digital technologies and participative webs of
   services, knowledge-intensive digital services have thrived on a rapidly
   expanding platform-based network economy. There is a great need for a
   comprehensive research on knowledge based analysis on social network and
   business network evolution to facilitate collaborative development of
   digital services.
   This research aims to develop an ontology-guided analysis of networking
   to facilitate the formation of the innovation network to create new
   digital services. Central to the research is a dynamic ontology
   construct that could articulate the evolution of the social and business
   networks driven by the prospects of value creation with networking
   structure and routines contributing to recognizing, engaging, and
   mobilizing key actors and resources. Based on a prototype model and a
   series of case studies of the emerging knowledge-intensive service
   industries, this research explores the potential of the model in
   adapting to the heterogeneity of the service demands and collaboration
   mechanisms in the service network. Through in-depth model-based analysis
   and synthesis of the emerging digital service activities, this research
   expects to develop an ontology-based platform for knowledge creation and
   network management system to capture the extensive opportunities for
   value creation in participative webs of services on experience

Abstract = {{This paper seeks to contribute to the analysis of innovation in the
   Colombian industry (at group or 2-digit ISIC level) using data from the
   first two national innovation surveys. This is pursued by means of
   Innovation Indices, from which it is sought to identify regional and
   national special features, while allowing international comparative
   analysis, along the lines of the Oslo Manual. The work highlights the
   limitations of the information available to carry out the calculation of
   innovation indices as proposed in the recent literature on the subject.
   As an alternative, a methodology based on the Importance Value Indices
   (IVIs) is applied, which allows the calculation of new innovation
   performance indicators amenable to international comparisons. By
   applying multivariate statistical techniques, redundant information of a
   high number of variables is cleared to construct the IVIs; then,
   clustering and characterization of the different units of analysis is
   performed using a model that connects the variables refined. The paper
   concludes with an exercise of innovation analysis applied to industrial
   groups in Colombia, using IVIs constructed with data from the first two
   national innovation surveys.}},

Abstract = {{This paper has examined the leapfrogging strategies with the case of
   catch-up and lead in digital wireless communications by the Korean
   public institutes. Despite the disadvantages implied by the
   technological regime of wireless communications and the risks facing
   early entrants in trajectory choice and initial market formation, the
   Korean Public Institute had achieved a ``path-creating catch-up and
   lead{''} in the sense they chose a different path from the world
   forerunners firms in the behalf of Korean government. Despite the lack
   of sufficient capability and core technical knowledge base, the Korean
   public institute was able to develop the digital wireless communications
   systems. Towards global digital communications market, the Korean
   targeted the national market from the beginning, and their sources for
   competitive advantages were the speedy catching up the digital
   communications for complex system like switching system at the initial
   stage. From the mid of 1990s, Korea was the first country in the world
   to develop the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) based digital mobile
   telecommunications system. Korea became the first to commercialize
   Wibro, LTE(Long Term Evolution), and LTE Advanced system for providing
   Wireless Broadband communications services in 2005 and 2010
   respectively. As a result, Korea enjoyed no. 1 technologies in the world
   since the early 2000s in evolutionary wireless communications services.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine how Apple and Google have used third-party led
   innovation to create viable digital innovation ecosystems, through the
   App Store and the Android platform respectively. In many ways, this is
   similar to the strategy adopted in an earlier decade by NTT DoCoMo in
   the mobile communications space, through the iMode platform. We compare
   and contrast alternative approaches to accelerating innovation through
   such an ecosystem oriented approach, and outline some key lessons for
   content providers, developers, and other stakeholders. We analyze these
   developments through the theories of network externalities, social
   network communication theory, and related frameworks in strategic
   management}},

Abstract = {{Automatic image annotation is the process by which a computer system
   automatically assigns metadata in the form of captioning or keywords to
   a digital image. This application of computer vision technique is used
   in image retrieval system to organize and locate images of interest from
   a database. Many techniques have been proposed for image annotation in
   the last decade that gives reasonable performance on standard datasets.
   In this work, we introduce an innovative hybrid model for image
   annotation that treats annotation as a retrieval problem. The proposed
   technique utilizes low level image features and a simple combination of
   basic distances using JEC to find the nearest neighbors of a given
   image; the keywords are then assigned using SVM approach which aims to
   explore the combination of three different methods. First, the initial
   annotation of the data using two known methods, and that takes the
   hierarchy into consideration by classifying consecutively its instances;
   finally, we make use of pair wise majority voting between methods by
   simply summing strings in order to produce a final annotation. The
   proposed technique results show that this method outperforms the current
   state of art methods on the standard datasets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the influence of digital technologies on media
   networks and in particular how they affect the traditional gatekeeping
   model. The wireless communications are the hot point of all digital
   technologies and their applications for the transmission of Olympic
   Games is the time milestone of the global creative industries every two
   and four years, in winder and summer Olympic Games. The authors argue
   that the R\&I industries' role involved with media industries need to be
   reconsidered into the frame of the updated media gatekeeping model. To
   investigate this research question results are reported from a case
   study regarding the gatekeeping processes in the 2008 Olympic Games in
   Beijing and the next Olympics up to 2016. Results show the need for a
   new gatekeeping model that takes into consideration the impact of
   digital technologies, especially the wireless communications.
   Additionally, the factor of R\&I into this new model could prevail new
   decision models about in vesting into innovation in global media
   industry, as the last has un impact on the media gatekeeping model
   itself.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless technology is a fast, flexible and easy-to-deploy solution to
   provide broadband access. In this context, the adoption of Femtocell
   Access Points, operating in the licensed cellular bands and typically
   designed to be used in SOHO, will improve the radio coverage and the
   building penetration of the existing mobile networks, based on
   macrocells.
   In the present paper an innovative approach to access the end user,
   relying on infrastructural integration of femtocellular technology with
   existing cabled networks, is proposed.
   This peculiar solution is further strengthened by the growing interest
   towards the possible deployment of mobile technologies in both the last
   portion of the UHF band V and the GSM frequency band, resulting from the
   re-farming process.}},

Abstract = {{Interorganisational ICT has become critical for the performance of both
   small and large organisations. SMEs however, traditionally lag behind in
   the uptake of these systems. In many countries, various policy
   programmes are initiated to improve ICT uptake by SMEs and support them
   in digital linking throughout their value chain. In the Netherlands, a
   nationwide policy programme was in place between 2002 and 2007 that is a
   prominent example of this type of policy initiatives. In this paper we
   present the results of an ex post evaluation of this programme, by
   comparing survey data collected among 516 participating SMEs with,survey
   data collected among a control group of 124 SMEs. In bivariate analysis,
   significant differences are found between the two groups with regard to
   the adoption of several types of interorganisational ICT. These
   differences remain intact if split sampling of the groups is applied by
   size (small/medium) and sector (trade/finance/public). Furthermore, it
   is found that participants of the policy programme perceived
   significantly more added value of ICT. In interpreting these results
   however, pre -selection effects should be taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, HCI has become increasingly preoccupied with the
   deeply subjective qualities of interaction: experience, embodiment,
   pleasure, intimacy, and so on, an agenda sometimes grouped under the
   heading of ``third-wave HCI.{''} Analytically understanding and
   designing for such qualities has been an ongoing challenge to the field,
   in part because its established theories and methodologies are
   comparatively weak at understanding and being responsive to human
   subjectivity. In this paper, we present a case study of a group of
   designers who have, in the past few years, revolutionized their
   domain-sex toys-by combining embodied pleasure, intimate experience,
   health and wellness, emerging technologies, high-quality design
   processes, and social activism. We consider the implications this case
   could have for researchers innovating on especially third-wave HCI
   design theories, methodologies, and processes.}},

Abstract = {{The Malaysian government is aggressive in its innovations in information
   and computer technology. However, the senior citizens are left behind,
   mainly due to fear of technology or having low or zero ICT literacy.

   technology was reduced and they developed interests and needs to seek
   information online. To conclude, to ensure people's acceptance and ICT
   adoption, any initiatives to bridge digital divide must consider the

Abstract = {{The arrangement of the five central figures of the east pediment of the
   temple of Zeus at Olympia has been the subject of scholarly debates
   since the discovery of the fragments more than a century ago. In theory,
   there are four substantially different arrangements, all of which have
   already been selected by certain scholars for various aesthetic,
   technical and other considerations. The present project tries to
   approach this controversy in a new way, by producing a virtual 3D
   reconstruction of the group. Digital models of the statues were produced
   by scanning the original fragments and by reconstructing them virtually.
   For this purpose an innovative new software (Leonar3Do) has also been
   employed. The virtual model of the pediment surrounding the sculptures
   was prepared on the basis of the latest architectural studies and
   afterwards the reconstructed models were inserted in this frame, in
   order to test the technical feasibility and aesthetic effects the four
   possible arrangements. The paper gives an overview of the entire work
   and presents the final results suggesting that two arrangements can be
   ruled out due to the limited space available in the pediment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the surveying process performed on the Church of
   San Ildefonso in Zamora (Spain) using Orthoware (c), an innovative
   photogrammetric software tool specially designed for the digital
   reconstruction of cultural heritage. This software is the result of
   intense R\&D at Metria Digital after several years producing heritage
   true orthoimages, plans and full color 3D models in a commercial
   environment. Orthoware allows true measurements and produces high
   quality true orthoimages and full color 3D models starting out from
   conventional digital photographs. This is a progressive tool designed
   for non-specialist users, providing intuitive and quick methods to
   visually diagnose the quality of the results.
   The Church of San Ildefonso in Zamora was built over a previously
   existing temple whose Romanesque construction dates back to the 11th
   century, although it is nowadays hidden among extensions and remodelings
   carried out up until 18th century. With a length of more than 30 meters,
   the original floor plan of the Church consists on three naves and three
   apses, although only one nave is visible now, covered by groin vault,
   and one semicircular apse partially hidden by the current building. The
   south front maintains the greater part of its Romanesque origins, in
   spite of being hidden and higher than the present ground level. At the
   feet of the temple a tower rises, whose first stage is Romanesque but
   which has been altered by numerous Baroque elements.
   The objective of the photogrammetric reconstruction was the integral
   survey of the monument, including its four facades, interior faces and
   roofs for the production of some true-orthoimages, cross-sections,
   longitudinal-sections and ground plans at scale 1/50 with an accuracy of
   10 mm for the drawings and a pixel size below 10 mm for the synthetic
   imagery.
   The usual photogrammetric workflow for producing true-orthoimages and
   digital 3D models in cultural heritage depends to a great extent on
   finding and matching homologous features amongst various images. This is
   a time-consuming, repetitive and blind recognition process requiring
   some spatial intuition and experience from the user. Orthoware makes use
   of automatic image analysis and computer vision techniques to improve
   this processing. Its innovative graphic user interface allows full
   interactivity and corrections or refinements to be performed at any time
   providing intuitive diagnostics from partial results. This flow involves
   very intensive calculations achieved through a software development
   specific for GPU (Graphic Processing Unit), using OpenGL (Open Graphics
   Library) and DirectX. Therefore, a combination of manual and automatic
   techniques makes up the ideal tool for a production environment. The
   workflow presented herein allow users to reduce orthoimage production
   time from months to just a few weeks.}},

Abstract = {{The main focus of this article is to explain a teaching activity. This
   experience follows a research aimed to testing innovative systems for
   formal and digital analysis of architectural building. In particular,
   the field of investigation is the analytical drawing. An analytical draw
   allows to develope an interpretative and similar models of reality;
   these models are built using photomodeling techniques and are designed
   to re-mTite modern and contemporary architecture. The typology of the
   buildings surveyed belong to a cultural period, called Modern Movement,
   historically placed between the two world wars. The Modern Movement
   aimed to renew existing architectural principle and to a functional
   redefinition of the same one. In Italy these principles arrived during
   the Fascist period. Heritage made up of public social buildings (case
   del Balilla, GIL., recreation center...) built during the fascist period
   in middle Italy is remarkable for quantity and in many cases for
   architectural quality. This kind of buildings arc composed using pure
   shapes: large cube (gyms) alternate with long rectangular block
   containing offices creates compositions made of big volumes and high
   towers. These features are perfectly suited to the needs of a surveying
   process by photomodeling where the role of photography is central and
   where there is the need to identify certain and easily distinguishable
   points on all picture, leaning on the edges of the volume or lininig on
   the texture discontinuity. The goal is the documentation to preserve and
   to develop buildings and urban complexes of modern architecture,
   directed to encourage an artistic preservation.}},

Abstract = {{Open innovation (OI) can be seen as systematically encouraging and
   exploring a wide range of internal and external sources for innovation
   opportunities, consciously integrating that exploration with firm
   capabilities and resources, and broadly exploiting those opportunities
   through multiple channels (Cohen \& Levinthal, 1990). In order to
   determine organizational competences or technological capabilities for
   open innovation, we explore the characteristics of open source software
   development projects as successful examples how organizations can
   enhance their businesses by using the ideas of open innovation.
   Hafkesbrink \& Schroll, 2009, clustered organizational competences for
   open innovation in digital economy in three dimensions of organizational
   readiness, collaborative capabilities and absorptive capacities. As a
   backbone of each of these dimensions appear the technological
   enhancement and existing of adequate collaboration and communication
   tools.
   One of the main benefits of the Semantic Web (SW) approach is the
   ability to model a knowledge structure using ontology as the starting
   point. Ontologies are highly suitable to represent consensus knowledge
   and its structure. This is exactly what is needed to exchange
   information within a community of interest and to enable automated
   processing of information items.
   SW technologies have the potential to improve information processing and
   knowledge sharing, increasing the quality of current applications and
   providing more sophisticated features for end users, but most of these
   theoretical advantages are not easily exploitable by real world
   applications (Lara et all, 2002).
   In this article we explore possibilities of semantic web infrastructure
   development to support organizational competences for open innovation.
   The idea is not new and it seems that the SW is very suitable for OI
   infrastructure requirements, but both disciplines recorded a decade of
   development without significant mutual application of research results.
   In order to identify the obstacles to intensive common development, we
   made the SWOT analysis for introduction of SW technologies in this stage
   of development as a main infrastructure for open innovation
   organization.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the intensity and patterns of use of fixed and mobile
   broadband consumers in Portugal. If usage across types of consumers is
   similar after controlling for individual characteristics identified to
   be important drivers of adoption, then it is more likely that consumers
   view mobile and fixed broadband as somewhat substitutable. Such a result
   is important for studies of broadband impacts; specifically, for
   discerning whether mobile broadband service will have a similar level of
   impact upon social and economic development as fixed broadband services
   have had. Results indicate that broadband uses are similar across fixed
   and mobile users, suggesting that the technologies are somewhat
   substitutable from customers' perspectives and raising the possibility
   of limited differential effects on innovation and other social goals.
   Results of interest include the characteristics of Internet users by
   technology, and differences of usage patterns reflected by individual
   characteristics.}},

   core. A digital temperature sensor of 1-wire bus LTM8871 is used to
   detect the real-time temperature and an inner comparator of P89LPC930 to
   detect the zero point. According to fuzzy control rules, a best angle is
   chosen. This technology is applied to drive the AC motor to get constant
   temperature differential. The system is effective in improving the
   thermal efficiency and poor circulation by avoiding frequent start-up of
   circulation pump. The innovation points lie in the system uses a minimum

Abstract = {{This study discusses how digital manuals with retinal imaging display
   (RID) can be applied to conventional work scenarios, particularly
   focusing on their impact on workers' psychology. An RID is a type of
   wearable display, like glasses, that enables users to view an overlay of
   a digital image and the real world. We conducted an experiment in which
   the subjects assembled an object consisting of 10 parts, by referring to
   a manual presented using RID. We prepared three types of manual content:
   a picture manual in monochrome, a picture manual in full color, and a
   movie manual. The subjects were tested under three conditions in which
   each type of content was presented using RID. For comparison, the
   subjects were also tested under two additional conditions: the same
   picture manual in monochrome presented on a 17-inch normal display; and
   the same picture manual in monochrome presented on paper. Based on the
   experimental results, we make the following suggestions. When a paper
   manual is replaced by a digital manual, the workers' task performance
   improves. However, for highly skilled workers, differences in display
   type or content design do not always improve their performance further.
   On the other hand, differences in display type and content design can
   have a characteristic influence on the workers' psychology. In
   particular, 1) manuals with full-color pictures can work well in various
   situations; 2) manuals with monochrome pictures give workers a
   comfortable sense of tension and make them conscious of a professional
   atmosphere; and 3) movie manuals can add positive factors such as
   pleasure, high motivation, and strong emotional impressions.}},

Abstract = {{Globalisation, the accelerating development of new information and
   communication technologies (ICTs) and the increasing dynamics of markets
   place new demands on knowledge transfer. Of particular significance in
   education is the use of e-learning, learning based on new ICTs. Due to
   its independence of time and location, e-learning is viewed as an
   opportunity to overcome spatial disparities between countries, but also
   between urban and rural areas within every country through the
   improvement of Knowledge Management. ``e-ruralnet - network promoting
   e-learning for rural development{''} is a project co-financed by the
   European Commission and deals with e-learning as a perspective for rural
   areas in the context of the ``Programme for Lifelong Learning{''}.
   Particularly the needs of the rural workforce are the main focus of
   interest. One emphasis of the project is the analysis of the e-learning
   market, in terms of both supply and demand. This report presents the
   first results of the supply side of the e-learning market on basis of a
   nationwide survey of e-learning providers in Germany. The survey
   focussed on identifying available learning products, especially in terms
   of innovations and creativity. The research findings demonstrate
   different structures in the use of e-learning in urban and rural areas.
   Based on this data it is the objective to derive recommendations for
   actions for relevant interest groups.}},

Title = {{Resveratrol-Containing Gel for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris A
   Single-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled, Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL DERMATOLOGY}},

Pages = {{133-141}},
Abstract = {{Background: Acne vulgaris is a complex, chronic, and common skin
   disorder of pilosebaceous units. The major pathogenic factors involved
   are ductal hyperkeratinization, obstruction of sebaceous follicles
   resulting from abnormal keratinization of the infundibular epithelium,
   stimulation of sebaceous gland secretion by androgens, and microbial
   colonization of pilosebaceous units by Propionibacterium acnes, which
   promotes perifollicular inflammation.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of
   resveratrol, a natural phytoalexin produced by some spermatophytes, such
   as grapes and other plants, on acneic skin.
   Methods: Resveratrol was incorporated in a carboxymethylcellulose-based
   gel. The chemical stability of resveratrol after storage at 4 C for 30
   days was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
   The resveratrol-containing hydrogel was administered to 20 patients
   affected by acne vulgaris enrolled in this single-blind study. The
   resveratrol-containing formulation was applied daily as a solo treatment
   on the right side of the face for 60 days, while the hydrogel vehicle
   was applied to the left side of the face as a control. To objectively
   evaluate the results, a digital photographic database was used to
   collect images. The number and type of lesions were recorded for each
   patient, to compare the Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) score before
   treatment with that obtained at the end of the study. Moreover, with the
   innovative technique of follicular biopsy, areas of acneic skin were
   prepared for histopathology. The average area occupied by microcomedones
   at baseline was compared with that at the end of treatment.
   Results: HPLC analysis demonstrated that resveratrol, upon incorporation
   into the gel, did not convert to its cis-isomer when stored at 4 degrees
   C for 30 days. All patients were satisfied with the active treatment and
   none experienced adverse effects. Clinical evaluation showed a 53.75\%
   mean reduction in the GAGS score on the resveratrol-treated sides of the
   face compared with 6.10\% on the vehicle-treated sides of the face.
   These data were supported by histologic analysis, which showed a 66.7\%
   mean reduction in the average area of microcomedones on the
   resveratrol-treated sides of the face. The comparison with the
   vehicle-treated side of the face (9.7\% reduction) showed a clinically
   relevant and statistically significant decrease of lesions in areas
   treated with resveratrol-containing hydrogel.
   Conclusion: This pilot study showed positive results for resveratrol gel
   in acne, and should be considered a valid starting point for further
   testing of the effectiveness of this molecule in different
   concentrations and formulations and in a larger group of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Iodine was discovered as a novel element in 1811 during the Napoleonic
   Wars. To celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of this event we reflect
   on the history and highlight the many facets of iodine research that
   have evolved since its discovery. Iodine has an impact on many aspects
   of life on Earth as well as on human civilization. It is accumulated in
   high concentrations by marine algae, which are the origin of strong
   iodine fluxes into the coastal atmosphere which influence climatic
   processes, and dissolved iodine is considered a biophilic element in
   marine sediments. Iodine is central to thyroid function in vertebrates,
   with paramount implications for human health. Iodine can exist in a wide
   range of oxidation states and it features a diverse supramolecular
   chemistry. Iodine is amenable to several analytical techniques, and
   iodine compounds have found widespread use in organic synthesis.
   Elemental iodine is produced on an industrial scale and has found a wide
   range of applications in innovative materials, including
   semiconductorsin particular, in solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I will discuss how educational innovation at the moment
   is based on the technology and the contents, that is, on the Computing
   Services and the University Libraries. I will also set out how these
   university services must be updated to meet these demands. In a previous
   article I argued that technology was the driving force of the current
   educational innovation, so I will not get into it now. In this article I
   will defend the role of university libraries as revitalizing and
   disseminating forces for this educational innovation, based on the
   information and communication technology and using precisely these
   technologies. I am talking about educational innovation, not about
   research in education. The technology and the library, based on the
   scientific progress, can educational innovation come true, supported by
   the pedagogical studies and models. This article is structured into two
   main blocks and a final section. The first block will deal with the
   dissemination of educational innovation, trying to fit three pieces:
   defining the concept of technology enhanced learning, arguing in favor
   of open knowledge and finally outlining the library of the digital
   university. In the second section I will discuss the policy and
   corporate strategy of the University of Alicante about these aspects in
   the last five years, detailing five lines of work: the Institutional
   Repository (RUA), the OpenCourseWare (OCW-UA), the Portal Audiovisual
   and other sites in the cloud, the fragUA and the Computer and
   Informational Skills (CI2). I will finally reflect on all this and I
   will present a kind of conclusions.}},

   environments which have writing as their support, aiming at improving
   reading and writing practices in students. The students indicated that
   the innovation allowed them to carry out self-evaluation, to communicate
   with teachers and with other students, to synthesize and apply ideas,
   and to reflect on ways of expressing concepts in writing. Besides, they
   stressed the valuable help of concept maps as ways of reorganizing their

Abstract = {{Investigation of the stress concentration in the nanomultilayer
   materials under exploitation conditions is the main objective of the
   work. During loading a failure can initiate and propagate, which have
   important impact on material strength and reliability. This is of
   importance when materials for biological applications are considered.
   Special features of the investigated material, including irregular shape
   of the boundaries and columnar structure of these layers lead to growth
   of local stresses in the material and may be responsible for mentioned
   instabilities. To capture this behavior during numerical modeling an
   innovative solutions are required.
   Authors propose numerical simulation, which combines algorithms of the
   deposition process for realistic digital material representation of
   coatings and finite element (FE) approach for modeling of material
   behavior under loading. Algorithm of the deposition process is
   implemented using the cellular automata (CA) approach. Based on the
   developed model, a simple plastometric compression tests are simulated
   to analyze stress distribution in the material and possibility of
   failure initiation. These results are compared qualitatively with
   experimental data, including ball-on-test and transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) observation. Obtained results are the basis for
   development of a numerical model for fracture propagation with adopted
   extended finite element method (XFEM).}},

Abstract = {{In last decades of international architecture, different contemporary
   architects (Libeskind; Rem Koolhaas; Herzog and Of Meuron; Toyo Ito;
   UnStudio; NOX; Madridejos-Sancho) have graphically presented buildings
   and architectural projects on the basis of a two-dimensional unfolding
   of three-dimensional folded surfaces. The two-dimensional constant and
   dynamic projection of a spatial three-dimensional situation has been
   argued from simple spatial-temporal allegories of the Architectural
   Project up to new developments with non-conventional instrumental
   resources, generating innovative structural, formal, spatial and
   technological solutions. Although these valuable individual experiences
   have contributed positively to the contemporary discussion, at the
   practical level they have not represented generalized strategies that
   can be transferred to the professional practice and to architectural
   education. This article uses results of more than 10 workshops (with
   Unfolding and Folding methodologies) developed in Chile, Argentina and
   Brazil to build up a pedagogy for the project that makes it possible to
   investigate the spatial and material properties of folded compositions
   in Architecture. It proposes to review and update project instruments
   through the incorporation of Parametric Design (2D generative patterns);
   3D origami software and machines of Digital Manufacturing (CNC and Laser

Abstract = {{Experimental validation of thermal hydraulics and CFD codes of scaled
   down models and full models of Nuclear Reactor components is very
   important for reactor system designers and reactor safety experts for
   optimal design and providing best safety features of the reactor
   systems. Over the period of time several techniques have been developed
   for this purpose. Among them Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV),
   a laser based optical technique, is the recent, innovative, promising
   and flexible enough one so that it can be adapted to a large variety
   flows. By this technique test time is reduced significantly.
   DPIV is a non-intrusive optical measurement technique, which allows
   capturing several thousand velocity vectors within large flow fields
   instantaneously. DPIV technique is being used in very wide and different
   applications, from micro flows over combustion to supersonic flows for
   both industrial needs and research.
   2-D DPIV facility having non-intrusive, instantaneous flow visualization
   with high spatial and temporal resolution features has been developed.
   It is used for measurement of flow velocity vectors at many (e. g.
   thousands) points in a flow field simultaneously and it provides
   instantaneous vector fields and displays velocity vectors in rea l-time.
   DPIV combines flow visualization with accurate quantitative velocity
   data. 2-D Velocity vectors are obtained by analysis of displacement of
   tracer particles on images in a known time. The development of
   visualization tools are powerful enough to at tack the complexity of a
   resulting flow field but also flexible enough so that they can be
   adapted to a large variety of different flow. DPIV system has Laser
   light source, Laser beam delivery system, High speed camera interface,
   DPIV image acquisition \& analysis software, CCD camera, computer
   controlled synchronizer, seeding particles \& PC. This system will
   enhance our capability of thermal hydraulics, neutronics and
   multiphysics modelling by experimental support \& actual measurement of
   parameters, in addition to codes we had with us. Application of DPIV is
   must for the flow in the separation and reattachment regions where it is
   directly related to drag and heat transfer coefficients and for Vortex
   shedding. This facility is being used for basic research of code
   verification, code development, design optimizations and safety
   analysis. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and/or

Abstract = {{The Pliocene period in the Montpellier region, considered as being
   emblematic since the middle of the 19th century because of its diverse
   mammal fauna, has not received much innovative treatment over the last
   30 years. In particular, there has been no reinterpretation of
   geological data in the light of the Messinian-Zanclean double eustasy
   and related mechanisms. And yet, the increase in the number of urban
   projects affecting the Pliocene terrains and substratum has allowed for
   a renewed analysis of these areas in conformity with the results
   obtained in the nearby valley of the Rhone river. Highlighting the
   discordance, the regressive Messiman erosion has allowed for the
   Pliocene fluviatile network of the Lez to emerge. This in turn has made
   possible the reconstruction of a digitate network that recorded all of
   the phases of the filling in of these Pliocene rias. This is
   particularly clear thanks to the study of the Messinian discordance in
   the hard rocks of the Montpellier fold on the one hand, and on the
   other, within the Neogene ditches. Since the Messiman, the course of the
   Mosson and Lez rivers, just as that of the Vidourle river, tracked
   heavily to the east. This is how the Pliocene Mosson river crossed the
   Montpellier fold. In fact these modifications of the river courses, made
   possible by the reuse, until the end of the Pliocene, of the erosion
   surfaces of the coastal links (the Montpellier fold, the Gardiole),
   correspond to the accentuation of the deformations of these surfaces.
   The amplitude and variability of these movements is a result of the
   altitude of the marine-continental Pliocene transition. This altitude is
   doubtless often rather approximate, but it differs considerably with
   respect to the coastal Jurassic ranges (the Montpellier fold to the
   north, the Gardiole to the south), which frame the Pliocene ``Gulf{''}
   of Montpellier. The two coastal ranges, calcareous and sub-parallel to
   the sea surface, have succeeded in channeling the transgression at the
   point of the saddleback axes, conferring Dalmatian coastal
   characteristics to the Pliocene ria}},

Abstract = {{The paper surveys the risks and benefits what a user faces in networked
   environment and how those challenges can be competed. The question is
   how to measure a potential or benefits of such complex phenomenon as the
   collaborative cross-domains in social media. We propose an innovative
   solution -to consider this in context of digital tools and the entities
   involved into cooperation-collaboration: core researchers, engineers
   developing information systems and tools, marketing technologists,
   users-consumers of services and products. The ways of collecting data
   and measures for protection privacy issues of data collected online as
   they were applied during the last two decades are overviewed in this
   paper. There is no universal law protecting online user's privacy in
   global world and hardly will it be ever. For a while only the awareness
   of the users, the Codes of Professional Ethics and a fairness of firms
   involved into collaboration could help them to avoid pitfalls hidden in
   social media. The summary table shows at a glance benefits and dangers
   met in social media by its explorers and users. An example included
   demonstrates how consumers' data can be analyzed and used by companies
   for behavioral targeting via clustering model and Bayesian approach in
   recommender systems.}},

Title = {{A novel video-based method using projected light to measure trunk
   volumes during respiration}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{707-713}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes and evaluates an innovative video-based method for
   measuring the trunk volume during respiration, using projected light and
   surface reconstruction. The method consists of the following main steps:
   (a) to project a grid of circular light markers on the anterior and
   posterior human body trunk surface during breathing, (b) to register the
   subject's trunk surface using two pairs of pre-calibrated digital video
   cameras, (c) to segment the video stream and track the projected markers
   using pre-processing techniques, morphological operators and detection
   algorithms, (d) to label the corresponding markers in the video
   sequences registered by each pair of stereo cameras, (e) to reconstruct
   the 3-D coordinates of all markers, (f) to reconstruct the surfaces from
   the unordered cloud of points using the Power Crust method and (g) to
   calculate the trunk volume in function of time using the divergence
   theorem. The evaluation of the method was based on two experiments. (1)
   Comparison of the volume of a trunk model (mannequin) by immersion and
   using the proposed optical method. (2) Analysis of the applicability of
   the method for measuring a subject's trunk volume during a vital
   capacity respiratory manoeuvre. The results showed that the method was
   able to automatically measure more than 2000 projected points per image
   and to provide a very detailed representation of the subject's trunk.
   The relative accuracy of the volume measurement was estimated to be
   better than 3\%. The analysis of the experiments revealed that signals
   coherent with the respiratory cycles could be identified through this
   method. In conclusion, the method based on light projection and surface
   reconstruction provides an accurate, non-invasive and useful means to
   calculate human trunk volumes during breathing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a digitally fabricated, customizable
   line of furniture and casework objects that leverage parametric
   technology and social networking to produce a highly collaborative
   distributed digital fabrication workflow. It describes how a furniture
   system, serving as an apprehensible model for architecture, was designed
   concurrently with the networked, multi-agent workflow that manufactures
   it and the layered user input that defines it. The furniture object
   designs are inextricably linked to their fabrication by a distributed
   network of small fabricators that supplant the single large
   manufacturer, and to their open outcomes that balance professional
   design expertise with user input. The paper concludes with describing
   how this model challenges the architectural profession's prevailing
   focus on the transactional and object oriented capabilities of recent
   digital innovations. By using such tools to design the objects within
   their systemic and networked relationships, architects might
   successfully create outcomes that better respond to society's
   increasingly complex demands.}},

Abstract = {{The Virtual Environment Rugby Skills Trainer (VERST) is an on-going
   collaborative project between Bangor University's Schools of Computer
   Science, Sports Health and Education Sciences and Psychology, together
   with Rugby Innovations Ltd., to create an accessible training tool that
   will help professional rugby players improve certain skills. It is said
   that it takes 10,000 hours of learning to fully grasp a skill; VERST
   will reduce the waiting time during practices and allow players to train
   individually. Although similar projects are being developed for lineouts
   and defensive strategy, as a first step in our implementation we have
   chosen to focus on passing the ball; an accurate passing technique is
   more difficult to achieve than many realize, and is a truly vital base
   skill. Using a motion capture suite and other tracking hardware, the
   players' and ball's movements are digitized so to allow them to interact
   with the virtual environment in a natural way. Physical modelling and
   simulating the motion of a virtual ball under real-game conditions
   preserve the accuracy of the environment. Wales is characterized as a
   nation that loves rugby, but no one really uses this for marketing a
   project from the heartland might be what Wales needs to win the world
   cup!}},

Abstract = {{Design Thinking is an approach for innovative problem solving. A typical
   characteristic of this approach involves multidisciplinary teams and the
   extensive use of tangible tools such as sticky notes, whiteboards and
   all kinds of prototyping materials. When team members try to collaborate
   from separate locations their traditional way of working becomes nearly
   impossible. A number of computer supported collaborative work systems
   exist, but there still lacks acceptable support for teams applying
   methods like Design Thinking. We have created an environment that allows
   these teams to work together efficiently across distances, without
   having to change their working modes. The Tele-Board prototype combines
   video conferencing with a synchronized whiteboard transparent overlay.
   This unique setup enables regionally separated team members to
   simultaneously manipulate artifacts while seeing each other's gestures
   and facial expressions. Our system's flexible architecture maximizes
   hardware independence by supporting a diverse selection of input
   devices. User feedback has confirmed that the Tele-Board system is a
   good basis to further enable collaborative creativity across distances
   while retaining the essential feeling of working together.}},

Abstract = {{In the everyday capturing and sharing of digital images, one is rarely
   confronted with the notion of this media being any different than its
   analog counterpart. With the exception of an occasional compressed
   artifact, the medium remains transparent to the pictorial content it
   contains-that is until an error or glitch occurs, providing a brief
   glimpse into the inherent properties of the medium itself. However,
   through advancements in error detection techniques, these artifacts are
   seen with less and less frequency, thus further removing the message
   from its medium. What if the glitch was caused intentionally? What range
   of innovative visual possibilities might unfold as the digital image is
   pushed beyond its ideal state? In pursuing these questions, the term
   precise mishandling was coined to describe a method of carefully and
   thoroughly manipulating the structural code found within a digital
   image, meanwhile observing the reaction this had on the pictorial
   surface. Utilizing the most common file format for digital images, the
   JPEG, this paper follows the discovery of a technique for generating
   innovative imagery through the cross-media visualization of text.}},

Abstract = {{KCPK is running an initiative called SSK, or Smart and Slim Supply
   Chains, dealing with bio-based packaging and innovations for making
   overall supply chains smarter and slimmer. SSK initiative covers the
   full trajectory from production, through distribution to the consumer.
   SSK focuses towards four different types of supply chains and several
   types of printed intelligence, with
   2D codes included. 2D codes are a kind of 2D matrix symbology which,
   when compared to 1D or barcodes, have specific advantages that enable
   novel and extended opportunities of use. In 2D codes, data is encoded in
   both the height and width of the symbol, so large amount of information
   can be encoded in smaller footprint. 2D codes can be read in any
   direction. Some 2D codes provide readability of (up to 30\%) obscured
   and/or damaged symbols, as well. Most known 2D codes are QR and
   Datamatrix, and other open and proprietary types exist. Other than for
   logistics and part marking, 2D codes are nowadays also more used in
   print to web, marketing and added-value applications. The aim of this
   paper is to investigate the application of 2D codes in bio-based
   packaging. Solid board is used as a specific example of such packaging.
   Direct printing of 2D codes, using digital printing techniques, is
   studied in terms of influence of material and process characteristics on
   achieved print quality reproduction and readability.}},

Booktitle = {{DIGITAL FACTORY FOR HUMAN-ORIENTED PRODUCTION SYSTEMS: THE INTEGRATION
   OF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Pages = {{103-124}},
Abstract = {{Business Process Management can be considered a powerful catalyst to
   increase companies' innovation capabilities by exploiting and
   coordinating firms' processes and resources in an optimal way. In a
   digital factory, processes do not only require useful information as
   input but also the possibility to capture, share, and reuse knowledge to
   increase workers productivity. As a consequence, there is a current need
   to evolve from old generation factories that exchange information among
   specific or closed working groups and/or individuals in silos to the
   next generation of digital- and knowledge-based factories where relevant
   business processes content is coauthored and shared among all workers.
   Additionally, companies need to collaborate with distributed internal
   and external networks to carry out different processes in a
   collaborative and concurrent way, in particular with customers and
   suppliers. On the other hand, Web 2.0 functionalities, such as wilds,
   blogs, tags, among many others, promise a new digital business ecosystem
   enabling formal/informal and internal/external relationships and
   interactions. Thus, this chapter briefly presents the applied research
   carried out in the Swiss DiFac project by SUPSI and CEMEX Research Group
   to cocreate the SMARTBRICKS Web 2.0 prototype to foster an
   open-collaborative space for business processes knowledge sharing and
   contents cocreation.}},

   fiber-optic screen, adding more pixels by combining many
   lower-resolution components. Video performance is improved by combining
   multiple sources per final pixel ({''}pixel signal processing{''}) to
   increase final frame rate, contrast, brightness, digital 3D image
   process, and color gamut, instead of exclusively trying to improve the
   performance of a single source per sub-pixel or pixel.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue microarrays (TMAs) have recently emerged as very valuable tools

   TMAs representative of samples produced from conventional toxicology
   studies within a large-scale, multi-institutional pan-European project,
   PredTox. PredTox, short for Predictive Toxicology, formed part of an EU
   FP6 Integrated Project, Innovative Medicines for Europe (InnoMed), and
   aimed to study pre-clinically 16 compounds of known liver and/or kidney
   toxicity. In more detail, TMAs were constructed from materials
   corresponding to the full face sections of liver and kidney from rats
   treated with different drug candidates by members of the consortium. We
   also describe the process of digital slide scanning of kidney and liver
   sections, in the context of creating an online resource of
   histopathological data.}},

Abstract = {{Indiana was one of the first states to build a state website. Its IT
   functions had strong legislative underpinnings and its central IT agency
   exercises a relatively high degree of authority over agency-based IT
   functions. In addition, Indiana's website, AccessIndiana, was the
   product of a long-term public-private partnership. Based on the analysis
   of official and public documents and some in-depth semi-structured
   interviews with key factors such as the general manager of Indiana
   Interactive and the former state CIO, this case describes the recent
   history and success of AccessIndiana from about 1995 to 2005. This was
   the period in which AccessIndiana was considered one of the most
   successful public-private partnerships managing a state Website. After a
   brief period of uncertainty, in July of 2006, the state of Indiana
   signed a new long-term contract with Indiana Interactive to develop and
   maintain its official portal. AccessIndiana offers important lessons to
   public agencies, particularly for state and local governments and
   developing nations.}},

Abstract = {{The intent of this paper is to examine experimental design methods in
   the field of architecture and their implementation in academic settings.
   The projects emerged during design research studio at the institute of
   digital design techniques at the university of Kassel and collaborative
   workshops with several institutes. The starting point of the teaching
   concept was a divergence from the usual methods and ways of thinking,
   allowing for new, innovative solutions to emergence during the design
   process. The main point was a development of novel spatial modules in
   coherence with material and structural considerations. The question of
   materiality becomes a crucial consideration. The characteristics of
   different materials used for models development did not just influenced
   geometrical possibilities but also intensify, explore and organize
   spatial and structural qualities of the projects.}},

Abstract = {{Digital fabrication has become the true counterpoint to computer aided
   design in architecture. Thanks to new C.A.D./C.A.M. technologies
   architectural design can now manufacture complex buildings that only a
   decade ago could have been almost impossible to develop. This
   convergence between C.A.D./C.A.M. technologies is producing a trend from
   construction to manufacturing. Arbitrariness of architectural form
   should not be confused with arbitrariness of architectural design, the
   latter being contradictory with the very essence of design. Conventional
   or digital architecture must achieve design consistency and must rely on
   architecture's basic principle, that of necessity. New materiality is a
   term being coined in relation to digital fabrication and the way it
   should address materiality in architecture. Innovation in the use of
   conventional materials, the ways in which they may be manufactured or
   tiled, as well as the emergence of new materials may outline what new
   materiality is about.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a collaborative project by RDAI architects,
   Bollinger+Grohmann and the timber construction company Holzbau Amann.
   The project is located in a former swimming pool in Paris and it is part
   of the new interior of a flagship store of the French fashion label
   Hermes.
   In late 2009, Rena Duma Architects, asked Bollinger+Grohmann to
   collaborate as structural engineers on a challenging design proposal
   within a very short timeframe. Three wooden lattice structures, the
   so-called ``bulle{''} and one monumental staircase with a similar design
   approach characterize the interior of the new flagship store. The
   lattice structures are dividing the basement into different retail
   spaces. They vary in height (8-9 m) and diameter (8-12 m) and have a
   free-form shaped wicker basket appearance.
   Wood was the chosen material for these structures to strengthen the idea
   of the wickerbaskets and to create an interior space with a sustainable
   and innovative material.}},

Abstract = {{Global Skills for College Completion (GSCC) offers transformative use of
   social media - a Guided Digital Environment - a unique set of online
   tools and processes to capture, consolidate, and advance the effective
   faculty classroom work. The ambition of GSCC is to achieve a quantum
   increase in the historically low pass rates of basic skills students in
   American community colleges. The goal is to produce a rate increase so
   dramatic, consistently 80\%, that it is ``visible to the naked eye.{''}
   This increased success rate in basic skills would have the effect of
   accelerating remediation and increasing the probability of college
   completion. We believe community college basic skills faculty possess
   all the wisdom necessary to figure out how to improve these rates, given
   the right tools. In this chapter we describe the GSCC project, the
   Guided Digital Environment and the Tools and Routines provided to
   faculty to allow them to be research-practitioners in the project, and
   the research we drew on to build it. We include early information and
   observations on the essential design elements for identifying effective
   basic skills pedagogy. We also describe the innovative technological
   tools used to create an engaged community and leave a digital trail for
   analysis. GSCC is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
   through a grant to the League for Innovation as part of its goal to
   double the number of young adults in the United States with a
   postsecondary credential by 2020.}},

Abstract = {{Three schools within the Faculty of Health Science at the University of
   Tasmania, Australia took part in an interdisciplinary academic
   collaboration with the aim to develop, implement and evaluate the
   e-portfolio experience of undergraduate nursing, medicine and pharmacy
   students. The Centre for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching, the
   University's teaching and learning facilitator, was a key player in the
   andragogical integration of the e-portfolio into a demonstration unit
   within the Bachelor of Nursing program. PebblePad was the e-portfolio
   application that was used to support learning and teaching (L\&T)
   activities associated with the project.
   A cohort of over 500 students and 8 staff on four campuses in two states
   of Australia piloted use of the tool whilst undertaking work integrated
   learning during 2010. Both staff and students were new to the use of
   e-portfolios so simplicity was paramount. Multiple L\&T approaches were
   employed to ensure students and staff were well supported in their use
   of the new technology.
   The development of reflective practice is part of each discipline's
   expected student learning outcomes. Reflective practice linked to
   professional competencies has historically underpinned assessment and
   the PebblePad application offered a new way to encourage and assess this
   competency. Reflection is one of the strengths of the design of the
   PebblePad e-portfolio that is embedded into its design, making it a
   valuable tool for use with students. The tool also facilitated the
   integration of knowledge and skills, and provided opportunities for
   interaction peer-to-peer and between staff and students. The use of
   PebblePad was an innovation for achieving these L\&T outcomes.
   Additionally, the collaborators recognised there was a need for access
   to comprehensive resources and support for students and staff with an
   aim of developing a community of practice beyond the project leaders.
   E-portfolios have a further benefit as students may use them to showcase
   evidence of their capabilities to teachers, prospective employers and
   other interested parties. The use of an e-portfolio may enhance the
   development and evidence of life-long learning for the future and assist
   with meeting the newly introduced national requirements for annual
   professional registration for nursing, medical and pharmacy
   practitioners in Australia.
   The key findings of the evaluation provided valuable lessons for others
   planning to embed the use of digital technology into their curricula.
   Positive findings included students enjoying using the blog tool for
   reflection; feeling more connected to their peers; and enhancing their
   integration of knowledge and skills. The most significant weakness of
   the implementation methodology was timing. The time frame for
   introducing the new technology was considered too short; staff and
   students needed to feel comfortable using the technology before using it
   for assessment purposes; and sufficient training for staff and students
   was required. In addition to discussing the findings, this paper will
   reflect on the other advantages of collaborative cross-discipline effort
   in each of the Schools of Nursing, Medicine and Pharmacy at a regional
   university when integrating new technology into the learning and
   teaching setting.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows a project-based blended learning experience, developed
   in higher education in the Fine Arts Degree (University Miguel Hernandez
   -UMH-, Elche, Spain), during a term in 2010-211 academic year.
   This experience is focused on three issues not that common in the
   learning of Fine Arts: development of projects linked to places and real
   situations in public contexts, the use of collaborative methodologies,
   and the use of a blended learning environment for their development -
   combining presential actions and the use of CIT tools. In the virtual
   environment, several Google apps were used within an innovative teaching
   project linked to the GoUMH agreement between UMH and Google.
   The main targets of this experience are: i) Experimenting methodologies
   and Tools that allow students to develop active learning processes as
   well as the acquisition of digital competences and team work skills for
   the development of artistic projects in real contexts. ii) Considering
   the usefulness, difficulties and satisfaction levels of these learning
   environments and methodologies from the point of view of both students
   and lecturer. iii) Checking the viability of these learning environments
   and methodologies as practical mechanisms to facilitate the progressive
   adaptation of Fine Arts degrees to the needs of the new curricula.}},

Abstract = {{Today digital visual experiences are inherently embedded in our physical
   environment, invisibly integrated into our everyday tasks, and
   increasingly mobile and interactive within our culture. The Horizon
   Project charts the landscape of emerging technologies. For example in
   the 2006 and 2007 Reports{[}1], several key trends emerge that will
   impact teaching, learning and creative inquiry. Specifically, the
   academic significance of digital work is highlighted for its impact on
   processes of dynamic knowledge, mobile and personal technologies as a
   delivery platform, personalized content and services, and collaboration.
   These changes due to new digital media are spawning new modes of
   representation and styles of discourse as technology interfaces with
   pedagogical methodology. The University of Florida (UF) new online
   Master of Arts in Art Education prepares art teachers to thrive within
   21st century educational environments. Combining the flexibility of an
   immersive and virtual environment with rich, hands-on studio
   experiences, students in our program learn and collaborate with fellow
   teachers to apply their learning to their classrooms and community.
   As Latour notes, ``New innovation will be absolutely necessary if we are
   to adequately represent the conflicting natures of all the things that
   are to be designed.{''}{[}2] Innovation becomes essential in imagining
   and designing teaching and learning for the 21st century. In this
   session, I will present my instructional strategies and lessons learned
   with implementing an online program and provide examples with one course
   required for a Master in Art Education degree. An overarching (program)
   design objective was to innovatively balance interactivity and
   engagement in the online courses to promote a professional learning
   environment, and real life activities for our remote Art Education
   graduate students. These included one-to-one mentoring, scheduling group
   discussions via Elluminate r (synchronous online platform), and
   detailing assignment feedback to provide a more personal learning
   experience. Within this course, I developed the idea of {[}ART]
   iculations to build community and offer opportunities to engage students
   in art beyond discussion boards of the online environment. This
   discussion will illustrate that within an on-line environment a rich
   educational experience can be provided that develops higher order
   thinking skills, builds community, develops cooperative learning
   experiences, and harnesses the diversity of class research interests.}},

Abstract = {{More than a decade ago, the NET GENERATION began making its way to the
   higher education system. Having been born between January 1977-January
   1997, this generation has witnessed the rapid emergence and extensive
   influence of digital technologies and tools such as personal computers,
   networks, mobile devices and the Web-hence it is also referred to as:
   ``Digital natives{''} and ``Youtube Generation{''}. These names actually
   reflect some features that characterize this generation, such as:
   familiarity with technology, need for innovation, collaborative
   relationship and autonomy in learning. At the same time, this generation
   shares the characteristics found in those engaged in multitasking such
   as having a very short attention span-which has led to the coinage of
   the notorious name: ``the attention-deficit-disorder generation{''}.
   Davenport and Beck's (2000) research in the field of management showed
   that one of the most important factors in gaining and sustaining
   people's attention is engaging people's emotions since ``the scarcest
   resource in modern organizations is attention{''}. The Net geners' use
   of technology affects their literacy and habits of learning and poses
   great challenges to teachers.
   In this paper, I will present some theoretical information regarding the
   Net generation and suggest ways that can enhance the learning of English
   amongst undergraduate students.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for a well-educated workforce has driven many countries to
   rethink their education systems. An education system has to be suited to
   the demands of the technological age so that a competitive edge can be
   maintained. Such demand for a technology savvy workforce is reflected in
   Alvin Toffler's declaration (Rosenberg, 2001: 3), that ``the illiterate
   of the 21st century will not be those, who cannot read and write but
   those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.{''} An ancient proverb
   says: ``if we don't change our direction, we'll end up exactly where we
   are headed{''} (Rosenberg 2001: 41). This indicates that learning
   institutions will have to constantly change and adapt in their
   environments if they are not to lag behind.
   Embracing digital environment in education will enhance efficiency and
   also provide better learning results as well as make education adaptive
   to the individual learner. It is fun to learn with computers and skills
   such as collaboration, critical evaluation, receiving feedback, planning
   and organisation are easily and effectively learned. It is important to
   note that learning is dynamic in terms of pedagogy and content. New
   knowledge is being generated as well as methodologies for delivering it.
   Due to its potential in interaction between the information, the teacher
   and the student through various media, ICT has become very popular in
   the education sector. Kenya has realized the importance of embracing
   technology in learning and has made tremendous steps towards integrating
   it in education. The government of Kenya is keen to utilize ICT and
   other resources to enhance access to learning for all Kenyans as
   indicated in its strategic plan.
   One of the avenues the government of Kenya has used to adopt new
   technologies in education is through the Curriculum centre. The Kenya
   Institute of Education (KIE) is the National Centre for curriculum
   development and educational research established by law. The Institute
   has adopted the use of computer in curriculum delivery in particular,
   which promises better and improved methods of content delivery,
   methodology and pedagogy as well as expanding the available teaching and
   learning resource base. Whereas technology cannot replace a teacher in
   the instructional process, it forms an important and additional resource
   for both the teacher and the learner.
   In recognition of the importance of technology, the Institute has set up
   an e-learning section. This section is responsible for delivering
   e-content to all its clientele - who are the stakeholders in education
   and any other sector. Currently the institute has embarked on three
   approaches to developing and delivery of e-content. These approaches
   are;
   1. KIE platform through which the e-learning section has developed
   content in 11 form one subjects for secondary school level. The section
   is currently working on the scripting of Form 2 content in 12 subjects.
   2. Tafakari project which has developed e content for PTE teacher's
   trainees and teacher educators in science and mathematics on
   methodologies of teaching. The project delivers its content to its
   clientele through servers installed in the teacher training colleges.
   3. KIE elimika LCMS is another approach the institute has adopted in
   development of econtent. Through this approach the institute has of
   developed courses which include Primary teacher Orientation and KIE
   staff induction courses. The developed materials are delivered online
   and also packaged in DVDs for offline delivery. This system uses
   Synchronous meetings of online classes which are facilitated by the use
   of web conferencing/ virtual classroom tools, in this case chatrooms.
   The synchronous nature appeals to many people and complements other
   asynchronous activities. This system has seen the Institute make huge
   savings in travel costs by cutting down on face to face meets. For a
   geographically widespread class or working group, occasional online
   meetings have helped keep people on track and provide a valuable
   opportunity for synchronous discussions.
   To further enrich the adoption of technology in Education, KIE has
   established a Curriculum Innovation Centre (CIC). The Curriculum
   Innovation Centre focuses on curriculum innovation, use of modern
   technology and development of personal and professional skills. This
   establishment is part of the global network of school Technology
   Innovation Centres and provides access to curriculum developers,
   teachers and learners in the East African region. The Innovation Centre
   aims at promoting the innovative use of ICT to enhance modern teaching
   and learning in the classroom. This, in turn, will contribute to
   economic growth through development and transfer of technology, new
   products and world-class skills acquisition as envisaged in the Kenya
   Vision 2030.
   To further enhance technologies in Education, the Kenya government
   through KIE has continued to develop and transmit radio programs over
   the years through the National Broadcasting Station. This takes into
   cognizance of the varied Kenyan populace. Radio programs enhance the
   access to quality education even to the most marginalized and the
   pastoralists' communities. Besides the Radio broadcast programmes the
   Institute has produced TV programmes which cover the mainstream
   curriculum subjects, Schools and colleges annual educational events such
   as the Drama and music festivals, National Students science Congress,
   and other activities scheduled by the mainstream ministry.
   The institute recognizes the importance to be in tandem with the rest of
   the world, thus the need to continually adapt new developments in
   technology to further enhance education. In this respect therefore, one
   of the technological areas it has embraces is in adapting the Digital
   channel. The digital broadcasting is a great opportunity that will meet
   the unique Educational needs of the society for social, economic and
   social cultural development. It is further hoped that the Educational
   Digital TV Channel through which Educational content is broadcast to
   schools and other learners' country wide is expected to meet the
   expanded demand for education following the introduction free primary
   and secondary Education. The channel complements the classroom teacher
   and other teaching-learning approaches. Besides, the channel also aims
   at addressing the knowledge gaps to equip the citizens with necessary
   skills for achievement of Vision 2030 and sustainable development. The
   unlimited access coverage of the channel promotes the aspect of
   inclusiveness and broad based participation by reflecting activities
   that affect the people's well being.
   The provision of distance and open learning education through the TV
   channel ensures uniform knowledge access and better learning environment
   for learners throughout the country.}},

Abstract = {{On the shoulders of teachers today, as in the past, lays the heavy
   responsibility of training future generations to act as meaningful and
   significant grownups. The future world will probably not use the same
   technologies that today's teachers have grown up into, but instead the
   environment into which our students will grow into and in which they
   will live the major part of their lives is unknown and unimaginable to
   us.
   We cannot even predict to our students how the world will look in thirty
   years. In the time, when they will be required to demonstrate their
   abilities and to contribute themselves to society.
   When we look back thirty years we will be encountered with a world with
   very few personal desk computers, with very small memories, no mobile
   phones, no access to the public internet, the first sprouts of mobile
   telethons, and in some areas no public land lines.
   Our students were born into a completely different world, a world where
   advanced technology is perceived as an obvious statement. They are
   ``natives{''}in this new world, while we are ``new immigrants{''}from an
   old world, and are required to learn their new language.
   This transformation in which students are often ahead of us in knowledge
   and abilities about those technologies has brought us to the recognition
   that we have to gain detailed knowledge of this content in a way so that
   we will be able, combined with our students, and based on our knowledge,
   to refine those skills required for a smart use of those tools knowing
   though that we will always remain the ``newcomers{''}with a trace of a
   foreign language.
   In the case of our school, the faculty has devoted the last few years to
   studying and mastering the existing technological language. In 2010,
   over the course of many hours of studying, exercising and training, each
   member of the staff acquired a ``tool box{''}or personal computer. This
   new tool enabled them to make good use both for pedagogical and
   administrative purposes.
   The local municipality supported the school administration and staff as
   to the need for this development. It supplied personal commuters to the
   teachers, and installed projectors in each and every class, and together
   with the educational staff sees in the assimilation of computerization
   at school, a challenge to respond to. As mentioned before, we don't know
   how our children's future world will look. But since we hold the
   responsibility for it we predict that one possible direction is the
   position of a personal portable computer/ communication system (based on
   today's mobile telephone and portable computers but with modified or
   different technology) that will be an integral part of its essence.
   Therefore, we have decided to supply our students with personal
   computers for their use from fourth grade and above. This will enable
   the students, given the appropriate studying systems:
   Active learning Personal advancement Real time student achievement
   evaluation
   Computers will be used to study core subjects, such as through the use
   of ``Time to Know{''}systems in language, mathematics and English, as
   well as other curricula.
   Time to Know is a new computerized system enabling students,
   individually, in small groups or the whole class to study in a new
   environment monitoring their enhancement and achievement.
   Those activities were followed up with other activities we have
   conducted for the use of computerized communication systems in school
   and community, such as Windows Live that includes a communal schedule
   and a combined data base for all users.
   Our model is a source of interest to other communities that would like
   to implement it as well.
   We are still at the beginning of our journey and we are still exploring
   to find the best tools to prepare our children better for the future.
   Another area that we regard as a fundamental instrument to serving our
   children in the unknown future is the ``emotional literacy{''}or
   ``emotional intelligence{''}, the ability to understand and relate to
   other people.
   Gardner (Gardner, 1983) in his ``multiple intelligences{''}theory claims
   that in order to act in human society, there is a need, among other
   things, for two personal intelligences that comprise the social
   intelligence, the inter-personal intelligence and the intra-personal
   intelligence.
   ``Interpersonal intelligence is the ability to understand intentions,
   motivations and desires of other people and allows people to work
   effectively with others.
   We consider that the two intelligences Gardner identified, based on
   numerous studies, demonstrate that possessing those competences predicts
   success in becoming a significant grown up human being.
   Barnett et al (2000) believe that studying in cohorts (as we do) and the
   students ``Are better prepared to assume leadership roles. The strong
   interpersonal relationships that develop in cohorts through group
   collaboration, community, and affiliation can influence students,
   leadership development. the professional contacts and networking that
   often occur in cohorts provide an ongoing source of support.{''}(p. 278)
   In our school, we try to develop the multiple intelligences among our
   students with the belief that the development of those personal traits
   will enable the students to understand other people's social dynamics
   and to interact effectively, and in that way we will provide them a key
   for successful growth.
   In our considerations of the learning process, and improvement in
   academic achievement, which we set as a goal, emotional environment is
   most significant. Combining those intelligences with the process of
   learning leads to a positive contribution to the school environment, as
   proven in national tests. We begin the second decade of a new century,
   in a school that tries, with shared efforts of community, parents and
   teachers, to provide our children the most and to prepare them to face
   future challenges. We believe that given the right tools, technological
   and emotional, our children can present themselves in the best way to
   make themselves meaningful and significant human beings. In the future,
   they will be able implement those abilities as grownups.}},

Abstract = {{All students have the potential to be creative. Creativity is
   conceptualized more like athletic ability that can be taught.
   Educational environment should provide young pupils with learning
   opportunities supporting creative development. Industrial innovative
   products like walkman and mobile phones were designed when innovators
   exchange viewpoints with people from different circles. Students'
   creativity is also stimulated by encounters with views different from
   their own. We all can image that stories have a mysterious power which
   can lead us into the world created by words. Facing the fact that
   science textbook describes content of scientific and technological
   inventions in exposition mode mostly, so that elementary pupils are
   difficult to comprehend. Story mode can support reading comprehension as
   well as can generate motivation by making links between story episodes
   and personal experiences. Invention ideas and associated principles can
   be conveyed with digital story. Digital storytelling could serve as a
   fun and engaging activity for students to strengthen basic as well as
   visual literacy, to build knowledge and skills via mastering a paragraph
   and using inductive reasoning, and most important to incubate curiosity
   as well as creativity. A picture is worth a thousand words. Invention
   ideas and associated principles can be conveyed with just an image.
   Story with a series of drawings to represent abstract scientific
   concepts can enhance learning, especially for elementary pupils. An
   e-storybook, entitled Story Talk Show, consists of stories of a series
   of innovation tools has been designed, developed, and evaluated by this
   study. The content structure, treatment design, storyboards of episodes,
   evaluation and revision of this e-storybook form the major parts of this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{It is no longer sufficient to use the traditional media as channels of
   communication through which to reach out to the public. Mutual
   consequently - that means not enough drivers of messages, which are for
   services for public relations, traditionally viewed as inactive
   recipients. Acceptance and use of social networks in the new media
   environment, the teaching of subjects related to the public, the
   educators responsibility, but also poses a great opportunity to review
   the current theoretical frameworks and models in this area, as well as
   how they teach the discipline. Thanks to the practical reaction of the
   current return users of social networks and less able to control the
   public debate about corporate and social issues of public concern,
   public relations with the public must be much faster to adjust the
   strategy and policy imperatives of their activities imposed by new
   technologies and modes of communication. The role of educators to train
   future professionals requires a different and innovative approach to
   designing the curriculum of the subject public relations. The way in
   which educators are adapted theoretical models of public relations with
   the communication practices used today on social media channels, will
   affect how future students will develop its approach to ethical and
   professional practice of public relations. Develop public relations
   strategy aimed at social networks and other popular digital channels of

   of knowledge, communication and use of information. Each of these
   processes as related to the sender and the recipient of information,

Abstract = {{In 2010 the Carnegie Foundation issued the ``Call for Reform of Medical
   School and Residency{''}. The results of this 3 year landmark study were
   released just as the University of Minnesota ( UMN) Medical School
   prepared for a 2012 accreditation visit. The Liaison Committee on
   Medical Education (LCME) accreditation standards include: Content
   integration within and across periods of study, Opportunities for active
   learning and independent study, and Assessment of students' clinical
   reasoning and communication skills. The LCME standards posed both
   educational and fiscal challenges for the UMN adjusting to the reality
   of > \$ 44.6 M reduction in State funding. Best practices had to be
   identified and developed that advanced student-centered education and
   that triggered new financial opportunities.
   ACTION Course level: To promote the integration of basic sciences within
   clinical medical/ surgical disciplines, a new ten subject 2nd year
   course ( Human Diseases 2 - HD2) was created. Strategically organized
   into ten ``theme{''} weeks, each week was bracketed by integrated
   readiness/ formative assessments. Curriculum level: To promote student
   independent study, preparation for class and knowledge acquisition, 3
   half days of unscheduled Independent Learning Time (ILT) were inserted
   into each academic week. A collaborative relationship with the UMN
   Collaborative for Academic Technology Innovation ( the ``
   Collaborative{''}; formerly known as the Digital Media Center) was
   leveraged to incorporate educational technologies that matched faculty/
   staff skills; all course materials were delivered on a UMN supported
   MOODLE learning management system. Rheumatology subject level: To
   enhance active learning, clinical reasoning and application within these
   new scheduling restrictions, the Collaborative helped identify
   pedagogically appropriate learning activities, enabled by educational
   technologies and newly constructed Active Learning Classrooms. OUTCOMES
   New Rheumatology learning activities: Large class lectures and related
   materials were repurposed into image augmented self study electronic
   resources. Knowledge application exercises held in a large capacity
   Active Learning Classrooms ( ALC) replaced small group sessions. Faculty
   and patient care benefits: The 9 student x 10 table ALC arrangement
   allowed for 1 faculty member to facilitate discussions among 90 students
   and released other faculty to resume clinical teaching that also created
   320 new hour patient appointments. Optimum room utilization: 20 hours of
   classes were scheduled in the technology rich ALC during nonpeak hours (
   e. g. Friday afternoons). Student outcomes: The ALC setting provided an
   energizing forum for 90 students to work on clinical reasoning and
   intra/intergroup communication. The high level of student interactivity
   continued after the class. Students reported similarly designed
   assignments to be valuable; from a faculty perspective student
   performance exceeded expectations. Cost savings: The 1 faculty to 90
   student ratio saved > \$ 14,000 in faculty instructional costs for one
   subject area with the potential for more savings.
   CONCLUSIONS Motivated by the Carnegie Foundation challenge, the
   Rheumatology example within the HD2 course shows how a resource
   constrained division can integrate content, introduce active/
   independent learning and clinical reasoning exercises and deliver an
   effective and cost saving learning experience. Leveraging UMN resources
   such as the Collaborative, Active Learning Classrooms and Moodle added
   value that can be reproduced as best practices.}},

Abstract = {{This experience took place in a pre-school classroom of 5-year-olds
   creating an integration activity classroom project dubbed ``
   Prehistory{''} which was developed during the first trimester. This is
   applicable to classes in elementary education due to the global aspect
   during this phase due to the closeness of student ages and interests.
   This answers that which was stated in Directives as reflected in,
   Article 6, Decree 22/2007, 10th of May, whereby the curriculum for
   elementary education was established for the province of Madrid: ``
   Reading comprehension, oral and written expression, audiovisual
   communication, as well as information technology and communication shall
   be covered in all areas{''}. We incorporated the program Crazy Talk 6
   Pro r as a learning resource with the objective of bringing the new
   technologies to the classroom for a hands-on activity complementing
   other activities previously done (searching for information, playing
   educational games, viewing audiovisual material). The idea of
   incorporating this animation program arose as an answer to the ``
   conflict{''} generated in the group while they visualized an educational
   cartoon series ({''}Erase una vez el hombre r ``) since they could not
   understand how the characters could be talking, asking: `` Where the
   people wearing a disguise?{''}. So incorporating animation software as a
   classroom tool allowed everyone exposure to audiovisual language
   transforming ourselves into scriptwriters and main characters in an
   animated movie with play dough and reflecting the learning achieved on
   `` Prehistory{''}. For this, we first began by watching an animated film
   on You Tube of the story: Cronion, of Michel Gay (Ed. Corimbo, 2001),
   with the objective of understanding how, by way of still images, the
   effect of movement can be achieved (zoom effects). Following this, we
   organized the work in the following way: analyzing the storyline;
   designation of roles ensuring everyone's participation. Later the script
   was modified and the character roles were assigned in random manner. For
   classroom activities we included: the making of the play dough
   figurines, putting up the scene, the digital recording of the voices
   (dubbing) and background sound, scene selection and editing, role
   playing, the incorporation of the `` the movie's{''} games corner and
   the making of invitations for the student's families. The making of the
   animated movie started in October and was finished on the 22nd of
   December with an invitation to the families to watch the premier.
   Among the benefits of using the program Crazy Talk, the following stand
   out: it is an incentive by itself; favors critical thinking; analyses
   reality; cultivates creativity; reinforces the use of different
   languages; promotes a good work ethic; helps them identify their
   emotions, express and share them; encourages group work and favors
   integrated and meaningful learning concepts. The evaluation of the
   process/product was quite satisfactory in all aspects. This project has
   allowed the teachers involved to evaluate the teaching possibilities
   with this computer resource and its possible application for university
   level teaching, learning and research. In fact this experience has meant
   personal collaboration with the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)
   which falls within their project concerning education innovation PIMCD
   1/2010-11 `` BUCM \& ELearning 2.0{''} (BUCM: Biblioteca de la
   UCM-University's library-).}},

Abstract = {{The new European Higher Education Area or EHEA was presented full of
   promises but in practice it was implemented not only without extra
   funding but also in a period of serious budget cuts. In order to create
   a new area, working with what we already have, it is necessary to
   reevaluate areas, resources and their functions. The moment has come to
   reunite our efforts by working together in multiprofessional teams in
   order to ``multiply{''} and not just ``add{''}. The moment has arrived
   to be versatile, to search for a common language, to create networks and
   disseminate our capabilities. If we maintain the belief that the library
   is a temple of erudition and the teacher the only one capable of
   generating knowledge, this converts the student into a passive subject
   and the virtual campus into a repository of notes. In this aspect, the
   library of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (BUCM) is evolving
   towards a new concept: Center for resources for learning and research or
   CRAI (Centro de Recursos para el Aprendizaje e Investigacion) which is a
   center for socialization which foments the educational use of new
   technologies (ITCs) as well as virtual learning environments and the Web
   2.0 tools, to develop E-learning or B-learning, systems wherein
   together, everyone in a cooperative spirit are enabled to learn and to
   share in the Internet. It is unquestionable that the connection of
   information and technology is becoming closer and it is necessary to
   form interdisciplinary teams and arm our students with the capability to
   get information and computer proficiency (IC2 -informational competences
   and computer-). Our project tries to answer the final conclusion of the
   Toledo Declaration (2006): ``Those professionals interested in the
   promotion of capability for informational competences should establish a
   network amongst themselves for the coordination y development of joint
   activities{''}. Our general objective is to shift activities in the
   classroom, and in that, correct the absence of student participation. To
   strengthen learning activities that require participation and stimulate
   occupational socialization of our students by the maximum educational
   use of web 2.0 free access tools. Try not to encourage the accumulation
   of notes, providing incentives to create their own topics by working in
   groups (in the Internet), using study guides (electronic portfolio):
   personalized virtual bookshelves with digital resources of multiple
   formats. Our aspiration is that the students would be aware of the
   library as a resource center for learning and research. An open center y
   agreeable where one could work alone or in groups. We present the
   results of the Education Innovation Project PIMCD 1/ 2010-11, associated
   with PCI AECID B/ 030048/ 10.}},

Abstract = {{A new era, new tools
   Within the framework of town-panning, the brand-new standardisation and
   normalisation of geographical information is making the development of a
   series of interactive, flexible tools possible, guaranteeing a real
   interoperability amongst different systems and agents through the
   Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI), data specifications, data sets and
   the advance towards the aforesaid information's use in a collective
   network. This new field of opportunities to process information must
   necessarily lead to innovation within the teaching of town-planning, so
   that there is place for the learning of the new modes.
   The development, among others, of systematisation projects of
   cartographical production (topography, plans, digital models, land
   registers...), town and land-use-planning, as well as the coordinated
   management of natural areas, make their most of the creation of more
   complex and multifunctional spatial databases (environmental, sectorial
   and those related to town and/or land-use planning). Nonetheless, its
   use and optimisation in nowadays' technical teaching at universities is
   fairly unusual.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of contextual systems, which fuel individual's
   development, is emphasized in Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory
   (1979, 1987, 1995), recalling their dynamism, integration and
   interdependence.
   Furthermore, Figueiredo and Afonso (2006), bearing in mind the
   educational use of ICT, underscore the individual/student's interaction
   both with contents and contexts, considering the latter of paramount
   importance in education. Actually, evidence shows that ICTs, if regarded
   not as a complement but essentially as a means to change learning toward
   knowledge construction, provide favourable learning environments
   contributing to children and youth's cognitive and sociale-motional
   development.
   This change takes place, or, better saying, may take pace, in each of
   the structures defined by Bronfenbrenner - microsystem, mesosystem,
   microsystem, exosystem macrosystem and chronosystem. The microsystem
   encompassing the individual's most direct and immediate contacts. I mean
   the school and family, focusing on activities, technology, peers,
   teachers and parents. Recently, Johnson proposed the ecological
   techno-microsystem that ``situates the developing child in the context
   of ICT use in home, school, and community environments{''} (2010, p.
   32); the mesosystems referring to interrelations between two or more
   microsystems with which the individual interacts; and the exosystem
   involving contexts in which the individual doesn't take an active role
   but which do influence the microsystems surrounding him. Considering the
   educational use of ICT, both initial training, continuing and
   post-graduate teachers are included in the exosystem. References either
   to the macrosystem or the chronosystem are not made in this text.
   In this context, the paper presents a groundbreaking look on ICT in
   education, centered on ecological techno-microsystem, a dimension of the
   microsystem that stresses the importance of digital technology in
   students learning. In particular, I refer to a small exploratory study
   carried out in different schools in Portugal that aims at understanding,
   analysing and developing the educational use of ICT.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 1960' Derek De Solla Price coined the concept of
   scientometrics: the measurement of scientific and technological
   activity. Its development was based on the construction of scientific
   bibliographic archives and the elaboration of indicators, an area where
   Eugene Garfield -the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information
   (ISI), nowadays known as the ISI Web of Knowledge- played a fundamental
   role. Since the development of the Internet, we have witnessed an
   exponential growth in the availability of digital libraries. Currently,
   bibliographic electronic databases are no longer restricted to the exact
   sciences as they also encompass the social sciences, the humanities and
   the arts. The aim of this study is to highlight the advantages as well
   as the challenges that these new technologies and methodologies
   represent for researchers working in literary studies. Based on the
   experience with my research project ``Babel Borges{''}, I explore two
   main issues: the availability and architecture of digital libraries, and
   the elaboration and analysis of bibliometric indicators. Since my
   project is centered on the Argentinean author Jorge Luis Borges, I focus
   on the field of Latin American literature. Thus, I compare the main
   international database -ISI Web of Knowledge- to North American and
   European digital bibliographies -MLA (Modern Language Association
   International Bibliography), Americanismo, Cibera, DOAJ (Directory of
   Open Access Journals), e-Revistas, Isidore, ISOC (Base de datos ISOC),
   Red-Redial-, to regional ones -CLACSO (Consejo Latinoamericano de
   Ciencias Sociales), Latindex (Sistema Regional de Informacion en linea
   para Revistas Cientificas de America Latina, el Caribe, Espana y
   Portugal), and SciElo (Scientific Electronic Library Online).
   Specifically, I discuss the coverage and the accessibility provided by
   these databases. In relation to the indicators, I emphasize the
   challenge that represent the procedures of transferring and interpreting
   data in a field where most researchers and students are not usually
   trained to deal with quantitative methods and analysis. In terms of
   innovation, this article brings to light the importance that digital
   resources and scientometrics represent for future developments in
   literary studies. Moreover, since this study is focused on Latin
   America, it allows us to take part in the discussion about the complex
   relations that exist between economic growth, knowledge development and
   globalization.}},

Abstract = {{In the current scenario, where communication and information sharing are
   a prominent part of our life, both in the public and private dimensions,
   media certainly have a central role as instruments for communicating.
   Since twentieth-century they have been not only the emblems of the
   enormous progress in new technologies but also of cultural and social
   transformations. Mass media and the subsequently emerging of advanced
   technologies involved an evident change both in modalities of contents
   production and in their transmission. That led to the creation of new
   media, enabling an instant, decentralized, personalized and
   collaborative communication.
   However, the metamorphosis of media is also characterized by hybrid
   forms where elements of continuity with traditional forms coexist with
   elements of strong innovation. It is necessary to combine the process of
   transformation of devices with the one of languages.
   New devices and new languages bring the experimentation from the more
   technological areas to the artistic field, involving different
   disciplines including Communication Design.
   Among the interest of research's areas there is the analysis of how
   communicative devices mediate the relationship between us and the
   territory. Territory is considered as the expression of multiple levels
   of information that cohabit and stratify. It is often difficult to
   communicate those aspects due to the superficial attention of
   territorial peculiarity preservation. This leads to a loss of the
   qualities that mark the identity of a territory.
   Therefore comes the need to communicate the territory and the dwelling
   places, showing their different characteristics and dynamics, by
   systematizing techniques, languages and all available devices in order
   to develop innovative communication models.
   This brings a research of new approaches and project practices that come
   up to the creation of communicative systems for territorial interface,
   fit to the new characteristic of fruition and to the needs of the user.
   The adoption of digital technology and new media in which contents,
   devices and languages are interbred, is changing the models of
   territorial communication.
   Thus the fusion of different languages inside digital media and the
   necessity to use the same contents on different communicative devices,
   introduced a new project practice, based on the possibility of
   administrating integrated systems of dialog (mobile, web, traditional
   publishing) that allow a more immediate and direct integration of
   different information and languages.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, a computer simulation environment to help teach
   and learn digital holography concepts and procedures is presented. The
   interactive simulation software, called ``Holographic Interface{''}
   (HI), represents an innovative computer assisted learning resource for
   the different contexts of classroom instruction or at distance
   education. The software developed reproduces a virtual optical lab, in
   which the numerical recording and reconstruction of a binary hologram is
   performed. Several functions, with a number of available user options,
   have been implemented: it is possible to create, to add or subtract, to
   multiplex, or to manipulate holograms. The design of this educational
   simulation allows simultaneous visualization of the digital object, the
   subsequent hologram and the reconstructed image at the image plane, with
   different magnifications.
   The software provides insight on how a hologram works in essence, on the
   use of binary holograms and on other optics topics, such as Fourier
   optics.
   We have applied this holography modeling environment to postgraduate
   classes and we have retrieved a positive assessment in terms of
   students' understanding and of the competences involved.}},

Abstract = {{Globalization, new technologies and demographic developments constitute
   an enormous challenge; one of the answers to this problem is the access
   to lifelong learning. Major responsibility of schools entering this new
   era of globalization is to prepare students for the new challenges that
   are rapidly changing our society.
   One of the greatest challenges currently facing our youth is finding
   meaningful employment. The ability to speak a foreign language and
   computer literacy are currently two of the most common criteria required
   from people wishing to enter the workforce in Egypt (and globally).
   Technology enhanced learning (TEL) has the goal to provide
   socio-technical innovations (also improving efficiency and cost
   effectiveness) for e-learning practices, regarding individuals and
   organizations, independent of time, place and pace.
   The eLearning initiative of Egypt seeks to mobilize the educational and
   cultural communities, as well as the economic and social players in
   Middle East, in order to speed up changes in the education and training
   systems for Middle East's move to a knowledge-based society. Egypt has
   adopted the ``eLearning{''} initiative to adapt the Middle East's
   education and training systems to the knowledge economy and digital
   culture. The objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic
   knowledge-driven economy in the Arab world. ELearning is designed to
   enable Arab to catch up by intensifying its efforts. It implements and
   extends into education and training the eEgypt action plan, including in
   particular the guidelines for employment.
   Information and communication technologies (ICT), properly used,
   contribute to the quality of education and training and to Egypt's move
   to a knowledge-based society.
   Egyptian ELearning University (EELU) is a private non-profit University
   established on 2008 to provide distance education through 24-hour online
   learning with a vision to be a leading university providing e-learning
   nationally, regionally, and internationally. EELU gives educational
   opportunity to learners who cannot attend a campus university. EELU
   plans to cover all the governorates in Egypt, Arab world and other
   countries.
   E-learning is essentially the computer and network-enabled transfer of
   skills and knowledge. It is the use of technology to enable students to
   learn effectively at their pace anytime, anywhere using the power of
   animation, videos and many more. It comprises all forms of
   electronically supported learning and teaching. The information and
   communication systems, whether networked or not, serve as specific media
   to implement the learning process. It is naturally suited to distance
   learning and flexible learning, but can also be used in conjunction with
   face-to-face teaching, in which case the term Blended learning is
   commonly used. Blended Learning refers to a mixing of different learning
   environments. Blended learning gives learners and teachers a potential
   environment to learn and teach more effectively.}},

Abstract = {{This presentation describes innovative ways to create engaging and
   interactive online instructional units. The combination of a web-based
   authoring environment, an open source LMS, and free web-based
   applications provide an effective suite of tools for instructors.
   Every unit of instruction should be constructed to meet the unit's
   learning objectives. A web-based tool, ``Radio James Objective
   Builder{''}, facilitates the construction of measurable learning
   objectives. The verbs typically associated with the various levels of
   Bloom's Taxonomy are available and categorized, providing an efficient
   way to design objectives.
   SoftChalk, an easy-to-use web authoring environment, is used to create
   web-based lessons that can be deployed in any learning management system
   or website. Preparing for change is the best practice, and even as
   learning management environments change or become obsolete, these
   instructional units remain intact, ready for deployment on the web in
   other venues. SoftChalk basically creates a ``mini website{''} for each
   lesson - the underlying technology is HTML and style sheets. The
   SoftChalk application provides a pedagogically sound means of creating
   instructional units. Videos can be embedded on the lesson screen itself,
   avoiding the problem of linking to a website which may distract the
   learner. Guiding questions can be placed above the video on the lesson
   screen, so that students are looking at those while they view the video.
   Self-check activities can be placed below the video to provide
   interaction and an opportunity to review the content of the video.
   Online learners benefit from a consistent structure for each unit.
   SoftChalk provides this structure each unit can have a customized banner
   and sidebar, with previous and next navigation provided by the software.
   For the developer, the application functions like most word processors,
   with a clean and non-threatening interface that doesn't require hours of
   training to use.
   Softchalk allows faculty to function as the subject-matter experts
   without the need to master technically difficult software. It's
   important to let faculty focus on their area of expertise instead of
   spending their time and energy on technical concerns.
   Finally, the integration of free, web-based applications provides an
   excellent way to create instruction that addresses a variety of learning
   styles. Free concept-mapping (mind-mapping) applications such as
   MindMeister or MindOMo are easy to use and pedagogically sound. Students
   use these to graphically depict concepts and relationships between
   ideas. Visual learners appreciate graphical depictions of complex
   relationships.
   Online courses frequently require students to introduce themselves via a
   threaded discussion area. Free web-based applications provide unique and
   creative ways to enhance this activity. For instance, students can
   ``poster themselves{''} via Glogster, a web-based application that
   provides an easy-to-use way to create a multi-media collage. Digital
   story-telling software provides a mechanism to integrate pictures and
   narration into a story-based introduction. Students can use Voki to
   create an avatar that speaks the words of introduction that the student
   types.
   Online course design is definitely evolving, and applications like
   SoftChalk, Moodle, and Web 2.0 tools provide pedagogically sound and
   efficient ways to create engaging and interactive units of online
   instruction.}},

Abstract = {{For long time, the instructional paradigm has applied in Vietnamese
   Higher Education in which lecturers say, students listen and
   submissively carry out lecturers' directions. However, in the age of
   technology, our students change radically. They can be called as the
   term ``Digital Natives{''} that Marc Prensky {[}1] coined and ``our
   students today are all native speakers of the digital language of
   computer, video game and the internet{''}.
   Students in the world as well as in Vietnam now bring with them a
   technological competence not seen in previous generations. They expect
   learning activities are more open, flexible. They are also interested in
   connecting with the whole large world with a computer from the conner of
   their room through social networking like YouTube, Facebook, and Flickr.
   The language of instruction now makes the traditional inquiry obsolete.
   However, lecturers, especially the older, were trained in another way
   without the implication of today's technology. They teach as they were
   taught and even resist changing their pedagogy or only grudgingly
   increase their technological competence. In addition, Vietnam, as many
   other Asian countries where education systems are permitted in Confusion
   culture zone, where lecturers are considered role models and they are
   comfortable with their situation. As the result, lecturers, the
   ``Digital Immigrants{''}, are struggling to teach a generation with
   entirely new language. Unfortunately, the newest generation of students
   will not go backwards and lecturers cannot just grouse about how good
   things used to be but rather than reconsider methodology. Lecturers need
   to be persuaded to change so that they, the ``digital immigrants{''} can
   catch up with ``digital natives{''}. But how can we make these changes
   happen?
   Discussion in this paper bases partly on the survey with 240 academic
   staff from six universities and colleges in the North, the Middle and
   the South of Vietnam. The survey explores how academic staff thinks
   about information technology-based teaching activities.
   There is a Chinese proverb saying that ``When the winds of change blow,
   some built walls while others build windmills{''}. When the winds of
   information technology blow, it seems that academic staff should build
   windmills rather than walls.}},

   both at the individual and societal levels. Thus, solutions to these
   problems can flourish from both individual and social actions (Jensen \&
   Schnack, 1997).
   The action competence concept was coined as an inclusive term referring
   to potential solutions of such problems. Even though the concept
   comprised a wide research repertoire from a variety of fields like
   environment, sustainable development and health education (Cairns, 2001;
   Eamas et al, 2006; Mogensen \& Schnack, 2010; Samuel \& Sundar, 2007;
   Seezink, Poell \& Kirschner, 2009); related literature has yet to offer
   an inclusive definition. According to the literature reviewed, action
   competence can be defined as ``an individual's capacity of critically
   selecting and conducting possible actions that may solve societal
   problems through democratic mechanisms{''} (Breiting \& Mogensen, 1999;
   Jensen \& Schnack, 1994; Mogensen, 1997)
   In line with the emerging and changing technologies and demands, action
   competence is perceived to play a vital role in integrating ICTs into
   our social lives. To adopt these technological innovations and
   developments, there is a tremendous need for action competent ICT
   experts. This fact brings ICT action competence to the current agenda.
   In this regard, ICT action competence is defined as ``the individual's
   motivation and capacity to select and conduct democratic and responsible
   actions so that ICT-related or non-related societal problems can be
   solved in a critical and effective way{''}.
   Expectations of ICT experts and modern pedestrians have been raised in
   line with rapid developments. Sufficient and innovative use of ICTs can
   bring about solutions for many problems the society is confronted with.
   In this regard, teacher training institutions should be obliged to
   undertake responsibilities regarding the education of future teachers
   who are supposed to equip next generations with the basics of digital
   citizenship. Among other fields of education, Computer Education and
   Instructional Technology (CEIT) Departments are expected to have
   critical roles to train ICT action competent teachers in Turkey. In this
   respect, this study aimed to draw a pedestrian model of ICT action
   competence, and to discuss action competent individuals' commitments to
   the society. Suggestions for teacher training institutions and
   implications for further research will be provided as well.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, innovative ADC modeling algorithm is described. It is
   well suitable for Nyquist-rate ADC error back annotation. This algorithm
   is the next step of building a supportive tool for IC design engineers.
   The inspiration for us is the work {[}1]. Here, the ADC behavior is
   divided into HCF (High Code Frequency) and LCF (Low Code Frequency)
   separated part. Close connection of this model type to circuit
   representation of ADC is the reason why we choose them. The main
   difference between {[}1] and our approach is in the purpose. Our
   algorithm is oriented especially on converters with low order of HCF or
   converters with low ratio between HCF and ``random{''} part of INL. The
   algorithm proves the highest efficiency in the previously mentioned
   case; however, it is also applicable to general error modeling related
   to ADC transfer characteristic. Moreover, we have designed efficient HCF
   order recognition part. Modeling results are demonstrated on a real data
   set measured by ASICentrum on charge-redistribution type SAR ADC chip.
   Prime focus of the paper is to introduce the main algorithm body with
   the stress on the key model extraction stages. Least but not last the
   experimental results are discussed. Also the algorithm limits are
   mentioned.}},

   of ``nearest access{''} services, which can automatically identify the
   nearest library and rapidly locate the resources in the target library.
   The knowledge bases consist of information about the nearby libraries
   and a rapid location rule for resources in these libraries. Second, the
   paper designs ``nearest access{''} algorithms that allow users to
   identify and select the nearest interlibrary loan resources from the
   knowledge bases of ``nearest access{''} services.
   Findings - Through these steps, the paper establishes an architecture
   for accessing resources in the nearest library that are based on a
   combination of knowledge bases and ``nearest access{''} algorithms,
   providing users with a convenient and rapid method to access
   interlibrary loan resources.
   Originality/value - The innovation of this research lies in the ability
   of the proposed architecture in providing accurate, agile and

Abstract = {{Objective: Use of technology to structure and support the daily
   activities of the residents in a small scale group accommodation ( SSGA)
   for dementia is a new innovation in the Netherlands. This paper
   presents: a) the process of development of this new way of structuring
   activities by describing the making of digital planning boards, b) the
   findings of a pilot study looking at the experiences of using this
   device in people with dementia living in a small-scale group
   accommodation as well as experiences of informal carers and members of
   staff and c) the process of organizing day structure using this device
   from the user's perspectives.
   Main content of paper: To develop the memory aid a user centred
   development process was used. After the first development cycle was
   completed the resulting digital planning boards were placed in the
   living room of a small scale living group for people with dementia and
   in private rooms of the residents. The main task of the aid is to
   support the memory of the residents by structuring the daily activities
   during the day. This paper provides the experiences of the users
   including the residents, informal carers and members of staff, issues
   around implementation and further development.
   Method \& findings: A qualitative method was chosen, data was collected
   using semi structured individual interviews with the residents (n=6) and
   focus groups interviews with informal carers (n=5) and members of staff
   (n=6). The framework analysis by Ritchie \& Spencer (1994) was used to
   analyse the data. This resulted in the description of the findings based
   on the following three general themes; the state of affairs regarding
   the implementation, the needs for further development and the learning
   experiences acquired during the development. The occurrence of
   installation errors, inefficient use, limited ease of use and a lack of
   knowledge regarding the function and use of the memory aid are
   highlighted as the most important issues that prevented a successful
   implementation. However, the majority of the residents were happy with
   the use and function of the memory aid when it worked. The informal
   carers were not very positive but indicated opportunities for
   improvement. This was echoed by the staff, although they saw an added
   value for the current use of the device. The findings highlighted shared
   views about ways of improving through adaptation of the software
   programme and additional technological applications such as Internet
   connectivity, improving its accessibility by using a remote control,
   adding videos and photos.
   Conclusions: A number of lessons are learned about the use and

Abstract = {{Objective. This paper presents the work of the eAccess+ network. The
   network intends to involve stakeholders along their product value chain
   to implement eAccessibility, and particularly those who did not show
   interest in taking up eAccessibility thus far. The paper outlines the
   approach taken to foster the implementation of eAccessibility. As
   eAccessibility by nature is a broad field, the network focuses on
   selected aspects of a) web accessibility, b) accessible convergent
   communications and accessible digital audio-visual systems and c)
   self-service terminals (SSTs) and devices for banking and financial
   services, public transport, tourism, cultural heritage and e-government.
   Main Content. Over the last years a considerable body of know-how,
   guidelines, techniques and tools became available to support
   eAccessibility. Awareness has increased and legal regulations have been
   implemented. But still the implementation of eAccessibility is scarce.
   eAccess+ intends to contribute to overcome this situation by contacting
   and networking with stakeholders responsible for the implementation of
   eAccessibility. The approach of eAccess+ is centered on the so called
   eAccessibility Hub: Many resources and a lot of expertise are already
   available but they do not enter practice and application. Users do not
   find them or do need guidance how to implement eAccessibility in
   practice. Therefore the Hub is not planned as ``just another resource
   base{''}. It provides a comprehensive overview and description of
   existing resources, establishes links to them and provides guidance for
   application. In addition, eAccess+ uses web based forms to contact
   stakeholders, in particular those who are not aware or reluctant in
   implementing eAccessibility, to get to know what is missing and what
   they expect or at least the reasons why they do not get involved so far.
   Results. Guidance to the existing body of knowledge and how to implement
   it will be provided using the eAccessibility Hub. Stakeholders, in
   particular those not aware or interested in eAccessibility so far, will
   be contacted. The information gathered should allow a more targeted work
   on raising the level of implementation of eAccessibility.
   Conclusions. The network started at the end of 2010 and implemented its
   infrastructure. First results show that the eAccess+ approach taken
   provides innovative methods to advance the uptake of eAccessibility in
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Objective As we move more inextricably into a digital economy there is a
   looming crisis for a growing number of increasingly marginalized
   individuals. The accessibility technologies we have are meeting the
   needs of only some, at high cost-and will not work with many new
   technologies. In addition, the pace and path of technological change
   predestines these approaches to fail in the very near future. At the
   same time the incidence of disabilities is increasing as our population
   ages.
   Main Content The same technical advances however hold the key for a
   radical paradigm shift in our approach to accessibility that can harness
   the pace of innovation and have it work for us rather than against us.
   Cloud-based AutoPersonalization taps the unprecedented ability to pool
   resources and match demand with supply enabled by the Cloud and the ease
   of setup and use that can result form the use of personal preference
   profiles to allow delivery of accessibility to every individual where
   they need it, when they need it and in a way that matches their unique
   requirements; automatically so that they do not need to negotiate,
   explain, qualify or justify.
   Results This paper describes an international collaborative effort to
   build such a system. Called the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure,
   it seeks to create an infrastructure based on cloud, web and platform
   technologies that can increase dissemination and international
   localization while lowering the cost to develop, deploy, market, and
   support a broad range of access solutions. This approach brings together
   international research and deployments of network based, built-in and
   installed access solutions that are activated and configured using
   personal needs and preference profiles. Most of the work to date has
   been in the educational or public access point domains-and has focused
   on the personal preference and materials matching aspects. The proposed
   effort would combine these with mechanisms to make it easier for users
   go discover what would help them, and tools and mechanisms to make it
   easier and less expensive for developers to create and market new
   solution.
   Conclusion Although based on research that has occurred over more than a
   decade, the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure concept and the
   comprehensive effort is new and just getting started as a coordinated
   system. Efforts are centered in the US, Canada and Europe (with its
   recently funded CLOUD4All project) but include participants on every
   continent except Antarctica-with central coordination from Raising the
   Floor-International, headquartered in Geneva Switzerland. The initial
   architecture and collaborative efforts are described as well as key
   hurdles to be overcome in order to create and deploy such a system.}},

Abstract = {{The mobile-enterprise concept has emerged as an innovation with the
   increasing use of personal digital assistant (PDA) on wireless data
   networks. To realize the concept, simply use the PDA to search for
   information is not enough, where an intelligent paradigm is required to
   deal with the request for information as well as the command execution
   in a distributed information system. This paper proposes a
   mobile-enterprise multi-agent paradigm (MMAP) which is an agent-based
   intelligent solution provider developed for small to medium enterprises
   (SMEs) in order to increase their flexibility and competitiveness in the
   market. The system is driven by intelligent software agents. Their
   design and prototype implementation are demonstrated in this paper. (C)

Abstract = {{A high-performance printing concrete has been developed for an
   innovative freeform-construction process that utilises digital
   fabrication methods for building large components. The concrete has a
   maximum particle size of 2 mm and contains up to 1.2 kg/m(3) of
   polypropylene fibre. The fresh concrete was successfully printed through
   a 9 mm diameter nozzle to build freeform concrete components by layers.
   The fresh state of concrete had an open time of 1.5 hours to let it be
   printed smoothly. The average compressive strength of the cast and
   in-situ printed specimens were in the range of 100 similar to 110 MPa
   and 80 similar to 88 MPa, respectively whilst the flexural strengths
   were not significantly different and in the range of 12 similar to 13
   MPa. The concrete has been used to build a freeform component, which is
   approximately 0.8 m high and 2 m long and the width curved in 1 m. This
   paper discusses the mix design, fresh and hardened state properties of
   the concrete, the freeform construction system and the performance of
   components made by this novel approach.}},

Abstract = {{At present, llamas and alpacas play an important role in the food
   security of populations living in high Andean areas and they also
   provide fibre, leather and meat. This alternative livestock is extremely
   important not only in arid regions of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador
   and Peru, but also in other countries that have discovered their
   economic potential, such as Australia, New Zealand, North America and
   Canada. In South America, production management is not efficient and
   does not generate income; they are subsistence economies. In the new
   globalised world it is relevant to achieve highly efficient livestock
   production to help territorial development without loss of identity. To
   such an end, we must take into account the vast experience and the great
   deal of information available for the last 20 years as well as the poor
   access to such information by the Andean communities. To begin to
   address these limitations, the International Agricultural Development
   Fund, the Biodiversity Foundation and other institutions have organised,
   since 2003, three editions of the `World Congress on Camelids', with the
   next one to be held in Chile (12 November). Its aim is to achieve
   coexistence and communication between the different sectors so that
   there is consistency between economic, social, human and cultural
   issues.
   The next stage will be to build a 2.0 website where all actors can
   actively interact through chat, blogs, social networks and forums, among
   other things. It will also provide a library including digitised
   material (Wiki), and allow for on-line training and the fostering of
   successful rural innovations. The project goal is to build, systematise
   and manage the day-to-day experience and technical knowledge in order to
   distribute such collective information (scaling up) trying to develop an
   alternative livestock production so as to achieve a productive and
   sustainable world in which camelid breeders are included.}},

   System, which was introduced into service in February 2007, with an
   innovative change of the control techniques for wayside signaling

   intended to improve the quality of construction of signaling devices by
   reducing the wiring work that is required for a large number of metallic
   cables and simplifying the operation tests. In this system, reliability
   is improved by using the duplex transmission lines, including the

Abstract = {{In recent years, the evolution of infrastructures and technologies
   carried out by emerging paradigms, such as Cloud Computing, Future
   Internet and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), is leading the area of
   enterprise systems to a progressive, significant transformation process.
   This evolution is characterized by two aspects: a progressive
   commoditization of the traditional ES functions, with the `usual'
   management and planning of resources, while the challenge is shifted
   toward the support to enterprise innovation. This process will be
   accelerated by the advent of FInES (Future Internet Enterprise System)
   research initiatives, where different scientific disciplines converge,
   together with empirical practices, engineering techniques and
   technological solutions. All together they aim at revisiting the
   development methods and architectures of the Future Enterprise Systems,
   according to the different articulations that Future Internet Systems
   (FIS) are assuming, to achieve the Future Internet Enterprise Systems
   (FInES). In particular, this paper foresees a progressive implementation
   of a rich, complex, articulated digital world that reflects the real
   business world, where computational elements, referred to as FInER
   (Future Internet Enterprise Resources), will directly act and evolve
   according to what exists in the real world.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years the technological evolution of terrestrial, aerial and
   satellite surveying, has considerably increased the measurement accuracy
   and, consequently, the quality of the derived information. At the same
   time, the smaller and smaller limitations on data storage devices, in
   terms of capacity and cost, has allowed the storage and the elaboration
   of a bigger number of instrumental observations.
   A significant example is the terrain height surveyed by LIDAR (LIght
   Detection And Ranging) technology where several height measurements for
   each square meter of land can be obtained. The availability of such a
   large quantity of observations is an essential requisite for an in-depth
   knowledge of the phenomena under study. But, at the same time, the most
   common Geographical Information Systems (GISs) show latency in
   visualizing and analyzing these kind of data.
   This problem becomes more evident in case of Internet GIS. These systems
   are based on the very frequent flow of geographical information over the
   internet and, for this reason, the band-width of the network and the
   size of the data to be transmitted are two fundamental factors to be
   considered in order to guarantee the actual usability of these
   technologies. In this paper we focus our attention on digital terrain
   models (DTM's) and we briefly analyse the problems about the definition
   of the minimal necessary information to store and transmit DTM's over
   network, with a fixed tolerance, starting from a huge number of
   observations. Then we propose an innovative compression approach for
   sparse observations by means of multi-resolution spline functions
   approximation. The method is able to provide metrical accuracy at least
   comparable to that provided by the most common deterministic
   interpolation algorithms (inverse distance weighting, local polynomial,
   radial basis functions). At the same time it dramatically reduces the
   number of information required for storing or for transmitting and
   rebuilding a digital terrain model dataset. A brief description of the
   method is presented and comparisons about the accuracy and data-store
   compression obtained with respect to other interpolators are shown.}},

Abstract = {{SA Photonics has developed (with support from the Air Force Research
   Lab, the US Army and Vision Systems International) an innovative wide
   field of view digital night vision head mounted display (HMD). This HMD
   has an 80 degree field of view to greatly improve operator situational
   awareness. By using creating an all-digital system, we provide the
   capability to enhance and record night vision imagery, overlay
   symbology, and inset video from remote sensors, either mounted on the
   aircraft or on UAVs. This HMD has been designed with maximum pilot
   utility in mind, and is easily stowable without impacting center of
   gravity or maneuverability of the pilot's head within the cockpit.
   Because the sensors are digital, they can be located right above the
   pilot's eyes removing any hyperstereoopsis.
   We have completed the design of our digital wide field of view HMD.
   Results of our work will be presented, along with design tradeoffs and

Abstract = {{In critically ill patients, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common
   complication. In some cases, oliguria may be the only sign verifying
   this condition. The consensus definitions of RIFLE and AKIN are based on
   changes in creatinine and urine output and define classes of severity
   within AKI. While meaningful change in serum creatinine is often not
   detectable until 48 h after deterioration in kidney function, urine
   output is a more rapid physiological parameter and detectable at the
   patient's bedside. Although urine output is a critical parameter in the
   intensive care unit, routine urine output measurements are performed
   manually. As a result, they may not be done timely and may be subject to
   inaccuracies due to human factors. The URINFO center dot system is an
   innovative digital urine meter that provides continuous minute-to-minute
   monitoring of urine output, thereby enhancing kidney monitoring and the
   acquisition of more reliable urine output information in real-time.
   Consequently, monitoring of urine output with URINFO may enable rapid
   therapeutic interventions and can be incorporated into patient data
   systems, thereby improving therapy management. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

   rapidly changing technologies by members of a distributed network of 35
   technology-based afterschool programs throughout California.
   University-Community Links (UC Links) is a collaborative effort among
   university campuses and local communities to develop a network, both
   physical and virtual, of afterschool program sites for underserved youth
   in California. While each UC Links program is a physical setting with
   its own set of learning activities developed in response to the
   cultural, linguistic, and educational concerns of the local community,
   the UC Links network as a whole serves as a larger virtual context for
   defining and pursuing shared goals and objectives and communicating
   information about effective uses of new digital technologies for
   afterschool learning. Using a cultural historical perspective, the
   authors approach UC Links as a sociotechnical activity system engaged in
   joint activity, and examine and assess its long-term adaptability and
   the differential capabilities of its local member sites to innovate in
   response to successive transformations of emerging technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Serendipity is generally characterized as a sagacious, unsought
   discovery. Innovations and advances in science and engineering such as
   penicillin and Teflon as a result of interactions with tangible
   engineered and natural phenomena are often labeled serendipitous.
   Serendipity also results from more conceptual interactions with
   information, knowledge, and ideas. But how does serendipity emerge when
   the discovery is predominantly conceptual? What conditions in the
   digital environment would help facilitate less tangible but similarly
   unexpected and fortunate interactions for knowledge workers? The
   objective of my research is to approach the study of serendipity as a
   process involving precipitating conditions, interacting internal and
   external factors that either hinder or facilitate serendipity, to
   understand how to best facilitate serendipity in a digital, information-
   rich environment. This research will contribute to an emerging field of
   study - support for serendipity in information systems - that is
   striving to make our experiences in digital environments richer and more
   meaningful.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology (IT) plays an important role in the growth of
   small businesses. Many businesses unfamiliar with technology tools risk
   being left behind in the so-called digital divide, rendering them unable
   to compete in today's business environment. Efforts to train owners of
   microenterprises often employ plan driven training, which emphasizes
   structure and linear learning with pre-defined learning objectives. This
   has been effective to a point, but it is sometimes insufficient to help
   microenterprises to cross the digital divide. This study proposes an
   alternative educational method, known as agile training. Agile Training
   is adapted from the Agile method of information systems development.
   Agile Training is an iterative method, designed to produce a
   demonstrable set of valuable technical skills on a short timetable. This
   innovative educational method adds process and psychological factors to
   standard plan driven training.}},

Abstract = {{H.264 or AVC (Advanced Video Coding) is a latest digital video codec
   standard which was developed as an answer to the growing demand for
   better compression in a wide range of applications and for improved
   network friendliness. H. 264 is able to deliver a compression efficiency
   of up to 50\% over a wide range of bit rates and video resolutions
   compared to previous standards (e.g. MPEG2 or H. 263). The downside is
   that the H. 264 decoder complexity is nearly four times higher than the
   previous standards. Hence a powerful hardware platform is required to
   provide real-time performance of H. 264 in today's high-end applications
   like HDTV. We present an innovative Hardware architecture to perform
   real-time H. 264 CABAC decoding using Finite State Machines (FSMs) for
   decoding of syntax elements. This architecture delivers a throughput of
   1 bin per cycle @ 180MHz as reported by Synopsys Design Compiler.}},

Abstract = {{Digital libraries are providing an increasing amount of data, which is
   normally structured in a classical way by documents and described by
   metadata as keywords. The data, even in scientific systems such as
   digital libraries and virtual research environments, will contain a
   great amount of noise or information unnecessary for our personal
   interests.
   Although there has been a lot of progress in the field of information
   retrieval, search techniques and other content finding methods, there is
   still much to be done in the field of information retrieval based on
   user behavior. This paper presents an approach deployed in the Humboldt
   Digital Library (HDL) to facilitate the retrieval of relevant
   information to the users of the system, making recommendations of
   paragraphs based on their profile and the behavior of other users who
   share similar profiles.
   The Humboldt digital library represents an innovative system of open
   access to the legacy of Alexander von Humboldt in a digital form on the
   Internet (www.avhumboldt.net). It contributes to the key question, how
   to present interconnected data in a proper form using information

Abstract = {{The paper will explore how a social media based E-learning 2.0 solution
   for formal learning (social IS) can be implemented, focusing on the
   technology acceptance process.
   The paper aims to increase the knowledge on how the acceptance regarding
   social media based E-learning 2.0 information systems for formal
   learning can be increased and how the acceptance affects the social
   learning experience. To achieve this, the paper relies on both a
   qualitative and quantitative approach and is primarily inductive. The
   paper concludes that the acceptance can not be seen as a linear process,
   as is common practice. Instead, one should see the process of acceptance
   as interlinked with the experience and external variables in a
   continuous process that can either `spiral' upwards or downwards.
   Furthermore, the paper identifies the problem of innovation resistance.
   The paper then analyzes information gathered from industry experts,
   practitioners and a live case to find how one can improve acceptance and
   thereby the social learning experience. Once these variables have been
   identified the paper presents strategic advice. The paper ends by a
   discussion of the results, both regarding the impact and contrast to
   previous research as well as highlighting areas for further research.}},

   the logistic of knowledge and reading enjoyment. The monopoly of the
   tradition-rich, printed books has ceased to exist. The texts get to the
   internet, and to read them innovative devices are required. The screen
   has become part of our daily lives, the deluge of letters arrive us
   electronically, and we transmit them digitally. The study seeks to
   examine some basic elements of this process, focusing to the

Abstract = {{The problem found in most hospitals is that the physician has to
   frequently visit the patient and asses his/her condition by measuring
   the parameters such as temperature, blood pressure, drip level etc. In
   case of emergencies, the nurse intimates the doctor through some means
   of communication like mobile phone. A growing selection of innovative
   electronic monitoring devices is available, but meaningful communication
   and decision supports are also needed for both patients and clinicians.
   The aim is to develop a reliable, efficient and easily deployable remote
   patient monitoring system that can play a vital role in providing basic
   health services to the patients. This system enables expert doctors to
   monitor patients in remote areas of hospital. Mobile phones or personal
   digital assistants (PDAs) with wireless networking capabilities may
   serve as gateways that process, store, and transfer measured parameters
   to clinicians for further analysis or diagnosis. The timely manner of
   conveying the real time monitored parameter to the doctor is given high
   priority which is very much needed.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion of collaborative principles and cognitive-strategic
   interactions for the innovation are phenomena that are not limited to
   private business contexts, but can also involve the public sector. The
   modernization action of the public administration (PA), in fact, gets
   through to a new innovation governance that puts to system resources,
   processes and actors, these last still too fragmented in their
   strategies and action models for interactive and collaborative
   innovation concept. Nevertheless, the full deployment of strategies and
   public politics inspired to the network innovation and open innovation
   logics requires appropriate conditions and the adoption of specific
   managerial tools {[}2]. This work try to evaluate the efficiency of a
   groupware as management tool to organize and manage interinstitutional
   networks, create participatory and collaborative conditions for
   innovation processes in public administrations. The research methodology
   is theoretical deductive. The dissertation departs in fact from the
   enucleation of theories and general principles to come, through the
   integrated cases strategy which places emphasis on holistic main aspects
   of the case {[}13], to the empirical analysis of the experiences tested
   at DigitPA (ex CNIPA) and to the analysis of some innovation projects.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study seeks to develop the concept of technological
   embeddedness by extending the social embeddedness theory of economic
   actions to household computer adoption. It also aims to propose a
   research framework in which technological embeddedness is a key factor
   that influences household computer adoption.
   Design/methodology/approach - The US 1989-2003 Computer and Internet Use
   Supplements to the Current Population Surveys are used to validate the
   proposed research framework.
   Findings - The results show that technological embeddedness positively
   affects household computer adoption. In addition, the impact of
   technological embeddedness is positively moderated by household income,
   and this impact is particularly stronger on first-time buyers than on
   repeat buyers.
   Practical implications - The results provide important policy and
   managerial implications for encouraging household computer adoption and
   bridging the digital divide.
   Originality/value - The paper proposes a new concept and develops a
   research framework for analyzing household computer adoption and
   technology adoption in general.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of digital economy or the new economy has performed
   appreciations over the current transformations of the economic
   activities, as result of using the digital technologies, which have
   ensured the access and processing of information. The new economy is
   characterized by intensifying the knowledge of the new products and
   services, the increase of technological information importance of
   innovation, globalization and long lasting development. The volume of
   information towards some services or products might change the way
   markets operate, situation that leads towards the accomplishment of a
   continuous flow of modifying or even restructuring the ole enterprises.
   New opportunities can also be reevaluated, in order to create value and
   quality, by information exploitation.
   The information society signifies the promoter which ensures the
   economical growth, in conditions of increased protection of the
   environment, thus accelerating the reduction of physical consumption.
   All these take place in order to capitalize the information and
   knowledge, ensuring the movement of the centre from investments, such as
   real means, towards the human capital investments. This paper aims
   towards the exemplification of limits drawn between extending the
   digital economy and the impact that such phenomenon exerts over its
   users. The adoption of IT opens therefore a wide pallet of services and
   activities, which any citizens or consumers can use. The paper proposes
   to emphasize the influence that digital economy has upon the
   individuals, seen as consumers of information technology, as well upon
   the level of protection as regards the personal data protection of
   people.}},

Abstract = {{The ICT sector is one of the key instruments for the economic
   development of an economy. The literature emphasizes its capacity for
   causing increase of productivity and generating new sources of incomes
   (Jorgenson, 2001; Colecchia and Schreyer, 2002; among others). Usually
   the economic studies measure the ICT sector impacts in the economic
   system but not the factors that can influence in the ICT opportunities
   for the whole economic development. Following Burt's approach (1992)
   about structural holes, the economic network organization establishes to
   whom and where the existence of new opportunities is reported. The
   network structure provides advantages of access, time and exclusivity to
   some agents but not for all. The structural hole methodology allows us
   to analyze the capacity of European ICT sector in the market
   opportunities creation and in the diffusion and technological
   innovation. The results corroborated the last inform about digital
   competitiveness in Europe by European Commission. Not only the ICT
   technologies have an important capacity of growth but their dependencies
   of other sectors are slight.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter aims to explain why and how South Korea develop such an
   advanced information and communication technology (ICT) and e-government
   in short period of time, and how the public sector is being innovated by

   to South Korea, the author provides a historical overview of the
   developmental processes of South Korea's ICT and e-government.
   E-government systems and services available in South Korea are explained
   along with the major achievements in public governance innovation. Much
   of the e-government services provide efficient and transparent processes
   of public service provision, and citizen participation in policy making
   and politics is being increased over time. The combined effects of
   e-government systems and services are: convenient access to government
   services, fast responses to citizen demands, automatic digital
   record-keeping, increasing transparency, cost-effective service
   provision, active citizen participation in policy making processes, and
   increasing political activism. However, South Korean experience of
   building e-government still has problems to be resolved. Most problems
   are behavioral as well as cultural instead of technical.}},

Abstract = {{In accordance with the Digital China strategy, the Mayor of Beijing
   declared in 1999 that Beijing Municipal Government (BMG) would launch
   the Digital Beijing plan. Digital Beijing aimed at building up an
   advanced and comprehensive information platform to support Beijing's
   sustainable development, as well as creating a public information space
   for government, enterprises and citizens to interact and to share
   knowledge. Digital Beijing changes the conception of traditional
   administration and contributed to the reengineering of organization
   structures of BMG. As a result, e-government, to some extent, promoted
   `quantitative management' in governmental administration, supervision
   and service. However, the transaction capability of e-government in the
   future will largely depend on the result of horizontal connections. Due
   to a great number of databases serving individual agencies or even
   offices, it is necessary to continue to invest in setting up the
   mechanisms of sharing and maintaining information resources.}},

Abstract = {{Campus Andaluz Virtual (CAV) is an experience framed within the project
   ``Universidad Digital{''} promoted and supported by the Junta de Andaluc
   a, which proposes a new teaching-learning model where students of all
   the public universities of Andaluc a can take virtual subjects that are
   recognized as free configuration credits in the student home university.
   The subjects offered in CAV are completely virtual and students are
   provided with all the didactic materials (theory notes, activities,
   exercises, tutorials and exams) through the e-learning platform of the
   university responsible for the subject. Hence, in particular, the
   evaluation of these subjects must be also carried out virtually.
   From the beginning of CAV, the Department of Statistics and Operations
   Research of the University of Jaen (UJA) has taken part in its formative
   offer with the subject entitled Descriptive Statistics. The authors
   assumed the challenge of developing a virtual course focusing on the
   teaching quality and on the importance of e-learning as a strategy for
   innovation and improvement.
   From our viewpoint, some of the main aspects in the implementation of a
   virtual course are the evaluation criteria and tools. In the case of the
   subject Descriptive Statistics offered in CAV, this evaluation has to be
   performed using the tools provided by the e-learning platform ILIAS used
   at the UJA. In this paper, the evaluation tools utilized in the subject
   Descriptive Statistics are analyzed to identify strong and weak points,
   as well as possible changes and improvements to be incorporated in
   future.}},

Abstract = {{From the university point of view, the European Higher Education Area
   requires additional techniques to improve motivation of students in the
   theoretical sessions. In addition, the change of the Spanish
   Universities system following the European Credit Transfer and
   Accumulation System (ECTS) is imminent. This change brings the need of a
   change of orientation in lectures, and the adaptation of former teaching
   methodologies into different active learning based ones. From the
   perspective of High School, it is also found the same problem to improve
   the motivation of students in the classroom. For that reason, we believe
   that is necessary application of new techniques to develop lessons and
   issues theoretical practices, more attractive and interesting for
   students. It has been found both in the University experience as the
   experience in the High Schools to define teaching more focused on
   practice, use cases and activities, which involved actively to the
   students in order to encourages their motivation, participation and thus
   improve their learning. This paper presents an analysis of our
   experience with portable digital boards and classroom response systems,
   which is compared with classical digital boards. This is presented and
   evaluated how useful are these new technological tools in the classroom.
   On the one hand, the proposed work improves the experience carried out
   in the implementation of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in the field of
   Electronics Technology at the University of Murcia. Specifically, our
   experience has been using portable digital board and a classroom
   response system. First, teachers and students can move around the
   classroom while leveraging the capabilities of an interactive board with
   the portable digital board, which is like a ``tablet{''} wireless. The
   results have presented that the methodology is positive for students and
   teachers, since this enhances the involvement of students in the stages
   of the PBL in the theoretical and practical sessions. On the other hand,
   this experience and work has also been implemented and evaluated in a
   High School, where teachers with more than 20 years of experience have
   incorporated in their class the use of the digital board. The results at
   the High School have been positive as in the university. Following the
   students and teachers opinion, the conclusions is that in both scenarios
   should be promoted the use and integration in the classroom of the new
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Shrinking funds, the development of new technologies and the upcoming
   customer demands, make urgent the need for change and innovation in
   libraries especially in higher education. Because of this challenging
   situation, libraries should find alternative ways to deliver their
   services. One of the options is the use of the Library 2.0 model. This
   model is a revolutionary concept that encourages a constant change due,
   among other things, to the use of technological tools. This includes
   online services such as SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information),
   forums, social networks, electronic newsletters, enhanced OPAC (Online
   Public Access Catalog), virtual reference, etc. In Ecuador, the
   University of Cuenca is currently executing the project ``Institutional
   change to strengthen research and education{''} (2007-2012). This
   project is being developed in the collaboration of the Institutional
   University Cooperation Program of the Flemish Inter-university Council.
   One of the main goals of this project is to have the Regional
   Documentation Centre ``Juan Bautista Vazquez{''} - CDRJBV leaning
   towards a Library 2.0 system.
   Based on an analysis related to the CDRJBV's situation, several changes
   were planned. In the technological area, the focus was on: 1) the
   strengthening and modernization of the technological infrastructure, 2)
   the development of a new Web Site, 3) the improvement and expansion of
   digital databases, 4) the implementation of new services through the
   Library 2.0 philosophy, and 5) the training of library staff and users.
   In the organizational and policy area, the proposed changes were: 1) the
   adequacy of organizational structure, 2) the optimization of internal
   processes, 3) the improvement of interpersonal relationships, 4) the
   positioning of the Centre both internally and externally, and 5) the
   update of regulations.
   After 3 years of project implementation, CDRJBV has obtained new
   physical and digital services that follow the Library 2.0 philosophy:
   the new Web Site has implemented all the new services planned and a
   modern technological infrastructure has enabled quick, direct and
   friendly access. Regarding the organizational part, the results are
   reflected in the adaptation and adoption of new library policies and
   procedures, the formation of the ``Library Council{''} that supports and
   legitimizes the change process within the University. It is also
   important to note that the library staff has become aware of the ``need
   to change{''}, resulting in the emergence of new organizational and
   technological practices.
   However, up to now this process has taken too much time and the results
   have been only partially achieved. Despite of the many troubles,
   important lessons should be learned out of this process, such as: 1) an
   evolution process towards a Library 2.0 system should be seen as an
   integral process, where technological and organizational components are
   managed simultaneously; 2) the stakeholders of the process must be
   involved from the earliest stages of planning to increase their overall
   cooperation; 3) the library staff needs to acquire and master new skills
   and knowledge in order to provide these new services. In addition, the
   technological tools that have been implemented have been one of the
   biggest supports during the deployment and execution stage; although
   their optimal and comprehensive development is limited by the policies
   and processes and not by the technological constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Bangladesh, a developing and third world country, recognized for its
   microcredit success, has a favourable political environment to achieve
   `Digital Bangladesh' by 2021. Government projects, public-private
   partnership projects, corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities
   and private initiatives for Information Communication Technology (ICT)
   for education are integrating telecenter models in secondary educational
   institutes. The three-fold objectives of these development projects are
   computer literacy for teachers and students, telecenter for community
   and access to better learning content or better learning. Little or no
   significant study had been conducted on the qualitative achievements of
   such projects traceable from early 2002. A secondary technical
   vocational education and training (TVET) institute of about 450 students
   in a village of about 5500 inhabitants is selected for a qualitative
   study using theories and methodologies adapted from different
   disciplines. This paper presents the plan for this action research to be
   conducted during August 2011 to December 2012 as part of the research
   project during September 2010 to June 2013.
   As proponent of ICT for development, the author considers the problems
   of rural inhabitants (78\%) living on agrarian livelihood, electricity
   insufficiency (47\% from nation grid), socio-economic class gap and
   bias, lower education vs. employment association (as education for
   sustainability) and low access to ICTs. These might resist the intended
   objective of ICT for development projects. With decrease of technology
   obsolescence period if the technology `domestication' is not
   proportionately increased, the digital divide will intensify. Bridging
   the digital divide (in terms of `adaption') will become far reaching.
   Thus, firstly, this paper reviews different theoretical dimensions to
   converge towards a qualitative `diffusion study' focusing socio-economic
   context. Secondly, the problems faced in implementing ICT in secondary
   institutions and telecenters of disadvantageous communities are reported
   to construct the problem boundary. Finally, the author proposes an
   intensive study using three different approaches to identify a
   preferable methodology for higher `diffusion' or `domestication'.
   Participatory Rural Assessment (PRA) will be used for identifying the
   achievement. Three different methodologies for diffusion include,
   firstly, smart class rooms and after-class telecenter model as part of a
   national pilot project; secondly, ICTs in co-curricular activities
   including self-learning and community teaching, ICT based academic
   administration; and thirdly, life and livelihood centred programs as
   part of telecentre.
   In Bangladesh context, TVET institutes' students come from lower middle
   class or below. The motivation for these students is early employment or
   entrepreneurship with low capital investment. Unfortunately, TVET
   institutes seem to be victim of invisible bias in ICT expansion
   projects. Bangladesh Millennium Development Goal (MDG) progress report
   of 2009 shows downward index for employment. IT supports services
   personnel are mostly from TVET institutes. The study is expected to
   positively contribute and give a direction to achieve the goal using
   school-based telecentres.}},

   instrument in the process of digital inclusion - since democratizes the
   e-learning, providing over 80 curses with webAula quality and accessible
   price to anyone. Because of the restructure global economy process, the
   pursuit to professional improvement by education and trainings grows.
   The people who are capable and inside the information world have more
   possibilities to stay and grow professionally on their jobs, no matter
   which is it. How many more experiences and training, in a better place a
   person will be. Historically, is know that in crises moments lived, the
   pursuit for education and professional improvement become priority to
   people, governs and companies. E-learning has a fundamental role in
   these times because it brings facilities in a very low cost comparing to
   traditional training and learning ways. There are multiply benefits:
   ease of management and process control; saving and business
   transparency; ease in the building knowledge process because of the
   easiness to adequate to different kinds of learning. The technology,
   content and management quality are fundamental factors that have to be
   observed by the E-learning developer company. If these factors are well
   structured, it turns into a solid base that brings real benefits to the
   users of e-learning, which means the knowledge will be passed and
   professional training will be placed.
   The restructure global economy must be seen as a time to create and
   implement opportunities, all kinds of e-learning fit in this moment of
   great opportunity. The big advantage from education is that there are no
   borders, it breaks the limits.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known the general concern of educators and teachers (and even
   of educational authorities around the world) with the question of
   `integration of ICT in the curriculum'. This concern is visible at the
   level of research reported and curriculum guidelines in many countries.
   In fact, it is widely discussed the `integration of ICT in the
   curriculum' and we should recall the discussion and analysis of Seymour
   Papert in 1996 in an article published in The Washington Post Education
   Review presenting the parable of `integrating the pencil in the
   classroom to understand the effect in pupils learning' and suggesting
   the irrelevance of formulating the issue of ICT in education as a
   problem of `integration'.
   This article aims to challenge and interrogate the concept of
   integration of ICT in the curriculum.
   Taking the notion that learning itself is an improvised practice, we
   discuss the viability and relevance of focusing the issue on the
   analysis of the learning curriculum as something that unfolds in
   opportunities for engagement in practice using the available artefacts
   and resources and which is not fully specified by the educational system
   (that uses the curriculum as a powerful tool to manage education). The
   rationale for the claims we will put forward and discuss in this article
   draws on (i) the notion that learning takes place through engagement in
   practices and not through the imposition of specific forms of behaviour
   based on prescriptive curriculum guidelines, (ii) the idea that more and
   more children grow up culturally embedded in technology as digital
   natives and in fact schools are populated by technologically rather
   powerful habitants in an ecological system in transformation, and (iii)
   on the notion that `integration of ICT in education' is a misleading
   formulation for researching the issue of using ICT in education.
   We will argue in the direction of focusing attention in teacher and
   students' practices - both at home and at school - and identify factors
   and strategies that may help to bridge the existing gap between
   practices of ICT use at school and at home and/or public spaces. For
   this purpose we will address the strategic role of learning scenarios as
   tools for the definition of learning trajectories leading to the
   assumption of relevant learning curriculum by the students.
   Finally we will put forward principles for a tentative research agenda
   on the use of ICT in education.}},

Abstract = {{Architecture's relationship to technology is central to design
   approaches and design education. Building technologies and design media,
   however, are not neutral. They are historically and culturally framed;
   their use and potential is related to and influenced by contextual
   parameters. Consequently, the potential of digital media and
   mass-customization technologies needs to be considered in the context of
   their application. Pedagogy that includes design-build projects, and
   which focuses on the realization of designs, offers opportunities for
   students to gain an understanding of the design and building process
   related to the use of digital media and fabrication technologies.
   Complexity, ecology, innovation, place, and aesthetics are references
   for context-specific design and building. They illustrate ideas relevant
   for the conception, development, and realization of design and building
   that is responsive to the surroundings. This interest in concepts of
   complex systems is consistent with a general understanding of the
   multifaceted environment within which architecture exists. By
   integrating design-build projects into the design curriculum, students
   participate directly in the design process and experience the
   implications of contextual parameters for design, fabrication, and
   building.}},

Abstract = {{Recently it has been detected a growing interest on distance learning
   platforms to give support to non-presence learning activities.
   Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV), conscious of this need has
   made an important effort to develop and launch different multimedia
   platforms useful as support for conventional (presence)
   teaching-learning activities and especially for distance learning
   (non-presence). Among these multimedia platforms, it is interesting to
   remark the increasing interest and use of several on-line platforms such
   as Polimedia and publication of free access teaching material through
   the Open Course Ware platform at UPV. Polimedia is a multimedia video
   platform based on Digital Learning Objects (DLOs) that can be defined as
   individual explanations of a particular topic in which a video
   presentation (mainly power point) and a video record with the teacher
   explanations are synchronized to obtain a video object file. Regarding
   free access teaching material, UPV has activated its Open Course Ware
   portal and the free access material is increasing every year.}},

Abstract = {{Information and communication technology is transforming teaching
   processes by providing very useful tools at higher education levels, and
   incorporating resources into teaching practices that will allow the
   generation of virtual training environments, free of time restrictions
   and non-dependent on the space required for face-to-face teaching.
   Chroma Key literally means colour key and corresponds to the component
   of the video signal that carries colour. It consists of an electronic
   process that combines the output signals from two or more cameras with
   one another, and/or with other external sources, obtaining as a result a
   uniform and visually undetectable mixture.
   There is no doubt that the rapid transformation that society is
   undergoing as a result of technological advances, is causing a huge
   impact on teaching methods at university. We report our experience with
   this technology for visualisation, in which we have incorporated virtual
   scenarios that afford a greater visual attraction to teaching
   presentations. For this reason, our aim is to use these digital
   audiovisual resources that enable an innovative way of teaching as
   alternative teaching methods that will end in attractive and efficient
   approaches for medical training in the current society, using
   easy-to-use technological methodologies.
   With respect to methodology, the process carried out is based on the
   fact that the recording system does not only work with two different
   sources, a primary and a secondary one, but that it possesses an
   electronic device able to detect the signal of a given colour, which is
   generally green or blue. If it receives the signal, it disconnects the
   recording it is making through the primary sources and replaces it with
   the signal from the secondary source. Evidently, the greater the
   capacity of the device in disconnecting the blue or green zones without
   affecting the other chromatic ranges, and, above all, those close to
   them, the better the quality of the final product. In this study, we
   used a virtual brainstorm set system, with a 5600 degrees k cold light
   illumination apparatus for chroma, a green infinite cyclorama system
   with 7 m of background and 10 m depth (4.60 m high) and a Panasonic E.
   860L camera. The software was Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5 with the Matrox
   RTX. 100 hardware and software
   The management of this audiovisual technology as a communication tool,
   facilitated the creation of attractive teaching environments,
   integrating training materials that improve the attention of the user
   (student) in their learning process, and offering an excellent means to
   transmit teaching contents.
   The use of technological training methods and the visualization of
   knowledge, together with the exploration of their teaching
   possibilities, lie within the sphere of our teaching responsibility and
   are a constant challenge to be met by both professionals linked to the
   teaching sphere and those in charge of elaborating and developing
   technological applications aimed at optimizing learning.}},

Abstract = {{Informational innovations in terms of modifications in the type and
   quantity of information available via the Internet are contributing to
   the establishment of a new social order that requires new skills to
   access, process and use information. Specifically, in academic context,
   all these innovations are aimed at the reorganization of the traditional
   models of teaching and learning, which also requires the commitment from
   teachers in the developments of strategies to access information
   efficiently and significantly.
   Under this approach, some European and national guidelines relating to
   the importance of the ability to access digital information effectively,
   making skills related to information literacy as key skills. Especially
   some generic skills have been emerged in the context of Bologna that
   require training for college and undergraduate students for the
   development of informational skills.
   Based on the variables involved in the process of finding information on
   the Internet (Fuentes and Hernandez, 2007) and some models of good
   practices for teaching and learning (Fuentes and Hernandez, 2009), this
   paper presents a series of competences students should develop along
   with the type of cognitive and emotional support educators can offer so
   that learners respond effectively}},

Abstract = {{The international world today witnesses a technological and scientific
   revolution, which caused an accelerated growth in scientific advancement
   and technological innovation, that represent an access for the present
   century. Nationally and internationally, education and learning are
   confronting several challenges such as, knowledge outburst since the
   amount of information is growing twice over per 4-5 years. To deal with
   this challenge it was necessary to construct novel teaching methods as:
   electronic learning, digital curriculum, distance learning, and smart
   classrooms, along with their implementation in teaching. Alongside with
   the innovative assistance such as, hypothetical laboratories, multi
   media, digital libraries, and other new technologies that basically
   implement technological innovations in teaching and learning process.
   Thus, it was necessary to investigate awareness level of technological
   innovations among science prospective teachers at College of Education,
   which mat assist her training to tackle novelty in the new technological
   world. Hence, the present research is trying to answer the following
   questions:
   What is the awareness level of technological innovations among science
   prospective teachers?
   Is there a statistically significant differences in the awareness level
   of technological innovations among prospective teachers due to different
   professionals (chemistry / biology).
   Is there a statistically significant differences in the awareness level
   of technological innovations among prospective teachers due to academic
   level (level one-level two).
   The study applied (Technological Innovations Awareness Test). The sample
   of the study comprises 200 female students applied to College of
   Education at chemistry and biology departments (level one \& level
   four).
   The study attained the following results:
   The sample represents a low level of awareness of technological
   innovations, lower than competency level identified in the study.
   There are no statistically significant differences between the mean
   scores of prospective teachers in chemistry and biology regarding
   technological innovations awareness test.
   There are no statistically significant differences between the mean
   scores of prospective teachers in first level and fourth level regarding
   technological innovations awareness test.
   With reference to the results of the study, several recommendations are
   presented:
   Reviewing educational syllabuses presented in teacher training programs
   to be in line with technological innovations growth.
   The need for training prospective teachers to utilize technological
   innovations in their field of profession through the implementation of
   hypothetical and computerized laboratories.
   Spreading the technological awareness among science teaching
   professionals, college staff members, and laboratory guardians through
   training courses and workshops to apply technological innovations in
   teaching process.
   Initiating professional training courses and workshops for prospective
   teachers to assist technological awareness, concerning its significance,
   concepts, implementation, and utilization in teaching.
   Including special syllabuses to deal with technological innovations and
   its utility, alongside with educational technology in prospective
   teachers programs.
   Providing the suitable classrooms and learning centers to maintain staff
   members' efforts in utilizing technological innovations in academic
   teaching.}},

Abstract = {{The new developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
   and the continuous changes of educational and research technologies have
   triggered new ways of interaction between professors and students,
   between researchers and their projects. It is about the interference
   between two types of communication, training and learning: the
   traditional ones, carried out in the real world, in the usual academic
   life, and the modern ones, moved into the virtual environment,
   accessible only to the initiated.
   In a world where the only aspect unchanged is change, education must
   integrate and adjust its offerings to support the new generations,
   constantly updating goals and resources to meet new challenges and at
   the same time, to provide skills and effective working tools for the
   learners.
   The paper attempts to identify and describe the way in which the new ICT
   in the educational field, such as e-learning, digital television,
   virtual classroom, videoconference, can expand the narrow circle of
   interest to knowledge and communication, as well as breaking the
   barriers of distance in order to initiate and develop relationships
   among different cultures, institutions and people.
   In order to be modern and attractive in its effort to train and
   specialize highly qualified persons, to generate and disseminate ideas,
   concepts and knowledge, a university should constantly learn to
   implement the latest innovations in the field of ICT, to promote and use
   them in its sphere of activity. To reach this goal, it should combine
   both traditional methods and modern ones, while virtualization and
   digitization of education and research should be the must-have of the
   moment.}},

   well-trained on the variety of technology tools available. Technology
   tools captivate the interest of students and encourage high-levels of

   while teachers lack the knowledge or skills to integrate technology into
   the curriculum. Two university teacher education professors will share
   innovative technology tools to enhance instruction. The tools were
   modeled in education courses for preservice teachers and transferred
   into K-12 classrooms. Technology tools included: Skype, PhotoPeach,
   Prezi, Blabberize, Xtranormal, Poll Everywhere (voting with cellphones),
   Tagxedo, GPS, and GIS. For example, Skype was used to connect to a local
   weather broadcaster, a foreign student, and classroom to classroom
   conversations. Poll Everywhere was utilized as a formative assessment to
   determine students' understandings of concepts discussed in class.
   Xtranormal introduced concepts in an innovative ways with dialogue

Abstract = {{This paper will focus upon education reform initiatives undertaken in
   teacher education programmes through innovative pedagogy and a learner -
   centered research agenda (Darling-Hammond et al 2005), at Bahrain
   Teachers College (BTC) (See Bahrain Education Reform, (2006)
   www.btc.uob.edu.bh/index/html, www.bahrainedb.bh. These initiatives have
   been undertaken in order to reform the Bahrainian K-12 school system.
   Curriculum reform movements have extended the trajectory of 21st century
   literacies, of transforming teaching and learning from traditional
   resources to digital, multimodal resources. The affordances of computer
   technologies-cyberliteracies have transformed information and
   communication (Unsworth, 2001).
   This in turn has led to a transformation of a pedagogy of
   multiliteracies, of multimodalities: visual, textual, audio, to a
   multiplicity of semiotic resources, meaning making cultures to construct
   different dimensions of meaning: linguistic, visual, digital (Street,
   1984, Gee 1990, New London Group, 2000).
   Technological tools have transformed the literate forms of
   communication. The way the book is read, the way information is
   selected, is now transformed and mediated by technology to a textual
   habitat, ( Goodwyn, 1998) to screen based literacies (Kress 1997).
   This paper reports preliminary attempts on the use of multimodal,
   multliteracies in Bahrain classrooms. Educators Hargreaves and Reyan,
   (1989), argue that teachers need to be increasingly included in
   curriculum conception, and not just be seen as technical executors of
   technical delivery of pupil learning.
   Teacher's candidates at BTC are instructed to multimedia communication,
   their awareness raised for critical understanding of multiliteracies in
   order to develop informed teachers for effective pedagogic intervention.
   During fieldwork teachers are encouraged and set tasks to develop
   digital teaching materials using digital learning tools: to record
   mediascape and soundscape of interactive environmental events and
   episodes, where the emphasis is on engagement, developing digital images
   and digital scripts that reflects participation, role relationships.
   The paper will analyse observations of teachers and discuss the
   following questions:
   1. To what extent are teachers able to move teaching and learning from
   recognition literacies, to reproduction literacies, to reflection
   literacies? (Unsworth 2001)
   2. How do teachers develop uses and users of language, image and digital
   resources to develop meanings?(Kress, 1995)
   3. To what extent do teacher candidates develop learner activities that
   explore and expand the nature and depth of their understandings?
   4. What is the nature of teacher candidate's competencies in order to
   communicate their critical thinking and understandings of
   multiliteracies?}},

   The educational landscape has changed significantly over the last
   decade, as have students' expectation due to ubiquitous technology
   {[}1], {[}2]. We describe the success of a UK centre of expertise, Mimas
   {[}3], based at the University of Manchester, that delivers online
   services to support research and teaching; with a focus here on learning
   and teaching materials and socioeconomic research data. We show how
   national initiatives, such as those we describe, can enhance the student
   experience, and contribute to the skills and employability agenda that
   are so relevant to 21st century learners {[}4], {[}5]. We also describe
   how we are sharing our expertise with countries in Europe to meet their
   national strategic priorities.
   Firstly we describe two services that deliver open access resources for
   teaching and learning. We move on to introduce findings from a project
   that investigated the use of socioeconomic research data in teaching
   that has helped us start to build a body of evidence to demonstrate the
   impact of using real world data on the student experience. Thirdly, we
   show how, having built a national profile for online educational
   services delivery, we are expanding beyond the boundaries of the UK to
   share resources, and expertise, with others through an EU Leonardo
   Transfer of Innovation project.
   We start with the international award winning initiative-Hairdressing
   Training {[}6] - a vocational online training resource, delivering
   interactive content for teaching and studying. The open access content
   has been mapped to a national vocational qualification (NVQ) scheme. We
   present on the use of the service since its inception, charting its
   history to make it a hugely popular online service and a model for
   others to follow.
   We then talk about a second national initiative - Jorum {[}7] - designed
   to support the global sharing of resources developed by teachers and
   learners in the UK. Services like Jorum can assist in helping academics
   save time in finding good teaching materials that can be reused and
   repurposed. Examples of evidence of Jorum's impact will be provided.
   We present an approach taken to collect narratives (or stories) from
   real teachers using real data from organisations such as the World Bank,
   the OECD and the IMF to show impact on the student experience. This
   appetite for sharing ideas and materials around educational practice
   with valuable secondary data resources accords well with the UK's need
   to upskill social science students in the use of data and statistics.
   Finally we describe the Mimas led two year project - Hair. Net - that
   will take Hairdressing Training into three EU member states - Slovakia,
   Romania and Bulgaria. This will facilitate labour market mobility in
   Eastern Europe by providing the UK's Hairdressing Training content to
   the partner countries, mapped to the European Qualification Framework
   (EQF) {[}46] and their own vocational frameworks.
   Changes to the educational and digital landscape in the early 21st
   Century bring opportunities. Mimas has over ten years' experience of
   providing user focussed services in support of education and research.
   This paper provides a summary of a number of key national UK
   initiatives, with the prize that services that deliver good quality,
   targeted content can provide real and global benefits for teachers and
   learners.}},

Abstract = {{Social media (web 2.0) is paramount in initiating economic potential and
   improving customer services and relations within the tourism industry;
   customers are now engaging in social media and businesses need to
   respond in order to contribute to a competitive European tourism
   industry. However, amongst some micro-business and Small to Medium
   Enterprises (SMEs) there has been a reluctance to engage in social media
   underpinned by a lack of targeted training in this area which responds
   to the specific needs of the industry and of the organisation. Given the
   growing recognition and importance of Web 2.0 technologies used by
   academics and the popular press, failure for SMEs to participate in
   these technologies could impoverish their digital experiences and thus
   result in lost opportunities for business development. Part of the
   problem lies in current mechanisms for engagement of businesses or
   practitioners in professional development. European commercial activity
   can no longer rely purely on formal education for the development of
   people engaged in work and should recognise that the knowledge that
   underpins practice is actually held within the community of its
   practitioners and brings meaning to learning. We have responded to this
   by creating a collaborative learning proposal which combines aspects of
   formal and informal learning to engage individuals at the grassroots
   level. The model, which uses a symbiotic approach to formal and informal
   learning is grassroots led, centred on the needs of the individual, but
   collaborative in nature and is based within an online learning
   environment. What this model provides is a means by which today's
   practical theories can be created by knowledge situated in the practice
   of those who have experience of it - daily practice reified through an
   informal collaborative network can become the basis for tomorrow's
   formal learning. Network technologies allow for this dynamic to be
   realised with an immediacy that is relevant, enabling the creation of
   focused, need driven learning. We have been successful in gaining
   Lifelong Learning Programme, Leonardo da Vinci Transfer of Innovation
   funding to pilot this innovative approach to technology enhanced
   learning within the workplace. Within the pilot we will be working with
   partners from Wales, Sweden and Bulgaria to test and develop this
   approach for web 2.0 training for the European tourism industry. A key
   component of the course development is the engagement of the industry
   themselves, and the ability for them to create their own training with
   facilitation by ourselves, located in the broader socio-cultural theory
   context and in particular the work of Wenger {[}1]. This paper reports
   on the learning model, its epistemological context and progress made in
   its implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Our growing sensitivity for environmental issues has indicated that
   buildings are the major cause for damaging nature. Pollution from
   heating and cooling buildings exceeds that from cars. The building
   industry, the second largest industry in the world, manufactures
   building materials consuming enormous energy, and exhaustible resources.
   Buildings and their construction account for more than half of the
   entire greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption globally each
   year. The Building Sector is the key source of demand for energy and
   materials that produce by-product greenhouse gases. On the other hand,
   our houses, which are the largest lifetime purchase, are built more or
   less with the same way as they were built at least fifty years ago. The
   home that will define our lives is designed by and large only for the
   present, based upon an implicit (and obsolete) conception that the
   future is just a repetition of the present. Our society needs urgently
   new approaches in the conception theorization and implementation of
   architectural practices, which will generate architectural designs
   responsive to the new conception of the relations between nature and the
   humans where the latter are part of the former depending upon and
   determining it in a dynamic and parametric relationship. Architecture
   education has a role to play in the above debate. The fragmentation of
   architecture education constitutes the environment as yet another `must'
   subject but with no connection to the design process in general and to
   the design studio in particular, while the design studio has always been
   the platform on which either implicitly or explicitly all fragments come
   together towards quality architecture. At our School of Architecture,
   after a number of pedagogic trials and errors, has recently designed a
   series of interlinked and innovative courses based on the model:
   initiation-theoretical background, grounding: precedent study through
   matrixes, conceptualization-delving into theory-implementing through
   design. In the first one: initiation-theoretical background, an
   introduction to the basics of building physics takes place but is
   transformed to be architect friendly avoiding calculi and equations
   while teaching the relationship between building and climate
   conceptually. This part is evaluated through exams on a series of
   questions that assess student critical thinking and good grasp of this
   relationship. In the second one: grounding: precedent study through
   matrixes, two lectures an introductory and a simulation of what is
   expected of the students are delivered by the staff. Each week students
   present a case study of a distinguished, for its environmental
   sensitivity, building on matrix of criteria set by the staff and
   students regarding performance, natural ventilation, cooling, heating,
   solar shading etc strategies. The students compile a digital archive of
   good practice examples. In the third one: conceptualization-delving into
   theory-implementing through design, the first part of the module is
   based on lectures that delve into, on the one hand, more specific issues
   of energy control and savings, and on the other hand, on seminars on
   software relating to the environment as well as relating to
   adaptive-parametric architecture. The paper will present the specifics
   of each method suggesting a broader, generalisable, innovative,
   integrated and cohesive pedagogy towards graduate architects with
   environmental sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Societies nowadays change at a rapid pace, and the globalization process
   is one of the main determinants of the characteristics of modern
   economies. Society's economic agents and human capital must present an
   adequate profile and competences to face the new challenges and
   opportunities that the knowledge economy brings about. Therefore,
   businessmen/employers and workers actually need not only traditional
   conceptual knowledge but other competences such as emotional
   intelligence, digital competences and language competences.
   Given the increasing globalization of today's industry and the crucial
   importance of the English language in the economic and business world,
   together with the changes in the educational learning context with the
   evolution of educational needs and the need to apply and use multimedia
   technologies in education, the Economics and Business Administration
   Faculty at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) has designed a
   new educational model adapted to the new conditions, focused on the use
   of competitive educational tools and on the promotion of students'
   language skills and competences. This new model, called a curricular
   Pathway in English, is offered to students as part of the Bachelor
   Degrees in Economics and Business Management, with a view to boosting
   the internationalization of its undergraduate programs.
   These language competences and knowledge are demanded by the Balearic
   business sector because there is a lack of workers with these skills and
   competences for the international expansion of the tourism firms and
   markets in other destinations. Furthermore, this new educational model
   provides an international perspective to these degrees and on completion
   of the course will increase job prospects for students at both Balearic
   and international level.
   With this new model the Faculty is committed to the mission of training
   highly competitive young and providing efficient teaching processes. The
   Pathway in English is a new pilot experience which offers the Faculty's
   students the opportunity to study, in English, half of the subjects from
   the degree courses and to spend a period at a foreign university where
   they can continue to study in English.
   The paper analyzes and evaluates the results of this new educational
   model and suggests measures to improve the model in the future. The
   structure of the paper is as follows: first an introduction describing
   the main features of the Balearic Islands' economy and human capital;
   the second section describes the structure, organization and management
   of the English Pathway and how this new educational model is part of the
   undergraduate degrees; the third section the resources, methodology and
   necessary protocols to implement this Pathway in English; next section
   presents results on the evaluation of this new model for the first year
   experience (2009-2010), with the students' and teachers' opinions and
   results; and finally, the main conclusions and policy implications.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this large-scale survey study (N=505) is to investigate
   secondary schoolteachers' instructional use of Learning Management
   Systems (LMS) and their perceptions towards LMS. Recent research shows
   that LMS- also referred to as Virtual Learning Environments, Digital
   Learning Environments, or Electronic Learning Environments - are
   ubiquitous in higher (Lonn \& Teasley, 2009) and secondary education (De
   Smet \& Schellens, 2009; Pynoo, Devolder, Tondeur, van Braak, Duyck \&
   Duyck, in press). Although a high adoption rate is observed, little is
   known about the related technology acceptance (Van Raaij \& Schepers,
   2008; Sanchez \& Hueros, 2010), how LMS benefit learning (Koszalka \&
   Ganesan, 2004), or how LMS use is related to instructor and student
   perceptions about teaching and learning (Lonn \& Teasley, 2009).
   In this study, a theoretical model was developed, starting from the
   second technology acceptance model-also referred to as TAM (Venkatesh,
   Morris, Davis, \& Davis, 2003) and focusing on additional variables,
   such as Subjective norm, Personal innovativeness, number of years of
   LMS-use (Experience), and Internal ICT support at school level.
   Self-reported instructional use was measured with a 12-item scale,
   including items focusing on sending messages, using the chatroom,
   exercises, document publishing, forum, learning path, wiki, classroom
   reservation, and different forms of administrative support. Typical
   learning functions of an average LMS were included. On the base of an
   exploratory and a confirmatory factor analysis, instructional LMS use
   could be operationalized as consisting of two constructs: administrative
   (i.e. focusing on distributing and management of course material) and
   interactive use (i.e. using the interactive features of the LMS for
   teaching and learning).
   In line with earlier TAM-research (Legris et al., 2003), the model
   predicted around 40\% of a system's use. More specifically, the model
   helped to predict 41\% of Administrative LMS-use. Moreover - and this is
   really innovative in the field - we were also able to predict 26\% of
   Interactive LMS use in this study. In addition to the typical technology
   acceptance variables, individual factors like Personal innovativeness
   toward IT and contextual factors such as Internal ICT support at school
   level were found to have a direct effect on the Interactive use of the
   LMS.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, Art education has experienced important changes due
   to the introduction of entirely innovative forms of expression and
   communication. Digital technology is the critical factor to give birth
   to these forms.
   In the digital era, the artistic laboratory and thus the entire Art
   education system is equally dynamic as the artwork itself.
   Digital interactive artworks, and even traditional artworks subject to
   digital processing (e. g. video montage), require innovative approaches
   in their creative process structure, with this effecting seriously their
   aesthetics. These entirely new approaches also reflect on the
   educational methodology.
   On the other hand, digital technology has created new facts regarding
   artist's identity and relation with society. Social web and
   collaborative authoring platforms have removed the artists' isolation
   and have established artistic communities that join forces towards batch
   modes of expression and production. This reflects on the educational
   process through collaborative and distance learning practices.
   The Multimedia-Hypermedia \& Video Art laboratory of the Athens School
   of Fine Arts (ASFA) is built on the above ideas and has always
   dynamically acted towards the development of a new generation laboratory
   that faces the new challenges.
   The basic principles that have evolved through 10 years of research are
   the following:
   A. The artist is a member of an interdisciplinary group, in an
   interconnected laboratory.
   B. The space for artistic experimentation, communication and life-long
   learning of this artist is a virtual space that the authors call
   meta-space. It is a special platform allowing the investigation of
   innovative concepts and structures that the digital environment
   encapsulates in its core. This is achieved by defining a conceptual
   multidimensional space that manages elements (e. g. sounds, images,
   texts, actions) and their ontological relations, rather than a virtual
   3D space imitating real world through realistic landscapes and avatars.
   Special courses on programming concepts and structures complete and
   upgrade this meta-space. In other words, this meta-space is an
   educational system that evolves by its participants.
   C. In addition to handling artistic elements and concepts, this
   meta-space has the potential to act also as a knowledge-space. This
   knowledge-space provides the artist with tools for theoretical (artistic
   and scientific) research. These tools enable advanced searching, as well
   as organization and classification of information. This knowledge-space
   is important as it allows linking of the artistic thought with other
   human thought disciplines (e. g. philosophy, mathematics etc). It
   communicates with external evolving systems, such as PLM systems, the
   semantic web.
   Since the establishment of the ASFA Multimedia-Hypermedia \& Video Art
   laboratory, these ideas have moved on through personal research of its
   members, and collaborations with other universities, namely the
   Department of Art and Technology of the Image of University Paris-8, the
   Department of Sculpture of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, the
   Tourcoing School of Fine Arts, the Digital Studios of the Goldsmiths
   University of London, the School of Arts and New Media of the University
   of Hull, and the College of Fine Arts of the University of Shanghai.
   This paper presents a) the gained experience from these actions and b)
   the results and directions for further research towards a complete
   proposal for a future digital creative laboratory structure.}},

Abstract = {{Students need to approach different university across the globe to get
   quality higher education like MS, MBA, Ph. D, Post Ph. D (super
   specialization). The most important hurdle the students face is the
   total awareness about the new courses and different universities where
   they are offered. Secondly, it may be very difficult for a lower
   middleclass / middleclass student has to shell out a lot of money for
   education and other expenses which he/she can't afford. The concept of
   Digital University is a boon to many such students. It is a setup
   towards bringing all the universities under one roof, and student can
   have access to all the details of each university and can then make a
   cognizant decision about their higher education. Apart from providing
   valuable information about globally recognized universities, this will
   definitely shrink the expenses and students can easily get quality
   education right on their desktop.
   Students aspiring for higher education (technical or non-technical) face
   a number of problems.
   Tedious job of hunting many universities and courses across the whole
   world.
   Getting into these universities and to have a course of one's choice is
   not a feasible task.
   Due to their financial problems, they cannot afford the astronomical fee
   and also fending themselves during their stay in the universities.
   In such a situation, Digital University concept comes as a boon to all
   the aspirants. With this new concept, the details of all the
   universities can be accessed by a click of the keys on his/her pc or
   laptop which would otherwise be a very tiresome task. Writing to all the
   universities which have been short listed by a candidate and to get the
   reply and forms from them is another patience testing activity.
   Lastly to avail university courses and to get the quality education
   (technical and non-technical), students don't have to physically be
   present in the campus of the university, and they don't have pay the
   regular sky scraping fees that any institute normally demands (other
   than the admission and examination fees which would really be very
   meager).
   With the concept of Digital University, the students can bid adieu to
   the mind numbing chores.
   This project also brings the ease on the student's pockets wherein the
   students spend only for his/her terminal and the broadband connection to
   get connected with the University where the courses are being conducted.
   It will be the distributed network system or NGN which have different
   type of access modes depending upon the authorities, like the University
   personnel, college management and the end user, i.e. the student.
   ``Education and technology cannot be seen separately. Taking education,
   especially vocational education, to rural India will soon become easier
   through mobile handsets,{''}
   The mobile phone is a great leveler in society as far as dissemination
   of education is concerned.This will prove a new paradigm in imparting
   knowledge to far-flung areas in the country and assist in bridging the
   divide using wireless and mobile technology.{''} As mobile wireless
   network technology becomes widespread, the importance of education about
   this new form of communication is becoming critical.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, integration of multimedia content in higher education has
   been the domain of schools of design, art and communications, with
   little attention given to the use of media in other curricula outside
   these traditional areas. While the advantages of using multiple
   modalities to convey messages and improve learning have been well
   documented, academia has struggled with conceptualizing how practical,
   high-impact content and applications can be used to engage learners and
   improve student retention.
   Compounding issues surrounding institutional adoption of new
   technologies are canonized role expectations. Traditionally, faculty
   achievement has been defined by teaching, research and service; a
   tripartite structure upon which promotion and tenure are based. With
   rigid performance-related expectations in each of these areas, often
   times faculty approach innovation with a high degree of trepidation,
   fearing that when interacting with technology, they will assume a novice
   status, causing significant disruption to the fluid, refined teaching
   styles they have developed over the years {[}1]. Underscoring how
   difficult implementing successful technology can be, a 2008 CDW
   Government survey of CIO's found that 72\% believed the biggest
   impediment to successful technology deployment was faculty buy-in and
   subsequent training. Overcoming such resistance requires that the
   benefits of technology integration must be clearly defined, with
   demonstrable institutional and personal benefits; criteria that can now
   be related to recent calls for accountability and transparency at the
   university and individual levels.}},

Abstract = {{Current trends in the field of Education promote and force a steady
   development of innovation processes. Misunderstood from the womb, these
   processes are developed in the classroom because that is what the law
   prescribes. One wonders if these legislators really think about the
   development of the teaching-learning processes in the classroom and the
   evolution of the actual society when drafting legislation and introduce
   new educational trends and goals to be achieved in different stages of
   the educative system. The protagonists of these processes of innovation
   are those teachers who work in Elementary and Secondary Schools, and
   who, as applicators of the legislation, must develop the principles it
   promotes.
   In order to introduce in our syllabus design innovation processes that
   deal with the prescriptions of the official curriculum and represent, in
   turn, methodological and didactical changes that help students to
   acquire a significant learning, I present an interesting program that
   involves the use of Information Technologies and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) and allows the teaching-learning of two objectives of
   Bloom's taxonomy (1950): application and synthesis. CmapTools is a
   program that empowers the construction and share of knowledge models
   represent as concept maps. It allows the creation of own concept maps in
   the acquisition of learning using a new medium that motivates the
   student and helps him to learn through problem-based learning (PBL).
   The inclusion of computer tools and programs in the development of our
   teaching sessions make possible a fair use of ICT within the
   methodological guidelines that sets the curriculum in the stages of
   Elementary and Secondary Schools. Similarly these technologies can be
   extrapolated and used in Higher Education, especially at this level of
   training because the main goal when training future secondary teachers
   does not deal in how to use them from a technical standpoint, but to
   learn what kind of didactic uses can be make from them, to acquire
   teaching strategies and develop specific methodology along new programs.}},

Abstract = {{Teachers must adapt to the needs of modern society and therefore must be
   impregnated with solid knowledge marked by new trends. Currently, these
   trends are built on the foundations of a digital society that must train
   citizens on the precepts of specific professional and academic
   competences. In Higher Education these competences imply methodological
   changes which, in turn, generate subsequent pedagogical innovation
   processes. Both of them ought to ensure quality in the teaching-learning
   process, whether in virtual or classroom teaching. Therefore, this new
   information age compels us to change education from their first links so
   as to achieve a comprehensive education in the students.
   The new educational reality requires new goals, new skills, new
   abilities, all of them aimed primarily at personal and social
   development of students through the teaching-learning processes, in
   addition to outlining the matters to be taught and the corresponding
   didactics, as well as the interdisciplinary relationship between them,
   especially when designing, planning and evaluating.
   The Bologna Declaration process requires a new teacher's profile. New
   training content is asked to be developed. Future teachers will need to
   know not just specific contents but new models of teaching, where
   e-learning becomes more important as a teaching mode that seems to adapt
   to educative needs. It promotes the presence of experts and resources
   that are unavailable in traditional classrooms. The use of
   videoconferencing requires specific formation in didactic application,
   as well as in the selection of materials to be taught. However,
   educational contexts do not ensure optimization of this resource. A key
   aspect lies in the specific training for its educative use, as it
   presupposes an approach that promotes the integration of academic and
   interpersonal competences and focuses on the development of good
   questioning skills which, indeed, are required to develop teaching.
   The innovation process highlights the use of videoconferencing in the
   new profile of teachers in Bologna process. We will pay attention to the
   factors involved in teaching process, the difficulty that arises when
   trying to train students using this approach and the conditions students
   must have developed before participating in this teaching mode.
   It is clear that the teaching profession can never rest in their initial
   training, especially in an era of rapid changes in scientific knowledge
   and technology. The need for teacher training is an undisputed issue in
   educational settings. It is only raised in scientific debates that deal
   with models that can guide it, a matter of great current interest
   because the challenge taken up by the educative system towards to
   achieve higher levels of quality is linked, among other factors, to
   continuous improvement of initial (pre-service) and continuing
   (in-service) teachers, as educational research supports itself. We can
   state categorically that well-trained teachers, always update their
   skills. Thus, we will observe some key elements in the development of
   pedagogical and didactical innovations within Bologna framework.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a framework for extended digital manufacturing systems
   (EDMS) is presented. It aims at an integrated environment for products,
   production systems and business processes. The reference model of EDMS
   consists of manufacturing entities with different roles and similar
   structures. The main areas of EDMS are modelling, simulation, analysis
   and change management. The integrated activities of EDMS are discussed
   from the viewpoints of augmented intelligence and integrated
   collaboration activities. The theoretical application areas of the past,
   present and future and the process from ideas to innovative solutions
   are presented. A real-life example of an intelligent manufacturing
   environment, in which several aspects of the EDMS framework are
   utilised, is introduced.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the complex relationship between digital
   media, religion, and politics in Egypt since the early 1990s. Charting
   the emergence of a new media landscape - one that is facilitated by
   technological innovations such as mobile telephony, high-speed Internet,
   and small digital cameras - this paper explores how a very strong
   Islamic revivalist trend is capitalizing on the power and reach of these
   new media practices in an effort to develop Islamically inflected models
   of citizenship. The paper argues that such a mediascape is contributing
   to the development of new models of nationalism and civic citizenship in
   Egypt ones that are not orchestrated by the Egyptian State but are
   mediated through oppositional groups, mainly of the Islamist variety.
   The paper aims to chart a map of media practices in Egypt in the past
   two decades, and trace how these practices are informing the rise of new
   notions of citizenship, cultural policy, digital activism, and media
   consumption.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the definition of a
   European perspective on Digital Earth (DE), identify some actions that
   can contribute to raise the awareness of DE in the European context and
   thus strengthen the European contribution to the International Society
   for Digital Earth (ISDE). The paper identifies opportunities and
   synergies with the current policy priorities in Europe (Europe 2020,
   Innovation Union and Digital Agenda) and highlights a number of key
   areas to advance the development of DE from a European perspective: (1)
   integrating scientific research into DE; (2) exploiting the Observation
   Web with human-centred sensing; and (3) governance, including the
   establishment of stronger linkages across the European landscape of
   funding streams and initiatives. The paper is offered also as a
   contribution to the development of this new vision of DE to be presented
   at the next International DE Conference in Perth, Australia, in August
   2011. The global recognition of this new vision will then reinforce the
   European component and build a positive feedback loop for the further
   implementation of DE across the globe.}},

Abstract = {{Several innovative `participatory sensing' initiatives are under way in
   East Africa. They can be seen as local manifestations of the global
   notion of Digital Earth. The initiatives aim to amplify the voice of
   ordinary citizens, improve citizens' capacity to directly influence
   public service delivery and hold local government accountable. The
   popularity of these innovations is, among other things, a local reaction
   to the partial failure of the millennium development goals (MDGs) to
   deliver accurate statistics on public services in Africa. Empowered
   citizens, with access to standard mobile phones, can `sense' via text
   messages and report failures in the delivery of local government
   services. The public disclosure of these reports on the web and other
   mass media may pressure local authorities to take remedial action. In
   this paper, we outline the potential and research challenges of a
   `participatory sensing' platform, which we call a `human sensor web.'
   Digital Africa's first priority could be to harness continent-wide and
   national data as well as local information resources, collected by
   citizens, in order to monitor, measure and forecast MDGs.}},

Abstract = {{At present, the training of professionals in Higher Education challenges
   docents to incorporate in their teaching practice, not only expertise of
   pure disciplinary content, it also calls for associated aptitudes of
   didactic knowledge to guide the disciplinary knowledge. This study
   intends to contribute new teaching methodologies in the form of didactic
   software for Histology students in the Nursing Degree program, Faculty
   of Health Sciences of the Universidad Autonoma De Chile. These
   interactive modules were created as support for traditional classes and
   practical steps with microscopic observation. For the development of the
   first module, a total of 200 images were digitalized in JPG format. From
   those images presentations with personal animation were realized, which
   were then converted to Adobe Flash Player thus creating the first
   software entitled ``Histological Module{''}. We incorporated functional
   information to the initial module of histological preparation in
   addition to concept maps. This innovation was particularly attractive
   and we decided to modify the initial software, thereby creating the
   second program entitled ``Histo-functional Module{''}. To compare
   student perception on both modules a previously validated, voluntary and
   anonymous opinion survey was carried out that included questions on
   factors related to: content, motivation, utility, quality and quantity.
   Responses were evaluated by Likert scale. Results objectively reflected
   the favorable acceptance that the histo-functional Module has had on the
   part of our students. This is probably the result of this software
   integrating knowledge of structures and their function, affording it
   meaning and facilitating learning as well as motivating students in the
   study of histology.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING}},

Pages = {{543-551}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an automated digital image processing technique for
   capturing the microstructure of asphalt concrete (AC) from X-ray
   computed tomography images. It applies to circular cross-section images
   of AC cores of known volumetrics. Its innovation is that it uses the
   volumetric properties as the main criterion for establishing grey-level
   thresholds for the boundaries between air-mastic and mastic-aggregates.
   The algorithm, implemented in MATLAB (TM), involves three stages. The
   first stage involves image pre-processing for contrast enhancement and
   noise removal. The second stage is the main thresholding routine
   accepting as input the enhanced images of the first stage and volumetric
   information for the AC. It consists of two components, namely
   volumetrics-driven thresholding and 3D representation/sectioning. The
   third stage further enhances particle separation through edge detection
   and image segmentation. Examples were provided in imaging actual AC
   cores of known volumetric properties. The algorithm was shown to produce
   realistic rendering of the microstructure of ACs. Their quality is
   suitable for input into numerical simulation.}},

   application demands becomes more variety and instantaneous, the role and
   responsibility for modern surveyors must be examined. Professional
   surveyors nowadays must have both the knowledge and skills to produce
   geospatial data that precisely meet the various application needs and
   correctly convey their understanding about data to domain users to avoid
   wrong decision making. This paper discussed how we include such
   considerations into our curriculum design at the Dept of Geomatics,
   NCKU. During their studies, students are expected to establish a correct
   understanding about the role and responsibility of surveyors and develop
   themselves to be ``solution providers{''} for providing reliable
   geospatial data.}},

   A new approach for the design and fabrication of an acoustic instrument

   3D printing, which has the potential to influence new designs, and to
   lead to new acoustics and ergonomic innovations. This paper describes
   the key concepts of this approach, presenting the development process of
   such a 3D printed instrument-a prototype of a 3D printed concert flute,

Abstract = {{This paper is conceptual and introduces a new transistor layout style
   called FISH SOI MOSFET (FSM). It is an evolution of the Diamond device
   (DSM) and specially designed to preserve the Longitudinal Corner Effect
   (LCE) to increase the resultant longitudinal electric field along the
   channel, that results in an improvement in the average carrier drift
   velocity in the channel. It presents a gate geometric shape similar to a
   ``smaller than (<){''} mathematical symbol. Unlike the DSM, the FISH
   layout style brings an innovative possibility in the lengthening of its
   effective channel length, defined as `` Lengthening of Effective Channel
   Length Effect (LECLE),{''} keeping the channel length with the minimum
   dimension allowed by the SOI CMOS process technology used in
   manufacturing digital ICs applications. It can reduce the die area of
   digital ICs by using the LECLE of the FISH layout structure style by
   combining conventional SOI pMOSFETs and FISH nMOSFETs. Thanks to the FSM
   LECLE, one also can reduce the die area of the current mirrors of analog
   integrated circuits. For the first time, it is shown that LECLE in the
   FSM structure is able to increase the Early voltage and consequently to
   improve significantly the voltage gain of analog ICs. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{Question/Objective: How can a special collection maintain or increase
   its profile in its parent institution, when that parent institution
   emphasizes scientific and clinical learning?
   Setting/Context: The Waring Historical Library, Medical University of
   South Carolina (MUSC), preserves and promotes the history of health
   sciences at MUSC and in South Carolina. As a state entity, MUSC has
   suffered significant budget cuts for the past several years. In this
   climate, the Waring had to find ways to maintain relevance in the MUSC
   community.
   Methods: The Waring partnered with the MUSC College of Nursing to
   explore new ways to build institutional allies. By combining traditional
   archival administration with innovative uses of digital collections
   aimed at institutional promotion and outreach, the Waring's digital
   library became an advocacy tool that led to the Waring's enhanced value
   to its parent institution.
   Outcomes: The Waring Library is a resource for MUSC development and
   alumni relations. Tangible outcomes include additional funding from
   grants, increased staff, no loss of institutional funding, increased
   access to collections, increased accessions, cultivation of
   institutional allies for long-term support of the Waring, and
   development of a template for future partnerships.}},

Title = {{Modeling Urban Flooding by Filtering LiDAR Data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{97-112}},
Abstract = {{The detailed representation of the topography is an important aspect
   when dealing with any flood simulation model. A Digital Surface Model
   (DSM) with fine spatial resolution can capture topographic object
   boundaries with a high level of detail. Light detection and ranging
   (LiDAR) is a technology that can rapidly collect elevation data of a
   relatively large topographic area with fine spatial resolution (<0.5m
   similar to 1m). Information about physical objects on the DSM is
   critical for storm water management as the propagation of flood water is
   influenced by both the terrain and the objects on the terrain. The
   processing of LiDAR data is an important task for generating an accurate
   DSM suitable to running a flood simulation model. Filtering is the first
   step in processing LiDAR data. In the LiDAR community, the term
   ``filtering{''} means the task of separating LiDAR data into ground
   (bare earth) and non-ground points (buildings and trees). However, the
   choice of appropriate filtering algorithm is crucial in order to detect
   micro objects such as boundary walls, fences, and thin embankments that
   have significant impact on the surface flow pattern. This study offers
   an innovative approach for developing a LiDAR filtering algorithm that
   is flexible in nature and able to detect not only buildings and trees
   but also the micro objects. The filtering algorithm is applied to two
   study areas, and the output suggests close correspondence to reality.}},

Abstract = {{Web 2.0 is a term, which is increasingly established in recent years in
   the media landscape, and the development of the digital knowledge
   society has permanently changed: The Internet is no longer just pure
   information medium, but an interactive platform on which the user is
   paramount.The Companies have realized in recent years that knowledge
   management (KM) plays an important role in the success of their
   business. Today is the ability to deal strategically with the knowledge
   and intelligence, become a success factor for companies that are
   dependent for their survival, effectively, efficiently and continuously
   generate innovation. Therefore the company must have deep knowledge
   about their customers and their needs. It is possible to know better the
   customer's pursuits, and to deepen the relationship between the customer
   and the company.Social media is a great way for the companies to
   communicate with its customers. It has allowed the communication between
   them like never before as they discuss about products and their
   likes/dislikes on social media channels.In this Paper we will examine
   how can social software (e.g. Wikis, Weblogs, Facebook, Xing, Twitter,
   etc.) as useful tools for knowledge management and what are the
   opportunities and Challenges with the use of social software for
   knowledge management in marketing.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe one university
   library's use of the Espresso Book Machine (R) (EBM), an innovative
   publishing technology that provides new options for matching content
   delivery to user needs. The paper aims to provide insight into the
   University of Michigan Library's experience with version 1.5 of this
   patented, integrated machine that automates the printing, binding, and
   trimming of softcover books from digital files.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes the machine's
   technology, the Library's impetus for purchase, services currently
   offered and plans for future uses, as well as advantages and challenges
   of owning a machine.
   Findings - Although relatively new and still undergoing refinement, the
   Espresso Book Machine technology can add value to library services by
   providing high quality, cost-effective print options not otherwise
   available to the campus community and beyond. Specific advantages
   include speed, flexibility, access to networked content, and low-cost
   output. Improvements by On Demand Books to the search and display
   capabilities of the EspressNet catalog will be needed in order to
   maximize the catalog's usefulness.
   Research limitations/implications - Apart from a brief discussion of a
   paper published about the University of Utah's Marriott Library
   experience, this paper does not include a survey or report of other
   EBM-owning institutions and ways in which the machines are being used at
   those locations. Experiences may vary among EBM owners based on a number
   of factors.
   Originality/value - Other academic institutions considering the purchase
   of an EBM may benefit from an in-depth report of the University of
   Michigan's experience.}},

Title = {{Role of policies in collaborative design process for digital libraries
   within African higher education}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{678-696}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to explore the role of institutional and
   national policies in the design process of educational digital libraries
   developed collaboratively with key stakeholders within the African
   higher education context.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research project based on
   three case studies of universities in Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Uganda) was
   carried out; comprising a retrospective review of the design process of
   ten innovative digital libraries through 38 in-depth interviews with key
   design stakeholders. The interviews were conducted between September and
   December, 2009, while the data were triangulated with observations and
   documentary evidence from key policies.
   Findings - Institutional and national policies were found to have
   tremendous impact on the design process of digital libraries as well as
   on their sustainability. Their absence in the design process was found
   to stifle innovation.
   Research limitations/implications - This research was limited to the
   design process of digital libraries in African higher education. The
   research findings suggest that policy makers are important design
   gatekeepers and as such digital library designers should actively review
   relevant national and institutional policies, incorporate the
   implications of policies into design processes, and help to develop
   relevant policies.
   Originality/value - The paper provides an understanding of the critical
   impact policies have with respect to supporting the design of
   educational digital libraries that are developed collaboratively with
   stakeholders. The retrospective review of completed digital library
   design processes carried out offers a different methodological approach
   for obtaining a high level understanding of the phenomenon under
   investigation.}},

Title = {{Small businesses in the new creative industries: innovation as a people
   management challenge}},
Journal = {{MANAGEMENT DECISION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-54}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper seeks to present findings from an SME case study
   situated in the computer games industry, the youngest and fastest
   growing of the new digital industries. The study aims to examine
   changing people management practices as the case company undergoes
   industry-typical strategic change to embark on explorative innovation
   and it seeks to argue that maintaining an organisational context
   conducive to innovation over time risks turning into a contest between
   management and employees, as both parties interpret organisational
   pressures from their different perspectives.
   Design/methodology/approach - A single case study design is used as the
   appropriate methodology to generate in-depth qualitative data from
   multiple organisational member perspectives.
   Findings - Findings indicate that management and worker perspectives on
   innovation as strategic change and the central people management
   practices required to support this differ significantly, resulting in
   tensions and organisational strain. As the company moves to the
   production of IP work, the need for more effective duality management
   arises.
   Research limitations/implications - The single case study has
   limitations in terms of generalisability. Multiple data collection and
   triangulation were used to mitigate the limitations.
   Practical implications - The economic contribution of small businesses
   in the new creative industries is widely acknowledged. While the sector
   shows high business birth rates, the business failure rate is equally
   high. This remains of concern for policy makers. This study aims to
   contribute to understanding why businesses in the sector either fail to
   grow or decline.
   Social implications - The economic contribution of small businesses in
   the new creative industries is widely acknowledged. While the sector
   shows high business birth rates, the business failure rate is equally
   high. This remains of concern for policy makers. This study aims to
   contribute to understanding why businesses in the sector either fail to
   grow or decline.
   Originality/value - Few qualitative studies have examined people
   management practices in the industry in the context of
   organisational/strategic change, and few have adopted a process
   perspective.}},

Abstract = {{In the Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) industry, the mayor trends are from
   film and stand alone applications to digital and inline inspection.
   Furthermore the quality requirements are growing driven by pushing
   design and material limits. Especially for field applications based on
   security reasons as well as image quality, replacement of isotopes can
   be monitored.
   With the move to digital the need for small focal spots at increased
   power requirements brought new challenges to the x-ray supplier. With
   the move to inline inspection systems, requirements for high uptime,
   fast throughput at the best possible resolution became the key
   challenges for the x-ray industry.
   The target to replace isotopes brings high challenges for weight size
   and energy.
   The innovation program of COMET delivers solutions for those challenges.
   Comparison between 600 Kilovolts (kV) and conventional 450kV x-ray
   sources will show the advantages in penetration and resolution and with
   this in defect recognition.
   The resolution gain with adaptive focal spots compared to standard focal
   spots will be presented and the advantages of maintenance reduced high
   voltage cables will be shown.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, three necessary relations are cross-analyzed by
   eighteen customers' needs (WHATs) and nineteen corporate i-technological
   measures (HOWs) through the use of the application of the House of
   Quality (HOQ) model of the Quality Function Development (QFD) and a
   comparison of the Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) for
   discussing the contemporary commerce environment. The evaluation that
   contributed the most is the comprehensive methodology and associated
   7-steps measurement of the HOQ model of the QFD are applied in order to
   avoid research arbitrariness, for evaluation comparability and
   linguistic vagueness, which are the pellucid measured characteristics of
   the HOQ models of the QFD regarding the features of complicated
   theoretical concepts, data-collecting processes and computed procedures.
   Specifically, the application of the quantitative entropy methods,
   similar measure and the TOPSIS are utilized in this study to minimize
   the indistinctness of the linguistic exactitude and to decreasing the
   subjective concepts of the five selected customers. According to the
   measured consequences in this study, it is very apparent that
   enterprises have to develop a creative i-technological marketing
   strategy to create an effective and efficient i-technological interface
   in order to achieve the customers' desires consisted of sale
   customization in product concentrated subjective and sale advertisement,
   sale promotion and sale employees in promotion considered session.
   Eventually, some suggestions for managers and researchers are
   inductively formed to further develop the best innovative
   (i-technological) marketing strategy for enterprises in a thriving cyber
   commerce environment.}},

Abstract = {{Presented paper proposes the optimization of the classical method used
   to manufacture the dental work model and its check on the model. In the
   classical method, for obtaining the prosthetic dental work model is used
   a gypsum model and the mobile blunt teeth are obtained by cutting it. In
   order to eliminate the drawbacks of the classical method, in this paper
   are presented the steps of obtaining the mobile blunt teeth using the
   benefits of CAD/CAM technologies. Thus, the prosthetic field obtained by
   3D scanning of the oral cavity is cut virtually resulting individual
   blunt teeth. The digital 3D model of the blunt teeth can be sent to the
   Rapid Prototyping machines or can be processed in order to write the CN
   program that will be sent to CNC machines.}},

Abstract = {{The present analysis aims to radiograph the status of the official Web
   sites for all the municipalities in Romania and, together with the data
   collected from the educational system (I refer here especially to the
   education in the field of IT\&C) to verify if there is a connection
   between these and the development of eGovernment in Romania. It is
   understood that the existence of Web platforms very well maintained
   doesn't imply that they're also used by the citizens or the business
   society. The new methods of administration don't need only innovative
   solutions but also ``intelligent citizens{''} (Stoica 2009). It is not
   only the personnel of public administration that need to benefit from
   IT\&C education, but also those to whom these platforms address (the
   citizens). For a correct development of a system, whatever that might
   be, it's actual status must be examined closely first. This is the
   reason why the test of analyzing it, in its dynamics, starts from a
   horizontal analysis done with the maximum accuracy possible. The data
   obtained in this manner can be used to create models optimum for
   development. In the future, the analysis will transform into a
   longitudinal one, the interest being in repeating it regularly at equal
   time intervals (2 years) and to observe the changes that appear and the
   causes that led to them.}},

Abstract = {{The acquisition of complex knowledge and competences raises difficult
   challenges for the supporting tools within the corporate environment,
   which digital storytelling presents a potential solution. Traditionally,
   a driving goal of digital storytelling is the generation of dramatic
   stories with human significance, but for learning purposes, the need for
   drama is complemented by the requirement of achieving particular
   learning outcomes. This paper presents a narrative engine that supports
   emergent storytelling to support the development of complex competences
   in the learning domains of project management and innovation. The
   approach is based on the adaptation on the Fabula model combined with
   cases representing situated contexts associated to particular
   competences. These cases are then triggered to influence the unfolding
   of the story such that a learner encounters dramatic points in the
   narrative where the associated competences need to be used. In addition
   to the description of the approach and corresponding narrative engine,
   an illustration is presented of how the competence ``conflict
   management{''} influences a story.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces and explores cycles of pre-produsage and
   produsage. It reports on the results from an online ethnographical study
   of the Apple iPad conducted before the public release of the material
   product. Consequently, most users had not physically interacted with the
   device in question. Nevertheless, the release of the technical
   specifications and marketing material generated a massive amount of
   produsage-related online discussion. As such this paper explores the
   concept of pre-produsage. Pre-produsage is a form of predicted or
   expected use, relating to products or services that are only accessible
   to users as a form of representation (e.g. technical specification,
   virtual prototype, and design sketch), but with an added element of
   user-generated design suggestions, conflict coordination, and software
   development. Remediationthe process by which new digital media
   technologies reuses qualities of previous technologies and enters an
   existing media ecologyis a prevalent theme in pre-produsage and involves
   a tension between features that support protracted use and features that
   provide total innovation. The paper argues that an analysis of
   pre-produsage can provide insights that relate to both anticipated and
   actual user experience (UX). More specifically, pre-produsage analysis
   can trace the underlying reasons for a certain problem, intention, or
   concern and connect it to a specific set of features and potential
   solutions. Finally, the paper shows how proprietary products become
   subject to produsage, resulting in artifacts negotiated by cycles of
   produsage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes Ma\_Miss (Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface
   Studies), the miniaturized instrument for spectrometric and
   stratigraphic analysis of sub-soil developed by SELEX Galileo in the
   context of ESA ExoMars mission. The Ma\_Miss experiment is coordinated
   by the Principal Investigator Angioletta Coradini (IFSI-INAF, Rome) and
   is funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).
   The exploration of Mars requires a detailed in-situ investigation of the
   Martian surface and sub-surface. Determining the composition of the
   Martian subsoil will provide a direct indication of the steps through
   which the sample material evolved along geological timescales.
   Ma\_Miss is an instrument fully integrated in the Drill system
   (developed by SELEX Galileo) hosted by a Rover operating on Mars
   surface; Ma\_Miss illuminates the wall of the drill borehole and
   acquires its reflectance signal in the Visible and Infrared (0.4-2.2
   micron) range, analyzes it through a miniaturized spectrometer (20nm
   spectral resolution), and transmits the digital data to the Rover.
   The innovative instrument concept was driven by several key needs,
   related to challenging scientific requirements and extreme environmental
   constraints. Implementation of the concept has required a deep
   interdisciplinary concurrent development in order to solve critical
   aspects of engineering and manufacturing, covering miniaturized
   monolithic optics and novel concept for fiberoptic connectors capable to
   automatically mate/de-mate during the robotic assembly of the Drill
   elements on Mars.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an innovative architecture of an udersampled digitally
   heterodyned stepped frequency GPR is presented. Tipically SFGPR perform
   a quadrature downconversion in the analog domain to detect targets; the
   main disadvantages of this approach can be eliminated by performing it
   in the digital domain. In order to perform such digitally
   downconversion, the echoes of the step frequencies transmitted are
   subsampled with a sampling frequency variable on a step by step basis
   according to rules described hereafter. This approach allows to greatly
   simplify both the transmitting and receiving chains of the SFGPR by
   eliminating a frequency conversion stage.
   The key aspects of architecture presented and its advantages are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic development of technical sciences and information technology
   allows now for acquisition of microscopic images of histological
   sections, not only using digital cameras, but also through specialized
   devices called scanners. The images obtained using scanners and stored
   in a computer storage device are called virtual slides and, together
   with special software, are known as virtual microscopy. The virtual
   slides can be analyzed on a computer monitor by panoramic viewing or
   using a detailed image examination at higher magnification. In many
   research and education institutions in both the US and Europe, the
   virtual microscopy is used for teaching and training purposes. In the
   academic year of 2009/2010, Department of Histology and Embryology,
   University of Medical Sciences in Poznan, as one of the first in Poland,
   has created a virtual database for educational purposes. This database
   has resulted from archiving the traditional images of histological
   slides in the form of digital images. So far, more than 130 virtual
   slides have been acquired and catalogued in 24 thematic folders,
   available for medical students participating in histology, embryology
   and cell biology courses. Telepathology is the second branch which use
   virtual microscopy. Virtual microscope allows to discuss and resolve
   medical/diagnostic problems with the use of telecommunication systems
   and information technology. The existing interne platforms offer access
   to virtual microscopes and virtual slides. In June, 2011 the Center of
   Morphologic Images Archivization and Digital Database of Microscopic
   Pictures in the Department of Histology and Embryology, Poznan
   University of Medical Sciences launch an online platform (www.caom.pl),
   aimed at providing a central database of scanned histological sections
   with images of physiological tissues, and pathological, rare and unusual
   lesions, including tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic inks have been developed for each primary color to serve as
   the imaging fluids for novel electrokinetic display (EKD) technology.
   EKD uses in-plane optical effects and out of plane switching fields to
   switch between color and clear states, allowing a stacked approach of
   color layers for a full-color display. The need for compaction into
   small volumes to achieve a clear state and repeated cycles of spreading
   and compaction creates challenges for the stabilization and charging of
   colorant particles. Surfactants play a critical role in determining
   system behaviors. This paper reports on the latest findings of
   surfactant influence on optical switching and bistability
   characteristics of display performance for some proprietary surfactant
   formulations.
   HP's combination of novel device architecture, proprietary inks, and R2R
   manufacturing platform enables the required attributes for electronic
   media such as low power, transparency, print-quality color flexibility,
   robustness, and scalability at low cost. The innovations described in
   this paper are applicable to either segmented or pixilated electronic
   media, and are currently being developed for both digital signage and
   electronic paper markets.}},

Abstract = {{Using data from 1,176 Italian municipalities in 2005, we identify
   factors associated with the development of eGovernment services supplied
   by local public administrations (PAs). We show that the combination of
   internal competencies and context-specific factors is different when
   explaining decisions to start eGovernment activities vs. the intensity
   of such activities. Municipalities involved in eGovernment are larger,
   carry out more in-house ICT activities and are more likely to have
   intra-net infrastructures than PAs that do not offer front office
   digitized services. They are also generally located in regions having
   relatively large shares of firms using or producing ICTs, where many
   other municipalities offer digitized services, and where population
   density is relatively low. The range and quality of eGovernment services
   supplied by local PAs tend to increase with their stock of ICT
   competencies, their efforts to train workers, and with their ability to
   organise efficient interfaces with end-users. Moreover, there is a
   correlation between the range and quality of eGovernment services
   offered and the broadband infrastructure development in the area where
   local PAs are located.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot study of aerospace design rationale capture methods in civil
   engineering was performed to improve support for information management
   and systems thinking. Deploying software-based methods in complex
   socio-technical environments presents many challenges. Digital tools are
   often force-fit into work in ways that disrupt communication and
   understanding. This study seeks to mitigate potential disruptions
   through careful study of opportunities for innovative, localized
   variations in civil engineering. Data was collected through adaptation
   of existing documents into map-based formats, examination of information
   repositories and informal interviews with engineers exposed to the
   mapping methods on a live project. Results echo previous work comparing
   these industries, highlight current limitations of ``paperless{''}
   visions and point to adapted mapping methods that better fit the civil
   engineering context. Future work will extend this study towards
   developing an effective infrastructure to support more holistic,
   competitive and sustainable design of the built environment.}},

Abstract = {{This research paper presents the design and development of a prototype
   for digital democracy simulation to enhance history learning for middle
   school and high school students. This project seeks to create an
   innovative software package that will serve as a model for democracy
   education in Tennessee and the United States. Through the collaboration
   of professors of computer science and history, historical content from
   Middle Tennessee State University's Gore Center will be digitized and
   manipulated to create an interactive, group-oriented, computer-based
   simulation of how democracy works. In the first phase of this project we
   designed an online computer game that allows students to learn about the
   history of the Civil Rights Bill through the decisions that Senator Gore
   Sr. made. Senator Gore Sr. was a Tennessee Senator during the time of
   the Civil Rights Bill.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing application of backlight illumination in laptops
   used in office, plasma display panels and household appliances such as
   televisions, digital cameras, cameras, etc, highly luminous Cold Cathode
   Fluorescent Lamp(CCFL)is born. The diameter of this type of lamps ranges
   from 1.8 mm to 3.0 mm. It generally uses tricolor fluorescence powder
   and metal like Ni, Ta, Zr, etc, as its cold cathode. The tube works by
   forming glow discharge with highly threshold voltage. Statistics show
   that its recent sales increase 30\% per year. It feathers high
   brightness, high efficiency and low power consumption; can rapid start
   at low temperature; control color temperature accurately; small in size
   and light in weight; tolerate high vibration; can easily process to
   various shapes (straight shape, L-shape, U-shape, toroidal shape, etc);
   decorate well. With the maturity of the LCD technology, CCFL has a wide
   market prospect, remaining 60\% growth per year. Presently, Japan is the
   largest producer of CCFLs occupying about 60\%, followed by Taiwan,
   accounting for 18\% approximately. With the upgrade and transformation
   of our industry, CCFL is widely used. As a consequence, how to increase
   production and decrease cost attracts more and more attention.
   In this paper, beginning with assembly process, based on sufficient
   understand of every process and procedure and control of workshop layout
   and logistics, by investigation of process, collection of database and
   analysis and research, the problem in CCFL producing management is
   analyzed in detail. Furthermore, on the foundation of improvement of
   line balance, the innovation research of CCFL production line gets
   satisfying result.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the structure of knowledge ecosystem based on
   knowbots, as well as the role of knowbots in the process of developing
   ecosystems. There are presented and analyzed the connections which are
   formed within ecosystems by using models based on agents. One of the
   objectives of digital ecosystems consist of overcoming the existing
   barriers and promoting innovative forms of software creation, knowledge
   sharing and creating the communities, thus allowing long term growth and
   competitiveness of small and medium enterprises. The objective of
   achieving self-organization in the digital ecosystem suggests the
   necessity of a capacity of superior reproduction of parts with minimum
   intervention from human agents, thus increasing the number of
   difficulties regarding quality control. Knowledge ecosystems require
   strategic engagement and managerial skill with the goal of combining
   information facilities of intelligent assistance with consolidated
   organizational practices for innovation, learning and interactive
   partnership. As an expanding field, applications of information
   technology and communications are still far from having reached their
   maximum potential. The behaviour of human agents is based on cognitive
   processes. After analyzing cognitive processes, the results may be
   relevant both for the construction of intelligent agents and for
   establishing appropriate correspondences with neurobiological processes.}},

Abstract = {{In the last ten years information security has been recognized as a most
   relevant new trend by academia, government and industry. The need for
   educating information security professionals has increased dramatically
   and is not being met despite recent growth of cyber security programs.
   The challenge is to design and evolve multi-disciplinary curricula that
   provide theoretical as well as hands-on experience and are also
   available to a broad student audience is of strategic importance for the
   future of reliable and secure systems. We present our experience in
   designing and evolving information security programs that have grown to
   over 650 students per year since their inception eight years ago and
   have graduated more than 250 students. We discuss three major directions
   in the evolution of the program: the increased focus of the core and
   growth of concentration electives, the design of cyber law curriculum
   and coordination with the business continuity programs, and the
   introduction of new educational technologies such as virtualization and
   video-collaboration and flexible online and blended delivery formats.
   The rapid growth of the program, the changes in the discipline and the
   great diversity of professional interests of our students required
   broadening of the curriculum with courses and modules on emerging
   technologies such as digital forensics, biometrics, security policies
   and procedures, privacy and security in health care, cyber law, as well
   as the coordination of the curriculum with existing programs in business
   continuity. Special efforts were expended to the introduction of more
   participatory pedagogy, more specifically by developing a series of
   virtual laboratories that brought real world situations into the class
   room and through video-collaboration tools that encourage team building.
   The accessibility of the programs was increased through the introduction
   of flexible delivery formats. After establishing the programs in the
   traditional classroom, we added an blended and online version that
   rapidly found a national audience.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology has supported learning in many different ways as
   improvements in communication, virtual environment embodiment and even
   mobility has allowed remote discussion and collaboration in exploring
   topics and developing ideas. However, learning environments often lack
   validation studies related to the grounding technology being used and do
   not consider creativity as a factor despite being essential for ideas
   generation and innovation processes which push human development.
   Moreover, computer-mediated communication quite often limits the
   effective expression of ideas between peers because technology may be a
   barrier rather than an aid. Taking this into consideration, this paper
   proposes the use of interactive surfaces as a promising technology to
   develop future creative learning environments. An exploratory experiment
   with 22 teenagers has been conducted. The experiment consisted of
   reflection, discussion and creation processes in which participants
   created entities with basic building blocks. The environment based on
   the interactive surface was compared to a completely tangible approach
   based on a tabletop with wooden blocks. A creativity model is used in
   the evaluation in terms of novelty, flexibility and fluency of thinking
   and motivation. The results showed that creations' novelty is
   significantly higher in the digital environment and also higher
   collaboration degree was observed so that this technology should be
   considered in the development of future learning environments to support
   creativity.}},

Abstract = {{Digitalization, one of the greatest creations of modern human history,
   is the technology based on the formal digital, mathematical logic and
   computer language of the 20th century. It is a a special term that is
   used when computer has developed to a certain stage. It has a strict
   definition, referring specifically to knowledge expression and
   transmission by means of computer as the tool and binary code 0 and 1 as
   the carrier to take information, text, image; etc. as its own form.
   Aerobics is a sport very popular with the broad masses while music is
   the soul of aerobics. The digitalization of aerobics is not only the
   innovative concept of aerobics but also the practical sports behaviors.
   The paper, by using computer theories and combining characteristics of
   music creating in aerobics, makes a preliminary study of digital
   technology used in aerobics music creation and composition so as to
   provide the theoretical guidance in this regard.}},

Abstract = {{The use of an innovative, intelligent control algorithm applied to the
   Siemens SGT-300 DLE engine is described. The algorithm ensures stable
   operation and minimises emissions over a wide variation in fuel
   composition.
   The Siemens 8MW class SGT-300 gas turbine has been in operation at the
   University of New Hampshire (USA) since 2006. As well as operating on
   natural gas or diesel, the engine also operates on a gas processed from
   a landfill. These gases have a variable Wobbe Index (WI) covering the
   range 29.7 to 49 MJ/m(3). No modifications have been required to the
   standard DLE combustion hardware. Introduction of the intelligent
   control algorithm has been instrumental in achieving this tri-fuel
   capability. Accumulation of more than 10 000 hours running on
   non-standard fuel has been achieved. The intelligent control algorithm
   exploits knowledge of the stable operating window through continual
   modification of the fuel schedule to avoid both lean blow out and high
   metal temperatures. Operationally, this results in a reduction in the
   NOx emissions, through controlling the unmixedness, and higher engine
   reliability, through the response of the algorithm to flame stability.
   Combining these advantages the control algorithm can deliver reliable
   engine operation on variable composition fuels when using standard
   combustion hardware achieving single digit NOx emissions not only on
   natural gas but also on processed landfill gas.
   This paper describes the control algorithm and presents results of the
   development from high pressure combustion rig and engine development
   test to field operation with both natural gas and processed landfill
   gas.}},

   According to rural ITs development of China, we constructed evaluation

   to pretreat survey data, then input the data into PNN for evaluating
   rural information construction in Sichuan. First, the study reveals only
   a small portion of rural enterprises have access to the Internet, and
   the penetration rate of the Internet in rural enterprises of China is
   much lower than that in urban enterprises revealed by previous studies.
   Second, this study finds that large and old enterprises are more likely
   to have access to the Internet. Thirdly, Internet access demonstrates
   very strong and positive relationships with enterprises' economic and
   innovative performances; though it is not clear whether or not the
   better performance at rural enterprises with Internet access comes from
   their usage of the Internet. The implication of the study is that
   governments should promote Internet usage among rural enterprises.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional reconstructions of bone geometry from microCT
   (computed tomography) data are frequently used in biomechanical and
   finite element analyses. Digitization of bone models is usually a simple
   process for specimens with a complete geometry, but in instances of
   damage or disarticulation it can be very challenging. Subsequent to
   digitization, further imaging techniques are often required to estimate
   the geometry of missing bone or connecting cartilage. This paper
   presents an innovative approach to the reconstruction of incomplete scan
   data, to reproduce proper anatomical arrangements of bones, including
   absent connecting cartilaginous elements. Utilizing geometric
   morphometric tools, the reconstruction technique is validated through
   comparison of a reconstructed 9 year old pelvis, to the original CT
   data. A principal component analysis and an overlay of the two pelves
   provide a measure of the accuracy of the reconstructed model. Future
   work aims to investigate the biomechanical effects of any minor
   positional error on the bone's predicted structural properties through
   the use of finite element analysis.}},

Title = {{Responding to user's expectation in the library: innovative Web 2.0
   applications at JUIT Library A case study}},
Journal = {{PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{452-469}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper seeks to provide an insight into the implementation
   of some of the innovative Web 2.0 applications at Jaypee University of
   Information Technology with the aim of exploring the expectations of the
   users and their awareness and usage of such applications.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study was undertaken at the Learning
   Resource Centre (LRC), Jaypee University of Information Technology
   (JUIT), Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India. The LRC at JUIT serves its
   patrons in supplementing their research needs while creating an ambience
   for teaching, learning and research. The emergence of digital
   technologies and information and communications technology (ICT) tools
   in libraries has encouraged the implementation of a wide range of
   applications, such as digital libraries, video on demand, reference
   services and database services into library services. The advent of
   next-generation web technologies, known as Web 2.0 applications, has
   prompted a number of other pertinent services to be implemented to
   enhance the information literacy skills of the existing services. A
   survey method was used to understand the basic awareness and
   expectations of library users, and the usability of resources.
   Findings - The LRC has made a number of provisions to adopt some Web 2.0
   applications in its library services to create information literacy. The
   users of the JUIT library still lack awareness about various Web 2.0
   applications necessary for teaching and learning.
   Practical implications - The paper suggests that Web 2.0 applications
   can be used effectively to create information literacy amongst users.
   Library and information science (LIS) educators should take advantage of
   advances in the field of ICT and consider the learning preferences of
   information natives as well as information immigrants. Web 2.0 supports
   a constructivist approach to information awareness tools, and has great
   potential to socialise learning and information delivery to a greater
   extent. Web 2.0 technologies should be implemented as a medium of
   information communication, taking into account the pedagogical
   perspectives.
   Originality/value - The case study is a practical application at the
   Jaypee University of Information Technology. The LRC has implemented
   some Web 2.0 applications in the Library. The study was undertaken at
   the university to understand the basic awareness of Web 2.0 and to
   create information literacy amongst users through it.}},

Title = {{A Systematic Review of Research on Live Chat Service}},
Journal = {{REFERENCE \& USER SERVICES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{172-190}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to synthesize the research literature that
   has investigated library-based chat reference service. We define
   library-based chat reference as a synchronous, computer-based question
   answering service where users of the service ask question(s) which are
   answered by library employees or contracted agents. Following the
   methods for conducting a systematic review, we developed inclusion
   criteria for our data set and collected data from research on chat
   service dating from 1995 to January 2010. We limited our data to
   empirical research using established qualitative or quantitative
   methods. The final data set included 59 documents. We used White's
   (2001) digital reference service framework to guide our data analysis
   and unitized the data to the level of the research question(s) asked in
   each of the studies, resulting in 146 research questions. We focused the
   bulk of our analysis on the six categories of the framework where the
   research emphasis was strongest: parameters of the service; clients;
   parameters of the service; questions; question-answering process;
   response guidelines; staffing and training; and mission, objectives,
   statement of purpose.
   Our aim is to analyze the literature on chat service from a broad
   perspective to uncover larger themes and streams of knowledge. We
   believe that this perspective is relevant to those who are currently
   engaged in chat service in some capacity-academics, librarians,
   managers, and IT developers. Our research presents the collective
   knowledge in this area and provides groundwork for researchers as they
   explore new questions related to chat service. It unifies for
   practitioners a collection of findings about chat service to enhance and
   improve their practice. The results suggest areas of opportunity for
   managers who wish to further develop chat as a library service, and the
   results synthesize current understandings about chat service which may
   be useful for IT developers to extend and innovate chat technology in
   libraries.}},

Abstract = {{Starting with the research question, ``How can the Primary School
   Curriculum be developed so as to spark Children's Engineering
   Imaginations from an early age?{''} this paper sets out to critically
   analyse the issues around embedding Engineering in the Primary School
   Curriculum from the age of 5 years. Findings from an exploratory
   research project suggest that in order to promote the concept of
   Engineering Education to potential university students (and in doing so
   begin to address issues around recruitment / retention within
   Engineering) there is a real need to excite and engage children with the
   subject from a young age. Indeed, it may be argued that within today's
   digital society, the need to encourage children to engage with
   Engineering is vital to the future sustainable development of our
   society. Whilst UK Government policy documents highlight the value of
   embedding Engineering into the school curriculum there is little or no
   evidence to suggest that Engineering has been successfully embedded into
   the elementary level school curriculum. Building on the emergent
   findings of the first stage of a longitudinal study, this paper
   concludes by arguing that Engineering could be embedded into the
   curriculum through innovative pedagogical approaches which contextualise
   project-based learning experiences within more traditional subjects
   including science, history, geography, literacy and numeracy.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing manufacturing accuracy requirements enforce the development
   of innovative and highly sensitive measuring tools. Especially for
   measurement with sub micrometer accuracy, the sensor principle has to be
   chosen appropriately for each measurement surface. Modern multi sensor
   coordinate measurements systems allow automatic selection of different
   sensor heads to measure different areas or properties of a sample. As
   example, different types of optical sensors as well as tactile sensors
   can be used with the same machine.
   In this paper we describe different principles of optical sensors used
   in multi sensor coordinate measurement systems as well as a new approach
   for tactile measurement with sub micrometer accuracy. A special fiber
   probe has been developed. The tip of the fiber probe is formed as a
   sphere. The lateral position of this sphere is observed by a microscope
   optics and can be determined to a fraction of a micrometer.
   Additionally, a novel optical set-up now even allows the determination
   of the z-position of the fiber tip with sub micrometer accuracy.
   For this purpose we use an interferometric set-up. The light of laser is
   coupled into the optical fiber. The light, exiting the fiber tip is
   collected by a microscope optics and superposed with a reference wave,
   generated directly from the laser. The result is an interferometric
   signal which is recorded by the camera and processed by a computer. With
   this set-up, the z-displacement of the fiber sphere can be measured with
   an accuracy of a fraction of the used laser wavelength.}},

   up as a result of sophisticated and advanced technology, and at the

   Many medical devices and pieces of equipment are developing at lightning
   speed as a result of digital technologies, which enable new medical
   concepts, strategies, and visions to be implemented faster than ever
   before. This means that developments which previously took a decade to
   implement are now being introduced at a rate of one a year. Technology
   thus not only has a dynamic interrelationship with medicine; it
   influences and shapes modern medical science on the basis of new
   technical possibilities. First-class health care would be inconceivable

Abstract = {{As most developed countries are moving towards the trend of a digital,
   information economy, the role of a national ICT strategy and policy
   becomes an important point that can widely affect the result of such
   transformation. In recent years many growing or recovering economies
   have been fueled by ICT driven innovations provided by ICT professionals
   (Maryska et. al. 2010), which can only happen as long as there is a
   solid foundation for ICT investment, digital readiness, information
   technology education, support for research \& development, as well as
   other aspects. (European Commission 2010, Oskrdal 2010, Pavlicek 2010).
   While most countries and their governing agencies are starting to be
   aware of the need to have a defined ICT strategy and measurement
   indicators, a number of them are still missing one, some don't have the
   necessary agencies with legal mandate to resolve issues of the digital
   age. At the same time, there are countries with a defmed strategy, clear
   organization scheme and a long-term goal of supporting both economic
   competitiveness and well-being of all citizens.}},

Abstract = {{Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is the study of the
   technology used in handling information and its concepts that aids
   communication. It has been identified by many international development
   institutions as a crucial element in developing the worlds' poorest
   countries, by integrating them into the global economy and by making
   global markets more accessible. ICT covers any products that will store,
   retrieve, manipulate, transmits or receives information electronically
   in a digital form. For example, personal computers, digital television.
   It is the basis of all fields of computer applications. It also finds
   usefulness in Management, Science and Engineering. ICT has created
   innovative applications that have lead to making life easier in many
   sectors. In this paper, we have analysis the impact of ICT on computer
   applications and its essentials.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing holds great promise for addressing the barriers that
   keep people with disabilities, low literacy and aging-related
   impairments from fully engaging with technology. However, using
   cloud-based computing to make assistive technology (AT) more widely
   available also raises legal and policy issues. The Americans with
   Disabilities Act, United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons
   with Disabilities, Communications Act, and other disability rights laws
   support increased availability of AT. However, what should the balance
   be between built-in accessibility and cloud-based access? There are also
   limits to the requirements and coverage of these laws, and issues about
   the definition of accessibility as technology develops. Copyright and
   digital rights are potentially implicated by cloud-based AT, as well as
   privacy and security rights. The needed infrastructure and
   interoperability of cloud-based AT may raise concerns for technology
   developers that regulation may stifle innovation or reduce commercial
   viability.}},

Abstract = {{Site-specific inspections and accurate problem identification are
   critical steps before pest control measures are applied, and this
   knowledge is important for the success of an integrated pest management
   (IPM) programme. Besides knowledge of pest biology, structural IPM
   professionals must understand how to develop a site survey and IPM
   measures with a minimal amount of effort. In 2008, the IPM programme in
   Santa Clara County, California, in collaboration with the structural IPM
   service provider, implemented a trial using PDA (personal digital
   assistant)-based software, bar-code scanners, and Web-based applications
   to conduct structural IPM inspections. The successful trial was followed
   by a full-scale adoption in 2009. Adoption of this technology is a move
   from primarily paper-based methods of pest traceability to consolidated
   digital methods that are more immediate and accessible for temporal and
   spatial pest data. In practice, the Internet-PDA-based inspection tool
   collects field observations on a unique hand-held PDA platform. It
   synchronizes those data to an Internet-based server, then allows a data
   modelling tool to track trends, predict and counter potential problems
   before they become serious. The data and reports are then made available
   to Department IPM coordinators/facility managers through desktop
   applications for analysis of pest trends and spatial distribution, and
   rapid response and mitigation efforts. These prioritize habitat
   modification through improvement in structural and landscape designs,
   sanitation, housekeeping and maintenance. Data analysis using digital
   governance tools developed under this public-private IPM partnership
   provides a picture in which improvements can be made to developing and
   promoting better pest management services at reduced risks. The
   development of this important management tool (as well as best practices
   and outreach components) has provided a foundation for continued success
   and improved employee and stakeholder participation. This has set an
   example for other government and non-government agencies and industry.
   Overall, digital governance has helped to monitor pest populations and
   then assisted customers in habitat modifications to solve pest problems
   with no or minimum use of reduced-risk pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a major health concern for the male
   population. Detection and primary diagnosis of PCa are based on digital
   rectal examination, serum prostate-specific antigen levels, and
   transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided random biopsy. Moreover, the gold
   standard for detecting PCa, systematic biopsy, lacks sensitivity as well
   as grading accuracy. This review summarizes recent developments of
   ultrasonography modalities and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) in the diagnosis of PCa. A comparison between the different
   methods is presented, including their clinical value and usefulness. It
   is concluded that innovative ultrasound techniques (including ultrasound
   contrast agents, 3-D and 4-D sonography, elastography and harmonic
   sonography) promise benefits in comparison to standard TRUS to
   accurately diagnose PCa. Promising advances have been made in the
   detection of PCa with multiparametric MRI. The combination of
   conventional and functional MRI techniques (including diffusion-weighted
   imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and MR spectroscopy) can provide
   information for differentiating PCa from noncancerous tissue and can be
   used for MRI-guided biopsies, especially in patients with persistent
   elevation of serum prostate-specific antigen and previous negative
   TRUS-guided biopsies. However, functional MRI technique and MRI-guided
   biopsy remain expensive and complex tools presenting inherent
   challenges. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{The digital turn, and with it increased use of location-aware
   technologies, has yielded innovative image applications and posed new
   questions about the status and value of the image. These applications
   rely on algorithmically defined relations between the viewing subject
   and the world viewed, offering robust alternatives to the visual
   economies of the past. If we take seriously Heidegger's insights
   regarding the Welt-bild as a metaphor for the modern era, the
   algorithmic reconfiguration of subject-object relations in this emerging
   visual regime potentially offers insights through which we can reflect
   upon the current era - and a metaphoric alternative. This article uses
   two entry points to explore this possible reconfiguration and, with it,
   the question of value. Downloadable applications such as Photosynth
   aggregate location-tagged photographs into a near-seamless whole, and
   offer a way to consider such issues as collaborative authorship of the
   image, unstable points of view and the repositioning of subject-object
   relationships - all elements that fundamentally challenge western
   representational norms dominant in the modern era. In this new regime,
   the spatial referents of greatest value are points of uniqueness sought
   out and built upon by the program's algorithms - and not those perceived
   by the viewer. The viewer is in turn free to explore an extensive and
   dynamic image space unconstrained by (and, indeed, without access to) an
   authorised or `correct' viewing position. A second case, built upon
   certain augmented reality applications, works by `recognising'
   particular spaces and, through the use of computationally enhanced
   viewing screens, superimposing new images over real space. In this case,
   a system of virtual spatial annotation depends upon the `correct'
   positioning of the viewer (and portable computing device) in the world.
   The two cases stand in a roughly reciprocal relationship, turning on
   different notions of algorithmic intermediation and subject-object
   relations and dynamics for the generation of meaning and value.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to present possibilities for a renewal of the forest
   sector through innovative services in the value chain of printed
   magazines. The forest industry faces serious problems as digitalization
   affects the use of print products. In order to succeed in competition
   with digital media, the forest industry must examine thoroughly the
   whole value chain and its different roles in finding new possibilities
   for services. One way to emphasize a strong service orientation is the
   adoption of so-called service-dominant logic, which means that customer
   value (value in use) is the starting point of the development. In this
   study, possibilities for new services have been looked for through two
   different topics, one focusing on novel combinations of printed and
   digital content and the other on the launch of a new magazine title.
   Based on the results, there are clear customer needs that could be
   answered by providing knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS).
   Through close co-operation, the paper producer could offer knowledge
   that is very important to the publisher from the viewpoint of printed
   magazines. The publisher would need a more efficient process for
   launching a new magazine title as well as better arguments for promoting
   advertising in printed magazines. Both of these are areas in which the
   paper producer could take a role as a facilitator of innovation.}},

Abstract = {{In this Science Fiction Prototype (SFP) we explore the evolving
   relationship between technology and people. We do this by considering
   what may seem to be two irreconcilable aspirations of the human
   condition; the desire for utilizing ever increasingly sophisticated
   technology in our life whilst at the same time preserving the spiritual
   values that make us human. Superficially it would seem that these two
   forces in our life are pulling us in opposite directions. Can the forces
   of technology and spirituality be balanced in modern life? To
   investigate this issue we invent a future in which nano-computing
   technology is available for sale in many forms. One form is smart-paint
   called ``iSkin{''} which, when painted on surfaces, turns them into
   interactive multi-media mediums. The characters in this story use this
   ``magical{''} paint to create an immersive reality environment, the
   ``WonderHome{''} in which reality and virtuality become confused in an
   intoxicating mix of sensory experiences that causes a madness known as
   ``Obsessive-Compulsive Technophilia Disorder (OCTD){''}. In the story a
   cure to this emerges in the form of the ancient Chinese practice of
   Chan, a form of Buddhism.}},

Abstract = {{Social networks, a new generation of sites that focus these days on
   global networks, Internet users are located. Based on online sites such
   organizations are working and each batch of Internet users with specific
   characteristics make together. Social networks such as media know that
   the possibility of achieving a new way to communicate and share content
   on that have provided the Internet. Social networks can be base of
   Entrepreneurship.
   Hundreds of millions of Internet users are members of different social
   network and hundreds of online activities on this site are passing
   daily. Relations in contemporary vision using digital services can be in
   the form of a network of coherent and integrated development tools as
   social networking or social networking on its website to offer.
   This feature could provide a media for a group of young persons in other
   countries to communicate, makes these networks to become a place where
   culture and customs can be your country to other countries to introduce
   and share leaves. It also introduced ideas to expand the community and
   to talk about it.
   Q \& A Persian platform for scholars is a local or national social
   network in relation to global web media. For Persians who want to have
   close virtual relation to follow their queries and finding suitable
   answers. Queries can be in many fields: math, physics, philosophy,
   literature, computer and others. In this platform (local social network)
   we can see Iranian culture acting not against global culture of networks
   but in parallel.
   Iranian abbreviations, passwords, E-mail, notifications and other items
   are easy to use for Iranians in this platform. A specific example of
   localization ``CHERNAB{''} is produced; local programmed words related
   to Iranian history and culture, not using ``CAPTCHA{''} anymore for
   security of the Persian website.
   In spite of many changes and innovative items using in a localized
   social network, it will help globalized social nets to be improved to
   reach a smaller virtual world.
   Localizing social networks can be extended to all other countries not in
   contradiction to global social networks. Iranian experience in this
   field should be used in overseas with close mutual cultures.
   Localization of social networks can act in parallel to globalization of
   social networks, cultures will be closer and direction will be positive.

Abstract = {{Information retrieval techniques become a challenge to researchers due
   to huge growth of digital and electronic information. Researchers are
   attending this area by developing different techniques to enhance
   precision and recall of retrieved documents. This paper presents an
   information retrieval system that has promising results in terms of
   recall and precision. These results are achieved via developing an
   improved inverted index for the document set and by developing an
   enhanced evaluation function to evaluate the retrieved documents in
   response to user query. Results are compared with two well known
   techniques applied in IR domain which are Okapi-BM25 and Bayesian
   interface network model and show that precision and recall of the
   retrieved documents by the proposed method outperforms these two
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive impairment affects a large proportion of patients with
   multiple sclerosis (MS) and has a profound impact on their daily-life
   activities. Improving the knowledge of the pathophysiology of cognitive
   impairment in MS and of the mechanisms responsible for its evolution
   over time might contribute to development of better outcome measures and
   targets for innovative treatment strategies. Due to their ability to
   detect MS-related abnormalities, MRI techniques are a valuable tool to
   achieve these goals. Following an updated overview of the assessment
   methods and profile of cognitive impairment in patients with MS, this
   review provides a state-of-the-art summary of the main results obtained
   from the application of conventional and modern magnetic resonance-based
   techniques to quantify MS-related damage, in terms of macroscopic
   lesions, as well as involvement of the normal-appearing white matter and
   gray matter and their association with cognitive impairment. The
   possible role of brain cortical reorganization in limiting the clinical
   consequences of disease-related damage is also discussed. Finally, the
   utility of the previous techniques to monitor the progression of
   cognitive deficits over time and the efficacy of possible therapeutic
   strategies is considered. Neurology (R) 2010;75:2121-2128}},

Abstract = {{Digitizing slides and analyzing the resulting images with image analysis
   algorithms has become a standard method to assess staining patterns of
   tissue processed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). An innovative
   peptide-based control slide capable of detecting procedural errors that
   may occur in the analytical phase of the IHC staining process was
   developed. A software application that quantities the peptide spots
   staining intensities and assesses HER2 scoring on cell line and tissue
   microarrays was developed. Slides processed according to standard
   operating procedure and by simulating antibody dilution errors were
   analyzed with this HER2 algorithm. The coefficient of variance (CV) of
   staining intensity for the peptide spots were less than 1\% during the
   reproducibility assessment. Error detection sensitivity of the
   peptide-based control was compared with cell line and tissue-based
   controls. Characteristics that make the developed algorithm robust are
   presented. These studies demonstrate that images generated by the iScan
   (TM) and analyzed by the analysis algorithm are reliable in the
   quantification of the peptide spot staining intensities on HER2 control
   slides. (The J Histotechnol 33(4):153-156, 2010)}},

Abstract = {{We designed a digital underwater video camera system to monitor nesting
   centrarchid behavior in the Tallapoosa River, Alabama, 20 km below a
   peaking hydropower dam with a highly variable flow regime. Major
   components of the system included a digital video recorder, multiple
   underwater cameras, and specially fabricated substrate stakes. The
   innovative design of the substrate stakes allowed us to effectively
   observe nesting redbreast sunfish Lepomis auritus in a highly regulated
   river. Substrate stakes, which were constructed for the specific
   substratum complex (i.e., sand, gravel, and cobble) identified at our
   study site, were able to withstand a discharge level of approximately
   300 m(3)/s and allowed us to simultaneously record 10 active nests
   before and during water releases from the dam. We believe our technique
   will be valuable for other researchers that work in regulated rivers to
   quantify behavior of aquatic fauna in response to a discharge
   disturbance.}},

   an enhanced measuring accuracy in order to assess if there is a strength
   enhancement or not for this class of cellular materials under moderate
   impact loading; (2) The use of digital image correlations to determine
   the strain fields during the tests to confirm the existence of a
   pseudo-shock wave propagation inside the cellular material under high

Abstract = {{We report on new solutions for the evolution of submarine optical
   transmission systems from 10 Gb/s to 40 Gb/s per channel. Today, optical
   coherent detection paired with digital signal processing (DSP) offers
   the opportunity to exploit innovative techniques like polarization
   division multiplexing (PDM). To take full benefit of this disruptive
   technology we propose the PDM-BPSK modulation format that has 0.8
   bit/s/Hz spectral efficiency. This solution presents unparalleled
   robustness to linear distortions, thanks to DSP, and high tolerance to
   nonlinear propagation effects. An experimental demonstration on
   Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Network's 6,300 km straight-line submarine link
   illustrates the performance of this new solution and demonstrates its
   potential to increase total capacity of submarine systems. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The advancement of wireless and mobile technologies has enabled students
   to learn in an environment that combines learning resources from both
   the real world and the digital world. Although such an approach has been
   recognized as being innovative and important, several problems have been
   revealed in practical learning activities. One major problem is owing to
   the lack of proper learning strategies or tools for assisting the
   students to acquire knowledge in such a complex learning scenario.
   Students might feel excited or engaged when using the mobile devices to
   learn in the real context; nevertheless, their learning achievements
   could be disappointing. To deal with this problem, this study presents a
   mobile learning system that employs Radio Frequency Identification
   (RFID) technology to detect and examine real-world learning behaviors of
   students. This study also utilizes each student's responses from a
   two-tier test (i.e., multiple-choice questions in a two-level format) to
   provide personalized learning guidance (called two-tier test guiding,
   T(3)G). The experimental results from a natural science course of an
   elementary school show that this innovative approach is able to improve
   the learning achievements of students as well as enhance their learning
   motivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the Spanish online media market has experienced a deep
   transformation throughout 2007-2009. One of the key factors of change to
   be highlighted is the rise of `native digital' media, which are trying
   to reach their share in a market still dominated by the online editions
   of traditional media. This article analyses these several of the
   initiatives at a national and regional level, such as Soitu. Among then,
   the case of Soitu stands out for its innovative approach, despite the
   fact that it closed down after a two year period. It is argued that
   Soitu's example could be regarded as a point of departure in the Spanish
   `native digital' media.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Cartesian signal decomposition has been the preferred
   representation in baseband polynomial power-amplifier (PA) behavioral
   models, this is not the only 2-D reference frame that could be
   considered for representing the input complex envelope signal. Indeed,
   in this paper, we demonstrate that, if the alternative polar
   representation is considered, the resulting Volterra series model is
   much more adequate to model the physical behavior of PA devices. This is
   the feature that supports the design of an innovative PA model,
   denominated the Polar Volterra model, which is more flexible and general
   than the traditional Volterra series commonly used in PA baseband
   modeling. The closeness of the new model formulation with the PA
   physical operation enabled, for the first time in PA low-pass equivalent
   behavioral modeling, the theoretical derivation of a Volterra series
   model directly from the PA circuit analysis. In fact, as the proposed
   model directly isolates such PA physical characteristics, a significant
   reduction of the number of model coefficients is achieved when compared
   with the traditional Cartesian Volterra model. Finally, validation
   results that highlight the advantages of the Polar Volterra model are
   presented. These were based on the laboratory measurements performed on
   two PAs with distinct architectures: a conventional class-AB amplifier
   and a polar transmitter.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. We examine relationships between information literacy and
   information ecology with regard to conceptual innovation in information
   science. We aim to expand our understanding of human information
   behaviour and relevance assessment in the electronic environment.
   Method. Conceptual analysis and conceptual mapping is used and
   relationships of main concepts are determined in a concept map. Earlier
   empirical research on information behaviour styles and relevance
   assessment using surveys and interviews are synthesized.
   Analysis. Two information styles (pragmatic and analytic) are
   characterized. Relevance assessment in the electronic environment is
   analysed. Relevance is considered as part of information literacy.
   Examples of students' information horizons and a concept map of
   relevance are given.
   Results. Ecological dimensions of information literacy are determined at
   semantic (relevance), visual (information horizon, concept maps) and
   behavioural and social levels (information styles). A model of
   ecological dimensions of information literacy is outlined based on
   triangle of values, tools and communities. Recommendations for
   development of students' information literacy are presented at levels of
   information seeking and relevance assessment.
   Conclusions Implications for information literacy development in the
   electronic environments and for information and educational strategies
   are derived. Relevance assessment should be actively trained as part of
   information literacy and guided inquiry. Ecological dimensions of
   information literacy can be used in new models of e-learning and digital
   libraries.}},

Abstract = {{In this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new
   type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. The
   layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of
   physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of
   devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology.
   We posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the
   ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. We develop (1) a
   conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of
   digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for
   digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate
   information technology infrastructures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the cross-country diffusion of personal computers
   (PCs) and the Internet, and examines how the diffusive interactions
   across these technologies affect the evolution of the global digital
   divide. We adopt a generalized diffusion model that incorporates the
   impact of one technology's installed base on the diffusion of the other
   technology. We estimate the model on data from 26 developing and
   developed countries between 1991 and 2005. We find that the codiffusion
   effects between PCs and the Internet are complementary in nature and the
   impact of PCs on Internet diffusion is substantially stronger in
   developing countries as compared to developed ones. Furthermore, our
   results suggest that these codiffusive effects are a significant driver
   of the narrowing of the digital divide. We also examine the policy
   implications of our results, especially with respect to how
   complementarities in the diffusion of PC and Internet technologies might
   be harnessed to further accelerate the narrowing of the global digital
   divide.}},

Abstract = {{Three Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland and Norway, participated in the
   IEA SITES 2006 study. All the three countries have launched huge policy
   and investment programmes to promote digital literacy and readiness for
   the information age. In relation to the remarkable Finnish Programme for
   International Student Assessment (PISA) results, it is interesting to
   see if the Finnish school system may be better suited to ground and
   contextualize pedagogical practice with Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) than the Danish and Norwegian counterparts. One main
   difference is that the Finnish system seems to anchor decisions about
   and interpretations on how ICT should be utilized stronger at the local
   level than the two other systems. One of the general goals in the policy
   programmes is to get teachers to innovate with ICT in the classrooms.
   The Second Information Technology in Education Study (SITES) 2006
   indicators for two innovative pedagogical orientations, lifelong
   learning orientation and connectedness are utilized to compare teachers
   from the three nations. The main findings is that Finnish teachers are
   either not differing or they are scoring significantly lower on the two
   indicators than teachers from Denmark or Norway. The exception is
   Finnish science teachers who are more inclined towards using ICT in
   lifelong learning practices than their Danish and Norwegian
   counterparts. Generally, the Finnish teachers seem to be more autonomous
   in their pedagogical choices but may also be more conservative than the
   Danish and Norwegian teachers in making use of ICT.}},

Abstract = {{The continued advancements in information and Internet technology
   stimulate innovations and diversified developments in the field. of
   digital learning. Among these, the emerging field of ubiquitous learning
   is gradually attracting the attention of researchers; the key difference
   between u-learning and m-learning lies in the aspect of ``situation.{''}
   Some studies showed that situated learning stimulates the establishment
   of learning impressions and learning experiences. On the other hand,
   some studies found that learning English through reading sentences or
   articles instead of the typical vocabulary-based system promotes
   learners' understanding of the connection between Words, the contextual
   meaning of words, and the methods of organization and expression. For
   this reason, this study proposes a mobile English reading learning
   system that integrates ``contextual information{''} and ``situated
   learning.{''} The system adopts RFID to detect the immediate location of
   the learners and then not merely provides the learners with English
   articles that are highly related to their location and situation but
   also provides them with reading support in words, sentence, paragraph,
   and article levels. Moreover, this study introduces three advanced
   indicators for developing learning strategies based on the learning
   portfolio. This study also conducted a comprehensive performance
   evaluation on both learning performance and system acceptance rate.}},

Abstract = {{Some digital business models may be so innovative that they overwhelm
   existing regulatory mechanisms, both legislation and historical
   jurisprudence, and require extension to or modification of antitrust
   law. Regulatory policies that were developed in response to nineteenth-
   or twentieth-century antitrust concerns dealt principally with economies
   of scale leading to monopoly power and may not be well suited to the
   issues of network effects or third-party payer online business models
   such as sponsored search. From the perspective of information systems
   economics, we investigate if such third-party payer digital systems
   require intervention as profound as the government's innovative approach
   to the problems posed by AT\&T in the 1913 Kingsbury Commitment,
   establishing the first private regulated monopoly. Google provides an
   example of a company whose innovative digital business model is
   difficult to fit into current regulatory frameworks, and may provide
   examples of the issues that might require an extension to regulatory
   policy.}},

Abstract = {{This longitudinal study was aimed at increasing our understanding of how
   teachers learn. It was conducted within a national innovation programme
   in secondary education. During one year 94 teachers reported six
   learning experiences using digital logs. The learning experiences were
   content-analysed in terms of learning activities and learning outcomes.
   The former comprised six main categories, namely experimenting,
   considering own practice, getting ideas from others, experiencing
   friction, struggling not to revert to old ways, and avoiding learning
   the first two categories being reported most frequently. Reported
   learning outcomes referred to changes in knowledge and beliefs,
   emotions, practices, and intentions for practice, with changes in
   knowledge and beliefs being reported most frequently and changes in
   teaching practices being reported rarely. Learning activities were
   associated significantly with all measures of learning outcomes. Type of
   learning environment was significantly associated with learning
   activities and learning outcomes. Results are discussed with respect to
   ways of fostering teacher learning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: Direct measurement of mammographic x-ray spectra under clinical
   conditions is a difficult task due to the high fluence rate of the x-ray
   beams as well as the limits in the development of high resolution
   detection systems in a high counting rate environment. In this work we
   present a detection system, based on a CdTe detector and an innovative
   digital pulse processing (DPP) system, for high-rate x-ray spectroscopy
   in mammography.
   Methods: The DPP system performs a digital pile-up inspection and a
   digital pulse height analysis of the detector signals, digitized through
   a 14-bit, 100 MHz digitizer, for x-ray spectroscopy even at high photon
   counting rates. We investigated on the response of the digital detection
   system both at low (150 cps) and at high photon counting rates (up to
   500 kcps) by using monoenergetic x-ray sources and a nonclinical
   molybdenum anode x-ray tube. Clinical molybdenum x-ray spectrum
   measurements were also performed by using a pinhole collimator and a
   custom alignment device.
   Results: The detection system shows excellent performance up to 512 kcps
   with an energy resolution of 4.08\% FWHM at 22.1 keV. Despite the high
   photon counting rate (up to 453 kcps), the molybdenum x-ray spectra,
   measured under clinical conditions, are characterized by a low number of
   pile-up events. The agreement between the attenuation curves and the
   half value layer values, obtained from the measured spectra, simulated
   spectra, and from the exposure values directly measured with an
   ionization chamber, also shows the accuracy of the measurements.
   Conclusions: These results make the proposed detection system a very
   attractive tool for both laboratory research and advanced quality
   controls in mammography. (C) 2010 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{The use of small animal models in basic and preclinical sciences
   constitutes an integral part of testing new pharmaceutical agents prior
   to commercial translation to clinical practice. Whole-body small animal
   imaging is a particularly elegant and cost-effective experimental
   platform for the timely validation and commercialization of novel agents
   from the bench to the bedside. Biomedical imaging is now listed along
   with genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics as an integral part of
   biological and medical sciences. Miniaturized versions of clinical
   diagnostic modalities, including but not limited to microcomputed
   tomography, micromagnetic resonance tomography,
   microsingle-photon-emission tomography, micropositron-emission
   tomography, optical imaging, digital angiography, and ultrasound, have
   all greatly improved our investigative abilities to longitudinally study
   various experimental models of human disease in mice and rodents. After
   an exhaustive literature search, the authors present a concise and
   critical review of in vivo small animal imaging, focusing on currently
   available modalities as well as emerging imaging technologies on one
   side and molecularly targeted contrast agents on the other.
   Aforementioned scientific topics are analyzed in the context of cancer
   angiogenesis and innovative antiangiogenic strategies under-the-way to
   the clinic. Proposed hybrid approaches for diagnosis and targeted
   site-specific therapy are highlighted to offer an intriguing glimpse of
   the future. (C) 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{In this paper modeling and simulation is discussed in the context of
   distributed manufacturing systems (DiMS). The DiMS concept aims towards
   efficient and innovative collaboration that integrates design and
   development activities of manufacturing systems. A DIMS, described
   formally as a digital manufacturing system, is a competent basis for the
   modeling and simulation of manufacturing systems. The activities of the
   simulation model are described on the basis of a service-oriented
   approach in which content of the services is completely known. Micro,
   meso, and macro manufacturing levels are applied to the modeling and
   simulation. By means of these levels the hierarchy of the communication
   of the services is illustrated. An example is described in which
   modeling and simulation is used to proceed from ideas to efficiently
   operated manufacturing systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A new planar MOSFET structure is proposed through a simple layout change
   which modifies the gate geometric shape from rectangular to hexagonal in
   order to use the corner effect concept to enhance the resultant
   longitudinal (parallel) electric field drift velocity of mobile carriers
   in the channel drain current transconductance Early voltage and
   on-resistance in comparison to the equivalent conventional parameters
   This paper is conceptual and performs a comparative analyzes between
   conventional and Diamond Partially-Depleted SOI nMOSFETs by 3D numerical
   simulations to understand the advantages and disadvantages of this
   innovative device compared to the conventional counterpart keeping the
   same gate area geometric factor and bias conditions A simple analytical
   model for the drain current was pro posed and tested for the Diamond
   transistor Since we found better results of the Diamond SOI nMOSFETs we
   believe that this innovative layout can be a new alternative for analog
   and digital integrated circuit applications for whatever area it may be
   needed without any extra burden to the current technology This layout
   approach can also be applied for any planar or 3D transistors

Abstract = {{Carpet manufacturers certify their products for end-use applications by
   evaluating the wear behavior of their carpets in mechanical experiments.
   Currently, this process is performed by visual inspection, suffering
   from subjective gathers that limit reliability. To automate this
   process, we propose the use of image processing techniques, specifically
   of local binary pattern (LBP) statistics. Such statistics are tolerant
   against illumination changes, can be easily implemented, and perform
   well when combined with a symmetrized adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler
   divergence. As a main innovation, we extend the existing rotationally
   invariant LBPs by including `mirror' and `complement' invariants. We
   show an accurately improved and more reliable estimation of the degree
   of wear in worn carpets. The evaluation is performed on four digital
   reference scales, each containing eight pairs of images comparing
   transitional degrees of wear to the original appearance. Additionally,
   the texture changes due to distortions of the pile yarn tufts are
   enhanced by choosing a suitable scale factor per reference. We validate
   the findings using six physical reference scales, each containing four
   pairs of images. In both references, linear correlations of over 0.89
   are demonstrated between the degrees of wear and extracted features from
   the images. These findings justify the use of the proposed LBP
   extensions in a first approach towards an automated low-cost inspection
   system for carpet wear at low computation cost.}},

Title = {{Innovation and Reduction in Contemporary Qualitative Methods: The Case

Journal = {{SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ONLINE}},

Abstract = {{During the course of this paper we mobilise an ideal typical framework
   that identifies three waves of reduction within contemporary qualitative
   inquiry as they relate to key aspects of the sociological tradition. The
   paper begins with a consideration of one of sociology's key questions;
   namely how is social organisation possible? The paper aims to
   demonstrate how this question moves from view as increased
   specialisation and differentiation in qualitative methodology within
   sociology and related disciplines results in a fragmentation and
   decontextualisation of social practices from social orders. Indeed, the
   extent to which qualitative methods have been detached from sociological
   principles is considered in relation to the emergence of a reductionist
   tendency. The paper argues that the first wave is typified by conceptual
   couplings such as `discourse and the subject', `narrative and
   experience', `space and place' and the second by `activity type
   couplings' such as `walking and talking' and `making and telling' and
   then, finally, the third wave exemplified through auto-ethnography and
   digital lifelogging. We argue each of these three waves represent a
   series of steps in qualitative reduction that, whilst representing
   innovation, need to reconnect with questions of action, order and social
   organisation as a complex whole as opposed to disparate parts.}},

Title = {{Shifting gears higher - digital slides in graduate education - 4 years
   experience at Semmelweis University}},
Journal = {{DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The spreading of whole slide imaging or digital slide
   systems in pathology as an innovative technique seems to be unstoppable.
   Successful introduction of digital slides in education has played a
   crucial role to reach this level of acceptance. Practically speaking
   there is no university institute where digital materials are not built
   into pathology education. At the 1st. Department of Pathology and
   Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University optical microscopes
   have been replaced and for four years only digital slides have been used
   in education. The aim of this paper is to summarize our experiences
   gathered with the installation of a fully digitized histology lab for
   graduate education.
   Methods: We have installed a digital histology lab with 40 PCs, two
   slide servers - one for internal use and one with external internet
   access. We have digitized hundreds of slides and after 4 years we use a
   set of 126 slides during the pathology course. A Student satisfaction
   questionnaire and a Tutor satisfaction questionnaire have been designed,
   both to be completed voluntarily to have feed back from the users. The
   page load statistics of the external slide server were evaluated.
   Results: The digital histology lab served similar to 900 students and
   similar to 1600 hours of histology practice. The questionnaires revealed
   high satisfaction with digital slides. The results also emphasize the
   importance of the tutors' attitude towards digital microscopy as a
   factor influencing the students' satisfaction. The constantly growing
   number of page downloads from the external server confirms this
   satisfaction and the acceptance of digital slides.
   Conclusions: We are confident, and have showed as well, that digital
   slides have got numerous advantages over optical slides and are more
   suitable in education.}},

Title = {{Process evaluation of appreciative inquiry to translate pain management
   evidence into pediatric nursing practice}},
Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Appreciative inquiry (AI) is an innovative knowledge
   translation (KT) intervention that is compatible with the Promoting
   Action on Research in Health Services (PARiHS) framework. This study
   explored the innovative use of AI as a theoretically based KT
   intervention applied to a clinical issue in an inpatient pediatric care
   setting. The implementation of AI was explored in terms of its
   acceptability, fidelity, and feasibility as a KT intervention in pain
   management.
   Methods: A mixed-methods case study design was used. The case was a
   surgical unit in a pediatric academic-affiliated hospital. The sample
   consisted of nurses in leadership positions and staff nurses interested
   in the study. Data on the AI intervention implementation were collected
   by digitally recording the AI sessions, maintaining logs, and conducting
   individual semistructured interviews. Data were analysed using
   qualitative and quantitative content analyses and descriptive
   statistics. Findings were triangulated in the discussion.
   Results: Three nurse leaders and nine staff members participated in the
   study. Participants were generally satisfied with the intervention,
   which consisted of four 3-hour, interactive AI sessions delivered over
   two weeks to promote change based on positive examples of pain
   management in the unit and staff implementation of an action plan. The
   AI sessions were delivered with high fidelity and 11 of 12 participants
   attended all four sessions, where they developed an action plan to
   enhance evidence-based pain assessment documentation. Participants
   labeled AI a `refreshing approach to change' because it was positive,
   democratic, and built on existing practices. Several barriers affected
   their implementation of the action plan, including a context of change
   overload, logistics, busyness, and a lack of organised follow-up.
   Conclusions: Results of this case study supported the acceptability,
   fidelity, and feasibility of AI as a KT intervention in pain management.
   The AI intervention requires minor refinements (e. g., incorporating
   continued follow-up meetings) to enhance its clinical utility and
   sustainability. The implementation process and effectiveness of the
   modified AI intervention require evaluation in a larger multisite study.}},

Abstract = {{Many areas of science such as biology, medicine and oceanography are
   becoming increasingly data-rich and most programs that train scientists
   do not address informatics techniques or technologies that are necessary
   for managing and analysing large amounts of data. Educational resources
   for scientists in informatics are scarce, yet scientists need the skills
   and knowledge to work with informaticians and manage graduate students
   and post-docs in informatics projects. The Marine Biological Laboratory
   houses a world-renowned library and is involved in a number of
   informatics projects in the sciences. The MBL has been home to the
   National Library of Medicine's BioMedical Informatics Course for nearly
   two decades and is committed to educating scientists and other scholars
   in informatics. In an innovative, immersive learning experience, G.Y., a
   biologist and post-doc at Arizona State University, visited the Science
   Informatics Group at the MBL to learn first hand how informatics is done
   and how informatics teams work. Hands-on work with developers, systems
   administrators, librarians and other scientists provided an invaluable
   education in informatics and is a model for future science informatics
   training.}},

Abstract = {{Matter and Interactions (M\&I) has recently been adopted as a novel
   introductory physics course that focuses on the application of a small
   number of fundamental physical principles to the atomic and molecular
   nature of matter. This study investigated how five physics teaching
   assistants (TAs) developed professional knowledge for teaching from
   their teaching experiences. Specifically, we explored what experiences
   influenced their knowledge development for teaching the innovative
   introductory physics course, M\&I. Through a qualitative, multiple case
   study research design, data was collected from multiple sources:
   non-participant observations, digitally recorded video, semistructured
   interviews, TAs' written reflections, and researchers' field notes. As
   TA's progressed through the semester, two experiences emerged as having
   a significant role in their development of knowledge for teaching M\&I:
   (1) setting teaching, learning, and curriculum goals for their classes;
   and (2) encountering dilemmas of teaching and learning. The results of
   this study will contribute to future preparation of the innovative
   introductory physics course as well as other college level science
   courses.}},

   comparison between out-vessel and in-vessel active coils}},

Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of innovative feedback schemes for control of dynamo
   tearing modes (TMs) in reversed field pinch (RFP) devices, the
   possibility of placing active coils between a non-conducting first wall
   and the vacuum vessel is investigated with a MHD based model. In this
   formulation the vacuum vessel plays the role of a stabilizing shell.
   With active coils placed outside the vacuum vessel and magnetic sensors
   located inside it, a previous study (Zanca 2009 Plasma Phys. Control.
   Fusion 51 015006) has shown that the ratio between the TM radial field
   amplitudes at the sensors' radius and at the resonant surface can be
   made close to but not smaller than the ideal-shell limit. This analysis
   considered a continuous-time modelling of the feedback. The same model
   admits a very appealing solution when applied to the in-vessel coil
   configuration: for high gains the radial field measured by sensors
   located between the first wall and the coils is reduced virtually to
   zero and the TM rotation frequency approaches the unperturbed natural
   value. In this case the feedback would mimic the stabilizing action of
   an ideal shell placed at the sensor radius. An improvement which makes
   the model closer to a realistic digital feedback is also presented. This
   is realized by introducing a discrete-time feedback action which
   includes a non-zero latency time. Unfortunately, the nice solution for
   in-vessel coils becomes unstable for realistic TM amplitudes when
   passing to the discrete-time feedback. In contrast the feedback of
   out-vessel coils is robust to time discretization, except when the
   vacuum vessel time constant becomes very small. This analysis indicates
   that future RFPs should rely on feedback systems of out-vessel coils.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative approach for initiating processes of a
   transactive memory system in newly formed groups of experts
   collaborating computer-supported in a complex problem-solving task. Our
   empirical study compared 15 experimental and 15 control groups, each
   consisting of triads. In the experimental condition, the triads were
   provided with a tool for fostering knowledge and information awareness,
   that is, being informed about the knowledge and the underlying
   information of the collaboration partners in form of digital concept
   maps. In the control condition, the groups had no access to this tool.
   Results confirmed the potential of the tool to initiate processes of a
   transactive memory system: shared agreement of the knowledge of the
   other group members' knowledge proved to influence group performance
   positively. In addition, previous findings of the tool's potential to
   establish knowledge and information awareness and to augment group
   performance could be replicated. However, the postulated mediating
   effect of processes of a transactive memory system concerning the impact
   of knowledge and information awareness on group performance did not
   reach statistical significance. Aspects for future studies and
   implications of these findings regarding their practical implementation,
   for example, in teams of organizations, are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study is to investigate experimentally the
   development of bedforms in a configuration where the sediment supply is
   limited. The experimental setup is a rectangular closed duct combining
   an innovative system to control the rate of sediment supply Q(in), and a
   digitizing system to measure in real time the 3D bedform topography. We
   carried out different sets of experiments with two sediment sizes (100
   mu m and 500 mu m) varying both the sediment supply and the water flow
   rate to obtain a total of 46 different configurations. After a transient
   phase, steady sub-centimeter bedforms of various shapes have been
   observed: barchans dunes, straight transverse dune, linguoid transverse
   dunes and bedload sheets. Height, spacing, migration speed, and mean bed
   elevation of the equilibrium bedforms were measured. For a given flow
   rate, two regimes were identified with fine sediment: (i) a monotonic
   increasing regime where the equilibrium bedform height and velocity
   increase with the sediment supply rate Q(in) and (ii) an invariant
   regime for which both parameters are almost independent of Q(in). For
   coarse sediment, only the first regime is observed. We interpret the
   saturation of height and velocity for fine sediment bedforms as the
   transition from a supply-limited regime to a transport-limited regime in
   which the bedload flux has reached its maximum value under the
   prevailing flow conditions. We also demonstrate that all experiments can
   be rescaled if the migration speed and height of the bedforms are,
   respectively, divided and multiplied by the cube of the shear velocity.
   This normalization is independent of grain size and of bedform
   morphology. These experimental results provide a new quantification of
   the factors controlling equilibrium height and migration speed of
   bedforms in supply-limited conditions against which theoretical and
   numerical models can be tested. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This brief presents an innovative control law for a distributed dc
   generation supplied by a dc power source, here, a fuel cell (FC)
   generator. Basically, an FC is always connected with a power-electronic
   converter. This kind of system is a nonlinear behavior. Classically, to
   control the voltage, the current, or the power in the converter, a
   linearized technique is often used to study the stability and to select
   the controller parameters of the nonlinear converter. In this brief, a
   nonlinear-control algorithm based on the flatness property of the system
   is proposed. Flatness provides a convenient framework for meeting a
   number of performance specifications on the power converter. Utilizing
   the flatness property, we propose simple solutions to the system
   performance and stabilization problems. Design controller parameters are
   autonomous of the operating point. To validate the proposed method, a
   prototype FC power converter (1.2-kW four-phase boost converters in
   parallel) is realized in the laboratory. The proposed control law based
   on the flatness property is implemented by digital estimation in a
   dSPACE 1104 controller card. Experimental results with a polymer
   electrolyte membrane FC of 1200 W and 46 A in the laboratory corroborate
   the excellent control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The decrease of IC feature size and the increase of operating
   frequencies require 3-D electromagnetic methods, such as the partial
   element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method, for the analysis and design of
   high-speed circuits. Very large systems of equations are often produced
   by 3-D electromagnetic methods. During the circuit synthesis of
   large-scale digital or analog applications, it is important to predict
   the response of the system under study as a function of design
   parameters, such as geometrical and substrate features, in addition to
   frequency (or time). Parameterized model order reduction (PMOR) methods
   become necessary to reduce large systems of equations with respect to
   frequency and other design parameters. We propose an innovative PMOR
   technique applicable to PEEC analysis, which combines traditional
   passivity-preserving model order reduction methods and positive
   interpolation schemes. It is able to provide parametric reduced-order
   models, stable, and passive by construction over a user-defined range of
   design parameter values. Numerical examples validate the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the effect of competition on product innovation in
   the market for digital cameras during the years 1998 to 2001 The
   analysis is based on a structural dynamic model that is estimated and
   used to simulate the innovation behavior of firms in counterfactual
   environments The model features hetero geneous consumers who time
   optimally purchase goods depending on the expected evolution of the
   prices and the characteristics of available cameras On the supply side
   firms Introduce new camera models and choose their characteristics
   accounting for the dynamic value of new products and the optimal dynamic
   behavior of consumers The counterfactual simulations imply that an
   increase in competition in the industry would not have generated better
   products on average and depending on the type of competition would have
   generated products with lower average quality (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All

Abstract = {{Background: With the rapid development of information science, the
   ancient Traditional Chinese Medicine is combining with it rapidly, and
   forming a new discipline: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
   Informatics. TCM information digitalization is the process of digital
   processing, which uses modern information technology to obtain, process,
   store, and analyze TCM-related data, information, and knowledge. It
   gathers research, application development, and service in an integrated
   whole.
   Methods: This article systematically analyzes the key research issues of
   TCM informatics (e.g., on data resources, data standard, data system
   construction). Also, the methodology and technology of TCM information
   digitalization research are thoroughly discussed.
   Conclusions: The starting point of the research on traditional Chinese
   medical information digitalization was in question. The research from
   the current study research was drawn from collected information that was
   stored, transferred, and utilized. This process helped to place an
   emphasis on the topic, as well as extending its research areas. In
   addition, an innovative TCM information virtual study center was set up
   to support a great deal of fundamental work.}},

Abstract = {{Can retro media make us relive the virtual from digital media? Following
   McLuhan's thesis that the proper characteristics of a medium are
   revealed through remediation, it could well be that retro media
   re-enacting digital media can make explicit what the concept `virtual'
   entails. Two recent works analyzed in this article take as their
   starting point antique theatrical techniques (the ballet pulley, the
   panorama) to evoke optical illusions, not to stage another illusion but
   for other purposes. Both works, which have no actual connection with
   cyberspace, include non-narrative interplay with antiquated
   technological installations that generate a challenging experience for
   the contemporary spectator in a digital era. The
   performance-installation I / II / III / IIII by Kris Verdonck stages a
   repetition in time in which the viewer gets trapped. By reviving virtual
   features into real ones and presenting them in replay-mode, the viewer
   discovers how a variation of sameness can evoke significant differences,
   or how identity arises due to a repetition in time. Hans Op de Beeck's
   installation Location (6) displays an all-round view in a real but
   generic space that induces the spectator's performative power like an
   avatar, able to dwell in the virtuality of personal imagination.
   Robrecht Vanderbeeken has published on a variety of topics, including
   metaphysics, philosophy of technology, and aesthetics. Formerly a
   researcher in the Theory Department of the Jan van Eyck Academy, he now
   teaches at the Royal Academy of Fine Art at University College Ghent
   (KASK), and is currently researching the philosophical implications of
   technological innovations in art and culture.}},

Abstract = {{The ATLAS Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeters are high precision, high
   sensitivity and high granularity detectors. A total of 182,468 signals
   are digitized and processed real-time on detector, to provide energy and
   time deposited in each detector element at every occurrence of the
   L1-trigger. The current readout electronics will need to be upgraded to
   sustain the higher radiation levels expected with the increase of a
   factor 10 in luminosity at the LHC in the years similar to 2017. A
   completely innovative readout scheme is being developed. The front-end
   readout will send out data continuously at each bunch crossing through
   high speed radiation resistant optical links, the data will be processed
   real-time with the possibility of implementing trigger algorithms.
   This article is an overview of the R\&D activities and architectural
   studies the ATLAS LAr Calorimeter Group is developing: front-end analog
   and mixed-signal ASIC design, radiation resistance optical-links in SOS,
   highspeed back-end processing units based on FPGA architectures and
   power supply distribution schemes. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is the most common complication of
   cataract surgery, occurring in up to 50\% of patients by 2-3 years after
   the operation {[}Spalton in Eye 13(Pt 3b):489-492, 1999]. This paper
   proposes a new approach for the assessment of PCO digital images. The
   approach deploys an unsupervised learning technique for clustering image
   pixels into different regions based on chromatic attributes. The
   innovative aspect of this paper lies in proposing the number of regions
   in a clustered image as a measurement tool for assessing the PCO.
   Experiments using synthetic data confirmed the plausibility of this
   approach. A series of experiments conducted on real PCO images
   demonstrated the robustness and stability of the proposed algorithm.
   Finally, the comparison of our method's assessment with medical expert
   evaluation reveals a very reasonable concordance.}},
