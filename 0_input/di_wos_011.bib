Abstract = {{The product life cycles of electrical appliances and electronic devices
   impact society and the environment, given the hazardous portion present
   in their materials flow. Scrapping as an industry serves to decommission
   end-of-life (EOL) equipment, linking materials processing and recovery
   activities with recycling, but must be controlled against adverse
   environmental and human health safety factors. This work tracks an
   on-going effort-the Agbogbloshie Makerspace Platform (AMP)-to use
   participatory design methods to upgrade capabilities of the scrap,
   recycling and maker community located at Agbogbloshie in Accra, Ghana
   through co-creation of technology. The authors explain AMP's aim to
   reconceptualize Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE or
   e-waste) as Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE or 3E): not as
   waste, but as inter-manipulable assemblages of 3E-materials. AMP seeks
   to employ a hands-on Makers and Development approach (M\&D) as a
   collaborative process to drive interclass innovation by co-designing and
   fabricating a makerspace, or open community workshop and lab, and
   networking e-waste and scrap recyclers starting at Agbogbloshie with
   students and recent graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts
   and Mathematics or STEAM fields. The investigation at Agbogbloshie over
   a period of 24 months suggests opportunities for utilizing participatory
   design to leverage waste management and 3E-materials processing across
   informal sector recycling ecosystems as inputs for popular prototyping,
   i.e. peer-to-peer digital fabrication and distributed manufacturing.}},

   the issue of dementia and aims at enabling family and carers to use ICT
   devices in order to help people with memory loss sustain the activity of
   the memory function and maintain good quality of life for as long as
   possible. The article introduces the most important steps of the course
   (technicalities, such as: programmes to use, necessary devices, making
   the drafts of the video, as well as the editing and evaluating
   processes) which lead to its main outcome: the creation of digital
   resources. The personalised video films produced consist of visual and
   oral materials, chosen by the person with memory loss, their carers and
   family. These materials may be further used to stimulate the brain
   activity of the person with memory loss.}},

Abstract = {{The new trends in automotive electronics such as autonomous driving,
   in-car smartphone-like infotainment, privacy and security, and all
   electric cars, require an entirely different vision than is pursued
   today. Georgia Tech sees unprecedented challenges and opportunities to
   address these needs because of disparate set of technologies that
   hitherto fore thought to be impossible to integrate. It proposes a
   systematic approach to system scaling, heterogeneous integration and
   innovative package architectures as the new era in electronics hardware
   with particular focus in electrical, mechanical and thermal designs and
   new digital, RF, sensors, millimeter wave and power technologies. The
   Georgia Tech team proposes a transformative and yet a strategic approach
   to automotive electronics, called System Scaling, leading to entire
   automotive system-on-a package. Such a system must integrate many
   disparate technologies such as high speed digital, optical, RF and
   wireless sensing and data processing from 100s of sensors as well as
   ultra-high power electronics. Georgia Tech proposes a highly innovative
   large panel-based, ultra-thin glass packaging in 3D double-side
   architecture with many, many innovations in designs, materials,
   processes, wiring lithography, fine-pitch and highly conductive
   through-vias for thermal management and system integration. Such an
   approach is proposed to lead to highly-functional systems with disparate
   set of technologies at lowest cost, in smallest ultra-miniaturized size
   with shortest interconnections with lowest power consumption. Georgia
   Tech views this approach to be superior to current approaches such as
   chip-first or wafer fanout or chip-last organic, leadframe and molded
   packaging technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid innovations in the area of digital things and Information
   Communication Technology are driving rapid deployment of Internet of
   Things (IoT) around the globe. Device to Device communications (D2D) in
   IoT are envisaged through various protocols such as Constrained Access
   Protocol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and MQTT-SN
   (for sensor networks). One of the major concerns in the deployment of
   IoT is to ensure the security of devices and D2D communications.
   Besides, existing communication protocols for IoT are devoid of security
   features. To address this, we propose a secure version of MQTT and
   MQTT-SN protocols (SMQTT and SMQTT-SN) in which security feature is
   augmented to the existing MQTT protocol based on Key/Ciphertext
   Policy-Attribute Based Encryption (KP/CP-ABE) using lightweight Elliptic
   Curve Cryptography. Further we demonstrate feasibility of SMQTT and
   SMQTT-SN protocols for various IoT requirements through simulations and
   evaluate their performance.}},

   erbium-doped fiber laser with sub-ring cavities based on a digital
   Opto-digital-micro-mirror device (Opto-DMD) processor is proposed and
   experimentally demonstrated. 3-channel tunable SLM lasing were obtained
   simultaneously by means of the Opto-DMD processor without any
   mechanically shift, which is the unique feature and innovative point of
   3-channel laser. The DMD processor can select and couple any waveband
   from the gain spectrum of the EDFA into the main fiber ring, which can
   guarantee the multiple-channels laser output. Different short passive
   sub-ring cavities are inserted into the main ring cavity for each
   channel and serve as mode filters, to make SLM lasing. The experimental
   results demonstrate the side-mode-suppression-ration (SMSR) is about
   similar to 40 dB, and the output power is more than similar to 9.5 dBm
   in the operating range. The center wavelength and power fluctuations are

   significant economic losses. Monitoring and diagnosis provide an
   effective way to detect the potential fault. However, the traditional
   approach is often limited for the concurrent potential multi-fault, and
   is also prone to make serious diagnostic deviation due to its definite
   thresholds. Predicated on this background, this paper is inspired by the
   innovative engineering model and then proposes an improved model to
   diagnose the multi-fault of power transformer accurately. Through this
   way, it aims to present a more efficient approach than the previous
   ones. Specifically, the new multi-fault diagnosis method can realize the
   transition from the precise quantitative numerical value to the
   qualitative evaluation concept, which is described as digital
   characteristics. Consequently, the collected data can be analyzed by the
   reasoning rules in the perspective of qualitative cloud concept. Once
   the relationship between the fault type and the cloud concept is
   determined, the diagnosis results can be deduced from the characteristic
   gas with different contents which has already been converted to the
   qualitative concept. A case study proves the feasibility and validity of
   the proposed model, and offers a new way for the multi-fault diagnosis
   of power transformer.}},

Abstract = {{Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm is used to generate
   image features which is very essential for object recognition, feature
   detection, image matching etc. This paper proposes an optimized hardware
   architecture for realizing the SIFT algorithm with reversible logic
   prototyped using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The digital
   hardware logic has been implemented with reversible and fault tolerant
   capabilities at significant design sections substituting the adder and
   multiplier functions which is one of the first of its kind of
   implementation of this application needed for designing energy efficient
   systems such as SoC (System on Chip) based robotic vision system.
   Reversible logic is emerging as an important research area for low power
   CMOS design, DSP applications and battery operated embedded systems
   meant for image processing. The reversible logic is implemented using
   our new proposed RFT (Reversible Fault Tolerant) gates (which is
   reversible as well as fault tolerant) that is used to design a new
   innovated adder circuit. The new adder circuit uses very less hardware
   resource which is again substituted with minimum complexity reversible
   gate. The proposed design shows invariancy to various image parameters
   such as scale, rotation, viewpoint and noise unlike other state of the
   art works. Moreover our design can process a frame of resolution
   640{*}480 in 15 millisecond, at a rate of 64 frames per second which
   meets the real time video rate constraint, what represents a speed up of
   415x compared to the software execution of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Digital, an amalgamation of social, cloud, mobility and analytics, is
   being widely used by enterprises for building innovative business
   applications. In digital applications, there is a healthy tension
   between `business' and `IT', leading to a rapidly evolving digital
   application. Often, digital applications have many stakeholders,
   requiring a role-based access and visualization of data. There is an
   emphasis on user experience. Due to such characteristics, a visual
   approach, for documenting and validating requirements is required. While
   this creates a better connect between business users and business
   analysts, it makes testing more difficult. In this paper, we present a
   rationale for visual requirements of digital applications, and then
   present a graph-model based approach for automated generation of test
   cases from visual requirements.}},

   measurement using a laser scanner is presented in this paper. The
   surface profiles of the falling materials delivered from the rotary
   chute at various titled angle in the filling operation of the blast
   furnace in China Steel Corporation (CSC) were digitized during the
   course of burden discharge. Based on the rigid body transformation and
   the invariant features, 3D image registration algorithm was applied to
   find out the transformation between the measurement and the blast
   furnace. Afterwards, the developed data processing method was employed
   to determine the quadratic curve representing the surface profiles of
   the falling materials. Consequently, the trajectories standing for the
   moving paths of the raw materials were evaluated to provide valuable
   information for preventing blast furnace wall from serious worn-out as
   well as establishing burden distribution strategies for better
   productivity and stability.}},

Abstract = {{South African communities are constantly being developed through new ICT
   projects and technologies which are initiated by individuals, government
   and private organisations. The problem with these developments is that
   they are implemented in isolation. This isolation causes limited sharing
   of resources, duplication, poor-governance of the resources, and in
   worse-case scenarios, failure of these projects is realised before their
   intended purposes. The smart community centre model that could be used
   to address these problems by focusing on the Siyabuswa Educational
   Improvement and Development Trust (SEIDET) community centre for
   experimentation purposes has been proposed. This model followed a
   descriptive analysis of ICT related work spanning over two decades
   performed within the SEIDET context, including the ongoing SEIDET
   Digital Village. The benefits of this smart community centre model
   include community and rural development through sharing of scarce ICT
   resources. It could further provide support for entrepreneurs through
   training interventions, action-based research for policy development as
   well as spawn local innovation and free-sharing of resources and
   services. This model can further be adapted to any local community, as
   it is designed using the international studies and theories. This paper
   presents the design of the smart community centre model. The design is
   described using Practice Theory concepts towards an empirical study that
   will be conducted using the General Morphological Analysis methods to
   corroborate aspects of practices. The scenario of how these theories
   could be practiced within the SEIDET centre is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of the new generation of Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)s
   to convert from a digital signal directly into high frequency bands can
   be seen as a large leap in capability allowing greater system
   flexibility, reduction in component footprint and power consumption.
   This paper presents a new high speed, high bandwidth Digital to Analog
   Converter with high sample rate and high output bandwidth which enables
   the direct conversion of signals to frequencies up to band X. The
   component features a number of innovative design features which enable
   the optimization of performance in the different Nyquist zones. These
   include various output shaping schemes and interface methods. Results
   will be presented which show the performance of the circuit at output
   frequencies greater than 8GHz.
   The component's performance can result in highly flexible and waveform
   agile Radar signal generation systems.}},

   of Siberia and the adjacent regions is based on the supposition that the
   articulatory-acoustic database being an attribute of ethnicity is a
   potential historical and linguistic source in the reconstruction of
   ethno-genetic processes.
   Instrumental methods have been used by the Novosibirsk phoneticians in
   the study of sound systems since the late 1960s. Since 2009, researchers
   from the three institutes of the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy
   of Sciences both of a philological and medical profile have been
   conducting a comprehensive interdisciplinary study of
   articulatory-acoustic bases of indigenous Siberian populations, using
   Magnetic-Resonance Imaging, digital Roentgenography and
   Laryngography(1). An electronic database including somatic material on
   46 idioms (languages, dialects and sub-dialects) has been created. The
   results of the study made adjustments to the traditional view of
   scientists about the Genesis of the autochthonous minority ethnic groups
   and their languages.}},

Abstract = {{Frequently described as the oil of the digital economy, data is today
   fervently sought after and its innovative use demonstrated in
   increasingly wide-ranging applications. To use data however, data users
   would first have to find them. In the realm of public / open data, there
   are often governmental and non-governmental agencies that consolidate
   and provide such data to users via centralized web portals. However, the
   equivalent is not available for datasets from the private sector, where
   data providers currently operate in highly-siloed environments. Data
   users seeking data but unfamiliar with the industry sector of interest
   have no straightforward mechanism to do so. This paper proposes
   Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) - a cloud-based, federated (peer-to-peer-like)
   dataset discovery platform based on open-source software, which allows
   for private sector data providers to increase visibility of their
   datasets to be discovered by unfamiliar data users. We explain the
   considerations behind the proposed dataset discovery platform and
   demonstrate it in a real-life pilot implementation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports that useful search applications can be developed
   around ``One-Touch-Character{''}, a simplified method using digit keys
   originally developed for display-free touch-tone-telephones. Several
   input methods created in Japan have transformed into cultures
   characterized by their specific operations. ``One-Touch-Character{''},
   one of the oldest methods, was born in 1990s and is seen as obsolete in
   the smartphone era. This paper introduces and compares input methods
   developed over the last 25 years. The drastic changes in appearance and
   features, from touch-tone telephones to smartphones through mobile
   phones, have strongly influenced input style. Though young people learnt
   quickly and became experts, those who could not catch the innovations
   became IT illiterates. To help them become positive users, we return to
   ``One-Touch-Character{''}. After investigating several different
   databases, we clarify what database characteristics suit
   ``One-Touch-Character{''}.}},

   problems in current production caused by changing of the markets and the
   global influence and general competition situation. Utilization of the
   progress achieved in the information and communication technologies are
   expected in the future for many manufacturing companies. This leads to
   the increasing and consistent integration of Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) into the production systems in smaller
   and smaller subsystems and components. Cyber-Physical System will be
   more and more involved in production systems. Mechatronic systems become
   cyber-physical systems through additional communication skills and
   autonomy in behavior on external influences and internally stored
   settings. In the Cyber-Physical Production System, the horizontal
   integration through value networks and the vertical integration through
   networked manufacturing systems can be built to realize smart factory
   and smart production. In a laboratory environment at the Experimental
   and Digital Factory at the Chemnitz University of Technology, an
   innovative logistical system is built up to apply the horizontal and
   vertical integration into practice for research investigations. A
   research question to be answered is how the communication between
   components in this system related to the horizontal and vertical

Abstract = {{Digitalization of businesses and society at large requires continuous
   and more elaborate reflection on business models and has become a
   critical business success factor. Business model meta-models have become
   important tools for their description, explanation, and decisions on
   them. In future they will serve as universal management frameworks and
   reference for all business decisions. However, this requires Business
   Model Management System (BMMS) for comprehensive software-support. We
   identify the key factors in the development of such BMMS and describe
   how they influence its development. We provide a manifesto for BMMS and
   apply a design science approach to the development of a BMMS prototype.

Abstract = {{The reason why smart home remains not popularized lies in bad product
   user experience, purchasing cost, and compatibility, and a lack of
   industry standard{[}1]. Echoing problems above, and having relentless
   devoted to software and hardware innovation and practice, we have
   independently developed a set of solution which is based on innovation
   and integration of router technology, mobile Internet technology,
   Internet of things technology, communication technology,
   digital-to-analog conversion and codec technology, and P2P technology
   among others. We have also established relevant protocols ( without the
   application of protocols abroad). By doing this, we managed to establish
   a system with low and moderate price, superior performance,
   all-inclusive functions, easy installation, convenient portability,
   real-time reliability, security encryption, and the capability to manage
   home furnitures in an intelligent way. Only a new smart home system like
   this can inject new idea and energy into smart home industry and thus
   vigorously promote the establishment of smart home industry standard.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new methodology for digital design properties
   extraction from simulation traces. The innovated methodology is based on
   a new data mining technique guided with static analysis of the intended
   design. The mining engine of the proposed methodology is based on
   innovated Breadth-First Decision Tree (BF-DT) search algorithm. The data
   structure of each node in the decision tree is handled to well present
   sub-space of the input simulation traces data space. Besides, new
   features are added to BF-DT to enhance its performance in both output
   sequential assertions and time of search. A new static analysis
   technique is innovated to extract all the combinational and sequential
   data dependencies between the digital design signals. The mining engine
   is guided with these data dependencies to extract complete combinational
   and sequential design properties relating signals desired to extract
   properties for and their cone of interest signals. The contributed
   mining technique has been tested for bit-level designs with different
   sizes. The design properties generated from the mining engine completely
   match with all design properties covered in the input simulation traces.
   Plus, the generated properties are at the highest possible level of
   abstraction leading to the best coverage for the input data space. The
   simulation results show that the proposed methodology has proven
   superior efficiency in extracting bit-level assertions of digital design
   in a feasible time. The next challenge is to include word-level
   assertions as well.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, the physical (PHY) layer of communication systems
   has evolved with the addition of techniques such as orthogonal frequency
   division multiplexing (OFDM) and multi-carrier aggregation. This has
   resulted in significant performance improvements, but it has come at the
   cost of increased power consumption and system complexity. To overcome
   this problem, a wide range of new Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols
   have been proposed for wireless networks. However, the speed of
   innovation in MAC protocols has not been able to keep up with the fast
   pace of PHY layer research; the latter being fueled by the availability
   of a variety of Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms. These systems
   have eventually made their way into the classrooms and labs, thus giving
   communication engineers an experiential learning opportunity. They have
   provided students cost effective options to acquire real-world signals
   and analyze them using digital signal processing techniques. In essence,
   this has done for communications engineering students, what the sound
   card did for students learning audio signal processing. On the other
   hand, computer science students have been left with the option of
   learning about MAC protocols only through text books or by using
   software simulations. This is because most SDR systems do not meet the
   stringent latency and performance requirements required for creating
   real-world communication links; and the few that do are priced out of
   reach for classroom sizes typically found in Indian engineering
   colleges. In this paper, we analyze this situation at hand and discuss
   the emergence of a new design space for MAC layer prototyping systems.
   This paper discusses the key requirements, namely latency, processing
   speed, and cost, of systems in this design space. Finally, this paper
   describes how availability of commercial technology and careful
   trade-off with other requirements, such as throughput and frequency
   agility, is making it feasible to design a system that meets these key
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{The wide use of ePortfolio (electronic portfolio) in higher education
   has been a great technological innovation. Currently, the ePortfolio is
   essentially used as a tool of learning and assessment, but less as a
   tool of orientation. The aim of our work is to provide IT tools to
   monitor, support and orientation for students in the academic and
   professional world. ``The use of the portfolio as part of the
   orientation approach must engage the learner to develop a reflection on
   him, his education and career aspirations. The tool should be designed
   to promote reflection on the orientation process implemented for each
   learner. ``(Duroisin, 2011). In this paper we propose a computerized
   system which allows not only the assessment of skills, but also acts as
   a monitoring and orientation ePortfolio of learners. Based on the Mahara
   technology `` ISIFePortfolio{''} (Bentaib, et AitDaouad, 2014) is an

Abstract = {{Mobile phones is one of the most preferred digital devices in
   constituting a large part of our daily lives in particular. Using of the
   mobile phones with technical innovations has become more common for this
   group named as generation Z. Creating a new and different social
   environment with sharing the private life in social websites like as
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. has reach a level that is closer to
   their social life than real life. It has been believed that smart phone
   usage especially in these generations has become an addiction and is
   considered that this situation has an effect to great extent on their
   social life and psychology. The aim of the study is to analyze mobile
   addiction of generation Z and how this addiction impacts in their social
   and individual lifes. In this study, the determination of the importance
   of factors that affect the mobile dependence of the generation Z and
   whether has an impact of the generations Z's social lifes or not, was
   evaluated by creating a new scale and utilizing a variety of scales in
   literature. This research was done with university students aged 18-23
   is composed of a sample consisting of 276 persons. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This project is the second phase of the research already presented in
   Foritaal 2013. The project consists of two specific parts: (1) The
   presentation of a Green Smart House System model made up of assisted
   living environments according to different levels of complexity, defined
   by its architectural and technological components, as well as furniture
   and everyday objects. (2) The presentation of case studies that propose
   projects for systems, components, technology elements, furnishings and
   objects of use for users with varying degrees of physical ability. The
   objective of this project was to identify the design elements essential
   to support new systems and methods of assistance, in the context of
   their own discipline of design, and to help users with different degrees
   of ability and/or disabling diseases. The project is based on the
   integration of the components of design products with innovative digital
   technology (ITC, AAL, home automation) in order to define new housing
   systems that are both integrated and interactive. This research project
   uses the definition of spaces, objects and components as its points of
   reference, designed in an inclusive (For All) and sustainable way that
   are technologically implemented with digital systems to assist in the
   daily activities of the user. The expected result consists of a series
   of concepts that can be developed and proposed as a progression of the
   current components available for this type of housing context.}},

   field flanked by technology and art. DevArt, a website run by Google,
   gives coders the opportunities to express themselves creatively as

   Our main claim is that DevArt has the potential to follow the success of
   mobile application stores such as Google's Android Market. In our view,
   DevArt replicates the central elements behind the mobile application
   store's success by implementing the open platform and open source
   development approach for free innovations. Considering its potential

Abstract = {{Innovative Method for Installing Pipe Depth Smart Test Stations at
   Exelon Nuclear Generation Stations to Quantify Corrosion Rates, Evaluate
   Cathodic Protection Effectiveness, Quantify Corrosion Potentials and
   Perform Subsurface Soils Analysis to Support Aging Management Plans and
   Reasonable Assurance Commitments on In-Service Buried and Underground
   Pipe and Tanks
   For several decades ANSI and NACE direct assessment (DA) standards for
   monitoring cathodic protection and coating quality (SP0502) have been
   relied upon by pipeline operators and regulators to accurately monitor
   the impact of corrosion on transmission pipelines. These same standards
   have been proven far less useful when deployed in nuclear power plant
   subsurface environments.
   In order to meet regulatory and industry commitments the challenge has
   been to develop a cost effective method to accurately monitor nuclear
   plants' buried pipe. The in-scope pipe is comprised of a dense complex
   of multiple systems in close proximity at depths sometimes exceeding
   30-ft. Most nuclear plants have been in service for over 30 years and
   rely on original buried pipe systems to perform as designed. These
   systems are manufactured using various metals, which are bonded together
   to reduce electrical step and touch potential hazards. Each of these
   factors reduce the confidence factor of DA, but combined they make the
   procedure even less effective.
   Smart Monitoring Test Stations can be installed without excavation at
   depths of up to forty feet directly into the subject pipeline local
   environment. This provides access to critical condition and assessment
   information that was previously unavailable. Smart test stations have
   been designed with the following components: two Electrical Resistance
   Probes (ER), two CP coupons and a stationary reference electrode.
   This paper will describe the planning and obstacles encountered during
   the installation, operation and interpretation of data from recent
   experiences related to the the installation of test stations at Exelon
   Nuclear Generating Stations. We will describe the process from planning
   to successful completion including:
   Smart Monitoring Test Station features and function
   Value of precise location insertion of probes
   Digitizing plant buried and underground pipe and tanks
   Smart monitoring test station site location selection
   Push probe method to capture soil samples
   Analyzing and interpreting soil samples
   Evaluating potential impacts from groundwater
   Push probe method of installing smart test stations at or near pipe
   depth
   Monitoring data from test stations

Abstract = {{The Virtual TAU (Tel Aviv University) initiative
   (http://moodle.tau.ac.il) was launched in the year 2000, aimed at
   fostering and stimulating a process by which instructors and students
   would use the internet to enrich prevailing learning processes and make
   traditional instruction more efficient and flexible. After a decade of
   intensive implementation, Virtual TAU aims to: enrich campus-wide
   academic instruction at TAU; use innovative ICTs in academic instruction
   to improve the quality of learning and teaching; promote research in the
   field of online-learning; and contribute to society by offering open
   online courses to the general public (MOOCs: Massive Open Online
   Courses). Virtual TAU focuses on three main pillars: developing and
   providing conceptual, pedagogical models for online-learning; providing
   training and technical support for instructors and students via
   workshops, one-to-one meetings, seminars, help-desk, on-line tutorials,
   and a support Web site; and research and assessment. In the 2012/13
   academic year, approximately 2,700 lecturers incorporated roughly
   500,000 web learning items in close to 6,000 course sites. During the
   same time period, the system counted approximately 30 million entries to
   Virtual TAU by 30,000 students and approximately 2,000 simultaneous
   student entries. Research and assessment are ongoing activities within
   Virtual TAU. The presentation will describe the innovative strategic
   program of Virtual TAU, focusing on the evolving addition of mobile
   technologies to the academic learning environment; developing innovative
   pedagogical online academic models using emerging technologies for TAU
   students and for the public (MOOCs); and integrating social network
   applications into the learning environment to enrich the learning
   experience. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {{Chang Jung Christian University and National Hsin-Feng Senior High
   School cooperated in hosting a series of teacher training camps,
   teaching module design discussions relating to Team-Based Learning (TBL)
   and green geothermal energy in 2012. The teaching program began in
   September 2013, focusing TBL on ``green energy{''}. Coupled with field
   visits, guest lecturers, and participation in competition, the teaching
   program aims to strengthen the learning effectiveness of students, and
   emphasize digital technology and hands-on module experience. Four
   cross-disciplinary senior high school teachers were invited to apply TBL
   methodology in innovative teaching and learning of geothermal energy.
   The teachers raises questions to trigger group discussion and in-class
   discussion on the principle and practice of energy use in daily life, as
   well as the establishment of energy-saving facilities. After
   self-learning, students then shared their learning experience with other
   students. Finally, the feedbacks and suggestions by the students and
   teachers on the TBL methodology are provided for a reference for TBL in
   the future. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access

   For the last decade they have gone through significant technological

   China. Method: by studying the demand of HFE, analyzing the hotspot and
   trend and learning the successful application of HFE, the systematic and
   scientific model of HFE technology system was built. Result
   (Conclusion): an explicit definition of HFE technology was given, and a
   tree-structure model of HFE technology system was presented. The
   first-order leaf nodes represented three technology directions (research
   directions) to which seven technology themes (research themes) in the
   second-order leaf nodes were attached, and the third-order leaf nodes
   were 31 technology contents (research contents) that belong to the
   technology themes, and the fourth-order leaf nodes were key technologies
   for solving the specific problems or research methods in the technology
   contents. A quantitative evaluation of TRL, TAL, and TUL was given and a
   general evaluation of HFE technology level was also made.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of digital communication technologies, we are
   required to re-define the term literacy as ``multimodal literacy{''}.
   The current generations, as digital natives, are literate not only in
   the conventional sense but in an innovative way which involves texts
   with static and dynamic images, gestures, audio, spoken language and
   written language. Citizens of today need to be able to comprehend
   meaning that is constructed through two or more communication modes.
   Likewise, it is equally important that teachers of the digital world
   need to possess multimodal literacy knowledge and skills. The teachers
   should be able to comprehend and interpret multimodal texts, and
   effectively design and communicate meaning through such texts and
   finally need to transfer this knowledge and skills to their students.
   This quantitative study aims to investigate multimodal literacy levels
   of 383 pre-service English language teachers at Gazi University, Turkey.
   The multimodal literacy of prospective teachers are assessed through the
   Multimodal Literacy Scale developed by Bulut, Ulu and Kan (2014) and the
   scores are evaluated in terms of gender, grade, and other background
   features such as internet use and parents' education level. Conclusions
   are drawn and suggestions are made for the English language teaching
   programs. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of a morphing blade to change its geometry according to the
   different operating conditions represents a challenging approach for the
   optimization of turbomachinery performance. In this paper experimental
   and CFD numerical analyses on a morphing blade for a heavy-duty
   automotive cooling axial fan are proposed.
   Starting from the experimental results proposed in the first part of
   this work, a morphing blade, made of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) strips
   embedded in a polymeric structure, was thoroughly tested. In order to
   assess the ability of the strips to reach a progressive and smooth shape
   changing evolution, several experiments were performed in a
   purpose-built wind tunnel. The morphing blade changed its shape as the
   strips were thermally activated by means of air stream flow. The bending
   deformation evolution with the increasing number of thermal cycles was
   evaluated by digital image analysis techniques.
   After the analyses in the wind tunnel CFD numerical simulations of a
   partially shrouded fan composed of five morphing blades were performed
   in order to highlight the evolution of the fan performance according to
   air temperature conditions. In particular, the capability of the blade
   activation was evaluated by the comparison between the fan performance
   with non-activated blades and with activated blades.
   The results show a progressive stabilization of the shape memory
   behavior after the first cycle. The blade deformation led to a
   significant improvement in fan performance at a constant rotational
   velocity. The CFD numerical simulation points out the differences in the
   overall performance and of three-dimensional fluid dynamic behavior of
   the fan.
   This innovative concept is aimed at realizing a sensorless smart fan
   control, permitting (i) an energy saving that leads to fuel saving in
   the automotive application fields and (ii) an increase in engine life
   thanks to a strong relationship between the engine thermal request and
   the cooling fan performance.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to traditional methods in product development, the
   increasing availability of two new 3D digital technologies, namely
   digital manufacturing (3D-printing) and digitizing of surfaces
   (3D-scanning), offer new opportunities in product development processes
   today. With regard to the systematic implementation of these
   technologies in the education of students in the field of product
   development, however, only a small number of approaches exist so far.
   This paper explores several ways in which 3D digital technologies can
   productively be used in design education. The innovative aspects here
   include that the students assemble and install the 3D-printers
   themselves, and that they are introduced to an approach that combines
   3D-scanning followed by 3D-printing. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{One major goal of the Rethinking Prototyping project is to bring
   scientists from different domains like engineering and arts to explore
   collaboratively new approaches of development and testing of Product
   Service Systems (PSS). PSS combine products, services, and
   infrastructure to fulfil individual customer needs. Therefore, the
   development of PSS is an extension of traditional engineering design
   process, which mainly refers to purely tangible products or intangible
   services into an integrated development process of products and
   services.
   The basis is a new technology called Smart Hybrid Prototyping (SHP), a
   joint development by Fraunhofer IPK and the TU Berlin. SHP is an
   innovative technology for a multimodal interdisciplinary evaluation of
   virtual prototypes in early development stages. It is based upon methods
   of Mixed Reality extended by modern industrial technologies to allow
   natural interaction with virtual prototypes of mechanical or mechatronic
   systems. It serves as a bridge between physical reality and digital
   virtuality.
   The use cases in this paper are based on urban bike mobility. Therefore,
   three concepts have been worked out to specify main requirements for an
   urban hybrid bike simulator. The first use case is from the perspective
   of a bicycle rental, where rental services for the users can be
   developed, validated, and optimized. The second use case provides the
   integration of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for the
   development and validation of mobile services for bicyclists. The third
   use case is oriented on development and validation of new bicycles and
   urban mobility concepts like e-bikes, pedelecs, tripelecs and sharing
   services. Based on these generic use cases the requirements on a hybrid
   bicycle simulator were derived.
   Why a bicycle simulator? Well, we are firmly convinced that the future
   of urban mobility is determined from trends such as ecological
   rethinking and the desire for sports and healthy life. Furthermore, it
   is one of the most competitive and agile markets using most innovative
   materials and manufacturing technologies. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Although, additive Manufacturing ( AM) has been hailed as the ``third
   industrial revolution{''} by The Economist magazine {[}April-2012], the
   first patent on Stereo-lithography was awarded in 1986. An enabling
   technology which can build, repair or reconfigure components layer by
   layer or even pixel by pixel with appropriate materials to match the
   performance will enhance the productivity thus reduce energy
   consumption. Innovative product such a metallic composites with negative
   co-efficient of thermal expansion has already been demonstrated. The
   capability to form a three-dimensional object directly form digital data
   reduces many intermediate steps in manufacturing and, therefore,
   potentially an attractive and economic fabrication method. This is very
   suitable for low volume manufacturing.
   The major challenge for design of additive manufacturing machine is on
   line ``Quality assurance{''} due to its application in low volume
   manufacturing. Statistical quality control is not applicable due to low
   volume. Moreover, any new innovative product has to go thorough a long
   process of certification before adaptation, especially for Aerospace and
   medical device industry.
   This paper presents the design methodology for Smart Metallic Additive
   Manufacturing System (s-AMS). In-situ optical diagnostics and its
   capability to integrate with the process control is a prudent
   alternative. The two main groups of AM are powder bed (e.g. Laser
   Sintering) and pneumatically delivered powder (e.g. Direct Metal
   Deposition {[}DMD]) to fabricate components. DMD enables one to deposit
   different material at different pixels with a given height directly from
   a CAD drawing. The feed back loop also controls the thermal cycle. New
   optical Sensors are being developed to control product health and
   geometry using imaging, cooling rate by monitoring temperature,
   microstructure and composition using optical spectra. Ultimately these
   sensors will enable one to ``Certify as you Build{''}. Recently the
   author and his group have developed a technique to analyze the plasma
   spectra to predict the solid-state phase transformation, which opens up
   the new horizon for the materials processing and manufacturing.
   Flexibility of the process is enormous and essentially it is an enabling
   technology to materialize many a design. Conceptually one can seat in
   Houston and fabricate in Haifa. This paper discusses the in-situ
   diagnostic methods and its integration the design of the machine. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: Systems engineering theory, hand-hold fundus camera(FC) and
   internet cooperative platform were applied to help community staff, long
   distance specialists' organizations and teams to cooperate on the
   screening for diabetic fundus pathological change(or diabetic
   retinopathy, DR) in regional residents. It aims at promoting the ability
   to prevent and control (PC) the important non-infectious chronic
   diseases (NCD) to design a proper value-chain for mutually beneficial
   mode of interactions among regional health services, and the other
   corresponding social roles via technological and organizational
   innovation.
   Methods:
   1. Organizational innovation mode: Based on the Concept of
   social-huge-system and systems engineering theory, a cross-functional
   flowchart was applied to hatch a valuable road map of PC of certain
   single important NCD, i.e. DR, as well as the evaluation on the
   systematic target efficacy.
   2. Technological innovation and its social practice: twenty patients
   suffered from diabetes with no less than eight years diabetic history
   were prepared to be recruited from the resident health record in Machong
   Community Service Center, Dongguan, Guangdong, P.R. China. The health
   culture for DR was expressed to the residents by specialists' lecture.
   Besides, their fundus photos were collected via web-movable hand-hold FC
   assembled with Smartphone for data remote transmission or hand-hold
   digital FC with self-storage device, and sent to specialists' teams in
   different places to study.
   3. Evaluation on the practice activity: Concerning the experience of the
   screening for DR, the satisfaction with the service and quality, the
   willing to accept the health service \& management, and the awareness
   for DR before and after the health culture for DR, survey forms were
   collected and analyzed from the spot inquires to the residents at the
   end of the activity and from the follow-up visit after one week later
   than the screening.
   Results:
   1. The essential factors of sustainably strengthening the healthy
   product chain consist of the innovational driving with
   science-technology especially which plus internet, the mutually
   beneficial mechanism for organizationally cooperative services, the
   integration of the recyclable service stream with financial
   backing-direction-like stream including health insurance, the government
   support, and finally the approval by citizen.
   2. Seventeen cases were recruited from twenty cases in the pilot test.
   Eight suspected DR cases of them were found with hand-hold FC which may
   be conveniently and easily operated by general practitioners, and with a
   cooperative platform. One of the eight cases suggested errhysis in
   fundus, a kind of high risk characterization of blindness.
   3. It suggested that the community residents preferred to accept and
   were satisfied with the health culture education as well as the
   screening service about DR. The awareness about DR was raised after the
   education (X2=8.57, v=3, P<0.05).
   Conclusion:
   Screening for DR in community resident via web-movable hand-hold FC,
   cooperating platform as well as a mutually beneficial mode for regional
   health and medicine will be potentially benefit to raise the efficiency
   and improve the ability on PC of important NCD.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1979, China has made tremendous progress in its transformation to
   a socialist market economy. As part of this process, China's financial
   system has evolved to one characterised by a high degree of
   marketization. At the same time, China today faces new challenges to
   growth and development, particularly from the necessity of restructuring
   its economy to focus increasingly on innovation and away from government
   led investment and low-wage labour. In the context of digital financial
   services, China has been a late mover but this has changed dramatically
   in the past five years, to the point today where China is one of the
   major centres for digital financial services and financial technology
   ({''}Fintech{''}). Looking forward, China needs to provide an
   appropriate regulatory basis for the future development of digital
   financial services and Fintech, balancing growth and innovation with
   financial stability. China today is exhibiting signs of a last mover
   advantage in this respect that may see it leaping regulatory
   developments elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{As the contribution of wind energy to the power grid increases, serious
   concern about its influence on the dynamic behavior of the power system
   has also increased. This has raised the need for advanced analysis and
   simulation tools that can study the complicated dynamic behavior of wind
   turbines, test their controllers as well as emulate a complex power
   grid. Therefore, to meet all the aforementioned goals, a reconfigurable
   hybrid wind farm testbed has been developed and implemented into a
   real-time simulation platform that has eight CPUs. The proposed wind
   farm testbed includes a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) system involving a
   Doubly-fed Induction Machine (DFIM) test setup and wind turbine
   controllers. The wind farm model is also tested under normal and
   abnormal grid conditions. Several types of system symmetrical and
   asymmetrical faults are investigated. The first is a two-phase to ground
   fault at the point of common coupling (PCC) and the second is a
   three-phase to ground fault. An innovative approach referred to as
   Computer Twins is employed to react to these faults and maintain the
   stability of the power grid. A comprehensive set of test results are
   presented in this paper to demonstrate the capability of proposed
   testbed.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade there have been sharp reconfigurations in the
   publishing industry in Argentina. To begin with it is possible to think
   of three processes which coexist and mark the newest trends in the
   formation and configuration of the national publishing fields: industry
   concentration, the emergence of technologies and internationalization.
   This three processes are articulated and complementary transformative.
   In this context, the editors function as cultural brokers from the
   strengthening of a new type of projects that make innovative use of the
   possibilities of digitization of the word. The aim of this article is to
   expose the problem of digital publishing in the Argentine publishing
   field and how information technology and communication -ICTs- under the
   informational capitalism, generate new editors and editorial models
   offering digital forms of publication. In particular, we have analyzed
   the emergence, in 2007, of Teseo, from a qualitative perspective. On the
   one hand, the methodological approach was linked to the analysis of the
   website and its catalog. Two in-depth interviews were conducted with the
   director, Octavio Kulesz. Through inquiry by the sense that it operates
   as a propellant editor of cultural mediation process we will deepen in

Abstract = {{The world is witnessing a spectacular shift in the delivery of health
   and wellness care. The key ingredient of this transformation consists in
   the use of revolutionary digital technologies to empower people in their
   self-management as well as to enhance traditional care procedures. While
   substantial domain-specific contributions have been provided to that end
   in the recent years, there is a clear lack of platforms that may
   orchestrate, and intelligently leverage, all the data, information and
   knowledge generated through these technologies. This work presents
   Mining Minds, an innovative framework that builds on the core ideas of
   the digital health and wellness paradigms to enable the provision of
   personalized healthcare and wellness support. Mining Minds embraces some
   of the currently most prominent digital technologies, ranging from Big
   Data and Cloud Computing to Wearables and Internet of Things, and
   state-of-the-art concepts and methods, such as Context-Awareness,
   Knowledge Bases or Analytics, among others. This paper aims at
   thoroughly describing the efficient and rational combination and
   interoperation of these modern technologies and methods through Mining
   Minds, while meeting the essential requirements posed by a framework for
   personalized health and wellness support.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of the great development of information technologies and
   telecommunications, a natural need to develop and implement a unified
   system of digital building information modelling has arisen. The rapid
   development of design technology in the field of architecture,
   engineering and construction leads to the continuous adaptation of the
   conceptual apparatus for building information modelling (BIM). BIM
   technology adopts a new definition as a universal tool for describing
   various elements of intelligent virtual 3D model of a building combining
   a series of sequential steps related to the investment, such as
   requirements of design, construction, operation and demolition
   optimizations and preparations. In the paper, the authors propose
   directions of research in the field of BLM (Building Lifecycle
   Management). (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to place the interest on cannibalization of
   existing business model as a consequence of introducing to the company's
   activity new business based on digital technologies. The article is
   structured as follows: in the first part the business model notion is
   presented, further its relation with technology, especially digital
   technology, is underlined, then in the third part research methodology
   is discussed, whereas the fourth part analyses enterprises' reactions to
   revolutionary change triggered by digital technologies in the business
   model context. Considerations presented in the article has been
   formulated on the basis of systematic literature review, including 139
   publications from the period between 2010 and 2014, Polish-language and
   English-language, and represent part of wider research conducted on
   business models. Quoted in the article the Deseret News case points to
   the dual-transformation approach as the most effective reaction to
   digital revolution. Firstly, the transformation encompasses reorganizing
   existing business in order to adjust it to the current market reality.
   Secondly, new innovative business based on digital technologies is being
   developed within separate structures with the intention to become the
   future core of the company's performance.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years many parents begin to adopt the use of digital media,
   such as mobile learning software, as a substitute to their parenting
   tasks. However, as this type of parenting and pre-elementary learning
   becomes more pervasive, it's necessary to rethink the role of digital
   media in parents' and children's lives: how to use digital technology to
   support parenting to accommodate busy modern life style and promote
   parental involvement in pre-elementary education. This research presents
   an action research of the digital parenting platform for improving
   work-life balance for parents in parent-child interaction, supporting
   parents-children activities in pre-elementary education, providing the
   advices and supporting the needs of parenting and learning in the

Abstract = {{Technical innovation in education is a necessity today because of the
   high accessibility rate and significant role of Internet, smartphones,
   tablets and laptops in students' life. Focus is shifting from hardcopies
   to the digital version of texts, assignments, assessments and projects.
   With a number of free interactive tools available online, the
   educational system is embracing the transformation readily. This paper
   deals with the process of e-book (iBook) creation through an iOS app
   iBooks Author, collaborating various projects by students of an EFL
   (English as a Foreign Language) classroom. A specific vocabulary related
   theme was introduced to the class and the students evolved their own
   understanding and interpretation of the topic with in-depth study
   enhancing their cultural as well as social identities. Student
   engagement in groups for theme-based project was later combined as a
   single iBook by the teacher and shared with the class using a cloud
   service and also a projector for those who lacked an iOS device (iPad,
   iPhone etc.). Together with text, student research came up with
   digitized posters, presentations, audio and video files, quizzes, 3D and
   2D images etc. to be used in the iBook. Distinctive features of this
   mode of interactive learning are inclusion of local references in the
   iBook and propagating research culture among students at an early stage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the partial results of a broader research project on
   the teaching of the Competence of Linguistic Communication (henceforth
   referred to as CLC). It is an ``I+D{''} project named Improvement of the
   Competence of Linguistic Communication in Pupils of Preschool and
   Elementary Education (henceforth referred to as COMPLICE) (Ref.
   EDU2013-44176-P funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness
   (convocatoria 2013 del Programa Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y
   Tecnica de Excelencia, modalidad Proyectos de I+D). The universities at
   Cordoba, Granada, Oviedo and Seville participated in this study. The
   COMPLICE project centers on the improvement of the CLC of pupils of
   Preschool Education and Elementary Education, using, with this goal in
   mind, an intervention strategy based on the training of teachers and the
   use of digital resources for instruction and assessment.
   At an early stage of the COMPLICE project, the main objective is to
   gather information regarding the teaching-learning processes of CLC
   which are carried out in schools of preschool and elementary education.
   This present study examines the results derived from the diagnosis done
   at five centers of Preschool education in the province of Cordoba,
   including its capital city. Precisely, the following objectives are
   proposed:
   a) Determine which elements of the school curriculum and program are
   used to develop CLC.
   b) Describe which learning tasks are used in the classroom of the second
   cycle of Preschool Education (3-6 years of age) for developing CLC.
   c) Identify how the process of CLC assessment is carried out and which
   are the instruments used for this purpose.
   In order to respond to these proposed goals, we have employed the
   following information gathering instruments:
   a) Analysis of the documentation of the school and the classroom.
   b) Analysis of the students' activities and productions. This section
   has differentiated amongst: b. 1) activities of expression and oral
   comprehension; b. 2) specific writing activities, and b. 3) reading
   activities.
   c) Group interview of the participating teachers.
   The diverse sources used allow us to perform information complementation
   and triangulation. With this is mind, we have begun by analyzing the
   documentation of the schools involved in order to contextualize the
   analysis of the CLC to the socio-cultural characteristics of the chosen
   schools. The productions done by the children allow us to look carefully
   at the specific activities which are used in the classrooms analyzed
   Lastly, we completed the data with input from the teachers themselves,
   given that they were able to help us to clarify and better interpret the
   available information.
   In the Preschool schools and classrooms analyzed, a blanket planning
   developed in which CLC is understood in a transversal manner, one that
   is present and lends support to all the other areas of the school
   curriculum at this stage. The creation of a communicative context in the
   classroom is promoted, one which encourages children to express
   themselves, turning reading, writing, speaking and listening into the
   base of a systemic and relational learning.
   The results show that the play-based component present in the different
   activities strengthen the enjoyment and emotional involvement of young
   boys and girls, where they approach the learning of reading and writing
   as a necessity to respond to their interests, more than as a process of
   literacy imposed externally and in a decontextualized manner.}},

Abstract = {{Non-traditional, project based, student-focused learning and academic
   competitions support and enhance traditional teaching and learning.
   This brief research review highlights three key benefits for students
   involved in this type of education: An increased number of students
   choosing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)
   subjects at University level; the opportunity for students to compete
   and excel in academic competition similar to physical sport competition;
   and increased acquisition of key employability `soft' skills, namely,
   team work, communication and problem solving.
   This learning format supports and enhances traditional school learning
   when students learn to communicate with their peers and teachers
   differently. The educator is facilitator and students feel comfortable
   to explore and test new ideas, thus developing their own learning.
   Many competition projects are based around Science, Technology,
   Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Surveys indicate that club, project
   and competition based learning can provide a type and level of
   engagement with science learning beyond the capability of a traditional
   classroom science. There is evidence to suggest a significant
   relationship between the number of STEM clubs that students participate
   in and their choice of a STEM major at University.
   Survey research indicates a link between student participation in
   academic competitions at high school and their choice of a related
   post-secondary education programme. Further, it indicates that
   participation in competition may in fact be more important in this
   respect than participation in school science classes - even where
   enhanced elements have been added. Competitions, and the extracurricular
   preparation activities that accompany them, expose students to
   information about science and science careers that may not generally be
   found within the curriculum. Competition offers an opportunity for
   students to compete and excel on a mental level much the way they do on
   a physical level in sports. Contests can prompt students to strive for
   excellence if their parents and teachers view competition positively.
   Cooperative team projects can increase social interest and community
   service through participation in community outreach or STEM-based
   community projects. Survey research indicates that these impacts also
   extend to peers, families and community members. 21st Century skills -
   communication, teamwork and problem solving - so important for
   employability - are embedded in all four of the project-based
   competitions referred to in this paper. Related research on social
   skills in relation to employability indicates that social adjustment at
   age 11 correlates to the likelihood of employment in later life.
   Destination Imagination (DI) is one of several organisations around the
   world offering this type of learning. It annually provides seven fun and
   engaging open-ended challenges that foster additional work with STEM,
   Performing Arts and Community Outreach, and is designed to bridge the
   increasing gap between our emerging digital and human ecosystem and what
   students are learning in school.
   DI is a global, not-for-profit organization, headquartered in the USA,
   with 200,000 participants annually, in 32 countries and reaching over a
   million students in the last 15 years. It is partnered with NASA,
   National Geographic, Disney and many other organizations invested in
   educational outcomes that prepare children and young people for the life
   challenges that lay ahead.
   Survey research on DI concurs with the above findings, concluding that
   team members outperformed comparable non-DI students on creative
   thinking, critical thinking and collaborative problem solving
   assessments. Positive values and attitudes towards creative thinking are
   shown to be statistically significant in at least one of the surveys
   undertaken.}},

Abstract = {{The school management is regarded as one of the most important functions
   in the administrative work of the educational institutions which ensures
   for the most efficient materialization of its objectives. The task of
   school management is to continually seek for innovative methods in order
   to increase the quality of the daily educational work. The Information
   and Communication Technologies (ICT) are a means of modernizing not only
   the educational process but the completion of administrative tasks as
   well. The schools' managers in Secondary Education increasingly use ICT
   as facilitators in the handling of their administrative obligations,
   which is consistent with the requirements of a modern ``digital{''}
   reality. This study deals with the research of the managers' digital
   profile and records their attitudes and perceptions regarding the
   integration and use of ICT in the administrative process of a school
   organization, focusing on the managers' familiarization in the
   implementation of ICT and the research of their specific training needs.
   A mixed methodological research approach was adopted ( a quantitative
   and a qualitative one), using as methodological data collection tools
   the structured questionnaire and the semi - structured interview
   respectively. The current study surveyed a random sample of 107 High
   School principals during the school year of 2014-2015 for the
   quantitative part and a purposive sample of 9 principals for the
   qualitative part of the research. The findings of the research reveal
   that managers as ardent supporters of the use of ICT in the organization
   and administration of their schools and they create a rich digital
   profile, while they definitely recognize the importance of ICT for the
   improvement of the administrative process in schools. Although the
   respondents of the research are very familiar with the use of ICT,
   nonetheless this does not mean that there are no educational training
   needs which must be taken seriously into consideration by the policy
   makers of the training programs.}},

Abstract = {{Technologies are increasingly present in our daily life. Internet and
   digital technologies brought out a new social paradigm, described as
   information society, and founded on the power of information, where
   knowledge is a never-expanding, ever-changing flexible resource, and
   where there are no time and space barriers in communication. In this
   context, schools face a huge challenge: it is necessary to develop and
   implement innovative solutions in order to adapt the traditional
   concepts and methods of teaching and learning for the students `latest
   requirements and profile. The teaching and learning processes of
   programming logic involve content and concepts that aim at the
   development of analytical capacity, abstraction and logical reasoning
   allowing problem resolution through computer algorithms. However,
   students face some difficulties resulting not only from lack of
   knowledge, particularly in Mathematics, but also from the teaching
   methodology in use for the content presentation. This paper presents a
   methodology for teaching and learning programming logic supported by the
   use of mobile devices. We used the App Inventor tool, a visual
   programming environment that allows the development of applications for
   mobile Android devices. Thus, it was possible to introduce programming
   concepts in a more appealing, participatory and engaging way, giving
   room to experiment, discovery and test. It was possible to combine the
   students' perception of the importance and applicability of learning
   contents with their affinity and interest in mobile technologies. In
   addition, it was possible to introduce usability concepts of interactive
   systems interfaces, particularly applied to mobile devices. The results
   obtained were very satisfactory. Schools, as a reflection of society,
   must adapt and exploit technology's new possibilities. It is necessary
   to integrate these technologies in the teaching and learning processes,
   remodeling and redesigning new habits and methods.}},

Abstract = {{ExeLearning is a tool of educational innovation and together with ICT
   has high opportunities to provide quality education. On the other hand,
   the emotional education is understood as an educational, ongoing
   process, which aims to promote the development of emotional competencies
   as an essential element of human development, in order to enable him to
   life and in order to increase wellbeing and social.
   Emotional intelligence, as ongoing process, must be present in secondary
   and higher education as well as throughout adulthood. Emotional
   intelligence takes a life cycle approach, which continues throughout
   life.
   Emotional competencies must be understood as a kind of basic skills for
   the life, essential for the integral development of the personality.
   They are an indispensable complement of cognitive development. Emotional
   intelligence is proposed to optimize human development; that is, the
   integral development of the person (physical, intellectual, moral,
   social, emotional, etc.).
   In addition, some strategic proposals for the implementation of
   emotional intelligence programs focus on teacher training. Teachers with
   minimal training can introduce elements of emotional intelligence in
   their teaching. One of the most appropriate spaces to do is mentoring,
   whose aim would be the personal and social development, which makes
   possible the coexistence in democracy and the construction of personal
   and social welfare. The members of the education community with
   resources, methodologies, techniques, strategies and activities can
   contribute by their example to emotional intelligence. It is considered
   very beneficial for both students and for teachers. Educational
   innovation is combined with eXelearning and emotional intelligence.
   It is considered very interesting for teachers learning innovative
   educational tools so that students achieve better academic results and
   the quality of the teaching-learning process increases, while their
   emotional intelligence, motivation and communication to increase both to
   the teachers and the other students. In addition, the personal and
   social development, which makes possible the coexistence in democracy
   and the construction of personal and social well-being is vital. In this
   sense, it is important to motivate to want to continue learning, which
   is a form of emotional intelligence.
   The participation and motivation of teachers has been considered very
   active and positive. All of them have tried to achieve adequate and
   useful results to improve their teaching. They have shown great interest
   and enthusiasm to achieve the objectives. They have managed to make
   significant progress regarding its starting point in the use of ICT with
   emotional intelligence.
   It has been conducted an updated digital material for the students to
   work using ICT. They have met their objectives and there has been a high
   degree of involvement of the participants and applied achievements in
   the classroom. It has been increased interactivity between students and
   has been increasing motivation. In addition, the students presented a
   positive and better attitude towards their own learning.}},

Abstract = {{It may seem obvious that the development of the mathematical thinking is
   one of the most important goals of Mathematics Education. However, the
   low yield obtained by many countries, including Spain, recently, in the
   most prestigious international assessment tests on Mathematics
   Education, PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) and
   TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study), which
   focus on reasoning and problem solving skills as main criteria to assess
   this area, has shown that their Mathematics Education does not achieve
   that goal adequately. Several studies agree to consider a poor attitude
   towards Mathematics on the part of students in Primary Education as the
   origin of this problem. They also point out, as causes of this
   situation, a teaching methodology based on repetitive and insignificant
   activities for the students' learning and the results that they obtain
   in the teaching units of calculation and arithmetic. The declining
   interest in studying STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and
   Mathematics) degrees is maybe the most important consequence of this
   problem because of its potential impact and negative effects on the
   development of research and innovation.
   As a way for change, an innovation proposal on Mathematics Education for
   Primary Education based on Digital Game-Based Learning is presented. In
   it, cryptoarithmetic activities through mobile devices apps are proposed
   as a way to contribute to improving the results of students in
   calculation and arithmetic units through problem solving and to increase
   their interest in learning Mathematics, at the same time that one of the
   technologies with a major impact in Education is introduced. These
   aspects help to shape a teaching methodology whose main objective is to
   provide greater significance to students' learning of Mathematics and to
   make more attractive this subject to them. Also, cryptoarithmetic
   activities, apart from being an interesting resource for calculation and
   arithmetic teaching, are perceived as games by students, a notion that
   it is expected to be reinforced with the mobile devices apps and
   introducing gamification in learning experiences, thereby increasing
   student motivation. Moreover, through this methodology it is supposed to
   take advantage of the Mobile Learning possibilities to deploy and use
   technology in the classroom, enriching the students' learning and
   promoting the acquisition of skills, due to the low cost of mobile
   devices, over other ICT devices, and their versatility for being used
   both on and off school.
   In this paper is shown a description and a didactic analysis of this
   proposal and the mobile apps used therein as teaching resources, which
   are ``Cryptogram{''}, developed by Andreas Schulz, and ``Cryptogram
   solver{''}, developed by Gnter Hildebrandt, both available for the
   Android operating system, the most widespread one among mobile devices.
   Also, the expected conclusions are shown, based on the didactic analysis
   of the resources and the methodology, among which are the benefits for
   the development of the Mathematical and Digital Competence. The
   conclusions of the real impact of the project in the classroom cannot be
   presented yet because it is currently developing.}},

Abstract = {{Vocational Education and Training (VET) based on principles of dual
   education has become recognized by numerous national educational systems
   as one of most advantageous models of education. This model allows one
   part of education and training to be realized within educational
   institutions, while the other part is carried out within industry
   partner organizations. In such way, labor market is supplied with highly
   qualified workers, capable of easily adapting to new business conditions
   and introduction of new digital technology.
   Implementation of a dual education system requires firm relations
   between representatives of education and business spheres. There are
   numerous possible models of their cooperation and collaboration.
   Successful realization of carefully chosen model ensures benefits for
   both sides, especially those associated with the high degree of
   compliance of graduates' skills with the requirements of the labor
   market. The gap between competencies attained within educational
   institutions and those necessary for entry into professional life is
   reduced to the minimum possible extent.
   Considering that there are presently only hints of possible future
   introduction of dual education in Serbia, the Faculty of Economics in
   Subotica has developed a dual business informatics study program within
   the present legal framework. The aim of this paper is to present the
   possible models of collaboration between a higher education institution
   and the ICT sector in different stages of curriculum design and
   implementation. At the same time, the paper presents the content of the
   developed interdisciplinary business informatics curriculum through an
   overview of expected student competencies.
   The authors have collected the necessary input from business entities
   through interviews and questionnaires. The collected data served in the
   identification of feasible models of cooperation, as well as in the
   detection of necessary competencies of future employees in the ICT
   sector. The outcome of this process is a designed dual study programme,
   ready for accreditation, with specified syllabi and well-defined modes
   of industry partners' participation in their realization.}},

Abstract = {{Creative and innovative developments in information and communication
   technologies have paved the way for assistive technologies in special
   education in addition to other fields in education. Assistive
   Technologies have been used as effective, efficient, and attractive
   teaching tools because learners with autism spectrum disorder have
   difficulties to develop cognitive abilities and acquire new knowledge.
   Learners with autism spectrum disorder need to improve their behavior,
   communication and relationships with their environment and this can be
   succeeded through special education. New digital devices, as hardware,
   appear to be promising teaching/learning tools. However, hardware takes
   on a new significance as long as it is used with well-designed software.
   Within the scope of this research, software refers to any interactive
   e-books and any interactive content based teaching applications. On this
   basis, the purpose of this study is to identify design criteria for
   interactive e-books and interactive content-based teaching applications
   for learners with autism spectrum disorder through a three round Delphi
   study. In this study, a total of 47 criteria under 5 themes were

Abstract = {{Higher education has always been a conservative environment, where
   education providers have seen their institutions as nuclear, the
   curricula being decided single-handedly, without much interference from
   the outside. The past decade, however, saw unprecedented changes in at
   least two directions. The first one is the outcome of the economic
   crisis, which has risen the necessity of the collaboration between
   business and academia in order to provide young graduates able to adapt
   quickly to the labour-market requirements.
   The other direction is related to the advent of new technologies. This
   obviously challenges the traditional learning space and asks for a
   dynamic, flexible and collaborative environment, where students are
   given the choice and can make decisions.
   Adapt2jobs is a European-funded project, with a view to adapting
   teaching methods and academic curricula to the labour-market demands.
   Its aim is to follow the above-mentioned directions in higher education,
   by making use of the digital technologies, and by actively involving
   students in the decision-making process so as to assure relevance and
   quality of instruction. The commitment of the university is twofold: one
   to quality and the second to the job-market. While accountable to
   society to provide qualified, innovative and creative workforce, the
   challenge of the university is to maintain the balance between quality
   of instruction and market demands. To what extent are we teaching for
   the future? This is a question that only the students can answer; their
   assessment of our educational proposals is essential for a successful
   program. The benefit of the project is that the student is supposed to
   assess, make a decision and pass on his conclusions, becoming aware of
   his/her responsibility not only for his own career, but also for his
   peers'.
   The project outcomes should be seen as benchmarks for developing and
   implementing improvements in the existing curricula. Students and
   employers become partners with teachers in the process of adapting
   teaching/learning methods to present-day labour-market requirements.
   Students involved in our project are encouraged to explore
   computer-based learning and, at the same time, to self-assess their
   progress by taking continuous-assessment tests and to measure their
   learning effectiveness by taking a final test. University-Business
   Cooperation concept has gained a lot of attention today because both
   parties are interested in providing highly trained graduates. In this
   sense, the project sustainability is firstly meant to establish a
   well-articulated framework, which can make this cooperation work.
   Secondly, teachers will contribute to the development of the project
   sustainability through their constant involvement in adapting the
   digitized content of the courses to the latest developments in the field
   and also, in promoting the blendend teaching method among their peers.
   Thirdly, students are encouraged to share their learning experience with
   their colleagues, a new one to this ecosystem of education.}},

Abstract = {{The shortage of digital skills in the current marketplace is
   unprecedented. It is estimated that over 4.4 million IT jobs will be
   created around Big Data by 2015; however, only a third of these new jobs
   will be filled {[}1]. Even Millenials are a matter of concern. In a
   survey comprising over 800 middle to upper management executives from
   over 50 industries, nearly one in five Millennials in the modern
   workplace are perceived to be lacking in analytical skills {[}2].
   The reasons driving this skills shortage are not hard to identify. The
   usage of mobile, social and analytical tools is permeating the length
   and breadth of every function across the organization. Unlike the past,
   the impact of these digital technologies and tools is felt not just in
   the IT department. This means that the magnitude of training and
   re-skilling that is required is enormous. Moreover, each new technology
   cycle has brought forth new requirements and these cycles are
   increasingly getting shorter. Employees must now refresh their skills
   more frequently if they wish to stay relevant in this rapidly changing
   digital environment.
   Organizations are beginning to recognize the magnitude of the problem.
   This skills shortage is creating a `war for talent', where companies
   have to compete for the best talent with new categories of players.
   Unlike in the past, the hunt for the best talent is no more limited to
   localized skills in certain departments. In this case, the talent war is
   manifest across the entire organization. The important questions are: Do
   organizations include digital skills as a key component in their
   workforce plans? Are HR departments equipped and skilled to bring
   innovative solutions to bridge the digital skills gap? How are Digital
   Leaders (or `Digiratis') developing digital skills?
   The research included in the paper is a combination of multiple surveys
   that have been conducted by Capgemini Consulting at varying points in
   time as well as select interviews of academics and business
   professionals. We first conducted an in-depth research with the MIT
   Center of Digital Business interviewing more than 150 senior executives
   from large enterprises from across the globe. The Phase 2 of the
   research with MIT focused on benchmarking digital practices around the
   globe. As a part of this effort, survey responses were gathered from 469
   executives in 391 large companies around the world.}},

Abstract = {{The use of digital tools has seen a rapid spurt in recent years. Advent
   of platforms such as social networks, growth in smart devices and mobile
   connectivity are all having significant impact on how employees work and
   socialize. As employees become more comfortable with technology, there
   is an increasing overlap in the usage of such tools across their
   personal and professional lives. This leads to high expectations being
   set on internal people organizations and systems. Such usage
   characteristics thereby put significant pressure on the people function
   to transform. Most organizations though have so far focused on
   addressing the impact of digital on customer-facing functions. In the
   process, they have not really addressed the crucial people-facet of
   digitization.
   We believe a radical re-think of key people functions and processes is
   the need of the hour. Traditional view of people drivers should be
   reframed for enabling a work culture reflective of the era of highly
   interconnected workforce. We call this new way of defining the people
   drivers in a digital age,
   People 2.0. We define People 2.0 as the behavioral, cultural, and
   educational transformation of employees and organizations driven by new
   technological paradigms. People 2.0 is built on the four key pillars of
   Collaboration, HR, Talent and Management. Digitization has triggered a
   transformation across each of these areas resulting in benefits as well
   as transformational challenges. The Key Pillars in the People 2.0 Agenda
   are:
   Collaboration 2.0: To enable a connected workforce which leads to
   project collaboration, co-creation, R\&D and Innovation
   Management 2.0: Manager's role moves from hierarchical control to
   managing contribution to the community and more globally implementing
   People 2.0 Transformation
   HR 2.0 has a two faced challenge: to transform itself \& to support the
   2.0 transformation both Business and People wise
   Talent 2.0 services allow new models of talent acquisition, retention
   and learning thus switching from conventional to social methods
   A transition to People 2.0 is complex. The rapid spread of social tools
   across the length and breadth of organizations will also play a
   compounding role in this transformation. A successful transition to
   People 2.0 must be based on a well-designed plan addressing all the
   company's dimensions to support both business and people ambitions.
   While a transformation to People 2.0 can yield significant increase in
   people performance, there exist multiple issues that need to be
   addressed beforehand in order to achieve the desired impact.
   In summary, the question is no longer ``if{''} but ``when{''} an
   organization will move towards the People 2.0 dimension. This transition
   represents a transformation that, even for the most agile organizations,
   is a significant challenge. How fast and effective is this
   transformation will determine whether organizations can (or cannot) be
   talent magnets.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of virtual teaching-learning in online education is
   practically a managed challenge today. The advantages of the new
   technologies enhance teaching in these models, it means an established
   fact. However, these same methodologies are outside as we talk about the
   modalities of classroom teaching, where lectures charge the same role
   than in the past, refusing to give way to the new digital era in which
   we live closer, and it is also intelligible and familiar to students.
   Therefore, we believe that new teaching innovation projects must be
   aimed at the integration and coexistence of these new methodologies with
   traditional education systems. One of the easiest and most productive
   tool within a virtual environment is the video tutorial. It is an
   attractive format for the student, powerful visual load, adaptable to
   developing programs and easy to create too.
   Implementation experience in Architecture degree and Building
   Engineering degree at UCAM Catholic University San Antonio of Murcia
   (Spain), has involved the preparation of simple three-dimensional
   Virtual Models of major building systems, using Sketchup, obtaining
   conceptual models which are illustrative of each of these sets and
   explaining how they work. This digital material has been used to develop
   a series of Video Tutorials that, in no more than 5 minutes, show each
   of these models in motion, permitting observation of each element
   separately and commissioning work together, combining image with
   explanatory texts and photographs of real works that establish a direct
   relationship between the represented object and reality. These Video
   Tutorials are created by Camtasia software, they have served as teaching
   support material during lectures in different construction subjects of
   two degrees. Video Tutorials are a useful support for students during
   these hours, which are dedicated to personal study.
   The results show a highly satisfactory experience, since it has
   increased the attention of students, motivating them to be part of the
   development of new digital models, taking advantage of their acquired
   knowledge in the software. It has increased the capacity of
   understanding the analyzed building systems, especially in the first
   years of the degree, thereby improving student achievement. And finally,
   we can highlight the possibilities that digital media has created in
   their dissemination, enabling collaboration and exchange of material
   with other schools and universities both nationally and internationally.}},

Abstract = {{Technological and digital innovations have invaded our daily life and
   affected our lifestyle. Innovations in digital technology are used to
   improve the learning process and the management of the school. The
   secondary schools in Ilia, Greece, are given the opportunity to profit
   innovative services of digital technology.
   The aim of the paper is to examine whether the secondary schools
   (teachers and educational leaders) of Ilia are ready to face the
   challenge of technological and digital innovation. This paper offers
   some thoughts on the attitude of the educational leaders to new
   technology, teachers' training to meet the demands of technological and
   digital development that happens, the way that these innovations are
   used and the structures that exist in secondary schools to implement ICT
   innovation.
   The topics which will be discussed are the technological and digital
   innovation in educational environment, the role of educational leaders
   to change and to technological and digital evolution contributing to the
   quality of learning and the welfare of students. The topics covered have
   been objects of extensive researches so there is a lot of bibliography
   published on the subject.
   The tool used for conducting the survey is the questionnaires handed out
   to teachers concerning the improvement of the educational process with
   the use of technology.
   This tool is valid for drawing examples which illustrate the research
   effectively.
   The survey is used to power a critical perspective on technological and
   digital innovations contemplating the strengths and weaknesses of the
   application of technological and digital innovations in teaching in
   secondary schools of Ilia. In conclusion, it will highlight the
   relationship between the technological and digital innovation and
   improvement of teaching-learning.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICT)
   provides unprecedented access to information, allowing humans a new way
   to interact globally. Advances in ICT have propagated the widespread
   adoption of social media, which is increasingly used for socializing,
   organizing events, spreading news stories, learning new languages, and
   supporting business strategies. This paper presents an innovative new
   course offered to college freshman across all majors as part of their
   first-year experience titled Social Media As a Revolutionary Technology
   (SMART). This active-learning course was developed to examine the rise
   of the information age and the ubiquitous presence and impact of current
   social media such as Facebook, You Tube, and Twitter. Students learn
   about information literacy, written communication, and oral
   communication in the 21st century by examining the impact of their
   digital landscape and the unique opportunities afforded by technologies
   that promote global communication. The use of technology in education is
   reframed by examining strategic applications of social media that
   transcend common uses such as connecting with friends. Specifically,
   this course analyses the design and metrics of social media campaigns
   such as the Save Sameer and Vinay bone marrow drives, Obama's 2008
   presidential campaign, Kickstarter efforts, as well as five class
   projects aimed at raising social awareness and charitable fund raising:
   Don't Drive Intexticated: No Texts No Wrecks, Charity Water, Santa's
   Holiday Helpers, Project Raspberry Pi, and 17 Acts of Kindness. SMART
   utilizes a framework for planning and implementing social media
   projects-The Dragonfly Effect-to empower students to strategically
   leverage social media technologies to promote social good. Emphasis is
   placed on a) the importance of establishing a focused goal that is
   time-bound and measureable; b) grabbing attention by developing a
   visceral campaign that delivers something unexpected and appeals to
   universal emotions (i.e., happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, anger,
   surprise); c) engaging people through transparent campaigns that foster
   collaboration and authenticity; and d) delivering an inspiring call to
   action. Successful social media campaigns require more than passion and
   perseverance; they require research, preparation, strategic design,
   monitoring, and metrics for measuring effectiveness. Campaign benchmarks
   and metrics are presented and discussed, including the results and
   overall impact of the campaign projects. The course curriculum was
   developed as an active learning model, engaging students by turning
   theory into action as students work in small teams to design, promote,
   implement, and measure their campaigns' impact within a semester-long
   project course. In this unique interdisciplinary course, students learn
   a greater social awareness through the deployment of digital service
   learning in which any student, regardless of major, can leverage
   technology to become an agent of change.}},

Abstract = {{The newest generation, Millennials, are beginning to arrive in the
   graduate school arena. Millennials, the largest generation in the US
   born between 1980 and the mid-2000s, are now forming a large part of our
   graduate student body. They are bold and not afraid to ask questions and
   were brought up in an era of technology. Millennials have a much
   stronger connection to technology than previous generations. This shapes
   the way they shop, communicate and gain information. Through the use of
   technology they have instant access to information and a wealth of
   choices. They embrace convenience and live according to their own
   timeframe. We ask ourselves what steps we need to take to prepare how to
   recruit and attract Millennials since conventional practices will no
   longer work. They are becoming more educated than previous generations,
   especially women. The pay gap for women in this generation has closed
   significantly. Their professional training, skills and education level,
   in many cases, exceed the existing workforce. This generation is
   motivated by different factors than the generations before them. They
   are more focused on their careers, getting married later, and living at
   home with their parents longer.
   Millennials want to save the world. They want to inspire others and for
   their job and life to have a deeper meaning. They have a positive
   attitude, are innovative and think big. Their drive is based on reward,
   benefit and satisfaction. They show a strong essence of passion for
   whatever they plan to achieve. This generation is motivated by results.
   Traditional recruitment practices that were previously employed will not
   be as effective with this generation and should strongly be revised.
   Students choose a degree program based on an innovative curriculum,
   access and use of technology in the classroom, relevant materials and
   convenience.
   They favor being able to tailor a graduate education to their needs.
   They are interested in knowing who else is sitting in the classroom in
   order to determine and forge professional networks. Millennials conduct
   excessive research about schools, but their opinions are not based on
   school websites. Due to their tech savviness and comfortability, they
   review chats and forums; check rankings, accreditations and employment
   statistics. It is quite important for them to know what kind of
   relationships schools have with local and global corporations. They have
   only one question: will the degree help them move forward?}},

Abstract = {{The continuous evolution of technologies has interfered with the way we
   live and see the world. A XXI century citizen does not see the world as
   a past century citizen sees. This change had different origins, in
   particular the incredible technology advances. Indeed, the technologies
   are present everywhere and in every activity we accomplish. They were a
   key factor in the evolution of the information society, sometimes called
   the knowledge society, with a global scale impact.
   Nowadays is defending an educational system more student-centred. The
   student should become more involved in the construction of its own
   knowledge, be self-regulating of its learning, which requires to be
   actively involved in the learning process. The teacher is responsible
   for motivate and support the students in this process. Thus, the
   learning process should be multi-dimensional, involving motivational
   aspects beyond strategies that lead to learning. Several studies point
   to several advantages in using Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) in the educational context, since they allow to
   explore factors such as multi-sensory association, human-computer
   interaction and experimentation, in solving educational problems and to
   contribute to a faster and more effective learning. In this sense,
   multiple online learning platforms have been developed, in order to meet
   the students' demands and the society itself.
   In 2008, an online platform called ``M@t-educate with success{''} (pM@t)
   was developed, with the goal to provide innovative environments,
   supported in appropriate digital resources which, by one hand, lead the
   students in the exploration, understanding and application of
   mathematical concepts and, on the other hand, to promote critical
   analysis of the methods used and the obtained results. Several contents
   were used: interactive visual components, animations and images of
   graphical representations, which help to clarify some concepts.
   Additionally, digital guides were developed, in order to allow the
   student, at his own pace, autonomously build his mathematical knowledge,
   exploring, conjecturing, investigating, discovering, testing concepts,
   and ensuring a more active role in the educational process. The students
   may learn by doing.
   However, the continuous evolution of technologies is a reality. More
   even the teachers be updated in relation to the contents, the teaching
   methodologies and the technological resources, they are faced with the
   inevitable need to continuously adapt to the education system. In this
   context, we developed a study to understand the opinions of students and
   teachers about the suitability of the pM@t platform in the teaching and
   learning processes. The main results were obtained in real environment
   and allowed to conclude the need to update the platform, namely: i) the
   migration to a newer framework (CakePHP) in order to support an editor
   of mathematical formulas and to improve the visual animations
   performance; ii) to create a new user registration system, more
   streamlined and suitable for several degrees and courses and iii) a new
   graphical and interactive visualization module of the platform usage
   statistics.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, there has been a large investment in
   information and communication technology in the teaching/learning
   process. In this context, mobile technologies, including smartphones and
   tablets emerge as an innovative tool associated with different methods
   and strategies. Mobile technologies are technological products and,
   nowadays, a very representative number of so-called ``digital
   generation{''} own and use them in our day-to-day, in recreational and
   educational activities. In this way, the mobile technologies contribute
   to a teaching/learning process more motivating and personalized. The
   students' motivation increases when this technology is used, leading to
   greater participation, and, consequently, better and faster acquisition
   of concepts/skills. Collaborative actions and cooperation between
   student/student, student/teacher and student/class are increased when
   mobile devices are used in the classroom context. The use of mobile
   technologies and their implications for the teaching/learning process
   are some of the challenges that teachers face today as promoters and
   ``drivers{''} in this process. To use the tools effectively an
   understanding is essential and therefore there are implications in
   teacher training not only for the use and application of technology, but
   for the underlying concepts and support. This paper examined the
   evolution of mobile technologies in Higher Education Institutions in
   Portugal between 2009/2010 and 2014/2015.}},

Abstract = {{The educational institutions - public as school and university and
   private ones - and other players in the learning environment are
   undergoing deep changes driven by different social and technological
   forces.
   The new generations of students are born and grown up with digital
   technologies - Generation X, Digital natives, Millennials and so on -
   and they represent a sort of genetic evolution in the way they approach
   and interact with the learning process. In their daily life, search
   engines, mobile connections, touch interfaces and social digital
   relationships are natural part of the experience.
   On the other hand Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is
   becoming even more pervasive in many ways as an academic subject, as a
   learning tool or a teaching supporting framework.
   Under the pressure of these thrusts - do not necessarily convergent -
   also teaching methods and praxis are facing with new challenges both in
   the field of formal learning and in the way to use and implement hard-
   and soft- digital innovations. Furthermore, ICT is shifting the focus of
   learning experience based on co- presence of teachers and students in
   the same place and time, to a deferred interaction mediated by digital
   tools in which learning activity is extended and enlarged to cover part
   of the daily and personal lifetime. Collaborative platforms - wiki,
   social network, video blogging etc. enable people to spontaneously and
   informal learning not mediated except by amateurs- experts or by
   community of interest or peers. Eventually technology is changing the
   teaching tools moving from mimetic forms simulating the printed book,
   notebooks and paper to virtual forms such as e- publishing and mobile
   apps in which medium and contents converge becoming really
   learn-machine.
   In this context and according to changing dynamics, the paper presents
   `` Res Logica{''} - as a paradigmatic a case study - an app pilot for
   tablet design to study syntax and linguistic construction of Italian
   language.
   The research project particularly faces the transition that educational
   publishers are living - according to a relatively recent national law
   133/ 2008. The editorial sector is required to give books - whatever the
   word is meant to define - in hybrid/ digital version, even if it's not
   specified explicitly cultural and format standards.
   Res Logica offers a solution based on the characteristic of the device -
   the app has been prototyped with Adobe InDesign Digital Publishing Suite
   for tablets and optimized for iPad - using touch interactions and
   gesture and multimodal languages.
   Conceived both as a teaching support and a learning tool Res Logica uses
   the gamification approach to generate collaborative dynamics and
   learning by doing processes specific of social networks and web 3.0 to
   acquire theoretical and practical notions about the language structure
   and grammar.
   The proposed case study tries to test the potentiality of digital
   learning tool and the convergence of the more recent digital revolution
   to evaluate a model and/ or a design method discussing limits and
   possible developments in parallel with the evolution of digital worlds.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to introduce the consensual assessment
   technique (CAT) to library, information, and learning spaces as an
   approach for assessing the creativity, innovativeness, and value of
   products. This paper proposes adaptation of the CAT to accommodate
   everyday, real-world activities integral to library and learning
   practices, research, and support for technology-rich learning
   environments. Based on case study research, an aware-enabled social
   radio tool in a postsecondary virtual distributed educational
   environment is used as an example to illustrate the application and
   potential of the technique. Contributing to the literature across
   multiple domains (e.g., assessment, creativity, information science,
   learning, and innovation), this paper has the potential to provoke new
   or revised approaches to assessment for practice and research. This
   paper also gives rise to new partnering and collaborative opportunities
   for libraries, learners, and educators in relation to data and learning
   analytics and other emerging digital learning issues. A conceptual
   framework for integration of the CAT into library and learning spaces is
   advanced. The proposed framework is expected to ignite interest in the
   CAT, opening the way for extension of the technique to 21st century
   technology-rich library and learning spaces with implications for
   practice, research, and methodology.}},

Abstract = {{In order to respond to the challenges posed by digitalisation, new
   competence and operating models are required in working life. This, on
   the other hand, requires developing the content and methods of higher
   education. This paper describes an experiment that addresses developing
   higher education in service design studies at Laurea University of
   Applied Sciences.
   The pedagogical starting point for the development work was a
   pedagogical model, Learning by Developing (LbD), that is based on
   learning through research and developing (R\&D). Expertise and
   experiences are shared between teachers and students as well as other
   project partners. While working in the project teams, students take part
   as equal partners bringing their expertise with them. The teacher
   members of the project team take part by providing their expertise to
   steer the progress of the work and, at the same time, the progress of
   learning.
   The objectives of the development work were: (1) to gain a
   research-oriented, developmental and problem-based higher education
   approach to studying; (2) to produce new methods and techniques to
   involve multidisciplinary students, citizens, companies, and the public
   and third sectors in the development of digital services; (3) to provide
   students with competence to use diverse development methods and tools
   flexible at all stages of the service design process; and (4) to provide
   students with competence to gather, structure and apply information in
   genuine R\&D contexts. The development work focused not only on the
   pedagogical issues, but also on student and stakeholder participation in
   the innovation process, and on applying and developing appropriate
   service design tools and techniques for that purpose.
   The development work was conducted during the multidisciplinary master's
   degree service design studies in the project called WeLive. The WeLive
   project was devised to transform the current e-Government approach by
   facilitating a more open model of design, production and delivery of
   public services leveraging on the collaboration between public sector,
   citizens and entrepreneurs. WeLive applies the service design approach
   to deliver next generation personalised digital services to citizens.
   For that, it contributes with the WeLive platform, an ICT infrastructure
   where stakeholders collaborate in the ideation, creation, funding and
   deployment of new digital services.
   The outcomes of the development work were (1) a new teaching model in
   line with the service design process, with the aim of providing students
   with the ability to act as service designers and innovation processes
   developers, and (2) an open innovation process model to involve
   multidisciplinary students, citizens, companies, and the public and
   third sectors in the development of digital services.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports on experiences gained in a year-long project at
   Sor-Trondelag University College, Trondheim, Norway (HiST). The project
   was a continuation of an earlier three week pilot project from 2014
   {[}1]. The aim of the project was to further explore the effects of
   implementing applied digital game-based learning in Social Sciences and
   English Second Language (EFL) training with a focus on democracy,
   ideology, economy and politics. A further aim was to situate this in a
   digital learning environment at HiST, using digital SMART Boards, and
   observe the learning process and outcomes.
   The game employed, Democracy 3 {[}2] is a political simulator in which
   the player, upon assuming the highest political office in his country of
   choice, has to administer economy, infrastructure, education and the
   day-to-day political administration of his country. While doing so, he
   will have to monitor the electorate and his own cabinet in order to
   ensure successful implementation of his policies and reelection.
   This complexity mirrors actual political realities and this makes the
   game an apt tool for education. In contrast to the previous project, and
   in response to the experiences made in that project, an emphasis was
   placed on the economical aspect. In the one subject, Social Sciences,
   economy is a central component, and with Norway scoring lowest of the
   Nordic countries in economic literacy in PISA, this is an in need of
   pedagogical attention. In the other subject, EFL, reading, speaking and
   conversation skills are as fundamental as a contextual and cultural
   understanding of the countries in which the language is used, and so a
   focus on communication was applied from one subject, while one on
   content was applied from the other. In addition, experiences show that
   the application of game-based learning also fosters innovative learning
   and a motivating, concrete approach to abstract concepts.
   The group consisted of approximately 100 students in two test classes
   and 40 in a control class, all on the preparatory course for engineering
   studies at HiST. The test classes used Democracy 3 while the control
   group had a similar project, but without the using the game. The
   learning outcomes were measured with a report and a segment in the final
   exam. This article will present these results in terms of economic
   literacy as well as the pedagogical and methodological conclusions drawn
   upon completion of the project, with special attention on the
   intersection between the application of digital game content, method and
   subject goals.}},

Abstract = {{Game making as a strategy for supporting learning processes is a
   research topic that has roots stretching back to the constructionist
   movement of the 1980s and 1990s. However, the current popularity of
   digital gaming, Game Based Learning (GBL), 21st century skills
   development and learner-centred strategies is sharping interest in the
   affordances that digital game making offers and how these can be
   harnessed in education to enhance learning. This contribution charts the
   emergence and establishment of learner-driven digital game making
   through a systematic review of the global literature on the topic
   published since the early 1980s. It maps out the research concerns under
   investigation in the field, as gleaned from a dataset of almost 500
   publications of different types specifically dedicated to the topic. The
   review forms part of the author's research activities in game making for
   learning carried out with an EC co-funded project called MAGICAL (Making
   Games in Collaboration for Learning). The review begins with a
   description of the method and procedure adopted for carrying out the
   literature search and producing a comprehensive dataset of records. This
   is followed by reporting and analysis of the generated data. The review
   concludes with a brief discussion and reflection on the results.}},

Abstract = {{Teaching technical subjects on Architecture and Engineering has been
   developed traditionally using lecture and master class methodology.
   During them, the professor presented the content using the resolution of
   practical problems as a complement for theoretical reasoning. This
   sessions were generally support by an analogic resource: the blackboard.
   In recent years, despite the introduction of new technologies in the
   classroom, this methodology has become more static. In most cases,
   explanations have been supported only by slides created with the
   assistance of computer programs, making into minority the use of the
   blackboard. This has produced the generalization of ``death by
   PowerPoint{''} phaenomenon. With regard to evaluation systems, there
   have been no substantial changes between these two different teaching
   methods despite the widespread implementation of competency-based
   learning system introduced by European Higher Education Area (EHEA)
   since 1999. Learning of students continues being verified by the
   realization of a final exam about the theoretical and practical contents
   of the subject.
   This paper presents a teaching methodology focused on encouraging active
   student participation both during the course of the class and outside.
   The application of learning for information and communications
   technology (ICT) makes its essential basis. Simultaneously, a continuous
   evaluation system capable of maintaining the attention on the subject
   has been implemented. The static attendance combined with traditional
   evaluation systems by a final exam produces an accumulation of
   information by the student revised and learned just to pass the final
   exam. This scheme has been changed getting a higher motivation of
   students to the continuous learning process. This system has been
   applied since the 2012/2013 academic year in technical subjects of
   Bachelor in Architecture in the Universities of Malaga and Seville
   through an Educational Innovation Project financed by University of
   Malaga.
   Results obtained by this experience show an increasing involvement of
   students during the course of the classes as well as a better engagement
   during the whole semester. In addition the using of this methodology has
   had a positive impact on the pass rate of subjects being involved
   usually lower than the average of Bachelor and University degree.}},

Abstract = {{Until now it is recognised that distance courses for medical education
   are more suitable for theoretical concepts, most online resources being
   scripts and textbooks. Practice is essential for a doctor but
   development of practical skills in multinational environments takes time
   and costs for mobility. The present paper is offering solutions for
   stimulating resident learning by new approaches, as the development of
   an innovative e-training method that is able to provide the trainees
   with a range of case studies and an advanced training curriculum. This
   will function as an interactive multimedia database system containing
   full reports on patients receiving orthopedic/rehabilitation treatment
   -real clinical case studies using digital imaging (Ultrasound, Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging, Tomography) and computational gait analysis data. The
   trainee must choose the right surgical or rehabilitation protocol and
   adapt them based on the particularities of the case study
   (patient-focused interventions). The training material is accessed via a
   standard web browser, which provides an integrated multilingual on-line
   learning environment. The presentation tier is adapted to include
   additional data provided by specific modern investigation methods,
   including medical imaging, video files of motion analysis, graphs of
   forces, muscle and joint reactions, numerical data, contact pressure
   diagrams, etc.
   Case studies will be in the form of full reports on patients in
   orthopedic/rehabilitation department (medical history, clinical signs,
   paraclinical evaluations), associated with one or more visual content
   objects (i. e. 2D, 3D images as acquisition outputs of Ultrasound,
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Tomography, plantar pressure graphs
   and video), starting with preoperative radiological images, description
   of surgery, and the outcome of the procedure (postoperative and further
   follow-up X-rays, MRIs, physical findings, contact pressure pattern of
   the patient gait) -60 case studies. The system will provide a feedback
   by showing students the correct diagnosis and how to arrive at it with
   minimal cost.
   The trainer takes ownership of maintaining a case study with the ability
   to update it online with timely or relevant information. Students as
   part of the curriculum are required to view individual profiles,
   brainstorm ideas proposed within them, evaluate key discussion points
   and draw conclusions from those discussions. Assessment will be done by
   multiple choice test and case studies that will be solved by the
   trainees. Interactivity allows trainees to test their knowledge and
   provides immediate feedback using images and cases that they could
   encounter in clinical practice. In this way educators will no longer
   serve mainly as the distributors of content, but will become
   facilitators of learning; learners will have control over content,
   learning sequence, pace of learning, time, and often media, allowing
   them to tailor their experiences to meet their personal learning
   objectives. The tagging of multimodal and interdisciplinary content is
   appropriate for the completion of realistic cases and will allow the
   users to perform most clinical decision-making procedures in a simulated
   environment, in natural language.}},

Abstract = {{Human beings have an extraordinary ability to conjure up mental stories.
   Here we provide theoretical background on the application of conceptual
   blending storytelling {[}1] to design fiction {[}2], and suggest that
   double-scope stories can provide a pedagogical framework to imagine the
   near future of information technologies. Imagining and communicating
   beyond the incremental is crucial to the dissemination of actual
   innovation.
   Suppose that Charlie Chaplin wants to make an omelette and realises that
   his fridge has run out of both energy and fresh eggs. He looks at the
   empty pan over the cooker and feels disappointed. That is one mental
   story, with roles, actions, goals, agents, and objects. At that very
   moment, he remembers of the chicken scene from ``Sunnyside{''} {[}3]. In
   that story, Chaplin gets a fried egg on the run by holding a chicken
   over a pan. This second story clashes with the story he actually lives.
   It is a false story and Chaplin should not make the mistake of holding a
   chicken over a hot pan. Indeed, Chaplin doesn't get confused. ``Someone
   who is inhabiting the real story of the present and who is
   simultaneously remembering a different story can partition them, so as
   to monitor each without becoming confused about which items belong to
   which stories{''} {[}4]. Fauconnier and Turner (F\&T) {[}1] have
   characterized the human effort to activate conflicting mental structures
   as a conceptual blending.
   Let the story continue. Chaplin takes his phone and calls Pennsylvania's
   based ``Rent the Chicken{''}, a business that rents chickens for people
   who want fresh eggs from humanely raised hens. The entrepreneur promises
   a fast delivery, so the problem is partially solved. This is a story
   that fits the world we live in. Now, looking at the fridge, an idea pops
   up in Chaplin's mind. He calls ``Energy Chicken{''}, a company that
   places an intelligent microchip in the hen's body. The device transforms
   the heat produced by the hen when eggs are laid down, into electricity.
   It is a smart product that operates under remote control, so one can
   program for the time and frequency of deliveries. More eggs, more
   electricity. In times of information technology, many devices depend on
   energy transformation, like the bicycle that, when the cyclist pedals,
   transforms mechanical energy into electricity and feeds the e-bike
   battery. Also, a host of new interactions and behaviours accompany
   technological devices, such as the Philips' wireless hue lightbulb, a
   smart product that works via an intuitive remote control. You can use
   the control either to dim or change the colours of your lights, or to
   set a wake-up light alarm clock. Given this scenario, there are good
   reasons to conceive of both ``Rent the Chicken{''} and ``Chicken
   Energy{''} as part of the world we leave in. ``Energy Chicken{''},
   however, is fictional: fictional, but feasible {[}5]. No doubt, it could
   inspire a film in Chaplin's style. Not a science fiction film, but a
   digital video informed by design fiction, providing experiences that go
   beyond the incremental, beyond the next product release.
   We conclude by suggesting that, for the purpose of communicating beyond
   the incremental, two complementary abilities are relevant to
   storytelling pedagogy: to conjure up stories that run counter to the
   story we actually inhabit, and stories that, despite fictional, run
   together to the story we actually inhabit.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the results of two complementary Teaching
   Innovation Projects aimed at designing and developing multimedia
   didactic materials to help students acquire the necessary background to
   face the first-year Physics course at some of the University of Cadiz
   technical BSc degrees. The most common educational needs observed among
   such students include an insufficient background knowledge in physics
   and mathematics which result in a high number of students failing to
   learn the subject of Physics and pass the exams. A collaborative effort
   has been made among various lecturers to create didactic materials using
   different technologies (interactive whiteboard, digital drawing tablet,
   tablet PC, video camera). More specifically, 16 videos lasting 4 to 8
   minutes were developed focusing on explaining basic aspects such as the
   use of vectors in space to represent physical magnitudes, vector
   analysis, algebra, trigonometry, and geometry. The idea behind was to
   create virtual introductory and reinforcement lessons that could be
   consulted anytime by the students. The videos were made available online
   to the students, which were also asked to fill a simple online
   questionnaire about them. Results from the questionnaire show a high
   degree of acceptance among the students, which stated that the
   explanations were easy to follow (100\%), that the themes covered were
   very useful (100\%), or that they helped them to better understand the
   subject of Physics (83\%).}},

Abstract = {{This paper leverages on parallel pursuits in changes in organizational
   space and cultures and private-sector appropriation of social media
   spaces to frame the relationship between the architecture of work space
   and that of play. In the contemporary innovation-obsessed economy, a new
   corporate culture is needed, sensitized to workers' larger well-being.
   Work spaces have undergone tremendous change, as employers'
   understanding of what counts as productivity has evolved. Some companies
   are focusing on the very space within which such talent can be
   nurtured-the office. Pool tables, volleyball courts, video game
   parlours, pianos, ping-pong tables, and yoga stations are becoming a
   signature of these new labor landscapes.
   The less regulating, confining and spatially predictable a work
   environment is, the more likely it is to generate new ideas and enhance
   performance. These new labor geographies are not confined to the
   material sphere. A decade ago, corporations' instinctive response to
   social media within the work domain was to sue business-bashing
   employees to cease and desist. Today, corporations are realizing that
   these digital leisure terrains can benefit them. We see businesses
   extending their presence virtually on sites conventionally demarcated
   for online social and leisure purposes. The rise of digital labor posits
   a challenge in the design of work spaces better adapted to a temporal,
   diverse and sporadic global labor market. Furthermore, gamification has
   become a new buzzword for labor landscapes driven by the belief that by
   infusing game dynamics into the work culture, it enhances employee
   engagement and problem-solving efficacy}},

Abstract = {{The deployments of technology across the global toward efficient
   learning environment are growing rapidly. In United Kingdom educational
   system, the government is investing 1.1 million pounds in primary and
   secondary school for early programming lessoning starting from age five
   upwards. The ideology behind this innovation is to make younger
   generation linked to innovation and digital industries and improve the
   pace with the most successful education system in the world. In this
   paper, an assessment-driven educational programming tutoring system for
   young students is described in a high-level overview (which provides an
   abstract design of the main components of the proposed system), as well
   as a detailed discussion of some of the existing tutoring programming
   tools for kids. The intention will be to develop this given proposed
   design fully functional and then evaluate it in different primary
   schools from the UK and other Middle East countries. One of our main
   intended aims of this study would be to offer a suitable educational
   programming system that could ease the process of teaching and learning

Abstract = {{Nowadays it has become really difficult to separate the frontiers
   between the ``real{''} and the ``virtual{''}. We live in a world where
   millions of images are in the middle between vision and perception.
   Often we are caught by images built with perspective effects and even
   better on the anamorphosis. Starting the geometric-projecting bases of
   anamorphosis in all its aspects, the research studies and analyzes its
   applications in modern art, presenting all the possible techniques,
   traditional and innovative. But especially all we want to put the focus
   on a new development of anamorphosis which takes advantage of modern
   technology, to mention the domain of sculpture and that of design. Also
   because now is possible to surmount certain limits imposed by
   traditional techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - In recent times the relationship between social stratification
   and internet use has become more complex. In order to understand the new
   configuration of the digital divide, this paper examines the
   relationship between socioeconomic background and digital engagement
   among youths.
   Methodology/approach - This study explores digital inequalities among
   Italian teenagers from a holistic perspective. It draws on primary data
   obtained with a triangulation of methods: a survey on a representative
   sample of 2,025 high school students and 56 semi-structured interviews
   with teenagers from different social classes.
   Findings - The statistical models indicate that cultural capital and
   parents' occupational status do not associate with broader social media
   use but are positively related with online information-seeking. The
   interpretative analysis suggests that teenagers from the upper-middle
   class make sense of the internet ``vertically,{''} in affiliation with
   parental socialization, and are more concerned with capital enhancing
   activities. Instead, teenagers from less advantageous social contexts
   appropriate the internet `` horizontally,{''} jointly with peers, and
   are mostly interested in social-networking and UGC production.
   Practical implications - School track, along with parents' socioeconomic
   status and cultural capital, influences teenagers' internet use. Further
   studies could explore whether school tracking contributes to digital
   inequalities.
   Originality/value - The study extends Annette Lareau's theory of
   parenting styles and social reproduction, but also obtains innovative
   results related to digital inequalities among youth. Contrary to
   expectations, teenagers from less advantageous social backgrounds
   enrolled in vocational schools have better chances to actively
   participate in social media than teens from the upper-middle class in
   academic-oriented high schools.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study examines the implementation of a community-level
   Sustainable Broadband Adoption Program (SBA) under the Broadband
   Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), a national public policy
   program meant to expand broadband deployment and adoption under the
   American Recovery Act of 2009, and administered by the National
   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) at the U.S.
   Department of Commerce. The California Connects Program (CC) was
   administered by the Foundation for California Community Colleges (FCCC).
   Methodology/approach - This chapter focuses on one part of CC's efforts
   to expand broadband adoption among the most underserved Californians
   through collaboration with the Great Valley Center (GVC). CC-GVC
   provided basic computer and Internet classes to disconnected populations
   with low-literacy levels, and primarily in Spanish, through
   community-based organizations, public schools, public libraries, small
   businesses, and others in the Central Valley, an 18 county rural region
   with a high concentration of digital destitute populations. The program
   worked with under-resourced local community institutions with a range of
   poor technology resources and that operated under variable set of
   social, economic, political, and institutional conditions. Through
   inductive, process-oriented, and explanatory case study research, the
   structure, strategy, and training approach of CC was examined. Content
   and theme analysis of primary and secondary qualitative and quantitative
   data involving the program's leadership, direct service providers,
   partners, participants, and nonparticipants was conducted. This involved
   a sample of 600 in-depth and short, structured and unstructured
   interviews and focus groups, archival and participant observation notes.
   Findings It was found that CC-GVC was able to meet uncertainty and
   operated with low institutional resources and paucity of linguistically
   appropriate teaching resources for new entrants through a flexible
   leadership approach that adapted to the social situation and was open to
   innovation. Community technology trainers were also able to engage those
   without or little direct experience with computers and with low-literacy
   levels with a linguistically appropriate and culturally sensitive
   step-by-step teaching approach that empowered and met people where they
   are. The author expands non-adoption models to include structural
   barriers in the analysis of the disconnected. It is argued that
   non-adoption is a result of evolving inequality processes fueled by
   poverty and under-resourced community development institutions and that
   teaching and learning is a social and institutional process that takes
   trust and time.
   Practical Implications CC shows that even the most disadvantaged can be
   empowered to learn-to-learn to use computers and can begin to function
   online and gain benefit under the most extreme institutional and
   economic conditions, but it takes more time and resources than providers
   expected and the Recovery Act provided.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper it is presented an innovation project that has been
   applied on several subjects during the current academic year 2014-15 in
   the University of Valencia.
   It has been aimed to promote, through web 2.0 and 3.0 (semantic wiki),
   the open publication of data generated by an educational community in
   order to enable new services and applications from them, increasing
   collaborative learning. Social relationships and interactions between
   people in the acquisition of knowledge have been recognized as the basic
   elements in learning theories. Ability to work in groups to achieve
   common goals appears as transversal competence learning at all levels of
   the education. Wikis play a leading role in educational settings,
   providing systems that incorporate a tool for performing learning
   activities. Furthermore, using semantic technologies in social networks
   provide new additional powers to those provided by the content subject.
   Moreover, the use of these technologies, promotes the interest and
   motivation of the student through group work, and therefore the
   acquisition of knowledge related to the subject. Finally, these
   technologies will facilitate dissemination of the work done by the
   construction of digital learning objects (web resources) that allow, on

Abstract = {{The pace at which a technology moves from ``emerging{''} to
   ``production{''} continues to increase. The support systems around that
   technology must match that pace. One recent example is the use of 3D
   modeling, visualization and printing within research and education. Once
   the realm of Hollywood, it is now completely feasible for an art history
   researcher to create a high-resolution 3D scan of an ancient sculpture,
   or for a medical student to work with a 3D print of a tumored organ.
   We've worked to build an open-source digital library capable of keeping
   up with the demands placed on it by rapid innovation. By utilizing a
   cloud-computing platform with dynamic metadata capabilities and
   pluggable support for new technologies, this library aims to make sure
   storage and categorization is never a hindrance to innovation. Our
   platform challenges many of the existing conventions of digital asset
   repositories, by flipping to a user-centric, content-delivery focused
   approach. This allows us to be responsive and flexible as users express
   their needs.}},

Abstract = {{In all cases new educational technologies are based on the processes
   related to the change of the educational paradigm from accredited
   qualification to certified skills.
   This educational paradigm affects one of the fundamental cornerstone
   structures of higher education the university library. Practical
   training of students should no longer be based on the passive use of
   available library resources, regardless of their degree of digitization
   and the applications of cloud technologies. In all cases students'
   practical skills are required not only when handling information and
   knowledge, but in order to become active participants in their
   presentation, analysis, preprocessing, brokering and dissemination.
   At the University of Library Studies and Information Technologies in
   Sofia, Bulgaria, a model of such inclusion of a library in the
   educational process has been applied by the Laboratory of Library
   Technologies, Communications and Informing (LibLab), which was launched
   in 2013.
   LibLab's fields of activity are associated with the formation of
   bibliographic culture, the application of modern library technologies,
   communication exchange and information literacy. The main objectives of
   the laboratory are oriented towards maximizing the use of its resources,
   in order to provide specialized training in various academic
   disciplines. With its activity the Laboratory aims at balancing between
   the development of innovative ideas and the achievement of benefits by
   applying them in real environment, as well as supporting the
   implementation of new educational approaches in the learning process.
   At SULSIT combining tradition with innovation is a priority in the
   learning process of BA, MA and PhD students. The University is an
   established national centre for scientific exchange of knowledge and
   there are opportunities for experimentation, research work and free
   choice in applying interactive approaches in the learning process. It is
   the LibLab model that not only facilitates professional communication,
   bursts of creativity and the innovation of the academic community, but
   it also supports most actively the opportunities for continuing
   education and further qualification of professionals in the field of
   library and information.}},

Abstract = {{The topic of rural isolated schools (based on the mountain and in
   islands) is a common issue in European countries (Italy, Ireland,
   Scotland and England, Germany and France). The normative situation is
   different from country to country and this aspect has an impact on the
   profile of the schools. Nevertheless, a common feature emerges: the
   ``multilevel classroom{''}, where students of different age and school
   level work together. In many cases the multilevel classroom is the
   reason for carrying personalised teaching activities and a model of
   teaching that abandons the traditional face-to-face lesson.
   The issue regarding this kind of school are fourfold: ICT
   infrastructure, school organization, teachers training and innovative
   didactic.
   INDIRE, namely National Institute for the Documentation, Innovation and
   Research based in Florence, has observed for five years teaching
   practices of isolated schools, with particular attention to the mountain
   and the small islands where the small schools are mainly based. From
   observation of three main network of schools (Marettimo, on the Egadi
   island; a network of schools in Liguria, a network of school in Friuli
   Venezia Giulia and a network of school in Emilia Romagna and Toscana)
   emerged two main models of teaching within this kind of schools.
   A common learning environment, where two or more classrooms work
   together on a common school subject project using different kind of
   technological setting. In this case distance learning is complementary.
   The joining link between physical place (classroom) and the
   videoconferencing time is a shared virtual learning environment used to
   collaborate or share of digital contents between students or between
   teachers.
   The shared lesson, based on every day distance learning activities. Two
   classrooms (with students of different levels) of different schools
   using videconferencing system on a daily basis sharing the same lesson.
   Small size group of students of the same school level work together. In
   this case technologies are essential and the main methodologies used are
   the flipped classroom, webquest and some kinds of evaluation and
   self-evaluation between the two classrooms.}},

Abstract = {{Teachers need to be prepared to become adaptive experts able to make the
   most of technology with their students. Inquiry projects within
   pre-service teacher education are one of the best ways to establish such
   reflective practice.
   This paper illustrates innovative best practice within a leading program
   of pre-service teacher education that can be studied online as well as
   on campus. In 2014 a personalized learning Inquiry process connected and
   empowered fifty-five online learning student teachers living throughout
   New Zealand. Online study was blended with a one day on-site workshop.
   This Inquiry project was situated within one of the final two courses of
   a 15 month program.
   As the course coordinator and teacher-researcher the author was able to
   experience, observe and listen first hand to the perspectives of these
   students contributing to her research into flexible and distance
   learning. The students' Inquiry projects provided personal ownership, a
   shared deep engagement and a powerful group experience of being
   connected, confident and collaborative learners and teachers. More than
   one third of these future school teachers focused on technology to
   enhance learning in primary schools.
   This presentation will share a sample of the students' Inquiry `Big
   Questions' and `Presentations' from within such current topics as
   `Modern Learning Environments', `Bring Your Own Device' (BYOD) and
   `I-pads in the classroom'. The students were required to record their
   experiences, findings and reflections in a Journal of their choice and
   support each other on line. These and other online interactions form the
   evidence base for the research.
   Within the final week of their Inquiry the students prepared and shared
   within an online Forum site a `Contextual Statement' summarizing their
   Inquiry journey along with a `Presentation' using a digital tool of
   their choice and sought required peer feedback. A range of Inquiry
   presentation screen shots provide illustrations. The peer and lecturer
   reciprocal learning and teaching experienced was significant as was the
   self-motivation to put this learning into practice on their final five
   week Professional Practice in a school and when they became teachers the
   following school term.
   How an Inquiry based approach is best included in other programs will be
   discussed during the presentation, along with possible future research.
   As new qualifications are designed and blended e-learning courses
   updated the presenter suggests student feedback is fed forward to ensure
   courses are engaging and maximize the learning for all involved.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Storytelling Pedagogical Star' is a model for the pedagogical
   evaluation of Educational Digital Storytelling Environments (EDSE). It
   is based on modern social and constructivist views of learning and is
   consisted of sixteen pedagogical dimensions, namely: collaborative
   learning, creativity and innovation, multiple representations,
   motivation, cultural sensitivity, gender equality, cognitive effort,
   feedback, learner control, flexibility, learner activity, valuation of
   previous knowledge, sharply-focused goal orientation, experiential
   value, knowledge organization and metacognition. This paper focuses on
   the exploration of the perceptions of primary education teachers on this
   model concerning its capacity to evaluate successfully the pedagogical
   soundness of an EDSE. More specifically, the perceptions of 33 primary
   school level education teachers were investigated through a
   questionnaire - including close and open-ended questions-within the
   context of a workshop where the `Digital Storytelling Pedagogical Star'
   was presented and discussed. The analysis of the results showed that the
   proposed model was positively evaluated by the teachers.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Pre-clinical practices in the subject of orthodontics in
   the degree of Dentistry at the University of Valencia, Spain, are
   necessary for teaching how to achieve a good diagnosis and treatment
   plan. Orthodontics plaster model analysis is one of the most important
   parts in the diagnosis of dental malocclusions in orthodontics.
   Objectives: Firstly, to develop three-dimensional animations for
   improving teaching diagnosis in orthodontics. Secondly, to assess the
   students the innovative teaching tools. Methods: Students analyzed
   dental malocclusion in the three planes of space and assessed the new
   teaching tools, comparing them with traditional teaching, using a
   questionnaire of 10 items with a 5 points Likert scale. Results:
   Students could perform the analysis of orthodontics plaster models
   digitally using new three-dimensional animations. The questionnaire got
   great results with an average score of 40.2 (CI 95\% 36.25-44.1) without
   significant differences between men and women. Conclusions:
   Three-dimensional animations make teaching and learning easier for our
   students. We feel that students can improve their diagnose and treatment
   plan with three-dimensional animations. Students and teachers assessed
   the new teaching tools positively.}},

Abstract = {{Age experiences are constructed in the way we address a certain
   age-group. People easily self stereotype and depersonalize themselves.
   ``I am too old to learn{''} or ``old dogs cannot learn new tricks{''},
   are comments often heard in the context of technology in use.
   One of the largest issues today is the reshaping of the population
   pyramids and the rapid proportional growth of the senior population
   especially in Japan and Finland. The ageing phenomenon is also
   interesting because of its role as a change agent in the society. The
   nature and meaning of being senior is changing. Cohorts approaching the
   somewhat stigmatized old age today do not fit the perception of previous
   generations. Future seniors are described to be healthier, better
   educated and more active, have more money to spend and be more open to
   digital technologies than the previous generations. The so called ``baby
   boomers{''} are expected to have an important impact on the global
   economy. They can also be trailblazers in reshaping stereotypes and
   attitudes related to seniors as learners and users of digital
   technologies.
   A promising trend reveals a change in the generational gap in technology
   use. While computers still remain the most used devices to access
   Internet among seniors, tablet computers have bridged the generational
   digital divide substantially. According to a global mobile consumer
   survey, adoption of tablet computers among people over 55 years has
   risen remarkably. Interestingly this same age group is the fastest
   growing demographic segment on social media sites.
   This article is a part of an EU funded study called AHEAD that addresses
   seniors in five countries.
   The article will elaborate upon the following issues: seniors as
   innovative technology users, social elements are essential in the
   learning process among seniors; creation of an experiential context
   encourages seniors to learn to use digital technology.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Teachers in the bachelor program nursing could have an impact on the
   shortage of geriatric nurses by influencing the students choice for
   working with frail elderly. Positive communications of all nursing
   teachers may not only have a positive effect on the attitude of students
   towards the care of older adults(1), it may also help them to make a
   deliberate choice in this direction(2).
   Relevance:
   Based on low attendance at training initiatives, nursing teachers can be
   assumed to have little interest in geriatric care.
   Aim:
   With our innovative awareness tool, we want teachers to discover the
   challenges of this nursing field and hereby enlarge the awareness of
   their own attitude and functioning with regard to geriatric care.
   Participants:
   All four university colleges of the Associatie KULeuven, Belgium
   collaborate on the development of this project.
   Methods:
   The digital tool guides the participant through the life of an older
   women in her home environment, portrayed by herself, her children and
   the general practitioner. The participant is faced with potential
   nursing problems and the wishes of this person. He is invited to reflect
   by means of questions throughout the story. Comments can be shared with
   fellow users via built-in social media.
   The choice for a real person (3), the use of film fragments (4),
   learning by reflecting individually and from other users reactions (5)
   are evidence based principles integrated in the tool. The different film
   fragments can be used as didactic material which may be an additional
   motivation to use the tool (6).
   Evaluation:
   An initial evaluation is scheduled for May 2015. Fifty nursing teachers
   will use the tool and judge it by means of an online questionnaire. The
   user experience and the usability of the tool will be questioned as well
   as possible influencing factors such as the digital literacy and the
   professional experience in geriatric care. Based on this feedback, the
   tool will be adjusted and finished. Early 2016 this instrument will be
   introduced to all the nursing teachers of the Associatie KULeuven and
   re-evaluated.
   Conclusion:
   Our aim is to present in two years a final product of Geraware that
   meets the objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing accessibility to a wide variety of anatomy teaching resources
   online has made learning complicated for students, due to the large
   quantity, mixed quality and lack of review by professionals. Therefore,
   we set out to develop a one-stop E-tutorial, which encompasses gross and
   surface anatomy with clinical applications and relevance highlighted,
   with content verified by medical and digital professionals.
   The University of Glasgow's medical curriculum was reviewed to identify
   areas of teaching that required extra tailored resources to aid in areas
   of complex anatomy. An Anatomy E-tutorial on `Hand-and-Wrist' was
   created using Articulate Storyline 2 software. The tutorial we created
   centered on the use of Anatomy. TV gross anatomical images. In addition,
   self-captured surface anatomy images and videos using
   digital-photography were incorporated into the package. Unique features
   of Articulate Storyline were utilized to ensure the users remained
   engaged throughout the E-Tutorial.
   We successfully created a fully interactive anatomy tutorial on hand and
   wrist anatomy using a novel software package. This was tailored to
   students undertaking the Glasgow Medical School curriculum, but has
   relevance to all those who need to obtain an in-depth knowledge of hand
   and wrist anatomy. Student evaluation will be presented on the
   effectiveness of this type of tool for learning anatomy of this region.
   This innovative use of Articulate Storyline 2, developed by students,
   for students, has created an excellent revision tool bringing together
   key elements of the medical curriculum in a single, easily accessible
   format. This will benefit student engagement with a complex area of
   anatomy.
   Produced by students and tailored to the integrated anatomy teaching,
   this product will prove beneficial for our colleagues and other health
   professionals alike.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing development of a wide range of emerging technologies -as
   pointed out in the NMC Horizon Reports in Higher Education (2002 until
   2015)-, together with the emergence and redesigning of new teaching
   scenarios and modalities (MOOC, mobile learning, informal campus
   environments, experiential learning spaces, among others), as well as
   the increasing use of technology by youngsters in today's society are
   becoming important factors that affect deeply in the way that education
   is conceived, and therefore, it also becomes necessary to find out new
   ways to design educational programs in all educational levels but
   specially in higher education due to its relevance in current and future
   society because of the economic, political and social crisis in the
   world.
   The arrival of technology at universities is not a recent matter and
   currently, its integration is still in progress (Sandholtz and Reilly,
   2004; Sangra \& Gonzalez, 2004), however, its pedagogical application in
   these new training scenarios and teaching modalities is a complex
   process that still needs to be in continuous and profound study
   (Aduviri, 2012) in order to evaluate properly its effectiveness in the
   students' learning as well as in teacher's professional development.
   Technology integration may allow the educator to improve their teaching
   methodologies as well as their pedagogical and digital competences, but
   not with the purpose of making a technological innovation, but a
   pedagogical innovation with the support of technologies, creating then,
   new pedagogical knowledge and learning to properly develop in the
   current knowledge society (Cabero, 2005; Hargreaves, 2003, 2011;
   Salinas, 2008). These pedagogical integration processes of the
   Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the university
   teaching might also imply having a wider vision of them, understanding
   ICT not only as a Technology for Learning and Knowledge (TLK) (Sancho,
   2008), but also as a Technology for Empowerment and Participation (TEP)
   of teachers and students (Adell \& Castaneda, 2012); Reig \& Vilchez,
   2013).
   In this paper we aim to provide a preliminary review of the factors that
   affect this pedagogical integration of TEP in higher education teaching,
   on the basis of a cross-case analysis of two parallel studies that are
   currently being held since 2010 in two Iberoamerican contexts: Barcelona
   and Mexico City. The data collection was based on in-depth interviews to
   teachers and managers of the participant universities. Both studies
   agree on the need of analyzing personal barriers of the university
   teachers, as well as the resistance to change (Robbins and Judge, 2013;
   Tejada, 1998), which arise from various sources such as their
   institutional context, the educational system, the teachers themselves
   and the educational policies in higher education that fall on teacher's
   developing and training regarding the integration of TEP in higher
   education (Fabry and Higgs, 1997; Jakstiene, 2011; Prestridge, 2012).
   Additionally, in both studies it can be identified those factors and
   conditions that contribute to a good integration of TEP in higher
   education and, therefore, they should become key aspects for teacher's
   training in the 21st century. The results of this cross-case analysis
   also aim to contribute in improving the models of the pedagogical
   integration of technology in university teaching.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the well-known poor performances of students in Mathematics,
   we set out to develop online educational software - based on the theory
   of self-regulation - integrating a virtual tutor and tridimensional
   visualization, aimed at students in the 4th year of Ensino Basico
   (Primary School). We want to create a new tool for work/study (a
   functioning prototype which can be readily used in other subjects and
   different school years) which allows the student to learn, develop, and
   consolidate the concepts taught in the classroom, by being able to, in
   real time and while tasks are being performed, understand one's mistakes
   through the intervention of the virtual tutor (digital agent) which
   follows, explains and justifies in ludic form. The sample will consist
   of ten classes. Data collection will be done through a database which
   can be accessed by the teachers. For validation, we shall verify the
   problem solving strategies regarding the proposed syllabus Geometry and
   Measures (GM4). It is an instance of development research divided into
   sub-studies, resulting, therefore, in multivariate methodology.}},

   university on a large scale is a challenging and complex change
   management process. This paper presents a case study of a German

   provided by an e-learning competence center for faculty, staff and
   students to foster the uptake of new educational designs with digital
   media. Furthermore it presents relevant findings from an investigation
   on the general uptake of these ``enrichment possibilities{''} across the

   implementation as seen from the point of view of lecturers and of
   students - and where the two perspectives possibly interact. Conclusions
   and recommendations drawn from this case study will inform stakeholders

Abstract = {{We live in a society full of digital and programmable objects. In this
   context, being code-literate involves an inescapable requirement for any
   citizen of the XXI century. We believe that a person is code-literate
   when the ability to read and write in the language of computers and to
   think computationally has been developed. So it is not surprising that
   computational thinking (CT) is being located at the focus of educational
   innovation as a set of problem solving skills to be acquired by new
   generations of students. However, we still lack international consensus
   on a definition of CT, nor a clear idea of how to incorporate CT to our
   education systems at various levels. Similarly, there is a striking gap
   about how to measure and assess CT. In reply, this paper presents the
   design of a Computational Thinking Test aimed at Spanish students
   between 12 and 13 years old (grades K-7 \& K-8): we describe the
   guidelines on which whole test and each of its items have been designed,
   as well as the content validation process through expert's judgment
   procedure. Through this process, the initial version of the test (40
   items length) was depurated to a 28 items version, which is currently
   being applied to the target population. Finally, possible limitations of
   the test and possible concurrency of the same with other international
   evidence on computational thinking assessment are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recently at the University of Glasgow, an exciting collaboration between
   the Laboratory of Human Anatomy, School of Life Sciences and the School
   of Medicine resulted in the creation of an elective Student Selected
   Component (SSC) entitled ``Development of Anatomy E-tutorials{''}. It
   was run by anatomical and digital experts and was offered as a five-week
   intensive module to create E-tutorials for challenging areas of anatomy.
   One such group which participated in this SSC developed an interactive
   E-tutorial based on cardiac anatomy and imaging.
   Referencing the intended learning outcomes from the first two years thus
   far in the medical curriculum at the University of Glasgow, a new and
   innovative way to approach the understanding and presentation of
   required anatomical knowledge and understanding was developed using
   Articulate Storyline 2. The intended end-user was second year medical
   students who have undertaken training in cardiac anatomy through a
   spiral-integrated curriculum. However, those required to have an
   understanding of cardiac anatomy for their professional field can also
   benefit.
   An interactive E-Tutorial of cardiac anatomy and relevant imaging was
   created using photogrammetry of actual cadaveric prosections
   (professionally dissected specimens) from the regular stock in the
   Laboratory of Human Anatomy at the University of Glasgow. Histological
   slides from the extensive anatomical collection were also digitally
   captured for incorporation into the E-tutorial.
   The tutorial was developed into nine sub-topics, making extensive use of
   images from cadaveric prosections, creative commons images, custom
   illustrations and interactive 3D representations of prosections. 3D
   assets were generated using photogrammetry techniques and free or
   open-source software, from cadaveric prosections currently used in
   anatomy teaching. Focus was placed on gross anatomy, and the use of
   clinical cardiac imaging techniques. Following each sub-topic a short
   quiz was created for immediate end-user feedback on the effectiveness of
   their learning. End-user evaluation is currently being assessed. We
   shall present the development of the E-tutorial using Articulate
   Storyline 2, and how best to incorporate anatomical material to develop
   an in-depth appreciation for acquiring the skills and knowledge of
   expected intended learning outcomes.
   Interactivity in learning and testing within the E-tutorial is paramount
   in the constructivist approach, and this feature sets it apart from more
   traditional media in education. Our E-tutorial is a detailed and
   self-contained resource and has application in supporting the learning
   and revision of cardiac anatomy. The simple framework developed for
   generating 3D assets is extensible to other anatomical areas. Indeed,
   with the next generation of digital natives, this provides an
   anatomically and digitally validated resource tailored not only for
   medical students, but allied health professionals in enhancing their
   knowledge and understanding of cardiac anatomy.}},

   Today's students have a shorter attention span compared to those of old
   days. Besides, in ESL classes students may lack schemata or background
   knowledge on topics that are discussed in classrooms or experience
   difficulties understanding input due to their limited vocabulary
   repertoires. While such difficulties required double efforts from
   teachers in the past, instructors today are blessed with technologies
   that can facilitate the task for them and help them design more
   learner-centered activities. The IT knowledge that today's students
   bring to classrooms can also help transform the learning environment and
   inspire teachers to engineer activities that inspire motivation and
   engagement on the part of their learners. in addition, the availability
   of mobile technologies and network broad-band connections in most
   schools is another push factor that can enhance acquisition and shift
   attention from teaching towards learning. However, technology comes at a
   cost. Teachers who intend to use IT and mobile technology in classrooms
   may be faced with a myriad challenges that can fill them with
   disappointment and push them to drop the idea altogether. Besides,
   digital technology is not available to all learners around the world.
   Thus, a gap between learners is still present even when mobile devices
   and internet connection are getting less and less expensive.
   Nevertheless, combining the use of these technologies with
   self-regulated learning instruction and self-efficacy beliefs as well as
   implementing some guidelines for students' use of mobile technologies
   during classes can lead to optimal results. furthermore, teachers who
   teach in areas where students do not have ubiquitous access to smart
   technology need to find more innovative ways of incorporating technology
   into their classrooms. Drawing on our classroom experiences and research
   experiments that we carried out in our classes, this presentation is
   going to make the case for the importance of BYOD instruction (bring
   your own device instruction) and Youtube videos in maximizing students'
   engagement and enhancing acquisition in classes of English and History.
   This paper will also share some interesting suggestions on how enhancing
   students' self-regulated learning skills and self-efficacy beliefs can
   facilitate the use of BYOD instruction inside English classes and peer
   teaching using Youtube videos in history classes. The presenters also
   intend to share the results and implications of their experiments that
   tested the effect of using BYOD instruction and Youtube videos on
   students' engagement and learning with the audience.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the labour market has become a highly competitive environment,
   especially for young graduates. More than 20\% of the EU (European
   Union) young graduates are unemployed and, despite their educational
   background and performances, it is ever more difficult for them to prove
   that the competences and skills acquired during higher education years
   are those needed by the employers. This disturbing percentage comes as
   no surprise since the last years' financial crisis has brought about an
   increase in the overall unemployment rate.
   Recent OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)
   studies shed light on a crucial question which arises now: will a skill
   upgrade in the European labour force help to increase the employment
   rate, especially among the young? In the digital age we have been living
   for some time already, possessing digital skills is, undoubtedly, highly
   regarded by potential employers. Nevertheless, according to a newly
   developed Digital Skills Indicator, based on the Digital Competence
   Framework, 23\% of the EU population has no digital skills (2012), and
   47\% of the EU population has insufficient digital skills.
   In this context, the idea of adapting teaching and learning to the
   labour market requirements was materialized in an 18-month
   European-funded project (www. adapt2jobs.ro), which is aimed at
   developing new teaching tools (computer-based instruction) in order to
   upgrade not only basic competencies and skills corresponding to the
   higher education study field, but also to develop ICT (Information and
   Communication Technology) skills, by innovatively delivering knowledge
   content. The partnership between a university and an ICT company has
   been materialized in seven digitized courses, available on an online
   platform especially designed for a group of 210 students. These students
   have been selected in order to test and assess the teaching tools
   developed during the implementation months of the project. Blended
   learning gives our students the opportunity to acquire knowledge and to
   experience computer-assisted learning. During the testing period,
   students will complete an online survey which focuses on their learning
   performances. Learning effectiveness indicators will be equally
   designed, tested and measured.
   Once the results of the project available, they will be analyzed and
   charted and will lay the foundation of the next generation of higher
   education programmes offered by the university, in line with the labour
   market changes and requirements. This will mean teaching what our
   graduates will need in their future professional career, and, at the
   same time, it will mean boosting innovation and creativity in teaching
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a work related to using Web3D-based technology at k-12
   levels and stimulating individuals' lifelong learning is presented. This
   work has addressed a gap on showing longitudinal investigation results
   referent to stimulating young children's lifelong learning with support
   of emerging digital technologies since k-12 levels and its impact on
   individuals' lifelong development. Based on qualitative data collected
   through action-research and ethnographic techniques in natural settings,
   a longitudinal investigation is described through a case study. It
   presents a former student's lifelong learning and professional
   development based on how he has used scientific knowledge integrated
   with computer science features such as interactive computer graphics and
   computer programming techniques and tools to create complex 3D digital
   environments' content (3DDE). As a qualitative result, with support of
   innovation diffusion theory, computational thinking, human computer
   interaction, and instructional scaffolding, this former student's
   trajectory has showed a potential for stimulating ones' lifelong
   learning and cognitive abilities enhancements through using Web3D
   technology. In addition, this work has brought about empirical
   possibilities for stimulating cross-disciplinary collaborative teachers'
   training and teaching in service based on diffusing advanced scientific
   and 3DDE knowledge with innovation and promoting sociotechnical
   development since k-12 levels.}},

Abstract = {{Online education can use extensive search engines, digital libraries and
   social networking tools to find, access and share information, resources
   and materials. At the higher education administration level online
   education can streamline some administrative aspects of teaching as
   marking mass communication to students, uploading assessments
   (non-hardcopy model), automated marking, setting-up collaborate groups
   and facilitating final grade allocations. However with this evolution
   more creative and innovative teaching and assessment methods are
   required, especially considering the exercise and sport science is a
   discipline with a significant emphasis on the development of practical
   skills with motor elements as well as in its current form represents a
   technologically dependent discipline. The paper will describe how the
   program evolved from an internal model of delivery with minimal
   e-learning dependence to a predominantly an e-learning dependent
   external model as the clients moved to predominantly external students.
   The current ratio of internal to external is currently 1: 3
   respectively. Outcomes of the trend to externalisation was the
   development of the first external exercise and sport science degree in
   Australia, development of significant learning infrastructure (both
   human and technology), redesign of laboratories and classrooms to
   capture real time lectures and practical as well as for storage in
   digital libraries, constant upgrading of LearnLine functionality
   (technology enhanced learning) and enhanced interactive functionality
   when staff-student and student-student communicate. A decisional balance
   model was also implemented to assess the positive and negative outcome
   when utilising of e-learning/technology enhanced learning.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, The University of Edinburgh has been languishing
   towards the bottom of national student satisfaction surveys for
   assessment and feedback. More significant focus is being placed within
   the institution on formative `assessment for learning' and ensuring that
   students have structured iterative feedback and personalised learning
   opportunity.
   The presentation will focus upon a pilot of Adaptive Learning for two
   courses within GeoSciences, Global Tectonics and the Rock Cycle and
   Introduction to Geophysics. Students in each class are taught half of
   the subject material using Adaptive technology in addition to lectures
   and practical's, and the remainder using lectures and practical's only.
   Some students are taking both courses as part of their programme. This
   segmentation provides a layering of control groups for improved
   comparisons of outcomes and confidence of any impact.
   Central Information Services have provided some initial funding for
   buying teaching staffs time to help prepare course content and structure
   the online materials. The project was planned with fairly ambitious time
   lines, allowing four months from the initial decision to proceed through
   to system launch.
   An interesting aspect of the pilot is that the course lecturers are
   using the adaptive tool in differing ways. One aims to use the material
   to support lectures, while the second approach will be based upon a
   flipped classroom model.
   The University are partnering with CogBooks who provide an adaptive
   learning solution. This is the first UK implementation of the product,
   which is hosted on `cloud' Amazon Web servers. The pilot was initiated
   following some market analysis and reference to existing market
   consultancy materials: `Education Growth Advisors'. This analysis
   `Learning to Adapt' {[}1]
   The adaptive learning tool continuously captures click track data
   relating to students use of text, graphical and animated content. A
   dashboard of usage and students progress through online material is
   available to both staff and students in real time, so that students can
   monitor their own activity and staff can re-enforce or adapt teaching
   face to face as necessary.
   Throughout the pilot, the system allows students to communicate with
   tutors online, and to receive customized feedback. In addition, regular
   automated tests within the CogBooks system provide the students with an
   opportunity to master the subject content, gain confidence, and receive
   automated feedback and direction toward recommended underpinning content
   and reading material where required. This mechanism offers exploration
   of ` flipped or inverted' class pedagogy where student preparations
   prior to class is considered key by commentators such as Cynthia Brame.
   {[}2]
   141 students are participating during semester 2, 2015, with the two
   adaptive releases already successfully underway. During and after the
   pilot students and staff are being surveyed to capture empirical data
   relating to the value and satisfaction they attribute to the adaptive
   solution. By June 2015, student exam results will also be available for
   comparison and evidence of impact upon results.
   The presentation aims to outline the planning involved and the
   communication to students in advance of the pilot. The student survey
   data will be presented both from responses during and post pilot.
   Student videoed interviews will be used to provide some real student
   perceptions, particularly focusing upon their comments relating to the
   personalised learning experience and the differing pedagogic uses of the
   technology. The final anonymous exam outcomes will additionally be
   reflected upon in the presentation.
   Pilot findings will be reported to the Universities senior Learning and
   Teaching Committee who are keen to see evidence of impact on student
   satisfaction, and to consider widening the adaptive approach within
   other subject disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years many institutions are looking to explore the potential
   benefits of using innovative technology to stimulate pedagogic
   innovation. The `flipped classroom' has become more common as a blended

   subject material in advance of face to face discussion or focus on
   threshold concepts.
   The presentation will focus upon a pilot of Adaptive Learning for two
   courses within GeoSciences, Global Tectonics and the Rock Cycle and
   Introduction to Geophysics. Students in each class are taught half of

   monitor their own activity and staff can re-enforce or adapt teaching
   face to face as necessary.
   141 students participated during semester 2, 2015, with the two adaptive
   releases and corresponding surveys successfully completed. During and
   after the pilot students and staff were surveyed to capture empirical
   data relating to the value and satisfaction they attribute to the
   adaptive solution and the differing pedagogic approaches taken by
   teaching staff. By June 2015, student exam results will also be
   available for comparison and evidence of impact upon results.
   The focus of the presentation will be specifically looking at the
   differing pedagogic approaches taken and comparison of student survey
   data from each course, aiming to show evidence to demonstrate impact
   upon student behaviour, satisfaction and learning outcomes. In addition
   we will highlight how the different pedagogic approaches required a
   different approach to content planning and quality assurance, as using a
   flipped classroom model for Introduction to Geophysics meant that
   students were interacting with subject content prior to lectures and
   practical's, and the content therefore needed to be self contained,
   clear and rigorously quality assured.
   Pilot findings will be reported to the Universities senior Learning and
   Teaching Committee who are keen to see evidence of impact on student's
   learning experience, and to consider widening the adaptive approach
   within other subject disciplines.}},

   banished from the classrooms because they are deemed to hinder students'
   concentration and encourage secondary activities.
   By transforming their personal use into an interactive means of learning

Abstract = {{The current concept of digital literacy was introduced by Paul Gilster
   (1997). As emphasized by Gilster, digital literacy is much more than
   mastering technical skills (Gilster, 1997). Digital literacies may be
   viewed within the scholarship of New Literacy Studies (NLS), in which
   literacy is considered a social practice rather than a universal skill.
   This definition relies on Brian Street's definition of literacy as ``a
   shorthand for the social practices and conceptions of reading and
   writing{''} (Street 1984). Within the framework of NLS it is assumed
   that literacy is a critical social practice that is constructed in
   everyday interactions across local contexts.
   Electronic or digital media, such as the internet, require a higher
   level of literacy than traditional textual literacy (Machet, 2002).
   Increasingly children and adolescents are exposed to digital input, and
   more reading and composing is conducted online than paper-based text.
   There is also a marked change in today's learners, we are teaching
   children for jobs that do not yet exist. In Prensky's terms they are
   digital natives, who think and process information differently. Vosloo
   actually refers to young people as ``generation text{''} and the ``thumb
   tribe{''}.
   This paper examines children's reading practices. What are their digital
   literacy reading practices? What are they reading? How are they reading?
   And what are the possible implications for their careers as readers?}},

Abstract = {{Digital inclusion has recently become a concern of society and there are
   many re-sources to promote digital literacy. However, only the access to
   new technologies and digital literacy are no longer sufficient to deal
   with the current challenges, as they have also require a high level of
   Digital Proficiency. Digital Proficiency measures how effectively
   individuals and organizations deal with digital technol-ogy. Individuals
   use technology for their own benefit and organizations use it to serve
   their external customers and employees (internal customers). Technology
   has influenced every aspect of our lives, from communication,
   collaboration and learning to information. It allows individuals and
   organizations to innovate, solve problems, improve productivity, make
   decisions and even win competitions. There are certification methods
   that evaluate the individual knowledge and skills associated with the
   use of Internet and computer. These skills are considered essential for
   academic learning and a minimum requirement for employment in a typical
   office environment. These methods evaluate aspects related to the use of
   hardware, operating systems and software, such as Word and Excel as well
   as Internet usage. As these certification and evaluation programs are
   not easily accessible due to costs and location of the tests, we have
   developed an online tool for the diagnosis of Digital Proficiency by
   using a case study in which students of a public university are compared
   with school teachers in Brazil (n = 333).}},

Abstract = {{Teaching innovation is linked to technological development of society in
   which we live where the Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
   have become an indispensable teaching resource. However, in Physical
   Education (PE) is difficult integrating them due to the limited time,
   facilities and resources available for the subject and especially the
   predominance of physical activity. This means implies a challenge for
   teachers and their methodologies. Therefore, it is necessary that actual
   and future teachers are critical and reflect on this issue. It is also
   necessary to innovate in their teaching fostering the integration of ICT
   as another teaching resource and contributing to the acquisition of
   digital competence. The aims of the study are to know the training
   received by students of Master's Degree around ICT, to analyze the
   importance given to the use of ICT in PE classes and use their
   experiences as students and to reflect on possible methodological
   strategies in order to apply them in PE of secondary school.
   A qualitative methodology was followed using focus group online. The
   purposive sampling technique used was ``homogeneous sampling{''}.
   Participants were 31 students (3 women and 28 men, aged between 22 and
   28 years old) of the Teacher Training for Compulsory and Upper Secondary
   Education, Vocational Training and Foreign Language Teaching Master
   (specialty Physical Education). The focus group was conducted in the
   subject of Teaching Innovation. Students participated twice and were
   moderated by two teachers (62 interventions were collected). All of the
   data collected for this study were analyzed using Atlas.ti program,
   version 5.2. Data were fragmented and included in codes grouped into
   families, which facilitated the analysis and creation of Grounded Theory
   by Glasser and Strauss.
   The results show that 96.7\% of the opinions consider the use of ICT in
   PE classes is important and very important compared to 3.3\% who think
   ICT are not important. With regard to the experiences of use they
   perceived as students in secondary education and in their period of
   practice at university 52.8\% of the citations consider their PE teacher
   didn't use ICT and 47.2\% who used them though rarely did (26.4\%). On
   the other hand, according to training received during their studies,
   most of the students (83.7\%) think that this training it is not enough
   and 16.3\% think that their training is appropriate and enough to
   integrate ICT in their future classes. Finally, in relation to proposals
   that students suggest to integrate ICT in PE, the most cited were the
   homework of ICT like complementary activities (13.7\%), use of blog and
   wikis (8.3\%) and interdisciplinary work with other subjects (6.5\%). In
   conclusion the students discussed the need to encourage greater initial
   training in ICT (Degree and Master's Degree) as a permanent training and
   continue working on methodological proposals for integrating ICT
   practically in the real context of the PE. In this way, ICT will
   contribute to the acquisition of digital competence in PE. Moreover, if
   teachers use ICT in the teaching-learning as an innovative teaching
   resource, it will provide higher quality education.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the innovative learning system that has been
   implemented by a new public secondary school named Institut Nou de Sant
   Gregori. In a nutshell, the main purpose of the paper is to present the
   initial stage of the process and analyse the first results of its
   application for the last eight months.
   The learning system focuses upon the design and development of a
   personalized electronic or digital portfolio throughout the whole
   secondary education stage. This project, which is pioneering in its
   context, aims at improving students' skills in an integrated manner
   through the transversal use of the ICT-based portfolio throughout all
   subjects and stages.
   This project has been implemented and tried for the first time during
   this academic year 2014-2015 by all the teachers and students of the
   school, with the collaboration of a group of researchers from the Open
   University of Catalonia (UOC). Thus, the school's pedagogical project
   has evolved into an educational research project, with Action and Design
   Research as its reference methodological approaches.
   The central part of the project has been recognized as a ``singular{''}
   and ``experimental{''} industrial doctorate project by the University
   Secretariat of the Catalan Government, partially funded by the Catalan
   Research Foundation, and will be developed within the doctoral program
   `Education and ICTs' at UOC.}},

Abstract = {{Within the fast-paced and ever-evolving technology sector, we often have
   little time to evaluate whether a new product is good or bad before the
   next new and innovative wonder is presented. Can the book-up to this
   point, seen as the standard vessel for transferring large amounts of
   information {[}1]-be seen as yet another piece of technology that will
   not stand the test of time?
   E-readers and digital copies of texts are becoming widely prevalent, but
   can these forms still be considered a ``book{''}? Is the book in its
   physical form, something fundamentally different and irreplaceable by
   silicon, screens and networks? In other words, how do form and content
   define the monograph?
   One path of exploration lies in the way we interact with the two
   forms-not just physically, but also through the contexts, associations
   and cognitive underpinnings involved in their consumption (see {[}2],
   {[}3], {[}4], {[}5], {[}6]). Another way of exploring this question may
   be through the preferences, motivations and satisfaction of each medium
   (see {[}7], {[}8], {[}9], {[}10]).
   If there are real cognitive and psychological differences, then we might
   expect them to affect the learning outcomes and overall satisfaction.
   This paper will summarize the wide range of issues that have been
   investigated: from design features and flaws {[}11], physical
   constraints {[}12], visual and perceptual fatigue {[}13], personal and
   practical preferences ({[}8], {[}9], {[}14]), accessibility {[}15],
   exposure {[}9], content and context ({[}8], {[}16], {[}17]), as well as
   the individual reader and how their motivations, and their preferences
   ({[}15], {[}16], {[}17], {[}18]), affect the outcomes. This presentation
   will outline how instructors and students can employ strategies to
   ensure that their exercises and studying effectively corresponds to the
   medium of communication.}},

Abstract = {{In high school and college, the teaching and learning of Math usually
   lacks relating to a daily reality. Students live the learning of Math as
   a rigid routine for solving exercises, mostly in an algebraic way. The
   absence of meaning when we teach, makes Math something outside of our
   world. The Math in classroom is not an interesting subject and, as a
   matter of fact, the idea we leave in students about Math is not fair.
   Could it be possible to change this? It is our claim that today, with
   the emergent digital technologies, we could conceive a different way to
   perceive Math learning. That is the aim of our group TEAM: Tecnologia
   Educativa para el Aprendizaje de las Matematicas (Educational Technology
   for Mathematics Learning). Certainly, learning outcomes are not just a
   question of using technology. We are concerned with the
   conceptualization of a didactic strategy including technology for the
   student interaction with the mathematical knowledge. Understanding
   technology as an instrument (not as tool), should include the promotion
   of a thinking process to learn through technology interaction.
   Mathematical knowledge is now available through digital means. Today we
   have an opportunity to make Math a visual and tangible matter that
   students could reach using the kind of devices they use ordinarily. We
   look forward to bring a new meaning for the students' interaction with
   Math; one that they could better appreciate. We look forward to
   strengthen our educational innovation team aiming to transform the
   teaching and learning of Algebra, Analytic Geometry, Geometry and
   Calculus through the integration of digital technologies. Concerning
   research, we care for the promotion of mathematical cognitive skills not
   presented in curriculum as a content to be learned. Basic skills for
   understanding Math as a way of thinking the world are useful in the
   process of problem solving. And those skills exceed the algebraic
   representation of Math. Today we have an Augmented Reality Application
   dealing with the development of spatial visualization skills. We are
   also working with Kinect sensor to bring gestural aspects into the
   graphical representation of Math. As this two examples show, by adding
   digital technology to the learning process we are encouraging students
   to focus in visual and gestural components when interacting with
   mathematical content. Our purpose is to present TEAM as has been working
   until now. We attended several calls looking for grants that keep us
   together as a research group. Members of TEAM are students of the PhD
   Program for Innovation in Education and their thesis include the design
   and development of this kind of technological products for the learning
   of Math.}},

Abstract = {{The business of education is changing for adult learners - from higher
   education through the development of employees in the workplace. The
   sharing of information and knowledge has served as the foundation of
   most professional association products and services. The delivery of
   training and learning management must now face new realities and undergo
   rapid transformation. New models of learning present a variety of
   challenges and opportunities for academic institutions and training
   leaders. This virtual session will begin by discussing four major
   disruptions that have been identified in research done by the American
   Society of Association Executives (ASAE) Foundation, Washington DC, with
   the Institute for the Future (IFTF), Palo Alto, California. These
   innovations include: (1) episodic to continuous learning; (2)
   institutional credentialing to open, micro-credentialing; (3)
   face-to-face learning to co-present communication; and, (4) servicing
   knowledge customers to building knowledge communities. Adaptations that
   serve the demands of today's adult learners are already beginning to
   shake up knowledge creation and delivery models. Real world examples,
   from professional associations, to higher education and beyond, will be
   shared to inspire you to respond to these trends before it's too late.
   Tracy Petrillo, EdD, CAE will conclude by presenting findings of her
   research on the adult learning journey to certification. She will
   showcase the voices of participant interviews that describe the
   challenges faced on a pathway to improving competence and leadership
   development. She will provide recommendations on how individuals,
   organizations, and Institutions can respond to the disruptions and
   enhance the lifelong learning experiences for employees and adult
   students.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the article is to discuss the issue of machinima as a viable
   didactic tool in linguistic education. The idea of creating and using
   videos produced in a virtual environment in the classroom has been
   developed in the CAMELOT project ({''}CreAting Machinima to Empower Live
   Online language Teaching and learning{''}) involving nine European
   partners (project awarded by the EU Lifelong Learning Programme - KA3
   ICT Multilateral).
   Machinima, as a portmanteau word of `cinema' and `machine', refers to
   filming actions, role-plays and dialogues between 3D virtual characters
   or avatars. Creating such videos in 3D Virtual Learning Environment -
   VLE, involves planning and performing activities such rehearsing,
   scripting and storyboarding, as well as editing and refilming. The
   versatility of the medium allows for using it in many areas of human
   activity, among others, in linguistic education.
   In the area of foreign languages learning and teaching this technology
   receives an increasing attention; it is accessible for students or
   teachers and it does not require possessing specific programming skills.
   Therefore, machinima perceived as an innovative didactic tool, can be
   used by instructors as a video material supported with multifarious
   exercises, or as a specific task assigned to the class.
   In the CAMELOT project, the use of creative cinematography in linguistic
   education is described within the framework of Task Based Language
   Learning Approach, which focuses on authentic language and on asking
   students to do meaningful tasks using the target language. It may be
   assumed that the involvement of learners in machinima production,
   improve and strengthen their linguistic, digital, and intercultural
   skills. In regard to the acquisition and development of learners'
   competences, the paper explores pedagogical implications for teaching
   and learning in 3D VLE, as well as envisages the ways in which this new
   emerging medium could be used in classroom practice.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the complete process of access and exploration of
   a technology in the MediaLab of the University of Salamanca, its
   transfer to the Faculty of Education and its final application to the
   classrooms of secondary education. The process is illustrated with a
   project of development teaching mobile apps with App Inventor. The
   underlying idea is that the emergence of new digital technologies with
   potential application in improving education is a continuum, not an
   isolated one-off event, and therefore innovation should be considered as
   an essential part of the educational activity. As a consequence, stable
   facilities and procedures should be established to experiment with
   technology innovations and to allow its transfer.
   The MediaLab of the University of Salamanca is conceived as a new
   interdisciplinary and collaborative learning space. A meeting point of
   Art, Technology, Science and Society to experiment with emerging
   technologies and their possible artistic, social and educational
   applications. It is, therefore, a permanent place of the university
   dedicated to the exploration of technological innovations with a
   methodology designed in four phases: access, exploration, transfer and
   application. App Inventor is a technology, originally developed by
   Google and currently hosted and managed by the Massachusetts Institute
   of Technology (MIT), for creating mobile applications with no need for
   advanced programming skills.
   The paper describes the four phases for the App Inventor project as an
   illustration of the general process. Once identified and obtained the
   technology the second phase consists of exploring and experimenting.
   Typically this step is performed by conducting unstructured exploratory
   workshops (labyrinths) where MediaLab specialists and stakeholders from
   any discipline are involved. In the case of App Inventor clear
   opportunities for application to teaching innovation were found. The
   mode of application that was articulated was the proposal to teachers
   and students of the MSc in Mathematics Education with Qualified Teacher
   Status (QTS) to include App Inventor as a substantial part of the
   Master's final dissertation. A short course was programmed to transfer
   the knowledge acquired. As a result, three students, tutored by a
   professor of Mathematics Education, devoted their final dissertation to
   design teaching units for secondary students that included the use of
   mobile applications created with App Inventor. The teaching units and
   Apps developed were used by the three post-graduate students in their
   Master's teaching practices at secondary schools. To measure the impact
   and relevance of technological innovation in learning mathematical
   concepts a research questionnaire was designed and applied to the
   secondary school students. The research results were published in a
   journal of Mathematics Education.
   This case exemplifies the complete cycle of technological innovation
   carried out in the MediaLab of the University of Salamanca, which has
   been kept in motion with other technologies like 3D-Printers, Arduino or
   capture motion devices.}},

Abstract = {{Absence of training of carers for the elderly, both formal and informal,
   accrues a long term economical and healthcare overhead. Demographics and
   vocational realities of this target group make ordinary teaching methods
   counterproductive. Scenario based learning has been established as an
   important part of self-directed education, in formal and informal
   context. Virtual Environments have established themselves as platforms
   of increased experiential impact for delivering interactive educational
   scenarios to learners. As part of the EU funded DISCOVER project, this
   work describes the innovations in design and implementation of a
   training scenario of elderly care in the OpenSim Virtual Environment.
   From an analysis of the target group for which this learning resource
   would be created, the following design guidelines emerged:
   Reading familiarity vs immersive narrative: Although it is usually
   better to narrate through imagery and not through readable text, due to
   the target audience's average age non-verbal narration could cause
   confusion due to lack of previous experience with the medium.
   Smooth Learning Curve for an unfamiliar audience: MUVEs have
   straightforward keyboard and mouse controls that are very familiar to
   contemporary users. However, with the target demographic (old Greek
   adults) having below average digital skills, it was decided for no
   keyboard shortcuts to be used and for all expected interaction to be
   described in the case's textual narrative.
   Cognitive tasks relevant to the target group: While the cognitive
   abilities of the case's target group are those of the average member of
   their demographic, their capacity as carers and the challenges emerging
   from this role impose a degree of psychological and mental fatigue to
   them. Thus the presentation of the case was chosen to be straightforward
   and without extraneous puzzle elements to focus on educational retention
   and overall judgment since the subject of the case would also be in
   regard to the same fatigue inducing subject, as a skills.
   Conformance to user's learning style: It was decided that care should be
   taken to keep learning style on the instructive side instead of the
   impactful, due to the target group's learning background. Specifically
   the scenario's branching was designed so that while it would be possible
   to make erroneous choices the impact of these choices was described and
   the user was allowed to continue with follow-through choices so as to
   discover the correct solution to each task presented.
   Consideration of the group's physical abilities: Both the subject matter
   and the target group's composition dictate against intense physical
   interaction in the game design. Reflex based, timed, or quick actions,
   while useful to master for healthcare professionals were not included
   either in the scenario's goals or its implementation.
   Based on these guidelines and with implementation provisions for
   extensibility, transferability and Standards conformance, the DISCOVER
   OS virtual case pilot was created and is currently being tested for
   efficacy as a learning tool for the carers of the elderly. On the
   development side of this research possible avenues of automation for
   authoring and repurposing of such scenarios are explored.}},

Abstract = {{``Exchange of best practices for transfer of innovation of GEO VET
   education to meet changing labour market needs in Europe following EU
   GEO policies{''} (GeoSkills Plus) is a European Commission funded
   project under DG Education and Culture, Leonardo da Vinci programme
   (Project No 2013-1-NL1-LEO05-12278). It began in October 2013 and will
   run until October 2015. Initiated by the Dutch Cadastre, Land Registry
   and Mapping Agency and the Geo Employment Market Foundation (SAGEO), the
   GeoSkills Plus Project is an ambitious project aiming to match labour
   market needs with geo education offer in Europe.
   The aim of this two-year project is to enable European countries to
   exchange best practices and innovation with each other regarding the gap
   between Europe's geospatial vocational education and training and the
   geospatial labour market. There is a growing need for well-trained
   students at all levels - vocational, bachelors, masters - in the field
   of geospatial technologies. This is because there are a growing number
   of jobs available in land surveying, mapping data collection, data
   processing, data delivery and turning data into information.
   In order to analyse the gap and to find out the reasons and factors,
   which have an influence on gap occurrence, and creates the mismatch
   between European geospatial education community and geospatial labour
   market, the hierarchy of the gap structure was developed. Suggested
   structure was adopted for questionnaire of respondents by method of
   pairwise comparison and processing of obtained judgements by
   multi-criteria method - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).
   The test AHP computations were made and expected digital values of gap
   factors importance was determined for some European countries (Belgium,
   Bulgaria, Lithuania, the Netherlands). Based on these results the
   optimal ways to Raise Awareness of geospatial studies and increase
   student enrolment were set up. GeoSkills Plus also identified the gaps
   between the supply of geospatial jobs and the demand for qualified
   graduates in different European countries, and set up ways to bridge the
   gap. Ultimately a Cooperation Model is created that identifies all
   stakeholders and offers them the steps necessary to improve Europe's
   position in the global geospatial market.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is aimed at showing the planned innovations concerning media
   applications in teaching English for Science and Technology and
   Autmation at the Slovak University of Technology (STU), Faculty of
   Materials Science and Technology (MTF).
   Teachers with the Department of Languages prepare STU MTF students for
   utilizing information-communication technologies by means of various
   tools, particularly Academic Information System used not only for
   recording the study results and providing study materials but also a
   useful means to prepare, distribute and evaluate numerous methodology
   ideas, share presentations, animations, videos; or e-learning
   interactive study materials. The Department of Languages utilizes online
   testing system where the teachers have customized the test to the needs
   of appropriate placement of students. In addition, the Department is
   currently planning to build a new digital multimedia classroom enabling
   to work with e-learning materials more efficiently. The Department
   teachers and doctoral students are involved in an international project
   with Serbia related to improving the video-conferencing skills. The
   Department has also started its own webpage, where all necessary
   outcomes of either under/postgraduates are displayed.
   Another interesting ICT application used at STU can be represented by
   utilizing virtual reality which is presented to the user in such a way
   that it appears and feels real. A virtual laboratory was successfully
   created within the project of preparing a multimedia textbook for
   secondary school students at the STU MTF. The ICT applications provide a
   great help for teachers themselves in project collaboration namely with
   the Department of Applied Informatics, Automation and Mechatronics in

   courses, delivered via an online platform. Moreover, the endeavor
   consists in adapting the existing curricula to the job market
   requirements especially by developing new skills and competencies to
   undergraduates from three different fields of study: economics, social
   sciences and architecture.
   Computer-based learning becomes more attractive to young people due to
   the delivery of the online course content which is provided in a
   innovative and attractive structure (digitized lessons), as a result of
   a joint venture between academia and IT experts.
   The research methodology consists in analyzing the national context of
   computer-based education, identifying the core skills and competencies
   required by the employers and developing measurements to assess the
   effectiveness of the computer-based learning.
   What gives value to our research is the direct contact with students
   during the entire process starting with digitized lessons usage,
   assessing the learning outcome and finally providing evidence of
   learning effectiveness.
   An online survey is currently run in order to capture the learning
   experience as it is perceived by students that are testing our
   ``products{''}. Valuable information will be available soon and a set of
   improvements will be in place in order to maximize the learning outcome.}},

Abstract = {{While the number of people using digital technologies is growing
   increasingly, scientific and educational institutions are investigating
   new innovative tools and technologies for various purposes: some employ
   online technologies to support and promote their activities, others
   utilize collaboration tools to interact with their audience, collaborate
   with other institutions, and share information and resources. In science
   education, interactive digital technologies are being utilized as tools
   to support teaching and learning in informal science learning contexts;
   they can also be employed as platforms to involve students in
   discussions on science related topics with other students, teachers,
   scientists, and the public. However, the continuous development in
   digital technologies might require these institutions to identify the
   most effective tools to incorporate. Moreover, there are a growing
   number of collaboration platforms that require institutions to have an
   active presence on. This highlights the need for continued research on
   and evaluation of these tools.
   This case based approach study explores the role of digital technologies
   in promoting various activities conducted by a selected sample of
   scientific and educational institutions. The paper highlights the
   collaborative features of digital technologies, and investigates online
   practices and activities used when institutions collaborate and share
   ideas and resources. In addition, the study compares how the selected
   institutions under study employ digital technologies to reach the public
   and collaborate with other institutions. The case study provides
   examples, recommendations and guidelines for institutions on factors to
   be considered when developing marketing and promotional strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes a collaboration between two European Universities to
   create innovative learning spaces that fuse new and emerging technology
   with traditional teaching tools. The goal was to utilise emerging
   wireless presentation and collaboration tools to foster new approaches
   to collaboration and innovation. In doing so we have created both an
   advanced classroom space and ideal environment for academic
   collaboration.
   By thinking of innovation as an emergent feature of a complex system
   (Goldstein, 2010), we have created a space that maximizes the potential
   for innovation by creating a site for face-to-face dialogue and
   instantaneous synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated
   collaboration. By utilising the BYOD paradigm, we have created a space
   where open collaborative discourse can be captured and shared
   instantaneously. Participants can create, research and share digital
   artefacts using their own devices on up to 8 centrally controlled
   display screens. These are used with dynamic switching and cloud
   technologies to facilitate cross-group, whole room and remote
   collaboration. These emerging technologies are teamed with ` old school'
   classroom technologies to create and environment that is adaptable,
   extendable and instantly useable by a diverse range of collaborators.
   This work discusses the creation of the space, including detail on the
   specific use of technologies and their limitations, and will case study
   a range of new pedagogies and collaboration methodologies that are
   possible with this environment. These include supporting undergraduate
   collaborative writing in groups of up to 60 (Almond, 2015), multi-site
   STEM problem solving and supporting staff development of innovative
   pedagogies in communities of practice (Wenger, 2009).}},

Abstract = {{The industrial tourism has become increasingly common in recent years.
   The core of industrial tourism is industrial culture, which
   generatesexperiences-thatenable tourists to maximize their travel
   experiences. This study focused on the duck industry in Yilan and
   explored the local policy making that isbased on the cultural
   creativity. There are three models that govern the transformations of
   the traditional duck breeders with cultural creativity. They include (1)
   the conversion of industry-specific knowledge from an ecological
   protection perspective; (2) the development of experiential tourism from
   a cross-sector collaboration perspective; and (3) the expansion of the
   international market from a foreign development perspective. This study
   endeavored to explore the novel values and output values generated in
   the transformation of the duck breeding methods used in Yilan
   byanalyzingthe perspective, concepts, and practicesadopted for a
   rice-duck farming system in life, production, and ecology. To achieve
   this goal, literature review, field survey, and text analysis were
   conducted, and digital media such as microfilmsand mobile applications
   (APPs) were used. We found that microfilms conveyed the meaning of
   cultural creativity after the transformation of the duck breeding
   industryinto an industrial tourism-oriented industry and emphasized the
   life cycle, output, and ecological values of industrial tourism. In the
   future, by integrating microfilmswith quick-response code (QR Code)
   technology to enable tourists to browse using APPs not only established
   prior knowledge of the duck industry among tourists, but also elevated
   the innovation value and economic output of duck industry transformation
   by providing a rice-duck farming experience.}},

Abstract = {{Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) has been used in order to
   restore muscle functions in patients suffering from neurological
   disorders. This therapeutic approach benefits from technological
   improvements that yield miniaturization. We previously have proposed and
   demonstrated an innovative electrical stimulation method in which
   wireless implants act as rectifiers of innocuous high frequency (HF)
   currents. These currents are conductively supplied to the tissues where
   the implants are located through external electrodes. Locally, the
   implants generate low frequency currents capable of stimulating
   excitable tissues. The method has the potential to enable unprecedented
   levels of miniaturization. The implant needs only two peripheral
   electrodes both for picking-up the HF current and for performing
   electrical stimulation. In addition, a tiny hybrid microcircuit, or a
   single integrated circuit, may integrate all the necessary electronic
   components. No bulky parts such as coils or batteries are required. We
   have demonstrated a number of circuit architectures for the implants
   with advanced capabilities such as digital addressability. In here, we
   demonstrate that the proposed method also allows bidirectional
   communications between the implants and the external system that powers
   and governs them, enabling proprioception-like sensing capabilities that
   may be crucial for closed-loop FES systems. We demonstrate a scheme
   based on amplitude modulation and Manchester encoding.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a parametric modeling method in the field of computer-aided
   architectural conception, which aims to produce non-standard wooden
   walls and envelopes with CNC machinery. This method explores the
   application of polygonal cellular structures (as patterns) on facade and
   envelope interventions for new and old projects. We innovate by bringing
   the 3D production environment complexity into the conception model to
   improve the production of manifold woodworking items by CNC (Computer
   Numerical Control) 3D fabrication. A recent experimentation, tests the
   entire workflow from parametric modeling to production of two full-scale
   prototypes. The results prove the range of inputs offered by the method
   to be functional, though it needs various improvements in order to
   optimize parametric modeling and digital fabrication procedures. Future
   research will focus on treating a wider range of joints via parametric
   modeling and deal with joint creation regardless wall deformation to
   expand the morphological approach of non-standard wooden walls design.}},

   this research is the development of a generative design tool, to be used
   at the conceptual chair design stage. A framework of five stages is
   proposed: (1) sample definition, considering chairs with a large
   diversity of types; (2) analysis of the syntax and semantics of the
   class through ontological classification; (3) development of a generic
   shape grammar, innovatively applied to product design; (4)
   implementation of a digital tool, that provides an interface to
   manipulate the chair components visualized in a 3D digital model; and
   (5) user evaluation of the program, in order to draw conclusions on the
   usability and usefulness of the tool and to collect inputs for further

Abstract = {{The convergence of digital media offers an integration of ICT focused on
   telecommunications and multimedia domain (under responsibility of the
   Moving Picture Experts Group, ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29) and the ICTE (the ICT
   for Education), managed by the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36, highlighting the MPEG
   standards, employees as content and metadata to the multimedia Digital
   TV and the technologies applied to e-Learning. Regarding this, there is
   the problem of developing an interoperable matching for normative bases,
   achieving an innovative proposal in the convergence between digital
   telecommunications and applications for e-Learning, also essentially
   multimedia. To reach this purpose it is proposed to create a standard
   ontology of interoperable metadata for web, digital TV and extensions
   for mobile devices based on the integration between MPEG-21 and SCORM
   metadata standards. The methodology used consists on building an
   ontology MPEG-21 SCORM which can be achieved on making a correspondence
   through the XPath language, managed by the W3C. The employ of the XPath
   language is desirable for matching and mapping both metadata schema
   patterns - integrating MPEG-21 (mostly Digital Item Declaration
   Language) and SCORM metadata schema. The practical purpose is the
   creation and storage of objects for use in digital telecommunications as
   Digital Television, in an interoperable way with the e-Learning
   industry, here as description metadata for all sorts of media and
   hypermedia to create learning objects.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations in technology and greater affordability of digital devices
   with internet made a new global world of data called big data. The
   continuous increase in the volume and detail of data captured by
   enterprises, such as the rise of social media, Internet of Things (IoT),
   and multimedia, has produced an overwhelming flow of data in either
   structured or unstructured format. It is a fact that data that is too
   big to process is also too big to transfer anywhere, so it's just the
   analytical program which needs to be moved not the data. This is
   possible with cloud computing, as most of the public data sets such as
   Facebook,Twitter, financial markets data, weather data, genome datasets
   and aggregated industry -specific data live in the cloud and it becomes
   more cost-effective for the enterprise to analysis this data in the
   cloud itself. This paper discusses various problems related to big data
   computation and possible solution using cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{Interactive geovisualization is an emerging field based upon many
   approaches from many fields and disciplines to provide theory, methods
   and tools for the visual exploration, synthesis and presentation of data
   that contains geographic information. Therefore, there has been
   considerable interest in spatial data visualization employing Virtual
   Reality and geographical information system (GIS) platform, and
   considered as an interesting tool for data investigation and dynamic
   visualization. The approach, integrated with Web technology, seems to be
   a powerful geospatial web-based 3D geographical cartography,
   visualization and analysis solution and, obviously, will becomes an
   important part of the future of the geovisualization. In this study,
   numerous morphostructural landscapes and some particular Triassic
   geomorphic landforms located within northern Tunisia have been
   considered to visualize their 3D terrain models and, specially, some
   significant GIS-based quantitative morphometric parameters extracted
   from accurate DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) are concerned. GeoVRML
   (Geographic Virtual Reality Modelling Language) with an inherent support
   of georeferenced models are produced to enable interactive visualization
   and 3D cartography on the World Wide Web using any Web browser with
   freely-available plugins and tools. Therefore, Web user interfaces were
   created based on the basic open web platform (OWP) standards. In fact,
   HTML5, XML, CSS3, and SVG are used and considered as the essential part
   of this designed open access platform. SVG, or the scalable vector
   graphics is used to manipulate original two-dimensional graphics and
   created GIS layers with support for interactivity. Moreover, a
   descriptive metadata of each layer is also integrated. Authoring and
   conversion of geospatial data to GeoVRML is carried out using GIS
   environment and, thereafter, connected to the Web interface.
   Three-dimensional GeoVRML scenes show an interesting ease of use with
   innovative VRML nodes more suitable for 3D cartography and scientific
   geovisualization dealing with geospatial data. Consequently, geographic
   coordinate systems, high precision, dataset scalability, and metadata
   linking are involved. GeoCoordinate, GeoElevationGrid, GeoLOcation, and
   GeoLOD are among the most practical used nodes. In this work, the
   ability to model dynamic 3D geographic data that can be distributed and
   interactively visualized over the web is emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing need for the development of 3D models of large-scale
   urban maps; it is expected both, by ordinary citizens and professional
   users of digital maps who would like to use them in modern economy and
   for many other innovative applications. Adopted announcement of the
   Surveyor General of Poland to build Polish 3D+ map is feasible, taking
   into account the available survey data sets. The authors performed two
   experiments which involved converting the geodetic sets into 3D maps.
   The first one was based on existing sets, the second one, on the other
   hand, founded on some experimental measurements. Both involved densely
   built-up urban areas within the campus at the University of Warmia and
   Mazury in Olsztyn. The results showed that the quality of 3D maps
   created on the basis of existing data will depend on the quality of the
   initial data and the accuracy of generated digital terrain model (DTM).
   The experiment demonstrated that the current geodetic surveys not only
   allow for verification of DTM accuracy, but also for creating a new
   product -3D map based on spatial objects. Therefore, a conclusion arises
   that there is a need for establishing some new methodology and modifying
   the available solutions, especially in the scope of geodetic surveys
   quality verification with the use of software enabling for 3D
   visualization.}},

Abstract = {{``Big data{''} is a word to be increasingly mentioned, which is used to
   describe the coming of information explosion. It also defines the
   related technology development and innovation. Big data triggers a great
   revolution. This seems to herald the inescapable process of quantization
   for all professions including academia, business or government. The
   trend of big data obviously outdated the conventional means of
   government administration, hence making its innovation the theme of this
   age. The innovation faces both opportunities and challenges.
   Opportunities are that it promotes information transparency and policy
   making based on population subdivision. For challenges, it may increase
   the risk of ``data dictatorship{''}, privacy, once being abused, may
   also lead to preemptive punishment; it is also possible to deepen ``the
   digital divide{''}. Based on pioneering research, this paper puts
   forward a new mode of government administrative innovation.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that, due to the weakness of the received Global
   Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, GNSS receiver operation may
   be easily and seriously threatened either by the presence of several
   impairments such as the unintentional interference, generated by other
   communication systems; or the intentional interference known also as
   jamming; and spoofing signals which attempt to mislead receiver
   operation. The term jamming refers to intentional transmission of RF
   interference with the goal of disrupting one or more of the received
   GNSS frequency bands, preventing the receivers from operating correctly
   within a targeted area.
   This paper provides a comparison between two interference mitigation
   techniques at the digital signal processing level for jamming signal
   removal. The traditional adaptive notch filtering scheme, widely
   discussed in literature, has been compared with a more innovative
   technique based on the use of the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD).
   Both techniques are implemented in software and their performance has
   been assessed via the use of a fully software GNSS receiver. Both
   techniques are first applied to a set of simulated GNSS jammed scenarios
   and preliminary results demonstrates that not negligible improvement is
   achieved at both acquisition and tracking level when the WPD algorithm
   is employed with respect the application of the classical adaptive notch
   filtering. In fact, using the adaptive notch filtering the effective
   range of the jamming can be reduced from approximately 474 meters up to
   127 meters while when using the WPD based algorithm, such a range can be
   further reduced up to approximately 10 meters. These results are also
   confirmed by successive test campaign where performance comparison of
   both software implemented techniques is assessed considering synthetic
   GNSS data interfered at Radio Frequency (RF).}},

Abstract = {{Metallic cables are still frequently used in access telecommunications
   networks, especially in the last-mile network segments, together with
   digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies. Recently, the G. fast system
   for reaching gigabit transmission speed over short metallic lines has
   been introduced. In order to achieve such performance, the frequency
   band of G. fast was extended up to 106 MHz or 212 MHz and several
   innovative transmission concepts were adopted as well. However, these
   innovations require accurate approximations of a G. fast transmission
   channel. Due to that it is necessary to provide accurate approximation
   of metallic cable transmission characteristics, the attenuation constant
   alpha(f) as well as the phase constant beta(f). Therefore, an innovative
   LN model was proposed and is presented in this paper. Its main
   motivation is to outperform the existing models with equal number of
   necessary parameters. The accuracy of a proposed LN model was tested for
   various metallic cables and compared with two typical existing models.}},

Abstract = {{With voice driven type design (VDTD), we introduce a novel concept to
   present written information in the digital age. While the shape of a
   single typographical character has been treated as an unchangeable
   property until today, we present an innovative method to adjust the
   shape of each single character according to particular acoustic features
   in the spoken reference. Thereby, we allow to keep some individuality
   and to gain additional value in written text which offers different
   applications - providing meta-information in subtitles and chats,
   supporting deaf and hearing impaired people, illustrating intonation and
   accentuation in books for language learners, giving hints how to sing -
   up to artistic expression. By conducting a user study we have
   demonstrated that - using our proposed approach - loudness, pitch and
   speed can be represented visually by changing the shape of each
   character. By complementing homogeneous type design with these
   parameters, the original intention and characteristics of the speaker
   (personal expression and intonation) are better supported.}},

Abstract = {{The movement to remote system from wired system has been a worldwide
   pattern in the recent decades. The versatility what's more adaptability
   brought by remote system made it conceivable in numerous applications.
   Among all the contemporary remote systems, Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET)
   is a standout amongst the most imperative and special applications. On
   the in spite of conventional system structural engineering, MANET does
   not oblige an altered system base; each and every hub functions as both
   a transmitter and a collector. Hubs correspond specifically with one
   another when they are both inside the same correspondence range. Else,
   they depend on their neighbors to transfer messages. The planning toward
   oneself capacity of hubs in MANET made it prominent among basic mission
   applications like military utilization or crisis recuperation. On the
   other hand, the open medium and wide dissemination of hubs make MANET
   defenseless against malignant assailants. For this situation, it is
   essential to create proficient interruption identification instruments
   to ensure MANET from assaults. With the changes of the innovation
   furthermore cut in equipment costs, we are seeing a current pattern of
   growing Manets into mechanical applications. To acclimate to such
   pattern, we unequivocally accept that it is crucial to address its
   potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and actualize
   another interruption recognition framework named Enhanced Adaptive
   Acknowledgment (EAACK) uniquely intended for Manets using JAVA
   programming platform. Analyzed to contemporary methodologies, EAACK
   shows higher malevolent conduct location rates in specific circumstances
   while does not significantly influence the system exhibitions.}},

Abstract = {{In a short period of time, medias have talked about MOOCs with high
   expectations, followed by great disappointments. Such a reversal of the
   trend is typical of technological determinism, which is a prominent
   approach of educational technologies. Against this background, the
   objective of this paper is to analyze general media discourses about
   MOOCs in a critical perspective. We used a content analysis method to
   characterize discourses of press articles and to assess the extent to
   which they convey a technological determinist view. We finally draw some
   concluding remarks about the way education technologies are socially
   perceived.}},

Abstract = {{In this research pedagogic influence of a dynamic geometry software in
   the geometric perception of the trigonometry functions sine, cosine and
   tangent, using Van Hiele's model, which not only helps guide the process
   of learning in geometry having as reference phases, levels and
   characteristics of the model, it helps to assess cognitive and
   communicative skill of students. Research was framed from the policies
   and actions planned by Ministry of National Education (MEN) and the
   objectives of the National System of Educational Innovation, created in
   National Strategy for Digital Open Educational Resources (REDA). In this
   research we worked with a population of sixteen (16) students of Jorge
   Isaacs School of the Armenia (Q) City under the qualitative
   methodological approach, highlighting a meaningful experience when the
   investigation is developed showing the belonging of the pedagogic fact
   and emphasis the conscious level to other level of superior order to the

Abstract = {{The flipped classroom has gained in popularity as a new way to structure
   teaching in which lectures shift from in-class events to digitally-based
   homework, freeing up class time for practice exercises and discussion.
   As part of an action research study, the author synthesizes reflections
   about how the flipped classroom mode can support teaching, learning
   through building cloud computer platform of learning resource cloud and
   teaching resource cloud. The implementation of task-based three stages
   teaching mode is: (1) Pre-task phase, highlights teacher's
   ``dominant{''} function; (2) Task-cycle, highlights students'
   ``principal part{''} at this stage; (3) Post-task (evaluation phase).
   Findings suggest that flipped classroom model that emphasizes
   collaborative learning, group work and accessibility can stimulate
   students' ability of critical and innovative advanced thinking.
   Recommendations are provided for educators interested in designing
   learning using a flipped classroom instructional model, as well as
   suggestions for future action research agendas.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic weighing is a constantly developing field of metrology. The
   electronic weighing module is vulnerable to many sources of
   environmental disturbances. Some issues connected with dynamic weighing
   and the necessity of implementation of signal processing methods are
   discussed. Implementation of this feature is impossible in majority of
   SCADA systems. The paper presents integration of three advanced software
   environments: MATLAB, LabVIEW and iFIX SCADA in prototype dynamic
   weighing system. They were used for advanced signal processing, data
   acquisition and visualization/process control. The integration of the
   three above mentioned environments is an attempt to create the
   industrial system with capabilities to deal with major dynamic weighing
   problems. It is innovative because it connects industrial SCADA,
   laboratory/industrial LabVIEW and MATLAB. Algorithms responsible for
   process control and data exchange are presented. The paper includes
   description of capabilities, performance tests, as well as benefits and
   drawbacks of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Progressive and permanent changes generated by the so-called
   technological revolution and whose cornerstones were innovation in all
   fields of science and particularly in information technology and
   communications, ICTs have not only given multidimensional changes but
   have given rise to a new production paradigm in Latin America, ``the
   knowledge economy{''} based on a new cultural model called
   ``cyberculture{''} and / or ``techno{''}.
   What happened to the cultural heritage and national and regional
   cultural identity ? Cyberculture is the new paradigm that redefines two
   concepts?
   In the XXI century learning is the most important source of wealth,
   welfare, ability to compete and cooperate in peace. Consequently, each
   government, each school must begin by accepting the need to transform,
   to be more dynamic, flexible and responsible to the community with which
   they interact and reflect about cultural
   heritage and identity of peoples.
   This work is based on the statement ``true value creation is directly
   related to man's creativity motivates invention and innovation on the
   generation and use of digital tools therefore, the individual, is the
   maker of a new dimension of the culture of S XXI. Throughout its
   development work try:
   a) Describe how ICT's cut across all sectors: economic, financial,
   political-legal, social and ecological, which determines are
   strategically key to promoting sustainable development and growth in the
   region.
   b) Demonstrate how new ICTs can facilitate the management of heritage
   policies and national and regional cultural identity, only to the extent
   that we know how to use them, why and when.
   c) Recognize the great challenge that means for the University to
   provide the elements necessary to set up a new model of society where
   man does not feel oppressed by the great technological advances, and
   where people benefit equally from technological advances.}},

Abstract = {{Gender recognition is a topic of high interest especially in the growing
   field of audience measurement techniques for digital signage
   applications. Usually, supervised approaches are employed and they
   require a preliminary training phase performed on large datasets of
   annotated facial images that are expensive (e.g. MORPH) and, anyhow,
   they cannot be updated to keep track of the continuous mutation of
   persons' appearance due to changes of fashions and styles (e.g.
   hairstyles or makeup). The use of small-sized (and then updatable in a
   easier way) datasets is thus high desirable but, unfortunately, when few
   examples are used for training, the gender recognition performances
   dramatically decrease since the state-of-art classifiers are unable to
   handle, in a reliable way, the inherent data uncertainty by explicitly
   modeling encountered distortions. To face this drawback, in this work an
   innovative classification scheme for gender recognition has been
   introduced: its core is the Minimax approach, i.e. a smart
   classification framework that, including a number of existing
   regularized regression models, allows a robust classification even when
   few examples are used for training. This has been experimentally proved
   by comparing the proposed classification scheme with state of the art
   classifiers (SVM, kNN and Random Forests) under various pre-processing
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of the internet has brought about many implications to the
   already existing media and the way we communicate to one another and do
   things. Several scholars have conducted studies to understand the
   factors responsible for technology acceptance. The Technology Acceptance
   Model (TAM) is one of the much referred models for technology acceptance
   where perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are recognized as
   the two main factors that influence computer usage behavior.
   Subsequently, there have been several studies aiming at extending and
   modifying the TAM by proposing additional variables believed to
   contribute to the acceptance of technological innovation. This study
   aims at exploring and testing other factors that have not been explained
   by Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in determining the acceptance of
   communication and information technology (ICT). A survey was conducted
   to obtain the necessary primary data from 300 respondents in the Klang
   Valley, a metropolis consisting of the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur
   and the state of Selangor. Rasch measurement model is used in analyzing
   the data in measuring the readiness of the respondents towards being a
   digital society. Ten constructs are prescribed in the questionnaire to
   better understand the society and the Internet and its application
   usage. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This article offers a media archaeology of immersive world maps and
   astronomical models, focusing on walk-in terrestrial and celestial
   globes. Innovations in digitally interactive data visualization promise
   spectators new ways of extracting knowledge from complex information.
   But the outsized claims and expanded formats of emergent displays invoke
   the ambitions of earlier scientific spectacles such as the
   nineteenth-century Georama - a giant sphere whose interior was painted
   to model the surface of the globe. Comparing immersive and interactive
   models of earth and sky exposes changing assumptions about how nature is
   ordered, how aesthetic representation should recapitulate that order,
   and how a spectator might perceive and know not just a model but the
   construct of reality itself. This article discusses examples spanning
   almost two centuries, such as the Gottorp Globe, the Georama, Wyld's
   Great Globe, the Celestial Globe of the 1900 Paris Exposition, the
   Atwood Sphere, the twin maps of Google Earth and Google Sky, and the
   Reality Deck 1.5 gigapixel display recently funded by the National
   Science Foundation at Stony Brook University.}},

Abstract = {{Digital signature is the key issue in a number of innovative processes,
   such as dematerialization, e-government, e-commerce, and e-banking.
   Digital signature ensures both the identity of the user and the
   integrity of the digital document the user signs. However, despite the
   robustness of the underlying cryptographic primitives, a number of
   vulnerabilities derive from the radical difference between handwritten
   signature on papers and signature on digital documents. Indeed, digital
   documents are not directly observable because humans need a tool to
   interpret the bits of the document and to represent the corresponding
   information. The aim of this paper is to focus on the vulnerabilities of
   digital signature deriving from the ``unobservability{''} of electronic
   documents. Possible mechanisms to contrast such vulnerabilities are also
   proposed, highlighting their positive and negative points under a
   perspective that does not ignore both practical and regulatory aspects.}},

Abstract = {{``There are no technological revolutions without cultural
   transformations.{''} This is a quote from the book ``The Internet
   Galaxy: Reflections on the Internet, Business, and Society{''} by Manuel
   Castells (2003), in which the author explores the complexity of the
   social problems generated by the spread of the Internet.
   Nowadays the Internet is no longer simply a means for connecting people
   through computers. The digital components of the network have
   materialized in things. Information has ceased to travel exclusively on
   the computer screen and moved onto physical objects, now able to talk to
   each other and with the environment.
   The challenge is that this technological innovation will become a social
   innovation, and that individuals, society, institutions and companies
   will appropriate it, modifying it, transforming it, and experimenting
   with it.
   This paper is a reflection on the role of technology in supporting
   social innovation. We will approach this topic from the perspective of
   interaction design, a discipline that studies social practices connected
   with use of technologies, and imagines new possibilities as well as new
   activities enabled by them.
   The reflection will develop by presenting the outcomes of Light through
   Culture, an international educational project that aims to create a
   meaningful context for learning in which students reflect on
   socio-cultural issues together by building interactive installations.}},

Abstract = {{When willing to prepare and to build operational Product Life cycle
   Management interoperability within a Dynamic Manufacturing Network (DMN)
   in a mature digital business ecosystem such as Aeronautic, Space and
   Defense, the approaches proposed by the Enterprise Application
   Interoperability are insufficient when willing to address the existing
   interoperability brakes Some of these brakes have been addressed in
   project such as IMAGINE and SIP@SystemX, allowing to experiment
   innovative way of using standards based enterprise modeling and also to
   identify some additional gaps for applying model base enterprise
   modeling to PLM interoperability within a DMN. After defining the
   business and the scientific contexts, the paper describes this new
   approach which consists in federating the usage of several PLM,
   Business, Information and ICT standard through the usage of an
   enterprise modeling standardized language, ArchiMate, and associated
   modeling tool Archi created using ArchiMate as an EMF DSL. The defined
   methodology is based on producing a set of DMN blueprints and associated
   templates. Then, through model to model transformation, other more
   detailed models using more specialized languages are created and used
   for software component generation and deployment enterprise hub platform
   based on standards. Using the methodology, the associated framework and
   the developed resulting from our research activity, we are now able to
   prepare and build interoperability within a DMN. Ability of preserving
   investment performed with the legacy and reducing risks associated to
   future evolution was demonstrated through IMAGINE Aeronautic Lab
   experimentation within SIP. Such experimentation also highlighted some
   issues related to model based engineering in such a context, and allowed
   identifying needs for new extensions of the federative PLM
   interoperability framework for Collaborative Networked Product
   Development initiated during the ATHENA project. It will be addressed in
   future work.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic Web technologies give us the opportunity to understand today's
   data-rich society and provide novel means to explore our past. Civil
   registration records such as birth, death, and marriage registers
   contain a vast amount of implicit information which can be revealed by
   structuring, linking and combining that information with other datasets
   and bodies of knowledge. In the Irish Record Linkage (IRL) Project
   1864-1913, we have developed a data preservation and interpretation
   pipeline supported by a dedicated semantic architecture. This
   three-layered pipeline is designed to capture separate concerns from the
   perspective of multiple disciplines such as archival studies, history
   and data science. In this study, our aim is to demonstrate best
   practices in digital archives, while facilitating innovative new
   methodologies in historical research. The designed pipeline is executed
   with a dataset of 4090 registered Irish death entries from selected
   areas of south Dublin City.}},

Abstract = {{Novel technological advances in mobile devices and applications can be
   exploited in wildfire confrontation, enabling end-users to easily
   conduct several everyday tasks, such as access to data and information,
   sharing of intelligence and coordination of personnel and vehicles. This
   work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information
   management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a
   complementary tool to the web-based version of the AEGIS platform for
   wildfire prevention and management. Several tasks can be accomplished
   from the AEGIS App, such as routing, spatial search for closest
   facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather
   data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas
   refill stations, evacuation sites etc.). An innovative feature of AEGIS
   App is the support of these tasks by a digital assistant for artificial
   intelligence named Cortana (developed by Microsoft for Windows Phone
   devices), that allows information utilization through voice commands.
   The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is
   potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated
   transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation
   operation centers and firefighting units in the field. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{The Digital Health and Care Institute is a new innovation centre in
   Scotland which aims to transform health and social care delivery using a
   dynamic model of innovation (www.dhi-scotland.com).
   Experience Laboratories are at the core of this model and are led and
   developed by the Institute of Design Innovation at The Glasgow School of
   Art. Experience Labs provide a new way of working collaboratively within
   health and social care contexts in Scotland through a process of
   exploration, co-design and co-creation, and rapid prototyping of ideas.
   Bring together academic, business and civic partners, Experience Labs
   provide the opportunity for extreme collaboration in a safe and
   realistic environment. Through a series of design-led activities, which
   position the user at the centre of the design process, the Labs enable
   the trialing of ideas and co-design of sustainable health and social
   care solutions, together with end-users.
   This paper presents the findings of a design-led project to co-design a
   new directory of services application for the Scottish Ambulance
   Service. The Experience Lab aimed to explore and develop a basic
   prototype of a Directory App to support ambulance clinicians to consider
   alternatives to Accident and Emergency where appropriate, and support
   initial small scale testing. The Experience Labs provided the
   opportunity to co-design, develop and test a solution with users. The
   design-led approach enabled the delivery of a set of user-driven
   requirements for the development of the Directory App. The safe space
   for trialling and testing provided by the Labs together with the
   design-led approach allowed users to share their ideas and experience,
   contributing to the design of the ideal Directory App. (c) 2015 The

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is the exploration of the management of
   Business Intelligence (BI) solutions in the Norwegian industry. BI aims
   to improve data analysis and enhance business performance. Nonetheless,
   academics and practitioners note that BI is complex and difficult to
   manage. We interviewed BI managers in 5 companies who had been awarded
   the Norwegian Computer Society's BI prize, based on the following
   research question: What can we learn from the successful BI
   implementations and management in award-winning Norwegian companies? We
   surmise two findings. First, building upon concepts derived from the
   Digital Infrastructure Theory we find that while the Norwegian industry
   still has a traditional, complex BI architecture, it is scalable in the
   sense that they can add or remove elements, or even scrap the whole BI
   solution. The companies demonstrate innovation and adoption through
   their use of dashboards and real-time data. In light of these findings
   we propose a future research agenda for BI. Second, we offer three
   lessons for managers of BI in organisations. (C) 2015 The Authors.

   infocommunication devices in the first and second level of primary
   education and in secondary education in Hungary. In the experiment on
   the use of e-paper, information search, note taking and copying
   functions were appreciated as facilitators of teaching, but the learning
   content with static text and illustrations was rightly criticized by
   students who, on the other hand, appreciated the introduction of
   e-books. In the second experiment presented in this paper, richly
   illustrated, dynamic learning content complete with interactive tasks
   was introduced on iPad tablets and the Challenge-Based Learning Model
   was employed. Methods of digital pedagogy were transmitted in a mentored
   innovation environment, based on the trialogical learning model. Both
   teachers and learners considered these solutions more motivating and
   effective. This content development and methodology dissemination
   experiment may be considered a successful dissemination model for the
   introduction of new ICT tools in public education.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses issues related to the practice of writing in new
   media. Despite predictions made by 20th century thinkers, text culture
   is not dying. Rather, it is experiencing a renaissance associated with
   the transition from content consumption in mass media to the practice of
   writing on the Internet. The age of writers is a decade of digital
   social networks, during which mankind has produced much more writing
   than in any of the previous eras. Writing is no longer the skill of a
   small group of professionals. It has become a regular everyday skill for
   all social classes, and teenager stand as the vanguard of the new
   culture of writing. School education has still not caught up with this
   trend, and official culture has failed to link texts teenagers produce
   with the great literary tradition in pedagogic efforts. In general, a
   conservative cultural atmosphere creates a situation where that the
   writer may only be the person who has published in the centralized
   professional press, although the real figure of the writer today is
   simply a social network user. The meaning of ``graphomaniac{''} has
   gotten completely lost. Writing in new media is not so much an
   innovation as it is the overcoming of a legacy from an era of mass
   media, and a return to the text circulation model known before the
   invention of printing. The central thesis of this article is that the
   text remains a key aspect of the future of media as suitable for fast
   communication and anonymous messages. The author is not dead-the author
   has moved to Facebook.}},

Abstract = {{The author traces the history of the Digital Humanities (humanities
   computing) from 1950 to 1990. She starts from Roberto Busa's pioneering
   endeavour to render the works of Thomas Aquinas automatically treatable,
   and goes on to look at the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). The article
   covers a variety of methods and a large range of topics, with a clear
   interdisciplinary inclination. By its very nature, humanities computing
   has had to embrace ``the two cultures,{''} to bring in the rigour and
   the unambiguous, systematic, procedural methodologies characteristic of
   the sciences to address problems within the humanities that had hitherto
   been most often treated in an intuitive and serendipitous fashion. The
   pinnacle of achievement for this period has been the TEI, which has
   influenced the professional community as a whole. Humanities computing
   can contribute substantially to the growing interest in putting
   humanity's cultural heritage on the internet, not only for academic
   users, but also for lifelong learners and the general public. Our tools
   and techniques can also assist researchers in facilitating the
   digitization and encoding processes, where ways to reduce the costs of
   data creation, without loss of scholarly value or functionality, have to
   be found. Throughout its history, humanities computing has shown a
   healthy appetite for imagination and innovation, while continuing to
   maintain high scholarly standards. Now that the internet is such a
   dominant feature of everyday life, the opportunity exists for humanities
   computing to reach out much further than has hitherto been possible.}},

Abstract = {{The information and communication technologies can make a significant
   contribution towards achieving the goals of good governance.
   E-Governance through Digital India initiative in India is to strengthen
   the public Institutions by adopting innovation in Government
   functioning. It helps to improve responsive public service delivery
   through the active participation of citizens, and by gaining the
   citizens trust. This promotes efficient functioning of administration at
   all levels which is the heart of Sustainable governance. This paper
   aimed to present the Digital India programme with an analysis of its
   effect on citizen services. Digital India is centred on three core areas
   viz.
   Improving Digital Infrastructure,
   E-services, and
   Digital Citizen Empowerment
   By connecting governments at the central, state and local levels and
   undertaking the capacity building programmes through public institutions
   and Public Private Partnership where ever Possible with adequate
   management and planned governmental mechanism. Further this paper
   identifies the major gaps in the working of governance and suggests
   alternatives to promote inclusive growth of entire public services, to
   transform India in to a digitally empowered society and Knowledge based
   economy.}},

Abstract = {{Social Accessibility is an approach to shorten the time for making web
   content more accessible by allowing ICT volunteers to improve its
   quality through collaborative work. In this context new forms of
   volunteerism have emerged through the creative and innovative use of
   ICTs. The first action in social ICT volunteering at UNED, the largest
   public distance university in Spain, took place in 2013 by enrolling 13
   student volunteers. In 2014, the second action started with promising
   outcomes and more than 60 volunteers. The overall project aimed to
   improve the accessibility of original user-generated video learning
   resources contained in a multimedia repository of the university
   commonly used by the vast community of a quarter of a million students.
   The video classes were textually transcribed, subtitled and converted
   into mp3 audio. Its semantic labelling in the repository was also
   improved through collaborative volunteer metadata authoring. Main
   contribution of this paper is to show the ICT-based volunteering
   experience and the corresponding discussion on main findings. The
   experience has demonstrated the capacity of ICTs to promote social
   innovation at the universities and bring about citizen empowerment, in
   this case developing conscious awareness of the difficulties that must
   be faced daily by people with functional diversity and the benefits of
   implementing universal web accessibility. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Introducing an innovative approach to digital images, Wood explores what
   software tells us about moving images. Her discussion starts with the
   logic of realism informing representational spaces in many moving images
   found in live-action films, games, animations and data visualizations.
   These are contrasted with sequences found in Iron Man 3, Oblivion, Rango
   and Journey that map onto a reality drawing its contours from `digital
   space'. Describing digital contours, Wood builds on her discussion of
   software based on interviews and analysis of Autodesk Maya. Digital
   contours are explained as movements and proximities in a digitally
   configured space. Based on non-representational theories used by
   cultural geographers, Software and the Moving Image puts forward
   more-than-representational space to explain the experience of digital
   contours in moving images.}},

Journal = {{ARCHEOLOGIA E CALCOLATORI}},

Pages = {{45-51}},
Abstract = {{Social sciences and humanities, and cultural heritage have been
   investigated at the National Research Council of Italy (CNR) since the
   agency's reform in March 4, 1963. From that date on, CNR has made it
   possible for the Italian SSH and CH communities to undergo a rapid and
   far-reaching development, which has brought about vital technological
   innovations such as the setting up of Italy's first digital library in
   1964 - as well as substantial services to the country - one thinks of
   the industrial applications provoked by the rapid improvement of
   cultural heritage restoration techniques in the aftermath of the
   Florence flood of November 4, 1966. Today SSH and CH researchers are
   part of the Department of Social Sciences and Humanities, and Cultural
   Heritage (DSU-CNR). At the center of DSU-CNR investigations are all
   social objects, be they material or immaterial (artifacts, books, social
   findings), but always set by a person, which now makes a repositioning
   of technological development increasingly urgent. Persons are not out
   there only to make sure machines work, they are expected to ask the
   questions that human beings find it necessary to pose while proceeding
   along the via humanitatis. Culture is about people that take part in the
   project of constructing Europe as a society that ought to be less
   unequal, less unjust, less segregating, and less passive with regard to
   differing starting environments. CNR researchers work in synergy and
   express the potentials of diverse sectors. They have integrated findings
   and methods of history, philology, linguistics, archaeology, physics,
   chemistry, and ICT. Among the new cross-disciplinary fields that have
   emerged are: heritage science, the ageing society and migration studies.
   The result is a multidisciplinary context, which is dynamic and
   productive, and in which natural sciences dialogue with humanities for
   the sake of cultural heritage cognition, conservation and valorization.}},

Journal = {{ARCHEOLOGIA E CALCOLATORI}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{131-140}},
Abstract = {{The Or.C.He.S.T.R.A. project focuses on the development of a set of ICT
   solutions supporting the ``smart{''} valorization of the tangible and
   intangible cultural heritage of the Campania Region, in particular the
   city of Naples and its historic center, for citizens/visitors/tourists
   while fulfilling the principles of sustainability and eco-friendliness.
   The project investigates the perspectives of applying the Smart City
   paradigm in the Cultural Heritage field. Thus, this research outlines
   the emerging concept of ``Smart Cultural Heritage{''} and proposes a new
   integrated approach, in which the fundamental value of the cultural
   framework is acknowledged in the complexity of the ``smart{''} model.
   The studies on Cultural Commons are invoked as a basis for the analysis
   on the advantages of sharing common cultural resources (such as cultural
   heritage and the related digital information) within the Communities,
   identified in their inclination to innovation by means of the Evolving
   Networks model. In this context the Or. C.He.S.T.R.A. project aims at
   defining a new model of an integrated multidisciplinary approach to
   Naples' historic center: a participatory, cooperative, complex system of
   heterogeneous information on the identified area, ranging from mobility,
   to health, energy, cultural heritage. The integration of different
   aspects increases their potential, affecting the values of
   ``cohesion{''} and ``density{''} of the networks of shared contents,
   goods and services in the area, and supporting the availability of
   culture and innovation in the community, facilitating their assumption
   and thus contributing to the generation of value on the territory.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper two experimental projects conducted in recent years by the
   Digital Archaeology Laboratory at Foggia University are described. The
   projects are oriented to examine possible solutions for the use of ICT
   in the communication of archaeology that imply specific attention
   towards technologies, languages and creativity. The first project
   described is TimeMachine, a virtual reality application realized with
   real-time animation technologies that allows the user to move freely
   inside reconstruction, hypotheses and documentation of an archaeological
   stratigraphic excavation. The latter is Heritouch, a multimedia system
   for digital storytelling regarding the huge collection of Greek pottery
   of the Fondazione Sicilia at Palermo. Albeit regarding very different
   aspects of archaeology, the common aim of the two projects was to
   achieve an innovative methodology for the production of digital content
   that, on one hand provides the use of innovative technologies for the
   creation and fruition of cultural resources and, on the other, tries to
   engage the competences of the professionals and the characteristics of
   the knowledge domain.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in the excavation and osteological studies of human
   skeletal remains have shown the need to adopt a computer-based approach,
   which is able to integrate the knowledge and skills acquired in recent
   years by different branches of archaeo-antropological studies, using
   modern and innovative tools. JASs (Journal of Anthropological Sciences)
   has repeatedly promoted a ``renewal{''} of the practices related to
   information management, both through the creation of the forum ``Sharing
   databases in digital Anthropology{''}, and through the publication of
   many international works linked to this topic. In order to address the
   management of large amounts of anthropological and paleopathological
   data and their subsequent processing and interpretation, the Division of
   Paleopathology of Pisa University has created an extensive project
   relating to excavation and laboratory activities designed to develop a
   number of data storage protocols and subsequent inclusion into a GIS
   system. This project has been essentially organized into a tripartite
   structure; the information system includes two main protocols designed
   by the research team of the Division of Paleopathology of the University
   of Pisa that work on an OS Windows: 1. the software SIUS manages the
   skeletal unit computer records, which aim to store all the
   archaeological, taphonomic and anthropological data recorded on the
   field during archaeological excavations; 2. the software BONES stores
   and handles the dozens of anthropological and paleopathological records
   compiled during the examination of the skeletal remains in the
   laboratory. The GIS system allows interaction between the protocols
   using the two types of software.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{1-26}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to address changes in public communication
   following the advent of Internet social networking tools and the
   emerging web 2.0 technologies which are providing new ways of sharing
   information and knowledge. In particular public administrations are
   called upon to reinvent the governance of public affairs and to update
   the means for interacting with their communities. The paper develops an
   analysis of the distribution, diffusion and performance of the official
   profiles on Twitter adopted by the Italian municipalities (comuni) up to
   November 2013. It aims to identify the patterns of spatial distribution
   and the drivers of the diffusion of Twitter profiles; the performance of
   the profiles through an aggregated index, called the Twitter performance
   index (Twiperindex), which evaluates the profiles' activity with
   reference to the gravitational areas of the municipalities in order to
   enable comparisons of the activity of municipalities with different
   demographic sizes and functional roles. The results show that only a
   small portion of innovative municipalities have adopted Twitter to
   enhance e-participation and e-governance and that the drivers of the
   diffusion seem to be related either to past experiences and existing
   conditions (i.e. civic networks, digital infrastructures) developed over
   time or to strong local community awareness. The better performances are
   achieved mainly by small and medium-sized municipalities. Of course, the
   phenomenon is very new and fluid, therefore this analysis should be
   considered as a first step in ongoing research which aims to grasp the
   dynamics of these new means of public communication.}},

Abstract = {{The cultural industry in China has made great progress these years. The
   seventh session of the Sixth Plenary Session and eighteenth meeting
   provides a perfect opportunity for the development of China's cultural
   industry. In the process of developing cultural industry, it is crucial
   to pay attention to the protection of cultural content and passing on,
   for the reason that it is the ``raw material{''} and ``foundation{''} of
   development. The cultural industry is a ``blank check{''} without
   content, which is good-looking but not working. As an important part of
   cultural development, intangible cultural heritage protection and
   exploitation is urgent, because it is not only an important source of
   developing cultural industry, but also a essential way to protect
   national culture, inherit Chinese civilization and improve the image of
   a country. So how to keep pace with the rapid development of new media,
   make protection and exploitation of intangible cultural heritage is a
   significant task.
   According to UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Intangible Cultural
   Heritage, the defination of the intangible cultural heritage is as
   follows, ``The intangible cultural heritage refers to the various groups
   and organizations sometimes are regarded by the individuals as all kinds
   of practices, performances, expression forms, knowledge systems and
   skills and the relevant tools, material objects, handicrafts and
   cultural sites. With the change of environment, and the relationship
   with the nature and the historical conditions the various groups and
   organizations constantly make the intangible cultural heritage from
   generation to generation get innovation, at the same time make
   themselves have a sense of identity and history. Thus they pomote the
   cultural diversity and stimulate the creativity of human beings.
   With the development and popularization of new media technology, the
   intangible cultural heritage faces how to utilize the new medium
   environment to construct the platform of development opportunities. And
   in a sense, the survival ability of new media depends on the creation
   and the consumption of the ``content{''}. Therefore, grasping the
   development trend of new media and strongly promoting the digital
   content production and animation, the creation of online games will
   promote the development of information and cultural industries in our
   country to form new economic growth point.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an innovative prototype for smart asthma spirometry device
   to be used by doctors and asthma patients is presented. The novelty in
   this prototype relies in the fact that it is destined to subtend not
   only adults but offers an efficient and attractive manner to accommodate
   children patients as well thus, making it efficient for doctors,
   patients and parents to detect and monitor such intricate cases at
   stages as early as six years old. Moreover, the apparatus used enables
   us to integrate a vital parameter representing the Forced Expiratory
   Volume to the final diagnosis. Besides, the presented device will
   automatically diagnose those patients, assess their asthma condition,
   and schedule their medication process without excessive visits to
   medical centers whilst providing doctors with accurate and pertinent and
   comprehensive medical data in a chronological fashion. Zooming into
   under the hood of the device, a fully reliable hardware digital system
   lies along with a flowmeter detector and a Bluetooth emitter to
   interface with a user-friendly GUI-based application installed on
   smartphones which incorporates appealing animated graphics to encourage
   children to take the test. Furthermore, the device offers the capability
   of storing chronological data and a relevant resourceful display for
   accurate tracking of patients' medical record, the evolvement of their
   asthma condition, and the administered medication. Finally, the entire
   device is aligned with the medical requirements as per doctors' and
   telemedicine specialists' recommendations; the experiments carried out
   demonstrated the effectiveness and sustainable use of such device.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This chapter introduces the role that libraries have played in
   the struggle for equity and access for people with disabilities. It
   explores the historical evolution of the library and its service to
   patrons with disabilities and the significance that the now dominant
   role of the Internet and digital library resources hold in the realm of
   equal access to information and resources.
   Methodology/approach - We introduce the three sections in this book
   beginning with libraries and their service and engagement of patrons
   with disabilities, continuing with a discussion of the accessibility of
   digital library resources, and concluding with a discussion of
   international laws and policies that relate to libraries and digital
   inclusion.
   Findings - The Internet and related information and communication
   technologies have offered libraries around the world many new
   opportunities to support and extend their activities to support
   accessibility and inclusion of people with disabilities. The structure
   of this book and its case studies provide inspiration for libraries and
   librarians that seek to expand the inclusion of their libraries and the
   communities that they support.
   Originality/value - This chapter introduces a book that is intended to
   provide best practices and innovative ideas to share amongst libraries,
   while publicizing the contributions of libraries in promoting social
   inclusion of and social justice for people with disabilities to those in
   the library community, and helping libraries to better articulate their
   contributions in these areas to disability groups, funders,
   policymakers, and other parts of their communities.}},

Abstract = {{The more complex our cities become the more difficult it is for
   designers to use traditional tools for understanding and analyzing the
   inner essence of an eco-system such as the contemporary urban
   environment. Even many of the recently crafted digital tools fail to
   address the necessity for a more holistic design approach which captures
   the virtual and the physical, the immaterial and the material. Handling
   of massive chunks of information, classification and assessment of
   diverse data is nowadays more crucial than ever before. We see a
   significant potential in combining the fields of composition in music
   and architecture through the use of information technology. Merging the
   two fields has the intense potential to release new, innovative tools
   for urban designers. This paper describes an innovative tool developed
   at the Technical University of Crete, through which an urban designer
   can work on the music transcription of a specific urban environment
   applying music compositional rules and filters in order to identify
   discordant entities, highlight imbalanced parts and make design
   corrections. Our cities can be tuned.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the application of innovative and interdisciplinary
   collaboration methods that emerged from the rapidly developing field of
   information technology and its intersection within the realm of design
   and architecture. These events, also referred to as hackathons, have
   risen in popularity in recent years (Artiles \& Wallace, 2013) and stem
   from a design response for the increasing demand for accelerated design
   decisions within the field of architecture. This paper examines the
   potential of hackathons as a platform for rapid development of design
   ideas into prototypes within a time constraint of 24 hours. The paper
   explores the hackathon as a robust foundational element for pedagogical
   approaches rooted in interdisciplinary collaboration. Using a case-study
   research methodology, this paper probes the framework of the event, the
   outcomes, and the lessons learned. As this paper demonstrates, the
   hackathon required participants to identify and explore shifting
   territories through interdisciplinary teamwork to arrive at innovative
   solutions. In this setting, the format of the hackathon serves as a
   vibrant territory that enables a concrete theoretical contribution to
   design pedagogy, CAAD education, and collaborative professional
   practice.}},

   processes of design development and fabrication, the boundaries between
   design and production become increasingly blurred. The methodology of
   the process of creation changes: the design development phase reaches up
   to the last produced model in a product series, in the same time the
   serial production cycle already starts with the first prototype. The aim
   of this research project is to explore and show the re-strengthening
   link between form, function, material and fabrication particularly
   driven by raising prominence of digital tools for design and production.
   Hereby the focus is on two points: the implementation of user data/
   input in the light of `Open Innovation' as driver of form and function
   on one hand and the crafing inspired aproach of a comprehensive
   integration of material properties, behaviour tradional techniques of
   processing into the the design process.}},

   to adopt it. In this context, this paper analyzes the use of EPS in the
   production of concrete formwork by reviewing its application in
   contemporary examples. In order to develop a clear assessment of the
   possibilities of expanding prefabrication in concrete using robotic
   hot-wire cutting, this paper also documents a set of practical
   experiments developed in the laboratory, addressing three material
   challenges: form; texture and composition. This research involved the
   design, formwork production and casting of concrete elements to explore
   the limits and characterize the process of robotic hot-wire fabrication
   in the context of concrete prefabrication. By recognizing the different
   approaches present in contemporary examples and in the explored
   practical experiments, we point out the advantages and limitations of
   using hot-wire cutting, and develop the reasons behind its limited
   application in practice.}},

Abstract = {{New e-learning systems often innovate by bringing together different
   content representation forms (multimodality) and the orchestration of
   access to the individual representations (workflow). The representation
   forms themselves (e.g. prose text, algebraic equations, video, concept
   maps and many others) are the building blocks of new e-learning designs,
   however most of these representation forms predate the field of
   e-learning research or even digital media. A less usual approach to
   e-learning innovations is to design new representation forms. ArcForm
   (Allsopp, 2013) is a new network notation using nodes, arcs and labels.
   It uses arcs connecting two nodes to represent transitive statements,
   but it differs significantly from other network or graph based notations
   by for example also allowing arcs that point from or to other arcs and
   thereby supporting recursive composition of complex meanings. The result
   uniquely combines four areas of notational value: 1) It is similar to
   natural language - both in its expressiveness and in the way meanings
   are expressed. 2) It presents separate meanings as separate, though
   connected, tokens supporting a visuospatially intuitive experience
   similar to navigating a geographical map. 3) It is based on a simple
   syntax that allows meaning to be stored as structured data thereby
   supporting querying, filtering and the dynamic visualisation of content.
   4) Finally, it allows individual meanings to be the object of online
   social evaluation. This notation can be considered as a foundation for a
   new category of e-learning systems. The idea is that these e-learning
   systems would allow users on a meaning by meaning (rather than a page by
   page) level to follow their own paths through available knowledge, to
   explore only what they find most interesting for their current learning
   goals, and to configure views that present content that they find
   relevant. One possibility is that it will allow students to develop and
   demonstrate reflective thinking independently of traditional essay
   writing skills. This is explored through an imagined scenario where a
   student interacts with one of these systems to create a new perspective
   using existing meanings.}},

Abstract = {{Social media and higher education pedagogy have enjoyed a chequered
   relationship, with significant debates about the efficacy of social
   media as a site of learning, the manager/host of an individual's
   learning trajectory and as a tool of facilitating collaborative learning
   at scale. This paper presents the exploratory findings from the
   evaluation of Constitution UK, an innovative civic engagement run by the
   London School of Economics. We argue that some of the behaviours
   inherent in social media learning (centred on fleeting connections,
   digital identity and discontinuous engagement) can create the conditions
   for effective learning and achievement at scale. Through the project we
   identified a number of challenges that social media as a learning
   platform and mode of learning itself pose for traditional on-line
   education including the role of the academic, the transformative effect
   of harnessing the massive and difficulties in approaching learning
   design in an unstructured and informal environment.}},

Abstract = {{The present research paper is focusing on the way social innovation is
   shaping the digital civil society. As new as it is, this concept has
   roots in local and international initiative, coming both from citizens
   and from organizations, with the purpose to use private resources for
   the public good. The primary aim is to make an exploratory intercession
   in the way we can define digital civil society, to identify the patterns
   in the social innovation as a global shaper for it and to map a start
   line for future analytical research, analyzing a series of online
   platforms and applications across the globe. In order to map the current
   state of the concept of digital civil society and to identify the most
   important aspects of it, the authors have chosen to develop their
   methodology research based on international insights provided by
   nonprofit organizations whose mission is to offer access to technology
   and to use technology for the community development and from
   international examples of digital innovation for the social good. This
   emergent research gave the authors a better understanding of the
   international context and mapping initiatives that have passed the
   incipient stage and are become a norm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to show the technical feasibility and current
   development status of a hardware reconfiguration scheme via digital TV
   (DTV) signal. The scheme is able to deliver the pre-synthetized Field
   Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware bit-stream (core) to DTV
   receivers from different manufacturers. Thus, the receiver framework can
   remount the core and reconfigure the FPGA device itself. This innovative
   approach presents a new hardware reconfiguration scheme that can be used
   in several projects of intelligent reconfigurable devices in the field.
   This helps improve future embedded systems and receiver hardware
   architectures so that the hardware legacy added by the use of
   Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) component devices is
   minimized}},

Abstract = {{ALOS-Next/Tandem-L is a proposal for a highly innovative L-band SAR
   satellite mission for the global observation of dynamic processes on the
   Earth's surface with hitherto unparalleled quality and resolution. It is
   based on a collaboration between DLR and JAXA which started with a
   pre-phase A study in 2013 and is currently undergoing a phase A study.
   Thanks to the novel imaging techniques and the vast recording capacity
   with up to 8 Tbytes/day, it will provide vital information for solving
   pressing scientific questions in the biosphere, geosphere, cryosphere,
   and hydrosphere. By this, the new L-band SAR mission will make an
   essential contribution for a better understanding of the Earth system
   and its dynamics. ALOS-Next/Tandem-L will, moreover, open new
   opportunities for risk analysis, disaster management and environmental
   monitoring by employing especially designed acquisition modes and
   techniques in combination with a reconfigurable tandem satellite
   configuration and an L-band SAR instrument with advanced digital
   beamforming techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology for the calculation of a digital
   elevation model (DEM) and the corresponding orthophotography at very
   high resolution (20 cm for the DEM, 10 cm for the orthophotography) on a
   large surface (more than 3 km(2)). Image acquisition was done with an
   off-the-shelf camera (Sony NEX-5N) attached to a delta kite. Developing
   the most accessible methodology being one of the goals of this study,
   the overall cost of the apparatus is limited to less than 1500 euros.
   This method has been developed to form an alternative with acquisitions
   from small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). In particular, kite as
   payload carrier is seen as being complementary to lightweight
   multicopters, which are increasingly used for remote sensing
   applications {[}1, 2]. Kite is of a strong interest when the use of
   radio-controlled and motorized systems is hampered by local regulation
   and/or when too strong winds keep these lightweight devices on ground.}},

Abstract = {{Staggered SAR is an innovative 2-D imaging system utilizing the digital
   beam-forming (DBF) technique and the continuous variation of pulse
   repetition frequency (PRF). However, due to the PRF variation, the echo
   data in the azimuth is non-uniformly sampled. To achieve good imaging
   quality, it is indispensable to interpolate the data of the staggered
   SAR to be uniform before further imaging processing. In order to realize
   efficient interpolation for different PRF variation schemes, we propose
   a non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT)-based interpolation method
   to resample the non-uniform data of the staggered SAR in this paper. The
   complexity of the proposed interpolation method is in the order of
   O(MlogM), where M is the number of azimuth sampling. Simulation is
   performed based on the echo data of point target from the staggered SAR.}},

Abstract = {{This paper problematizes the challenges of setting up a new mobile
   learning project in a Croatia, a country where technology-enhanced tools
   in classrooms are not often used due to a number of reasons, two of
   which are the lack of infrastructure and no teacher professional
   development. There are three focal points of this paper: designing
   scalable and durable mobile learning solution, working with teachers in
   order to ensure an adequate teacher development and creating appropriate
   digital contents to match primary school level 2, 3 and 4 curriculum.
   Scalable and durable mobile learning solutions in the context of this
   project include two main platforms: (1) a mobile learning tablet
   application for primary school students and (2) a designer application
   mainly aimed at digital contents designers and producers, to also be
   easily used by the teachers. On the other side, it describes the
   processes of strengthening digital competences of the participating
   school teachers, including technology competence, leadership capacity
   and technology supported curricular innovation processes. Thirdly, the
   issues of design and implementation of digital lessons are explored with
   a special focus on digitalization of the existing non-digital lessons
   together with the teachers, wherever appropriate and feasible. As a
   result, conceptual prototypes of digital lessons are produced to be
   analyzed and discussed amongst teachers and researchers, after which the
   selected ones get integrated into digital lessons for tablet computer.
   In addition to describing the threefold process and the accompanying
   issues, the paper presents preliminary experiences and results in this
   novel research initiative, sets up mid-term goals and proposes and
   adequate methodology in achieving the project goals.}},

Abstract = {{When first introducing PBL into a traditional teaching environment,
   several problems tend to arise. Not changing the structure means that
   first PBL experiences can only be carried out by a small group of
   instructors. The use of technology, teamwork methods, and the sharing of
   individual experiences resulted in some techniques and ideas to
   introduce PBL successfully in our actual curriculum. This paper presents
   an experience using this form of active learning in a subject belonging
   to our Mechanical Engineering degree, which combines three essential
   aspects in training students: enabling them to be digitally competent
   according to the European Union considerations, designing and conducting
   active learning, and analyzing the students' motivation through their
   educational process. Although the experience was developed in
   traditional designed environments, ITs were used to ease the
   collaboration between students.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some current results from an ongoing research into
   how a non-digital business model may transform successfully into a
   digital business model. Amit and Zott's break-through business model
   construct is assumed here as the core conceptual foundation for
   digitalization. Its main focus on economic value creation and
   appropriation attempts to unify several contemporary theoretical strands
   (Schumpeterian innovation, value chain logic, product-market strategies,
   resource-based view of firm, transaction cost economics and strategic
   networks). Building upon this conceptualization and by using a digital
   transformation of a bookselling company as a means of illustration, we
   bring to the forefront two central arguments to be considered for a
   successful transformation of business model from non-digital to digital.
   First, digital transformations shift the notion of firm centric value
   creation and as such cannot be comprehended without the network. Thus
   the digital transformation of business models implies multi-actor
   coordination, where no single executive authority may command the
   desired behavior, other than by means of negotiations. Secondly, the
   economic characteristics of digital information challenge conventional
   managerial wisdom such as the function of positive network effects being
   opposite to the conventional business logic, reduction of transaction
   costs and the negligible marginal costs, among others. A key assumption
   here is that managers' wisdom is challenged by these characteristics of
   digital information economics as they act as filters that enable and
   hinder opportunities, adequate analysis, planning and decision-making. A
   review of previous studies on business model change indicates that
   digital transformation of business models is rather underresearched.
   Analysis show that whilst these studies provide solid grounds on the
   factors that hinder and enable business model change, they may not be
   sufficient to explain and account for digital transformation of business
   models. Majority of these studies provide very weak connections of the
   business model with the value network thus disregarding the very
   distinct feature of business model. We consider that future exploration
   of these central arguments that this study advocates, would potentially
   provide insights on how to embark into a successful transformation, and
   thereby avoid the tragic fate of Blockbuster.}},

Abstract = {{The change from the traditional economy to the digital economy impacts
   the competence required in the field of accounting. Further, due to
   limited resources, time management has become one of the most crucial
   factors when planning and implementing courses. One solution to the
   above-mentioned challenges is sharing professional knowledge, good
   practices, and work, by applying innovative teaching methods in order to
   find the synergies in teaching, also in higher education. The starting
   point for implementing co-teaching is administrative encouragement,
   which requires a willingness to take risks and an acceptance of
   experimental quality. However, the key to successful planning and
   implementation of collaborative teaching is the genuine individual
   commitment of teachers to involve co-teaching. As a result, the
   co-teaching approach can help reach the ultimate goal: to improve the
   educational outcomes of students. There are different ways to apply the
   co-teaching methods. This paper deals with the co-teaching methods used
   particularly in accounting courses, but also in other entrepreneurship
   education in the Department of Business Management in Mikkeli University
   of Applied Sciences, Finland. In addition, this paper aims to present
   the benefits and requirements of applying these methods in practice,
   taking into account the aspects of both teaching and educational
   institution.}},

   engineering practices as the teaching model and transferring from
   knowledge-based curriculum mode to theory-practice combination
   curriculum mode, students' learning abilities, practice abilities and
   innovation abilities can be improved. From the effect of the practical
   application, it can get better results as the theory knowledge and

   outstanding engineers, as well as the promotion of the CDIO Teaching
   mode, the education should continue to explore new laws and models in

   course introduction is considered as the guide into the DSP in order to
   enhance students' sense of professional identity and belonging. Then,
   the practice and design should be organized elaborately under the CDIO
   model for the purpose of stimulating students' desire to learn the
   course and to solve problems in engineering practice. Matlab and other
   specific applications as a development tool are used to realize the
   specific applications. Finally, the paper tried to establish a new

Abstract = {{Virtual environments are recognized as more effective than other digital
   approaches for the acquisition of several abilities. This is because the
   brain recognizes the virtual world as real and this facilitates the
   transfer of the newly acquired skills to the real world. In this paper,
   we present a game that has been designed and developed with the aim of
   teaching spatial orientation abilities to teenagers with mild
   intellectual impairments. In particular, the game focuses on the
   training of two basic skills: perspective taking and mental rotation.
   Perspective taking refers to the ability of imagining how the world
   looks like from another person's point of view, while mental rotation is
   the ability to mentally represent and manipulate physical objects in
   one's mind. The game, which takes place in a virtual environment, shows
   the player a scene with some objects on the table. The player has to
   choose among four provided alternatives, the one that shows how the
   scene would look like from a different side of the table. The game was
   first developed to be used with either a desktop pc monitor or an
   interactive touch table. In this case, a virtual world is represented,
   but the player is not completely immersed in it, he just looks at the
   scene from outside. A second version of the same game has then been
   developed using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), which makes the player
   feel immersed in the virtual environment, where he can freely move
   around just as if it was real. In this paper, we discuss both advantages
   and disadvantages of the immersive Virtual Reality (VR) compared to the
   desktop VR. In fact, on the one hand, having the possibility to
   ``dive{''} into the virtual world allows the player to: Better build a
   mental model of the scene and the involved objects by freely moving
   around the table and examining the objects from all the possible
   perspectives; Manage by himself the amount of help needed: it is always
   possible, at any time of the game, to move to the other side of the
   table and see what the scene looks like. Increase his involvement in the
   game by exploring the virtual world as he pleases. Have a better
   learning transfer thanks to the similarities between the virtual and the
   real worlds. On the other hand, using a HMD can be tiring and cause
   sickness to some players. Furthermore, the presence of a complete
   environment in which to move and explore, can draw the attention away
   from the main task of the game and therefore influence learning
   negatively. Experiments are planned to verify the foreseen advantages
   and disadvantages involving young adults with mild intellective
   disabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Game based Learning (GBL) has been promoted as a way to enhance science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics education, in several aspects.
   In this paper we aim at conceptualizing the creative, embodied and
   immersive potentials in the context of teaching geometry in primary
   school. We review two cases where the concept of ``game{''} is related
   to the development of pupils' creativity and innovation skills. One
   intervention is inviting pupils to become designers at a ``game
   factory{''}, by using the digital mathematics tool GeoGebra. The second
   intervention uses mobile technology to have students participate in a
   collaborative game requiring them to take part in an embodied activity
   outside the classroom. In the paper we develop a model that view game
   based creative learning in as a combination of constructive, immersive,
   and reflective aspects. We do that by considering different meanings of
   the word ``game{''} in a mathematics education context. That is game as
   a medium, game as a framing of educational processes, and games as an
   object. Considering games as media highlights the similarities with
   texts and any other means of delivering content. We can ask what message
   a specific game conveys, and discuss how well suited the game is
   compared to other mediations of the same content. Games can be described
   a as ``semiotic domains{''} that allow players to interact with
   knowledge and make sense of the world (Gee, 2003). Games can act as a
   framing used to govern and plan educational processes, either as direct
   motivational driver, aiming at engaging more students in certain planned
   activities (Hamari, Koivisto, \& Sarsa, 2014), or as an established form
   of process control in which complex situations can be played out. In a
   game the player act according to rules and the process has a natural
   direction towards finishing or advancing in the game. Furthermore games
   can frame educational processes by challenge the learners perspective
   through narratives and role-playing (Shaffer, 2006). Pupils creative
   design competencies and motivation to create and develop games have been
   documented as unusually relevant and high (Kafai, 1995; Tekinbas,
   Gresalfi, Peppler, \& Santo, 2014). Mathematical thinking s can be used
   to think game scenarios through, to govern the competitive aspects of a
   game and ensure that the gameplay is fair and balanced in terms of the
   involved struggle. Game literacy, both in terms of playing, producing
   and discussing games, does thus relate to mathematical literacy and
   knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Game-based learning (GBL) is a new educational paradigm. Digital
   game-based learning (DGBL) is a well established teaching pedagogy in
   higher education; commonly referred to as a GBL. However, there are many
   non-digital educational games available which do not require any
   technological assistance. Non-digital game-based learning (NDGBL) has
   also many advantages over digital game-based learning in education.
   Nonetheless, the teacher is the most important part of successful
   implementation of any DGBL or NDGBL approach. Teachers' perceptions are
   crucial towards this type of innovative learning because teachers are a
   bridge between students and games. Many studies were conducted that
   presents teachers' perceptions on the more popular form of GBL, DGBL
   approach. There are very few studies presenting teachers' perceptions on
   NDGBL. Therefore, in this paper, I present teachers' perceptions on my
   proposed NDGBL approach. This paper provides a critical analysis of
   teachers' feedback who played non-digital mathematical games to test the
   effectiveness of my proposed NDGBL for adults in higher education.}},

Abstract = {{The EU-based industry for non-leisure games (applied games) is an
   emerging business. As such it is still fragmented and needs to achieve
   critical mass to compete globally. Nevertheless its growth potential is
   widely recognized and even suggested to exceed the growth potential of
   the leisure games market. The European project Realizing an Applied
   Gaming Ecosystem (RAGE) is aiming at supporting this challenge. RAGE
   will help to seize these opportunities by making available an
   interoperable set of advanced technology assets, tuned to applied
   gaming, as well as proven practices of using asset-based applied games
   in various real-world contexts, and finally a centralized access to a
   wide range of applied gaming software modules, services and related
   document, media, and educational resources within an online community
   portal called the RAGE Ecosystem. Besides this, an integration between
   the RAGE Ecosystem and relevant social network interaction spaces that
   arranges and facilitates collaboration that underlie research and
   development (R\&D) as well as market-oriented innovation and
   exploitation will be created in order to support community building as
   well as collaborative asset exploitation of the contents of the
   Ecosystem. In this paper we will outline a conceptual approach exploring
   methods to first of all integrate content management and community
   collaboration support portal technologies based on Digital Library (DL),
   Media Archive (MA), and Learning Management System (LMS) infrastructures
   with social network support technologies. This will allow for a seamless
   integration of social network advantages within community portal
   operation. On the other hand it will support information, content, and
   knowledge sharing, as well as persistency of social interaction threads
   within Social Networking Sites (SNSs) that are connected to the RAGE
   Ecosystem. The paper reviews possible alternative architectural
   integration concepts as well as related authentication, access, and
   information integration challenges. In this way on the one hand a
   qualitative evaluation regarding an optimal technical integration
   approach is facilitated while on the other hand design approaches
   towards support features of resulting user interfaces are initiated.}},

Abstract = {{Game-based learning (GBL) remains important for engagement and learning.
   It is about much more than simply learning with games. GBL involves
   several steps, approaches, elements and features in gaming that lead to
   and enhance engagement and leaning. The accelerating pace of gaming and
   digital technology, along with increasing pressure on teachers to
   improve pupils' performance and achievement, means there is a need to
   search for innovative approaches to GBL that will engage pupils with
   learning. By ``engagement{''} we mean the capacity to create and sustain
   a momentum of continuous learning so that pupils become self-directed
   learners. However, only a few surveys explore the connections between
   approaches, strategies, resources, teaching and learning in the context
   of designing and using GBL to increase engagement. These connections may
   be understood as ``learning experiences{''} and ``conditions{''} in
   classroom learning environments. Therefore, the attempt to harness and
   maximise teaching and learning approaches, strategies and resources is
   at the centre of GBL research and initiatives. Thus, we designed and
   administered a teacher questionnaire as part of design-based research
   (DBR). The purpose of the questionnaire was to gain insight into
   teachers' instructional practices, give teachers the opportunity to
   share their teaching experiences, and keep a broad and open
   understanding of teachers' experiences, including their positive and
   negative feelings and thoughts. The findings presented in this paper
   evaluate increasingly varied materials, resources and solutions for
   enhancing learning within primary and post-primary schools. This survey
   also aimed to gauge teachers' enthusiasm for using a game-based approach
   to designing classroom activities and for extended learning, towards our
   effort to introduce and enhance GBL approaches. The survey results may
   improve our understanding of teachers' concerns, requirements and GBL
   suitability in relation to introducing and using games as a teaching and
   learning method in the classroom and for independent and extended
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{This demonstrator presents a novel framework for the characterization
   and modeling of mixed-signal systems. It will be shown that a joint
   analog and digital analysis is relevant for future radio-frequency (RF)
   components and devices. A characterization procedure suitable for
   mixed-signal systems is presented based on a National Instruments (NI)
   PXI architecture by analyzing the system in a scattering wave
   perspective at each port. This framework allows an RF engineer to
   integrate innovative mixed-signal models on available RF/microwave
   simulators, such as the NI AWR Microwave Office. An example of various
   analog-to-digital-converters (ADCs) will be carried out by measuring its
   linear parameters, and then using it inside a simulator tool.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the meaning, role and concepts of lifelong learning
   and information and communication technology in the context of achieving
   rapid and effective adaptation of employees in public administration. IT
   education in business can be represented as a combination of academic
   and professional knowledge, skills and abilities that allow satisfying
   business needs and performing tasks in line with business requirements.
   Lifelong learning is an important step in the life of every individual
   that is now readily available, and can mean a major breakthrough in
   professional work or a complete change of business orientation. Lifelong
   learning refers not only to the time and training on the job, but also
   includes the time before, during and after the working life of every
   individual who care about their cultural, social and professional
   development. Capacity development of Croatian public institutions is
   supported through a number of important projects in the field of
   information and communication technologies at the national level. Career
   development and promotion in the civil service is closely associated
   with continuing academic education or professional training in the areas
   related to the workplace but also increasingly popular lifelong
   learning, especially in the field of ICT.
   The use of ICT offers the possibility of innovative methods of teaching
   and learning, using publicly available services, and professional
   collaboration worldwide. ICT Competency as a form of lifelong learning
   includes safe and convenient use of ICT in work, leisure and
   communication. This technology allows the use of the Internet, digital
   content, electronic media, personal computers, mobile phones, electronic
   ATM, electronic books, digital television, etc. ICT Competency is
   associated with logical and critical thinking with highly developed
   skills of information management and advanced communication skills. Due
   to the rapid technological development, well-planned and quality
   training is essential primarily of employees of public institutions, and
   then the user to be able to understand, apply and use new technological
   solutions.
   An example of this is e-Administration, which necessarily involves the
   use of information technology to increase the availability and
   facilitate the execution of public services for the benefit of citizens,
   business owners and employees in these services.}},

Abstract = {{Information revolution has resulted in fundamental changes in the fields
   of technology, economy, science and education, politics, publishing
   industry, culture and arts, but also in the way people think and behave.
   Social awareness for more progressive education, and also the urgent
   response to new requirements of research community, has prompted the new
   way of information creation and dissemination, which is reflected in
   electronic publishing and scientific production in open access. The main
   goal of this paper is to define a model for building the academic
   library as the vault of organized digital collections. The digital
   library mission implies systematic acquisition and organization of
   digital collections, managing collections and ensuring long-term access
   for users according to pre-established rules. The future of digital
   libraries depends on the ability of self-organization and
   transformation, in order to become the main centre of knowledge and
   distance learning, using complex software systems and constantly
   developing into flexible network structures. Digitization of the
   existing library materials, development of institutional repository,
   electronic publishing and organization of collections in open access,
   taking into account copyright regulations, should be in the focus of
   building a digital library. There are many significant digital library
   projects worldwide, but in Croatia, they are just starting. This article
   explores the possibilities of developing a model of the academic digital
   library that will be horizontally and vertically networked with other
   libraries, and thereby contribute not only to its own academic
   institution, but also to the entire creative industry on which it relies
   through its innovative activities and partnership with the economy.}},

Abstract = {{While the academy is a critical enabler and incubator for technological
   innovation, many senior university faculty are ``digital pilgrims{''}
   who are less adept at cloud computing than their ``digital native{''}
   counterparts. A lack of fundamental industrial hygiene in University
   departments, particularly those with the least exposure to cloud
   computing, combined with institutional norms which discourage university
   scrutiny of faculty, is a potential driver of security vulnerabilities
   as universities and departments transfer research activities, as well as
   institutional capital, into the cloud. This paper will provide a robust
   contemporary literature search to bound the issue, and suggest the
   methodology for surveying universities and faculty therein to determine
   the following five items: Comfort and conversance with cloud computing;
   Training received; Awareness of better industrial hygiene practices;
   Operational security awareness; Affect about privacy and disclosure. In
   summary, faculty, themselves, can drive significant risk to the
   enterprise. This paper intends to bound and frames this issue so that it
   may be elaborated by further research, and to create a baseline product
   that is of use to the academy and to the defense industrial base.}},

Abstract = {{As computing and displays become more pervasive and wireless networks
   are increasing the connections between people and things, humans inhabit
   both digital and physical realities. In this paper we describe our
   prototype Mirror Worlds framework, which is designed to fuse these
   realities: Fusality. Our goal for Fusality is to support innovative
   research and exhibitions in presence and collaboration, sensors and
   smart buildings and mixed reality in applications from engineering to
   art. By fusing live sensor data from the building and its occupants with
   online 3D environments and participants, we demonstrate a
   firstprinciples approach to online multi-entity messaging communication.
   This demonstration shows how the variety of Mirror Worlds clients can be
   supported through the open Web architecture. These technologies enable
   new possibilities for collaboration as well as directions for
   interoperability. Finally, we layout out our research agenda for the
   framework and discuss its transformative applications.}},

Journal = {{EDUCATION 3-13}},

Volume = {{43}},

Pages = {{404-419}},
Abstract = {{In the light of the European Union's interest in creativity and
   innovation, this paper, drawing on data from the EU project Creative
   Little Scientists (2011-2014), explores the teaching and learning of
   science and creativity in Early Years education. The project's
   conceptual framework, developed from detailed analysis of relevant
   literatures, highlighted the potential existence of a number of
   pedagogical synergies between inquiry-based science and creativity-based
   approaches in Early Years education. The science and creativity
   literature reviews were thus re-examined to identify synergistic
   features of teaching and learning in the Early Years. These were seen to
   include: play and exploration, motivation and affect, dialogue and
   collaboration, problem-solving and agency, questioning and curiosity,
   reflection and reasoning, and teacher scaffolding and involvement. Field
   work undertaken over a 4-month-period in 48 sites across the 9 partner
   countries provided the opportunity to examine the existence of these
   synergies in Early Years settings and primary classrooms with learners
   aged 3-8 years. Qualitative in nature, the fieldwork was framed by a
   case study strategy encompassing multiple methods of data collection:
   sequential digital images capturing interactions; observations
   supplemented by audio recording; timelines; and interviews with teachers
   and groups of children. The data set comprised 71 cases in early science
   (and mathematics), with 3 episodes of activity per case encapsulating
   creativity in these domains, resulting in 218 episodes for analysis. A
   deductive-inductive analytical approach was undertaken in two phases
   with cross-case analysis both within and between countries. The paper
   exemplifies the pedagogical synergies innovatively identified in the
   conceptual framework and documented in the fieldwork, and highlights the
   potential for creativity in exploratory science contexts. Additionally,
   it highlights differences between practice observed in preschool and
   primary settings and advances a new conceptual definition of creativity
   within Early Years science education.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative solutions generate positive contribution by improving
   businesses' production processes, decreasing environmental impact and
   simultaneously communicating social responsibility along with adequate
   education. Communication and innovation environments are known for their
   dynamicity. Such is currently represented by on-line communication
   channels, company innovation tools and new attitudes to information
   gathered through various digital technologies. The paper deals with
   using digital marketing in the eco-innovation process while presenting
   the results of the research aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises
   operating in the Slovak business environment. Through the research, we
   managed to clarify important facts which may enable us to solve out a

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to create and test the practical
   application of the business model maturity assessment solution based on
   the entrepreneur's perception of development of individual elements that
   influence the process of generating customer value and benefitting from
   this value. The concept development was based on the business model
   canvas (sterwalder and Pigneur, 2010) and tested through DELab UW
   (Digital Economy Lab at the University of Warsaw) on a sample of 46
   respondents, which consisted of two categories of businesses: those
   using R\&D processes and those who did not perform any R\&D activities.
   To grow and build competitive advantage, companies need broad-based
   innovation, not only in respect of products and technologies, but also
   in terms of their strategies and business models (Christensen, 2010;
   McGrath, 2012; Orlowski, 2013; Casadesus-Masanell, Zhu, 2013). A
   business model embodies the organisational and financial architecture of
   a business and mediates between technological innovation and the
   creation of economic value (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002). For
   companies using the outcomes of R\&D processes in their business,
   commercialisation is the basis for developing a business model.
   Therefore, it seems important to analyse the effect of R\&D
   commercialisation on the development of business model elements. To
   determine differences in the business model maturity between the R\&D
   and Non-R\&D groups of enterprises with the use of ANOVA test, the
   authors designed a Business Model Maturity Indicator. Furthermore, we
   tested a hypothesis, that the diversity of business model maturity
   depends on the use of R\&D in business operations.}},

Abstract = {{Storytelling is a powerful means of expression especially for voices
   that may be difficult to hear or represent in typical ways. This paper
   reports and reflects on our experiences of co-creating digital stories
   with school practitioners in a project focusing on embedding innovative
   technologies for children on the autism spectrum in classroom practice.
   The digital stories were short films or narrated sequences of slides and
   images that conveyed key views about experiences and practices with or
   around the technologies. The creation of the digital stories aimed to
   empower schools and individual teachers to construct and share their own
   authentic narratives and to build case examples of creative
   technology-enhanced teaching and learning. Through focusing on our
   experiences with one of the schools, we examine the use of digital
   stories as a method for enabling knowledge co-creation with
   practitioners and we discuss the evidential potential of digital
   stories. We argue that the co-creation of digital stories enabled
   teachers to find their voice in critiquing the usability, usefulness,
   efficacy and flexibility of the technologies. Furthermore, the stories,
   both the process of their creation and the final artefacts, provided a
   concrete grounding for knowledge co-creation about teaching practices
   and authentic technology-enhanced learning.}},

Abstract = {{Libraries support the parent institution's teaching, learning, and
   research programs irrespective of its nature being academic or corporate
   or Research and Development setup. Due to the impact of Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT), there has been a paradigm shift in the
   library services and the roles of information professionals. Librarians'
   role has been changed from information provider to facilitator of
   information, transition from print to electronic media, users have
   become `Active Users' than `Passive Users'. Emphasis in the libraries
   has been on `access' instead of `acquisition', `team work' rather than
   `individual contribution', solitary environment to networked
   environment. Hence, the present study attempts to highlight the current
   developments in academic libraries in order to tune with the changing
   information industry and requirements of the user community. The
   expertise and skills needed by the Librarians also calls for continuous
   updation of skills to possess expertise and skills to work in the
   complex, multifaceted and modern digital library. The author attempts to
   share his experiences and implementation at Virtual Learning Resource
   Centre and Digital Library, Gulbarga University, Karnataka and
   highlights some innovative practices and services that can be rendered
   in the academic libraries for better visibility and sustenance of

Abstract = {{Recent blackouts have shown the need for an innovative wide-area
   monitoring and control (WAMC) systems. With PMUs now embedded in
   protective relays, and the availability of fast processing technologies,
   many real-time wide area protection and control schemes can be
   implemented.
   An Out-of-Step (OOS) event that occurs between two connected areas in
   the power system, can ultimately result in a total blackout, and in such
   cases the two areas should be separated to contain the damage. The
   separation is achieved via OOS detection and tripping functions that
   operate on appropriate transmission lines. One of the most commonly used
   functions to achieve OOS tripping is the Dual-Blinder function.
   In this paper, a Phasor-Based OOS function is compared to the
   Dual-Blinder function: the tripping times of these two functions are
   compared via multiple hardware-in-the loop simulations covering various
   disturbance scenarios. The implementation is carried out using a
   real-time digital simulator, Phasor Measurements Units (PMUs) embedded
   in the relays, a GPS clock, and a synchrophasor vector processor (SVP).
   Simulation results showed that the Phasor-Based function predicted the
   OOS event and responded faster in the cases where the system was poorly
   damped while the Dual-Blinder method has responded faster in the other
   cases. The paper concludes with suggestions for improved future
   implementation of the PhasorBased OOS tripping function.}},

Abstract = {{Since its invention 60 years ago the synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   principle has been continuously pushed further in terms of information
   density. Future SAR systems are required to collect data in different
   frequency bands and polarizations with finer spatio-temporal resolution
   and higher quality. These requirements drive technology developments
   with a trend towards digital radars. This type of radar is highly
   flexible and configurable compared to its analogous counterpart and
   allows a relatively easy implementation of digital beamforming (DBF) as
   well as multiple input multiple output (MIMO) techniques. The demand of
   highly sensitive SAR sensors enforces antenna concepts with large
   aperture. A promising candidate are large deployable mesh reflector
   antennas fed by an array of feed elements. Each feed element, or a
   subset of feed elements, defines a digital channel to be further
   processed on board the spacecraft or on ground. These innovative class
   of high-information content SAR sensors are the result of a carefully
   optimized design in both, the hardware and the signal processing domain.
   Here, an advanced SAR sensor concept based on array-fed reflector
   antennas shall be presented. Space, time and frequency adaptive
   beamforming techniques which complement the antenna design are
   introduced and demonstrated by means of numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays future designers are required to explore different fields of
   engineering (e.g. basis of design and operation of machines, methodology
   of process design, characteristics of phases of a product life cycle,
   ergonomics, etc.) in order to obtain sufficient knowledge about the
   product, the problems of its operation and related services. Currently,
   there is a strong tendency to take into account the impact of a product
   on the natural environment. The handling of products that are withdrawn
   from usage is one of the big problems emerging in a modern society. One
   of the possibilities to solve these problems is taking into account the
   environmental issues at the very early stage of the product design.
   Authors created the methodology to include recycling requirements in the
   phase of design of the product with support of the CAD 3D
   systems(14,15). In details, the method of ecological-oriented product
   assessment during the design process was implemented in CAD 3D
   environment in order to improve the skills and knowledge of future
   designers about environmental aspects of the designed product(12). In
   order to enhance the effectiveness of the training of designers, authors
   decided to use immersive Virtual Reality (VR) technologies that are more
   and more often used as advanced training systems. The user/trained
   person can explore Virtual Environment (VE) for educational and exercise
   purposes(5). Immersive VR technologies are gaining wider use as
   engineering design tools to support the product design phase because of
   their ability to deliver an immersive and user friendly environment that
   can be used as digital test-bed for prototypes of the product(30). Paper
   briefly describes the analysis of the recycling of selected product
   designed in the CAD 3D system with the support of Virtual Reality
   technologies that were based on the recycling product model (RpM) and
   the agent technology(12,14,15). The RpM, developed during the geometric
   modelling phase, includes the data necessary for a comprehensive product
   recyclability evaluation already at the design stage. This approach
   allows designer to select appropriate solutions that facilitate future
   disassembly and to choose materials most suitable in terms of future
   recycling. The analysis allows to make an assessment of the
   susceptibility of the product for recycling using the agent system. The
   agent system, in accordance with the recycling product model (RpM) that
   was implemented in the 3D CAD system, is an innovative tool for the
   designer to enable a comprehensive assessment of the product in terms of
   its susceptibility to recycling. Future designers (students of
   mechanical engineering fields) gained possibility to improve their
   skills and knowledge in the field of ecodesign through the immersive
   trainings of virtual product design for recycling. Applying the Virtual
   Reality technologies for training of the future designers was aimed at
   enhancing the effectiveness of training mainly due to immersion and
   interaction with the virtual environment and to explore the product
   before it is constructed, as well as provide learning of the
   environments in which the finished product will be operated. As the
   example of the recycling-oriented virtual product design, case study of
   the design of small household appliance is presented. Participants of
   the immersive training (students) have a possibility to design the
   product in the Virtual Reality and select the optimal variant, which
   meets all environmental requirements.
   Short description of the recycling modeling (creation of connections,
   defining the extended materials and disassembly attributes) as well as
   an example of recycling assessment such as calculation of recycling
   assessment measures or providing tips and suggestions generated by agent
   system is also presented. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this work is presented a new hardware implementation of a high speed
   logic analyzer inside FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chips that is
   fully autonomous by directly driving a VGA compatible computer monitor
   for multiple signals display. It can be used as a very low cost and real
   time testing instrument for both external hardware and internal FPGA
   designs. The implementation is optimized at schematic level by proposing
   an innovative solution called BERC (Begin-End-Reset-Cell) as hardware
   digital filter that eliminates any magnitude or equality comparators
   usually inferred from hardware description languages to decode the
   counters signals. This new technique is much more efficient because it
   reduces the combinatorial resources to a minimum, and it can be
   generalized for all kind of video interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{New communication technologies and policies, especially since 1980s, has
   become a major discussion point in social science studies with
   communication axis. When compared to US and Europe communication
   policies to Turkeys-It is high lightened that Turkey's new communication
   technologies are dependent on outside sources and Turkey does not have a
   stable and long-term determined approach towards these technologies.
   In addition to 1980s means changing of paradigm of the development of a
   liberal economy, free market economy, market orientation communication
   policies points out an outstanding axis shift. The source of the changes
   in this period are articulation of a new accumulation scheme of
   capitalism in Turkey and the loss of power of the nation-state and
   nation-state policies in the process. Another important point is that
   Turkey is one of the worst ranked countries when country's population
   compared to the number of internet users. Lack of access equity and
   Turkey's not producing but exporting position and being dependent in
   terms of communication technologies are main points to be considered
   when examining the policy.
   Considered Turkey in new communication technologies and policies axis,
   Marshall and When (transferred succeeded, 2004, p. 15).; They address
   that that country necessarily has information infrastructure and
   accordingly develop the applications to meet the local needs and at last
   have the power of creating and controlling capacity In order to take
   advantage of the advantages of information and communication
   technologies in a country.
   When Turkey is evaluated from this perspective, it falls behind his
   European parties in terms of creating innovation capacity and
   administering the contents of this innovation.
   This study, in order to create a sensitive framework for the political
   economy of communication, aims to examine the information technologies
   in the scope of access equity and content orientation and it also aims
   to come up with possible answers concerning how to manage and organize
   this new media.}},

Abstract = {{Digital business models are often designed for rapid growth, and some
   relatively young companies have indeed achieved global scale. However,
   despite the visibility and importance of this phenomenon, analysis of
   scale and scalability remains underdeveloped in management literature.
   When it is addressed, analysis of this phenomenon is often
   over-influenced by arguments about economies of scale in production and
   distribution. To redress this omission, this paper draws on economic,
   organization, and technology management literature to provide a detailed
   examination of the sources of scaling in digital businesses. We propose
   three mechanisms by which digital business models attempt to gain scale:
   engaging both non-paying users and paying customers; organizing customer
   engagement to allow self-customization; and orchestrating networked
   value chains, such as platforms or multi-sided business models. Scaling
   conditions are discussed, and propositions developed and illustrated
   with examples of big data entrepreneurial firms.}},

Abstract = {{Analog circuits provide the critical interfaces between the digital
   world inside today's integrated circuits and the physical world.
   Semiconductor technology scaling driven by `Moore's Law' has resulted in
   a phenomenal scaling of the performance of digital processors and
   memory. Continuing design innovations have enabled the scaling of analog
   interfaces onto scaled CMOS technologies, even though device scaling is
   a mixed blessing for the analog designer. This paper reviews the scaling
   challenges for analog circuits ranging from fundamental to practical
   challenges. Design strategies are outlined that in principle can
   overcome the challenges and can help guide the search for new circuit
   paradigms. Several examples of innovative analog design paradigms are
   reviewed and the opportunities in highly scaled CMOS technologies are
   outlined.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on plot as a mediator of interactive digital
   storytelling (IDS). Drawing on a theory of narrative applied to IDS, the
   paper focuses on the manifestation of plot across three different IDS
   contexts. After defining plot, plot elements, and plot analysis, I
   explain the sampling of the three IDS types considered with plot
   analysis in this inquiry. The plot analyses of 116 IDS entries by youth
   and young adult participants within and across those IDS types revealed
   patterns of stability and variation of plot elements. The foundational
   nature of plot and its sensitivity to context outside as well as within
   the narrative scene are evident as participants in complex narrative
   systems used plot elements to communicate and to innovate. Future
   research can test and extend plot analysis for further application to
   IDS research and design.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore whether and how the
   intellectual capital (IC) approach and concepts could be fruitfully
   adapted to study the smart city phenomenon from a managerial point of
   view.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a long-term,
   in-depth ethnographic exploration of the vast global community, which is
   created around the smart city movement.
   Findings -The analysis suggests that, in order to effectively analyse a
   smart city context through the IC lens, the traditional IC framework
   needs to be extended for: expected outcomes, which should also include
   sustainability, resilience and quality of life; categories of key
   resources, which should also include institutional capital and
   environmental capital; units of analysis, which should also include
   territorial systems, such as transportation or waste; and key managerial
   challenges implied. As a final result, a smart city intellectual capital
   (SC-IC) framework is proposed.
   Research limitations/implications - Most of the cases analysed in this
   study are European; further studies are advisable to better investigate
   non-European smart city contexts.
   Practical implications - The paper suggests that the knowledge
   management, project portfolio management and network management
   approaches are crucial to better support managerial practices in smart
   city organizations.
   Originality/value - The SC-IC framework allows for a clear definition of
   the smart city organization, as a new knowledge-based, project-oriented,
   network-shaped type of organization. Therefore, the SC-IC framework
   provides smart city research with a consistent rooting in management
   studies. Further, this paper contributes to the fourth stage of IC
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Although digital media, social media and new media were found for a
   while, an overview of integrated multidisciplinary research of new,
   social and digital media with information technology, such as augmented
   reality, virtual reality and interactive applications has not been yet
   presented. This paper discusses the current development of the socially
   digital media work applying augmented reality for advertising, marketing
   and display research. These are a very important issue for developing
   some new social networks, i.e. to connect people through various senses
   of human (i.e., vision, hearing, somatosensation, olfactory and
   gustatory). In other words, a literature review of the recent new media
   and augmented reality works is discussed also. Rather than only
   augmented reality, this paper also provides a brief concept for future
   new media research when utilizing and using some other innovative
   technologies into every human sense. By tackling these complex problems,
   we can find advanced solutions breeding novel trends in socially digital
   media and information technology in an integrated and multidisciplinary
   manner.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, governments recognize the importance of creativity and
   innovation for sustainable socioeconomic development, and many invest
   resources to develop learning environments that foster these capacities.
   This paper provides a systematic framework based on Nair's Innovation
   Helix model for studying the factors of a country's creative learning
   ecosystem (CLE), the quality of its education system (QES), and its
   innovative capacity (IC). The CLE factors are
   infrastructure/infostructure (physical and digital infrastructure),
   intellectual capital, interaction, integrity systems, incentives, and
   institutions. Using a composite CLE index for 113 countries, the
   findings indicate a strong correlation between a country's CLE, QES and
   IC. Through brief case studies of countries that measure highly in CLE,
   QES and IC, this study points out their higher education strategies and
   their best practices for other countries to emulate, in order to
   facilitate creativity and innovation through higher education.}},

Title = {{Usability evaluation of an academic library website Experience with the
   Central Science Library, University of Delhi}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{896-915}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The paper aims to evaluate the usability of the website of
   Central Science Library (CSL), University of Delhi. Multi-method
   approach of evaluation is used with the use of standard checklist and
   questionnaire survey of representative users. Besides, the information
   architecture of the website under study is analysed in this paper.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on the literature review and the
   author's experience, a usability assessment tool for library websites
   was developed by Pant (2013). It comprises standard checklist and
   questionnaire for users' survey. In the present study, this framework
   was used to assess the usability of CSL website. The questionnaire
   survey of 35 representative users was conducted through random sampling.
   The results of both methods (standard checklist and questionnaire
   survey) were analysed for evaluating the website usability.
   Findings - Need for improvement of the website was realised in terms of
   efficiency, effectiveness and learnability for better usability. Notice
   board, site search facility, list of services, FAQs and user guides were
   the most sought after features among others as per the analysis of the
   questionnaire survey. Besides, the need to enhance the visual appeal of
   the website was felt. However, information resources provided through
   the CSL website were found useful for users.
   Originality/value - The paper presents an innovative multi-method
   approach of website usability assessment while considering six usability
   attributes: Usefulness, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Learnability,
   Satisfaction and Accessibility. The approach adopted in this paper is
   cost effective in comparison to formal usability tests and heuristic
   evaluation. Therefore, this framework is suitable for libraries having
   limited budget to ensure the user-centred library website with maximum
   usability. This paper encourages other libraries to conduct similar
   website usability evaluation to identify the usability problem areas and
   users' perception for their respective website.}},

Title = {{The challenge of the visual: making medieval seals accessible in the
   digital age}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{999-1028}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present and evaluate an
   innovative classification system for medieval seals that was created as
   part of the Seals in Medieval Wales (SiMeW) project, funded by the UK's
   Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). The classification system
   developed in response to the cataloguing challenges associated with
   rapidly gathering sigillographic information on about 2,500 medieval
   seals from a number of collections in several UK repositories.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper outlines the challenges
   involved in recording and classifying medieval seals from the British
   Isles, and describes existing systems for organizing sigillographic
   information. The SiMeW system is explained as a response to the
   limitations of existing systems.
   Findings - Designers of systems for recording seals need to take into
   account the physical characteristics of seal impressions, matrices, and
   casts, the strength and limitations of digital media, as well as the
   need of cataloguers and users.
   Originality/value - In recent years scholars have systematically
   investigated the problems associated with text-based image indexing and
   retrieval. Nonetheless, medieval seals have been largely overlooked,
   even though they are common in UK repositories. SiMeW's system offers
   cataloguers an example of an approach that they can use in new and
   existing seal catalogues, to generate metadata that can help make seals,
   which are a key component of the cultural legacy of the Middle Ages,
   more accessible to users.}},

Abstract = {{The present study describes our on-going efforts aiming at refining and
   validating a Mobile Seamless Learning (MSL) approach supported by mobile
   Digital Storytelling (mDS). Considering learning factors of locality,
   formality and time, as well as elements of designs for learning and
   technical development, we have chosen six dimensions of the MSL
   framework (Wong and Looi 2011) to support our work. Guided by the
   principles of co-design (Spikol et al. 2009) and design-based research
   (Design-Based Research Collective, 2003; Ejersbo et al. 2008), we
   collaborated with 4 teachers and 54 pupils, devoting an extensive amount
   of time to design, develop and enact the phases of our proposed mDS
   workflow supported by mobile and web technologies.
   Beyond the mobile application developed for mDS, we have developed and
   integrated web solutions that support the overall learning experience,
   and tools that allow teachers to orchestrate the activities. The mDS web
   serve as a platform for continued work over time, such as reflecting,
   remixing, and reusing the digital content generated during the
   activities. The web platform provides means for teachers to search,
   watch, group, and assess the pupils' mDS outcomes, and therefore serves
   as the interconnecting glue between all the learning activities involved
   in the mDS workflow. This study reports on the activities conducted in
   four classrooms in the spring of 2015, working with the five phases of
   the mDS approach. The outcomes of our efforts reinforced the importance
   of an active involvement by teachers to adopt and incorporate innovative
   technology enhanced learning (TEL) activities and solutions into their
   everyday educational practices, but most importantly on the need for
   schools to acquire self-governance on how to make use of their learning
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present novel modifications to
   a RepRap design that increase RepRap capabilities well beyond just fused
   filament fabrication. Open-source RepRap 3-D printers have made
   distributed manufacturing and prototyping an affordable reality.
   Design/methodology/approach - The design is a significantly modified
   derivative of the Rostock delta-style RepRap 3-D printer. Modifications
   were made that permit easy and rapid repurposing of the platform for
   milling, paste extrusion and several other applications. All of the
   designs are open-source and freely available.
   Findings - In addition to producing fused filament parts, the platform
   successfully produced milled printed circuit boards, milled plastic
   objects, objects made with paste extrudates, such as silicone, food
   stuffs and ceramics, pen plotted works and cut vinyl products. The
   multi-purpose tool saved 90-97 per cent of the capital costs of
   functionally equivalent dedicated tools.
   Research limitations/implications - While the platform was used
   primarily for production of hobby and consumer goods, research
   implications are significant, as the tool is so versatile and the fact
   that the designs are open-source and eminently available for
   modification for more purpose-specific applications.
   Practical implications - The platform vastly broadens capabilities of a
   RepRap machine at an extraordinarily low price, expanding the potential
   for distributed manufacturing and prototyping of items that heretofore
   required large financial investments.
   Originality/value - The unique combination of relatively simple
   modifications to an existing platform has produced a machine having
   capabilities far exceeding that of any single commercial product. The
   platform provides users the ability to work with a wide variety of
   materials and fabrication methods at a price of less than \$1,000,
   provided users are willing to build the machine themselves.}},

Title = {{What are you printing? Ambivalent emancipation by 3D printing}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{572-581}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purposes of this paper are to study how entry-level 3D
   printers are currently being used in several shared machine shops
   (FabLabs, hackerspaces, etc.) and to examine the ambivalent emancipation
   often offered by 3D printing, when users prefer the fascinated passivity
   of replicating rather than the action of repairing. Based on a field
   study and on a large online survey, this paper offers to examine
   different practices with entry-level 3D printers, observed in several
   shared machine shops (FabLabs, hackerspaces, etc.). The recent evolution
   of additive manufacturing and the shift from high-end additive
   technologies to consumer's entry-level 3D printing is taken as an entry
   point. Indeed, digital fabrication has recently received extensive media
   coverage and the maker movement has become a trendy subject for numerous
   influential publications. In the makerspaces that were taken for this
   field survey, 3D printers were very often used for demonstration,
   provoking fascination and encouraging a passive attitude.
   Design/methodology/approach - As part of the work for a PhD research on
   personal digital fabrication as practiced in FabLabs, hackerspaces and
   makerspaces, since 2012, a large-scale field survey at the heart of
   these workshops was carried out. Particular attention has been paid to
   the relationships established between the inhabitants of these places
   and their machines, observing the logic of developing projects and the
   reactions or techniques used to counter unforeseen obstacles - that
   shall be demonstrated to be an essential occurrence for these moments of
   production. From Paris to Amsterdam, Barcelona, Rome, Lyngen (Norway),
   San Francisco, New York, Boston, Tokyo, Kamakura (Japan) to Dakar, a
   means of observing at the heart of more than 30 makerspaces (FabLabs,
   hackerspaces) has been created, with the aim of looking beyond the
   speeches relayed by the media and to constitute an observatory of these
   places. The field observations are confirmed by a quantitative study,
   based on a survey submitted online to 170 users, coming from 30
   different makerspaces in more than ten countries in the world and
   reached through social networks or mailing lists. This survey offers a
   rigorous insight on the uses of 3D printing and leads to the
   consideration of the types of attention applied to 3D printing and the
   part played by the ``default{''} or ``trivial{''} productions used for
   their demonstrations or performances.
   Findings - Based on both the observations and the quantitative survey,
   it can be discussed how the question of so-called
   ``user-friendliness{''} is challenged by practices of repairing, fixing
   and adjusting, more than that of replicating. Indeed, it is claimed that
   this offers a possible meaning for 3D printing practices. In the
   description and analysis of the behaviours with 3D printers, this leads
   to privilege the idea of ``disengaging{''} and the notion of
   ``acting{''} rather than simply passively using.
   Originality/value - 3D printing is just one of the many options in the
   wide range available for personal digital fabrication. As a part of the
   same arsenal as laser cutters or numerical milling machines, 3D printing
   shares with these machines the possibility of creating objects from
   designs or models produced by a computer. These machines execute the
   instructions of operators whose practices -or behaviours - have yet to
   be qualified. These emerging technical situations pose a series of
   questions: who are those who use these 3D printers? What are they
   printing? What are the techniques, the gestures or the rituals imposed
   or offered by these machines?}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report an interdisciplinary,
   cooperative-learning project in a second-year course within the ``Enzo
   Ferrari{''} Master of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering. The work
   aims to raise awareness of the educational impact of additive
   manufacturing and reverse engineering.
   Design/methodology/approach - Students are asked to develop,
   concurrently, the design and the manufacturing solution for an
   eye-tracker head mount. A digital head model is reverse engineered from
   an anatomical mannequin and used as an ergonomic mock-up. The project
   includes prototype testing and cost analysis. The device is produced
   using additive manufacturing techniques for hands-on evaluation by the
   students.
   Findings - Results of the presented case study substantiate the authors'
   belief in the tremendous potential of interdisciplinary project-based
   learning, relying on innovative technologies to encourage collaboration,
   motivation and dynamism.
   Originality/value - The paper confirms a spreading conviction that the
   soon-to-be engineers will need new practice-oriented capabilities to
   cope with new competitive scenarios. Engineering education must adapt to
   the social, rather than industrial, revolution that is being brought
   about by additive fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{Statistics has been recognised as one of the most anxiety-provoking
   subjects to learn in the higher education context. Educators have
   continuously endeavoured to find ways to integrate digital technologies
   and innovative pedagogies in the classroom to eliminate the fear of
   statistics. The purpose of this study is to systematically identify
   students' perspective of using cooperative learning in a flipped
   statistics classroom by utilising Q-methodology, which is a combination
   of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Forty-five students
   who had participated in a 16 week course were interviewed and asked to
   rank 30 statements according to their relative importance. Three
   distinctly different factors that represented groups of participants
   with similar views were extracted. All groups identified cooperative
   learning as an effective instructional strategy in flipped classrooms.
   It is concluded that students' concerns were reflected in these multiple
   perspectives; therefore, individual levels of support should be
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this ongoing, three-year action research study is to
   explore the digital challenges of student engagement in higher education
   within the experimental platform of blended learning. Research questions
   examine the role of digital innovation in supporting diverse learners,
   as well as building meaningful connections with technology for
   undergraduate teacher education students. Results from qualitative data
   collected through instructor journals and field notes and student
   mid-term and exit surveys during year one, indicate blended learning can
   be effective for modelling how to use technology to shift learners
   towards more active agency. The immediacy of the localised university
   classroom delivered a viable research setting for digital
   experimentation, while providing a significant lived experience for
   undergraduates to springboard their future technological practices with
   K-12 students. Four pedagogical opportunities for digital intentionality
   in virtual spaces emerged during data analysis and are shared as
   considerations for future innovation: (1) designing digital resources,
   (2) scaffolding student learning, (3) learner customisation, and (4)
   promoting the lived experience. Lessons learned could be effective in
   helping develop higher quality educational experiences for on-campus
   students, as well as scaffolding greater engagement in online formats
   involving more global populations (e.g., massive online open courses
   MOOCs).}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that disability activism and politics can be seen as
   paradigmatic for the wider debates on the philosophies, forms, and
   formats embedded in technologies. Firstly, the paper discusses
   disability activism movements that use digital technology to intervene
   into digital technology, especially in the social media area. In both
   cases, activists seek to use the platforms themselves to argue for, and
   obtain, greater accessibility, customisability, and configurability, of
   the platform for users with disabilities. Yet there is a clear clash
   between philosophies embedded within these social media platforms, and
   the aspirations and values of many of the activist strands of
   disability. Secondly, the paper explores the use of digital technologies
   by disability activism movements in relation to welfare and work
   reforms-notably the UK struggles in the 2010-2014 periods. Here
   disability activists have made extensive use of digital media
   technologies, and we discuss their innovations, and the lessons they
   offer.}},

Abstract = {{The digitalization and the use of Internet have represented a major
   opportunity for the development and sometimes, for the revitalization of
   the companies and their products. In crisis time, the chances to reduce
   time and costs represent a great possibility, especially for the hotel
   sector that is increasingly competitive, demanding from the
   organizations a rapid reaction.In theory,both from the organizational
   and managerial point of view digital activities play a key role, but
   what role plays the technological equipment of enterprises and the
   orientation of managers that manage it towards innovation in practice?
   In this study the usage of web-based tools by hospitality SMEs for
   different business operations was verified. Firstly, the previous
   literature in this field was reviewed in order to synthesize it.
   Secondly, the empirical analysis was conducted by means of 9 case
   studies based on in-depth interviews with hotels' managers of 5 Italian
   regions for the purpose of identification of e-tools use, especially in
   turbulence times.}},

Abstract = {{The article derives from debates on impoverishment of journalism as
   labour that has been through technological innovations historically torn
   between business goals aimed at realizing profits for media owners and
   journalistic goals of connecting citizens to social life grounded on the
   right to communicate. The authors of the report Many Voices, One World
   based their normative concerns for communication on the right to
   communicate that concerns citizens' abilities to access information,
   voice opinions and participate in public life and thereafter departs
   from understandings of press freedom that rest on property rights. By
   adopting the labour process theory the article reveals the logic of
   deskilling of journalists and analyses implications of
   deprofessionalization of journalism for enforcing the right to
   communicate with a special emphasis on the phenomena of precarization,
   prosumption and robotization in journalism.}},

   of detailed spatial data.
   In this article methodological and conceptual issues on which this atlas
   is based on are discussed and outlined by practical examples of the
   genderATlas. Our participatory approach, which means the inclusion of
   potential users at all stages of the research process will be explained
   as well as the decision to implement a flexible and modular article
   concept for the atlas. An article in the genderATlas system is
   understood as a coherent unit, which is constituted of maps, diagrams,
   infographics and explaining texts on a specific topic. In a further
   step, chosen indicators and cartographic approaches are discussed and
   constraints and possibilities of online atlases to approach gender
   issues debated.}},

Abstract = {{The virtual reconstruction of subterranean structures is a suitable
   scenario for the integration of different geomatics techniques although
   narrow passages, lack of light and irregular surface can arise various
   problems in the data acquisition as well as processing procedures.
   Generally the final product is a dense and detailed 3D model, whose
   number of triangles increases quickly according to the complexity of the
   object. This complexity reduces the efficient use and dissemination of
   the produced information therefore innovative solutions are sought. The
   article presents the 3D surveying and modelling of underground passages
   of World War I (WWI) fortifications. After the acquisition of dense
   point clouds by means of terrestrial scanning (TLS), a simplification
   and optimization workflow is performed with the aim of generating a
   lightweight product that keeps the maximum amount of significant
   information. A continuous scene representation with a 87\% triangle
   reduction is generated, while the final precision is preserved according
   to a tolerance predefined by the final user. Such 3D product can be
   employed as basis for reconstruction, consolidation, preservation and
   valorisation of the WWI tunnels.}},

Abstract = {{Never as within the complex of Sassi (Matera, South of Italy), the
   parties have a volumetric material identity and a special construction
   condition for which, first of all, you need to know the whole to which
   they give life, and then the individual components and their
   connections.
   In the course of time, in the Lucan city, there were stable and
   favorable conditions that allowed the development of an architectural
   language, of juxtaposition of the materials, interpenetration of space
   and conformation of the volumes, which generated an exceptional urban
   phenomenon. The distribution of these building artifacts in symbiotic
   connection with the connective calcareous texture that hosts them,
   resulted in a spontaneously harmonious figurative balance that
   characterizes the constructive expedients employed and the distributive
   and morphological solutions. This is the reason why the Sassi, and the
   overlooking Park of Rupestrian Churches of Matera Murgia, have been
   entered in 1993 in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
   The complexity of a built space, such as this one, determines the need
   for a non-traditional approach, so you have to combine last generation
   tools and canonical ones for survey, drawing and representation, within
   a dialectic between memory and design, tradition and innovation. For
   this reason, an appropriate cognitive apparatus has been set up for the
   entire technical process, making use of different non-destructive and
   non-contact techniques: digital photogrammetry, total station, laser
   scanner and thermography, in order to obtain a three-dimensional
   computer model, useful for the diagnosis and the preservation of the
   integrity of cultural heritage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports research into developing digital storytelling (DST)
   to enhance reflection within a specific professional learning context -
   that of a programme of teacher education while concomitantly producing a
   transferrable design framework for adaption into other, similar
   post-secondary educational contexts. There has been limited substantive,
   evaluative design-based research investigating empirically the potential
   of digital storytelling for reflection in professional, post-secondary
   education. Consequently, there has also been a lack of robust and
   reusable models to guide and inform design-based research in this
   context. This paper illustrates the development of a repeated study,
   undertaken on a longitudinal basis, over 3 years, and on a large scale,
   involving 323 pre-service teachers. The design-based research developed
   at the three key stages along the triadic spectrum of maturity: from (1)
   analysis and exploration, through (2) design and construction, to (3)
   evaluation and reflection (Kopcha, Schmidt, \& McKenney, 2015). The
   innovation reported here is now a mature intervention, constituting a
   core part of the professional educational formation of pre-service
   teachers within a two-year, graduate teacher education programme.
   Further, the R-NEST design framework, which emerged from this
   longitudinal design-based research, enumerates key criteria and
   principles for designing, implementing and evaluating DST to enhance
   reflective practice in post-secondary professional education.}},

Abstract = {{This article concerns functioning of small and medium enterprises and in
   particular: craft ones. In the sector structured European Union, the
   abovementioned stand for 80-95\% of the existing companies and moreover,
   they generate the biggest number of job positions and the national
   income. The article focuses on a selected part of SME sector: craft
   enterprises and especially, on financing their activities. This
   financing relates to both, financing craft businesses' investments and
   their current operations. In the first part of the text one presents a
   literary query concerning the definition of a craft enterprise and the
   resulting from its characteristic functioning: conception and tools for
   financing investments and current operations of craft enterprises. In
   the second part, one demonstrates the results of researches on the
   conception and the tools for financing craft enterprises functioning on
   the Polish market. In the summary of the article one demonstrates
   conclusions concerning the ways of maintenance and (in many cases
   innovative) changes of the conception and the tools for financing craft
   enterprises. The element congruous with the basic topic of the article
   relating to the current functioning of a craft enterprise in the real
   environment (both: inner and outer one), is its functioning in the
   digital surrounding (including with regard to the conception of
   financing activities), which correlates with the dynamic development of
   ICT technologies. The aforementioned development together with
   digitalization determines many aspects of craft enterprises'
   functioning; also the ones connected with financing tools and
   conceptions. Referring to the things stated, it is clear that ICT
   technologies should be taken into account in enterprise's current
   activities and in other aspects of its functioning e.g. communication,
   as well as eservices it provides and receives.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Mobile Service of Big Data can be supported by the fused
   technologies of computing, communication and digital multimedia. The
   purpose of this paper is to propose new agent-based proactive migration
   method and system for Big Data Environment (BDE).
   Design/methodology/approach - First, the authors have designed new
   relative fusion method for making decision based on fuzzy-neural
   network. The method can make the fusion belief degree to be improved.
   Then the authors have proposed agent-based proactive migrating method
   with service discovery and key frames selection strategy. Finally, the
   authors have designed the application system, which can support
   proactive seamless migration function for big data. The method has
   innovation in which mobile service task of big data can dynamically
   follow its mobile user from one device to another device.
   Findings - The authors have proposed agent-based proactive migrating
   method with service discovery and key frames selection strategy. The
   method has innovation in which mobile service task of big data can
   dynamically follow its mobile user from one device to another device.
   The designed system is convenient to work and use during mobility, and
   which is useful or helpful for mobile user in the BDE.
   Originality/value - The authors have clarified and realizes how to
   transfer service tasks among different distances in Big Data Environment
   (BDE). The authors have given a formal description and classification of
   the mobile service task, which is independent of the realization
   mechanism. In the designed and developed application system, the new
   idea adopts fuzzy-neural control theory to make decision for
   task-oriented proactive seamless migration application.}},

Abstract = {{The last years we faced a tremendous development of social media powered
   by innovative technologies related to web services, web 2.0 and social
   networks. Nowadays we are entering in to the next digitally enriched
   generation of social media and enabled by thrilling, currently under
   extensive development technologies, like Big Data, Cloud Computing,
   Virtual/Augmented Reality and Internet of Things. To our understanding
   the new generation of social media and the integrated business models
   that will support them are within a converging area where social
   features and ubiquitous technologies are met. Social elements, related
   to behavior, self-esteem, attachment and other psychological dimensions
   of personality will be transparently integrated to a number of
   technologies. Thus for the next years we have to wait for a number of
   new applications and systems, all targeted in a meta-existence level
   where the characteristics of human identity will be mixed with various
   digital identity elements. This basic trend and direction in the Social
   Media research in the next decade will boost the transparency of
   technologies and will stimulate an extremely different Web than the one
   we are exploiting together. The key dimension of the Social Media sphere
   will be the dependent social identification of humans by a number of
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{In the epoch of information, virtually people and organizations have
   identified the significance of communication. The expansion of
   Information and Communication Technology and particularly the use of web
   technology have allowed the establishment of networks which enable vast
   amount of information to be transferred around the globe. Our era can be
   straightforwardly described as digital. Numerous technological
   innovations are increasingly pushing organizations to change their
   business processes in order to adapt into new competitive environment.
   The most popular technology which appears to have significant impacts on
   people is the Internet. The web technology allows the establishment of
   networks which enable vast amount of information to be transferred
   around the globe (Drosos \& Tsotsolas, 2014). The aim of this paper is
   to study the use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) in Greece. For the
   collection of the data, web site questionnaires were used in order to
   better record the Social Networking views on the service. The survey was
   conducted within the period September - November 2014. Final input data
   consist of 410 questionnaires. Generalized linear models (especially
   multinomial logistic models) are used in order to study the
   differentiation of social media due to social economic and demographic
   factors. Moreover with the usage of non-parametric tests the correlation
   between the use of social media and age is examined. Finally, the
   influence of the security to the use of social media is studied.}},

Abstract = {{Following clear technological trends, the cooled IR detectors market is
   now in demand for smaller, more efficient and higher performance
   products. This demand pushes products developments towards constant
   innovations on detectors, read-out circuits, proximity electronics
   boards, and coolers.
   Sofradir was first to show a 10 mu m focal plane array (FPA) at DSS
   2012, and announced the DAPHNIS 10 mu m product line back in 2014. This
   pixel pitch is a key enabler for infrared detectors with increased
   resolution. Sofradir recently achieved outstanding products
   demonstrations at this pixel pitch, which clearly demonstrate the
   benefits of adopting 10 mu m pixel pitch focal plane array-based
   detectors.
   Both HD and XGA Daphnis 10 mu m products also benefit from a global
   video datapath efficiency improvement by transitioning to digital video
   interfaces. Moreover, innovative smart pixels functionalities
   drastically increase product versatility.
   In addition to this strong push towards a higher pixels density,
   Sofradir acknowledges the need for smaller and lower power cooled
   infrared detector. Together with straightforward system interfaces and
   better overall performances, latest technological advances on SWAP-C
   (Size, Weight, Power and Cost) Sofradir products enable the advent of a
   new generation of high performance portable and agile systems (handheld
   thermal imagers, unmanned aerial vehicles, light gimbals etc...).
   This paper focuses on those features and performances that can make an
   actual difference in the field.}},

Abstract = {{The effective digital mobile learning uses efficient teaching and
   learning methods and it makes full use of its ``mobile{''} nature. The
   student is mobile rather than the device. This key principle should
   influence all the other principles of the digital mobile learning.
   The effective mobile learning exploits the advantage of being on the
   scene, it provides immediate access and connection and it acknowledges
   the learning process which takes place outside of (and together with)
   the formal learning frameworks, in places such as the workplace, at home
   and in open air.
   The introduction of a wide variety of technologies had an impact on the
   training methods. Together with the rapid development of PCs in the 20th
   century and with the explosion of the mobile phone use in the past 10
   years, we started to see a change in the classroom training pattern from
   the learning with a Trainer in front of the room to a varied blend of
   approaches regarding the learning from various frameworks.
   During the first stages of the mobile learning development, the focus
   was on the mobile devices themselves, but they are now being replaced by
   a new orientation towards understanding the students who are connected
   to the relevant information while being mobile.
   This work is an attempt to show the degree of preparation and use of the
   M-learning within the teaching activity. The investigated sample
   includes a representative number of 350 Training Staff from the higher
   education environment in 15 university centres.}},

Abstract = {{Although the new technologies presented considerable advantages for the
   effectiveness of organizations, they also initiated important
   challenges. One of the characteristic challenges in the globalized world
   is the demand, for organizations, to stimulate innovation, in order to
   adapt to the continuous changes of the market. Thus, as agents which
   catalyzed the interconnected world, social media are strong influence
   factors in generating innovation. The organizations from the PR field
   are especially constraint to innovate, because the communication tools
   evolve in a rapid manner.
   The objectives of the paper are to discover in what directions and to
   what extent social media development influences and stimulates the
   innovation in the organizations from the communication and PR field. The
   method is qualitative, by using the structured interview on a sample of
   communication and PR professionals. The communication experts were
   invited to discuss about cases and situations of innovation in their
   agencies/media organizations/communication departments, and to describe
   the role played by social media in the developmental process of
   innovation. The results showed that, besides the four roles discovered
   as being played by social media in generating organizational innovation,
   the social media development determined a paradigm innovation in most
   companies and organizations from the PR field. Finally, in communication
   attributions, it developed a differentiation of services between regular
   social media responsible from companies, PR agencies and digital
   agencies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative use of photogrammetric detection
   techniques to experimentally estimate structural/inertial properties of
   helicopter rotor blades. The identification algorithms for the
   evaluation of mass and flexural stiffness distributions are an extension
   of the ones proposed by Larsen, whereas the procedure for torsional
   properties determination (stiffness and shear center position) is based
   on the Euler-Prandtl beam theory. These algorithms rely on measurements
   performed through photogrammetric detection, which requires the
   collection of digital photos allowing the identification of 3D
   coordinates of labeled points (markers) on the structure through the
   correlation of 2D pictures. The displacements are evaluated by comparing
   the positions of markers in loaded and reference configuration. Being
   the applied loads known, the structural characteristics can be directly
   obtained from the measured displacements. The accuracy of the proposed
   identification algorithms has been firstly verified by comparison with
   numerical and experimental data, and then applied to the structural
   characterization of two main rotor blades, designed for ultra-light
   helicopter applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to present the links between the quality of life and
   smart cities. In this digital era, it is necessary to stay informed, to
   be competitive, innovative and creative. Some countries understood the
   importance of these factors and use them as key elements for
   sustainability. This is the reason why cities developed themselves into
   smart, creative or intelligent cities.
   In this respect, paper starts with a presentation of the background for
   this topic, based on the literature review. Then it focuses on the
   Sustainable Development Indicators at Territorial level for Romania and
   Smart Cities Ranking in order to make correlations between cities and
   study the particularities and similarities. Based on this relation
   between innovation, quality and efficiency we could develop strategies,
   in order to improve the sustainability of the cities. In the last part
   of the paper it will be presented the results of the research, and the
   strategy to increase the cities ranking based on the quality of life
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Web applications are well established tool for sharing information in
   all areas of human activity such as the field of interest of this paper
   which is Czech archiving. It is difficult to deal with the Czech
   legislation's demands for storing electronic data as evidenced by the
   recent demise of the project of the Central National Digital Archive
   supported by the European funds which is a howler of international
   importance and proof of how little is the Czech Archiving ready for the
   onset of digital data. Already existing decentralized networks of local
   public digital archives are mostly small innovative solutions on not
   only regional but also national level towards on-line access to at least
   digital copies of the original analogue archival documents. These
   solutions often arise in very humble circumstances without much of the
   state support and bring products in a variety of different levels of web
   applications. When developing these applications it is primarily
   necessary to comply with legislative requirements, whereof one area
   under the legislation are safety procedures. This article addresses web
   application security while dealing with SQL injection methods, automated
   tools SQLmap and GoogleHacking.}},

Pages = {{101-129}},
Abstract = {{There is no doubt today about the possibilities and potential of digital
   impression-taking with the aid of intraoral optical impression systems,
   and the past few years have seen a considerable increase in the range of
   optical intraoral scanners available on the market. On the strength of
   numerous innovations and a wider range of indications in orthodontics
   and implantology, intraoral scanning systems appear to be a highly
   promising development for the future. Digital impression-taking with
   intraoral scanners has already shown itself in some respects to be
   clearly superior to conventional impression-taking. Particularly worthy
   of mention is the versatile integration of digital impressions into
   diagnostic and treatment concepts to provide a customizable healthcare
   solution for the patient. It remains exciting to look forward to future
   developments that will allow us to observe digital impression-taking as
   with other digital applications already established in everyday life
   becoming firmly established in the routine of dentistry and dental
   technology. This article presents an overview of the benefits and
   limitations of digital impression-taking using intraoral scanning
   systems, and includes a summary of all the relevant intraoral scanners
   available on the market at present.}},

   Remote Sensing Technology}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2510}},
Pages = {{7-14}},
Abstract = {{Transportation corridors are classified as critical infrastructure in
   the United States and Canada. Successfully maintaining these corridors
   in safe, operational condition requires strategies that address
   individual hazard classes and manage associated risks. Natural and
   constructed slopes along transportation corridors represent one such
   category of hazard; typical risk management strategies involve
   quantitative measurements and qualitative evaluations of their present
   condition and the hazards that they pose to infrastructure, people, and
   shipments along the route. At some sites, traditional field-based
   observations are supplemented by high-resolution remotely acquired
   three-dimensional (3-D) imaging data of the ground surface, generated
   from various sensors and platforms, including terrestrial lidar and
   photogrammetry, airborne lidar, and oblique aerial photogrammetry. The
   collection, processing, and implementation of 3-D data collection and
   analysis into a slope management system are complex and frequently
   result in poorly collected, poorly understood, and underused data.
   Furthermore, the intricacies of the applications and limitations of
   different technologies generally are well understood only by
   specialists. As a result, the industry is reluctant to implement these
   technologies in active slope management systems. Practical procedures
   for remote data collection are illustrated, and the applications and
   limitations of the previously mentioned technologies are explained. The
   current capabilities of these technologies are presented; because the
   field is advancing rapidly, innovation and development soon will enhance
   the applicability of these technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Digital disruption refers to the implementation of digital
   technology-enabled changes to better meet customer needs and is drawing
   increasing scholarly attention. However, the way in which digital
   disruption is achieved is still relatively understudied. This study
   examines the affordance of gamification in enabling digital disruption.
   We present an exploratory case study and qualitative analysis of our
   observations on a mobile application platform and app, goCatch. goCatch
   is widely recognized as a digital disruptor in the taxi industry. From
   our empirical investigation, we find that goCatch uses gamification
   through situational and artifactual affordances to enable digital
   disruption. This study clarifies the relationship between the situated
   motivational affordances of gamification between the key players in a
   digital ecosystem and value creation in a mobile commerce business. The

Abstract = {{This paper develops a holistic framework to examine the changing
   business models in creative industries in the digital economy, using
   evidence gathered from two strands of empirical work. The research found
   that digital technologies have facilitated pervasive changes in business
   models in all sectors of the creative industries, but with only a few
   exceptions, the resultant new business models are often neither novel
   nor unprecedented. In many cases, digital technologies simply allow
   organisations to deploy a wider range of business models than previously
   available to them, often by adapting and applying traditional business
   models to different ranges or stages of products in the online
   environment; or simultaneously adopting multiple business models as a
   portfolio. The paper identifies a series of emerging trends; and
   highlights three areas for future research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates how senior managers interpret and react to the
   strategic threats and opportunities presented by digital technologies.
   Strategy studies focus on one type of actor or organizational context.
   Instead, we considered various firms, roles and expertise. We conducted
   20 hours of in-depth, elite interviews with 15 senior managers from
   client firms, digital marketing agencies and strategy consultants and
   identified several opportunities related to the data and how they are
   manipulated, the business uses of digital technologies and broad
   behavioral changes. However, data quality and quantity limit the value
   of data granularity and currency. Additionally, we found that the three
   types of interviewees produce strategy assessments that differ in terms
   of content, salience and valence. This finding advances the conceptual
   understanding of the impact of different roles and cognitive frameworks
   on strategy development and, thus, the need to incorporate the views of
   third parties in environmental scanning exercises.}},

Abstract = {{Much of earlier emphasis on open data as a public good has been focused
   primarily upon accessibility and has ruled out the role of rivalry in
   the creation of horizontal and vertical complements. Rather than framing
   open data as a public good, this paper positions open data as a common
   pool resource, which is subject to subtraction by commercial interests.
   Contrary to the prior depiction that the subtractability of common pool
   resources is deleterious, we argue that subtraction is essential to
   attracting private investment. Specifically, making open data more
   subtractable, will not only attract further private and public use but
   also induce eventual releases of private and commercial data to form a
   marketplace of data complements. We further argue that most of the
   current open data initiatives should direct their attention towards the
   creation of a platform market to harness the distributed resources for
   creating digitalised innovation and services.}},

Abstract = {{technology domains towards the service of a business. Any kind of venue
   - physical or virtual enabling a one-sided, two-sided or multi-sided
   market can be thought of as a platform. Digital platforms compete
   against each other and some become successful while others fade away.
   Platform cannot be managed in a goal-oriented fashion because the number
   of actors and relationships between them increases beyond the ability of
   what the platform owner can handle. However, a platform can be
   orchestrated by designing and facilitating processes taking place among
   participants. In this conceptual paper, we review the literature on
   platforms and participant roles. We present four platform categories and
   three platform orchestration modes. In conclusion, we suggest that
   winning platform requires simultaneous orchestration of efficiency,
   development and innovation in order to attract and lock-in participants,
   facilitate transactions, and create novel offerings.}},

Abstract = {{Internet traffic from mobile devices surpassed traffic from traditional
   desktop PCs for the first time in 2014. Although users today access and
   experience digital services through multiple mobile and traditional
   devices simultaneously, little empirical research investigated the
   mechanisms driving this shift, or its implications for service
   innovation research and practice. Here, we report on a qualitative
   phenomenological study of multi-device use. Drawing on the emerging
   literature at the interface of service-dominant (SD) logic and service
   innovation, we conceptualize the individual devices used to access
   digital services as engagement platforms. We explore user behavior and
   experiences of digital entertainment services, and find that the
   perceived need to enhance or avoid elements of digital service
   experiences motivates users to switch between and/or supplement multiple
   engagement platforms with one another. We conceptualize our findings in
   two distinct theoretical models and delineate future research
   opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{When scholars and practitioners consider the implications of offshoring
   work, their primary concern is often the impact offshoring has on
   communication between people at different sites. When time zones and
   geographic boundaries separate employees, communication is limited,
   making it difficult for remote colleagues to form trusting and familiar
   relationships with one another. However, offshoring not only obstructs
   person-to-person interactions, it also impedes person-to-object
   interactions. This is potentially problematic as many organizations
   today still produce physical products, such as printed marketing
   collaterals, computers, home decor, or automobiles. Though organizations
   that create physical outputs may engage in digital work processes,
   people at these organizations may still rely on interactions with the
   physical objects that they produce in order to complete tasks. In this
   paper we investigate impeded person-to-object interactions at two
   offshore work sites representing two different occupations: automotive
   engineering and graphic design.}},

Abstract = {{Although extant research convincingly argues that managers can change
   product innovation practices by exploiting new forms of generativity
   afforded by digital technology, the literature has so far been silent on
   how incumbent firms may conceive of and implement requisite generative
   capability. Against this backdrop, we report from an action research
   study into a digital innovation initiative aimed at developing connected
   cars. The managers in charge of the initiative engaged us as they faced
   considerable skepticism and push-back from the organization. To help the
   firm embrace new innovation norms and practices, we therefore infused
   innovation theory and options thinking into the group of managers as a
   means to conceive of and implement generative capability. As a result,
   we present and validate an integrative theoretical model of how
   incumbent firms may leverage digital options thinking to shape their
   organizational and technological resources into requisite generative
   capability. In conclusion, we discuss the contributions of the model and
   the empirical results to extant literature on generative capability in
   digital innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Innovating with digital technologies is important for organizations in
   order to stay competitive in the market. Today, diverse actors drawing
   on multiple institutions drive such innovations, ranging from engineers,
   designers and customer facing units, far extending the scope of the IT
   function which used to lead digital efforts. Still, there is little
   research on how non-IT functions innovate with digital technologies.
   Using the lens of institutional logics and affordances, we examine case
   studies to address this research gap. We find that actors outside of the
   IT function innovate with digital technologies in various ways because
   depending on the combination of institutional logics they draw from -
   they recognize affordances of digital technologies differently.}},

Abstract = {{This case study examines three different digital innovation projects
   within AutoInc - a large European automaker. By using the competing
   values framework as a theoretical lens we explore how dynamic
   capabilities occur in a firm trying to meet increasing demands in
   originating and innovating from digitalization. In this digitalization
   process, our study indicates that established socio-technical
   congruences are being challenged. More so, we pinpoint the need for
   organizations to find ways to embrace new experimental learning
   processes in the era of digitalization. While such a change requires
   long-term commitment and vision, this study presents three informal
   enablers for such experimental processes these enablers are timing,
   persistence, and contacts.}},

Abstract = {{Communality and connectivity are types of public goods offered in online
   spaces. As theoretical concepts, they provide design insight for the
   creation and understanding of interorganizational collaboration tools in
   multisided networks and value chains. In this paper, we present an
   extension of communality and connectivity that enables an examination of
   how organizations create value with networked
   organization-to-organization (O2O) systems. We use the framework as a
   lens for a case study involving the historical development of an online
   technology and its organization (MarketMaker) over 16 years that
   reframed the backbone of the agricultural market in the U.S. from a
   supply chain to a network. MarketMaker successfully interwove consumers,
   farmers, universities, government agencies, and states based on its
   innovation to connect stakeholders in novel ways around information and
   communication. As a central system in reconfiguring the value chain,
   MarketMaker provided services to the food industry not previously
   enabled. A number of important lessons learned about effective use of
   communality and connectivity are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the development and application of an innovative
   tool, Text Re-use Alignment Visualization (TRAViz), whose aim is to
   visualize variation between editions of both historical and modern
   texts. Reading different editions of a text empowers research in
   literary studies and linguistics, where one can study a text's reception
   or follow the development of its language over time. One of the purposes
   of a text edition is to trace or reconstruct a possible archetype or
   something that might be considered to be an original version of the text
   in order to better understand its evolution over time. To do so, the
   textual scholar examines and records the similarities and the
   differences between a number of exemplars in what is known as a
   `critical apparatus'. The result of this variant analysis can be
   visually represented as a `Variant Graph', where the relationships
   between these exemplars can be more easily studied. Variant Graphs can
   be, in turn, visualized in order to facilitate reading and interaction
   with the source data. Borrowing from existing digital tools, TRAViz
   assists the scholar in the collation process by specifically focusing on
   design and user engagement, concurrently seeking to simplify interaction
   as a means of encouraging humanists to adopt the tool. The article will
   describe the needs and rationale behind the creation of TRAViz by
   exploring existing research, describing its functionality through
   examples, and by finally discussing how its application can influence
   future development of this tool in particular and of the field in
   general.}},

Journal = {{GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT}},

Abstract = {{We introduce r.randomwalk, a flexible and multifunctional open-source
   tool for backward and forward analyses of mass movement propagation.
   r.randomwalk builds on GRASS GIS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support
   System - Geographic Information System), the R software for statistical
   computing and the programming languages Python and C. Using constrained
   random walks, mass points are routed from defined release pixels of one
   to many mass movements through a digital elevation model until a defined
   break criterion is reached. Compared to existing tools, the major
   innovative features of r.randomwalk are (i) multiple break criteria can
   be combined to compute an impact indicator score; (ii) the uncertainties
   of break criteria can be included by performing multiple parallel
   computations with randomized parameter sets, resulting in an impact
   indicator index in the range 0-1; (iii) built-in functions for
   validation and visualization of the results are provided; (iv) observed
   landslides can be back analysed to derive the density distribution of
   the observed angles of reach. This distribution can be employed to
   compute impact probabilities for each pixel. Further, impact indicator
   scores and probabilities can be combined with release indicator scores
   or probabilities, and with exposure indicator scores. We demonstrate the
   key functionalities of r.randomwalk for (i) a single event, the Acheron
   rock avalanche in New Zealand; (ii) landslides in a 61.5 km(2) study
   area in the Kao Ping Watershed, Taiwan; and (iii) lake outburst floods
   in a 2106 km(2) area in the Gunt Valley, Tajikistan.}},

Abstract = {{The change in the profile of new consumers has demanded innovations from
   organizations in their operations. In this context, a new type of
   business has changed the Brazilian scenario, the E-commerce. This
   segment is in full growth and presenting elevated projections of billing
   (EBIT, 2013). However, a paradox has puzzled professionals and
   researchers of this field. If the segment is promising, why do companies
   of this sector have negative results? Therefore the aim of the study was
   to verify what reveals the analysis of accounting statements on economic
   and financial performance of B2W Digital (on-line retail) compared to
   other companies of the sector (traditional retail). In the theoretical
   framework were discussed concepts of the main economic and financial
   indicators and a brief history about the e-commerce in the Brazil.
   Subsequently documentary analysis was performed on the financial
   statements of these companies for the period 2007-2012. The results show
   that the main causes for B2W Digital's low performance in the analyzed
   period were: imbalance in the management of medium terms, in other
   words, the organization pays its suppliers on terms much smaller than
   those the organization receives from its customers, hence the need to
   finance its operation with costly resources of short-term, specially
   loans and prepayment of receivables, which leads to expenses with taxes
   and interest; high levels of debt, low gross margin due to cost of sold
   goods which consumes more than 70\% of its net revenue and lastly the
   increase of operational expenses, mainly in distribution.}},

Abstract = {{This research-based design project harnesses the intrinsic capacity of
   interactive multimedia design and digital technology to construct an
   awareness of cultural environments, using both visual and aural forms as
   a way to understand, act out, look upon, search for, and interrogate
   representations of contemporary culture. We established an implemental
   system in this study, using Wikipedia's Wiki platform, Radio Aporee, and
   Panoramio, with which users can participate in life archiving and
   getting knowledge through a data-sharing-and-collecting platform. Users
   contribute and interact with the data, enabling conceptualisation of the
   production of knowledge as a relative process involving interdependent
   correlations of human knowledge. The scope is opened up for live
   archiving, integration with wide data sources, and the breaking down of
   the barriers of knowledge, and a new sense of materiality, meaning,
   audienceship, and authorship is provoked. We demonstrate our system with
   a case study presentation of Tai-Pin Old Street in Taiwan.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the growing importance that the so-called
   ``commons{''} are gaining in the sphere of cultural creation. To do so,
   it critically analyses two important analogies that have appeared during
   the recent years: the first one, between the ``natural{''} and ``digital
   commons{''}, and the second, between the ``old{''} and the ``new digital
   enclosures{''}. The paper demonstrates that their similitudes are
   prominent, although both comparisons have to be carefully studied. The
   main goal is to present the ``digital commons{''} as those devices
   capable to shape a sort of ``Popular political economy of
   pro-common{''}. Throughout a double approach (the technical-legal and
   the political-economical one), the paper highlights the need to have an
   institutional environment robust enough to prevent the effects of new
   enclosures in contemporary creation and the dissemination of culture.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of a third wave of digitization designers are facing new
   challenges to create products and services. We believe that the
   far-reaching user involvement and the flexible functionalities of
   third-wave digital innovation is radically changing the work field of
   designers.
   The paper focuses on two main effects of third-wave digital innovation;
   convergence and generativity. We analyzed the consequence of these two
   effects on three process-oriented roles of the designer that make up an
   important part of Design Thinking: (1) the designer as integrator; (2)
   the designer as boundary creator; and (3) the designer as the user's
   advocate.
   Based on this analysis, we propose three new roles that better fit the
   third wave of digital innovation: (1) designers as function
   orchestrators; (2) designers as gatekeepers of initiatives; and (3)
   designers as advocates of human desire. To fulfill these new roles and
   to equip designers for the new wave of digital innovation, we belief
   that there is a need for reconceptualizing Design Thinking.}},

Abstract = {{This pilot study examines CAD software learning differences between a
   group of non-technical innovators (clinical nurses) and traditional CAD
   users (design engineers). This research was motivated by the rapid
   growth of digital fabrication methods and the proliferation of low cost,
   semi-professional CAD software, both of which have reduced prototyping
   barriers for innovators outside of professional design. The study's
   methodology consisted of (i) a pre-test survey to assess each subject's
   degree of computer usage and confidence in 3D modeling, (ii) the
   completion of a CAD tutorial on a laptop, and (iii) an interview to
   record each participant's impressions of the design experience. Based on
   a mixed-methods analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, the study
   showed that the nursing cohort had both the strong motivation and
   technical ability to learn CAD software. However, their profession
   enforces a low tolerance for ambiguity or time inefficiency, making the
   traditional engineering methods of ``explore and learn{''}
   inappropriate. The output of this study will be used to assemble an
   extensive experimental curriculum for nurse innovators interested in
   medical device design.}},

Abstract = {{The manufacturing industry needs to meet the challenges of a rapidly
   changing society by using innovation while considering other factors
   such as trends. This paper focuses on three overarching trends:
   globalization, urbanization, and digitalization. These three major
   trends together with policies and regulations could be regarded as
   fierce threats to a manufacturing firm operating in a traditional mature
   industry. However, this mix could also be viewed as an opportunity for
   the innovative company to address future market needs and gain
   competitive advantage. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the
   production innovation in SMEs by considering the developments in the
   manufacturing processes as well as the innovation and design process
   activities of the manufacturing company. Through two case studies in
   Sweden, this paper seeks to answer how do SMEs operating within the
   manufacturing sector respond to the sustainability and other emerging
   trends while innovating in their production processes. This paper helps
   to understand how these firms are using some of the approaches and
   strategies to keep the current pace of innovation and sustainability
   trends.}},

Abstract = {{With greater online access and greater use of computers and tablets,
   educational materials are increasingly available digitally, and are soon
   predicted to become the standard for science classrooms. However,
   researchers have found that institutionalized structures and cultural
   factors in schools affect teacher uptake and integration of technology.
   Findings are sparse that detail the complexities of how teachers
   actually incorporate technology in their teaching as they negotiate the
   introduction of a new and potentially disruptive innovation. With
   respect to a digital curriculum in particular, teachers can be unclear
   about their role vis-avis the curriculum, as the ``computer{''}
   potentially becomes an alternative source of authority in the classroom,
   and this can mean that the teacher is no longer in control. This paper
   reports on the implementation of two units of an innovative
   environmental science program, Biocomplexity and the Habitable Planet,
   as a digital curriculum. We discuss some of the lessons learned about
   the mix of challenges, anticipated and unanticipated, that confronted
   four high school teachers as they implemented the curriculum in their
   classrooms. We suggest that developers and users of digital curricula
   pay particular attention to how they envision where the authority for
   teaching and learning in the classroom should reside.}},

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of digital media, design education has been
   challenged by the ongoing advancement of technology. Technological
   change has created unprecedented possibilities for designers to engage
   in the broadening realm of interactive digital media. The increasing
   sophistication of interactivity has brought a complexity which needs to
   be managed; most notably, information technology. The mobile device
   revolution has changed people's lives and created distinct challenges
   for design educators to master. Social media provide new possibilities
   as/for teaching technologies to engage students. On the downside,
   designers compete with amateurs through crowd-sourcing platforms.
   Responses to manage the rapid technological advance in design education
   have emerged as pockets of innovation from some institutions. This paper
   takes a closer look at how technology has affected and continues to
   affect design education in the context of design educators and
   practitioners arguing that design education is stuck in the past. Does
   every technological ``revolution{''} require a radical change in design
   education? To answer this question the broadening and squeezing of
   design education is examined in the context of the increasing complexity
   of technology. Potential and ``must have{''} responses to technological
   challenges are illustrated through examples from an undergraduate
   digital media design major.}},

Abstract = {{Rail straightness measurement is critical in rail production, in which
   the detecting speed, accuracy and stability directly affect the overall
   rail production. In this paper, using modern technology such as laser
   sensors, data acquisition, and computing technology, an innovative rail
   straightness measurement method was designed and implemented based on
   parallel computing. In the design, 14 laser displacement sensors and 2
   rotary encoders were used to measure respectively 7 level displacements,
   7 vertical displacements, and rail transmission displacement in
   real-time. After those signals conversed to digital and transferred to
   server computer, CPUs and GPUs will: 1) synchronous matching, 2) inner
   block analyzing, 3) block analyzing, 4) frame analyzing, 5) straightness
   analyzing. The disturbing factors, such as iron oxides, side sliding,
   low frequency vibrations, and high frequency vibrations were and
   eliminated. Finally, get the rail straightness information and output,
   save, transfer, or used to guide production. Experiments and practical
   application show that, the method not only is feasible, but also it
   detection speed can up to 3m/s, and accuracy up to 0.05mm.}},

Abstract = {{This study is aimed to create an alternative to the classical GIS
   representation of the impact of earthquake hazards on urban areas. To
   accomplish this, the traditional map was revised, so that it can cope
   with contemporary innovative ways of planning, namely strategic
   planning. As in the theory of fractals, the building dimension and the
   urban neighbourhood dimension are addressed as different geographic
   scales between which lessons for decisions can be learned through
   regression. The interaction between the two scales is useful when
   looking for alternatives, for the completion of a GIS analysis, and in
   choosing the landmarks, which, in the case of hazards, become strategic
   elements in strategic planning. A methodology to innovate mapping as a
   digital means for analysing and visualising the impact of hazards is
   proposed. This method relies on concepts from various geography, urban
   planning, structural engineering and architecture approaches related to
   disaster management. The method has been tested at the building scale
   for the N-S Boulevard in Bucharest, Romania, called Magheru. At the
   urban scale, an incident database has been created, in which the case
   study for the building level can be mapped. The paper presented is part
   of a larger research work, which addresses decision making using the
   framework shown here. The main value of the paper is in proposing a
   conceptual framework to deconstruct the map for digital earthquake
   disaster impact analysis and representation. The originality of the
   concept consists in the representation of elements at different scales
   considered to be of different levels of importance in the urban tissue,
   according to the analysis to be performed on them.}},

Abstract = {{Holography has the potential to become the ultimate 3D experience.
   Nevertheless, in order to achieve practical working systems, major
   scientific and technological challenges have to be tackled. In
   particular, as digital holographic data represents a huge amount of
   information, the development of efficient compression techniques is a
   key component. This problem has gained significant attention by the
   research community during the last 10 years. Given that holograms have
   very different signal properties when compared to natural images and
   video sequences, existing compression techniques (e.g. JPEG or MPEG)
   remain suboptimal, calling for innovative compression solutions. In this
   paper, we will review and analyze past and on-going work for the
   compression of digital holographic data.}},

Abstract = {{Micro structured optical plastics components are intensively used i.e.
   in consumer electronics, for optical sensors in metrology, innovative
   LED-lighting or laser technology. Injection moulding has proven to be
   successful for the large-scale production of those parts. However, the
   production of those parts still causes difficulties due to challenges in
   the moulding and demoulding of plastics parts created with laser
   structured mould inserts. A complete moulding of the structures often
   leads to increased demoulding forces, which then cause a breaking of the
   structures and a clogging of the mould. An innovative approach is to
   combine PVD-coated (physical vapour deposition), laser structured
   inserts and a variothermal moulding process to create functional
   mic8iuro structures in a one-step process. Therefore, a PVD-coating is
   applied after the laser structuring process in order to improve the wear
   resistance and the anti-adhesive properties against the plastics melt.
   In a series of moulding trials with polycarbonate (PC) and
   polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) using different coated moulds, the mould
   temperature during injection was varied in the range of the glass
   transition and the melt temperature of the polymers. Subsequently, the
   surface topography of the moulded parts is evaluated by digital 3D
   laser-scanning microscopy. The influence of the moulding parameters and
   the coating of the mould insert on the moulding accuracy and the
   demoulding behaviour are being analysed. It is shown that micro
   structures created by ultra-short pulse laser ablation can be
   successfully replicated in a variothermal moulding process. Due to the
   mould coating, significant improvements could be achieved in producing
   micro structured optical plastics components.}},

Abstract = {{Australian Universities face a `tough' Federal government of sector

   education 2013-2016. New technology, globalisation, productivity driven
   innovation and scientific method are the contexts through which research
   outcomes, on tighter budgets, will be made. In this paper, we redraw
   attention to the complexity of research contexts, including media sites,
   industry and digital worlds. In particular, we foreground the `turn to
   affect'. Recent years have witnessed a complex revision of
   understandings about lived worlds by considering intangibles: affect,
   emotion and the senses. Universities have also included the performing
   arts and the digital arts and sciences. The turn to affect is, then,
   significant beyond discourse, and universities would be wise to
   encourage less tangible research strategies that impact and respond to
   the market and, indeed, allow the market responses to affect.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional ultrasound imagers suffer from a large data rate between
   their analog-to-digital converter (ADC) front-end and digital
   beamforming backend. This high aggregate data rate (typically exceeding
   30 Gb/s) is holding back the design of imagers with high transducer
   counts, such as 2D imaging arrays. Prior work has demonstrated
   sub-Nyquist sampling techniques in software, which take advantage of the
   low innovation rate to sample well below the physical bandwidth of the
   signal. This work demonstrates a PCB-based hardware implementation of a
   32-channel analog front-end (AFE) employing sub-Nyquist sampling. We
   additionally demonstrate a mixer-based subarray beamforming technique
   that exploits the narrowband nature of the receiver to beamform received
   signals prior to digitization. Together, these techniques reduce the
   aggregate data rate by a factor of 43x when compared to a conventional
   system.}},

Abstract = {{In Smart City and Participatory Sensing initiatives the key concept is
   for user communities to contribute sensor information and form a body of
   knowledge that can be exploited by innovative applications and data
   analytics services. A key aspect in all such platforms is that sensor
   information is not free but comes at a cost. As a result, these
   platforms may suffer due to insufficient sensor information made
   publicly available if applications do not share efficiently the cost of
   the sensor information they consume.
   We explore the design of specialized market mechanisms that match demand
   to supply while taking into account important positive demand
   externalities: sensors are digital goods and their cost can be shared by
   applications. We focus on the buyer side and define different demand
   models according to the flexibility in choosing sensor data for
   satisfying application needs. We then investigate the properties of
   various costsharing mechanisms with respect to efficiency and budget
   balance. In doing so, we also propose and study a new mechanism, which
   although lacks strategyproofness, it exhibits important efficiency
   improvement along with certain fairness properties.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical placement learning experiences are integral to all health and
   medical curricula as a means of integrating theory into practice and
   preparing graduates to deliver safe, high-quality care to health
   consumers. A growing challenge for education providers is to access
   sufficient clinical placements with experienced supervisors who are
   skilled at maximising learning opportunities for students. This paper
   reports on the development and evaluation of an innovative online
   learning program aimed at enhancing student and clinical supervisors'
   preparedness for effective workplace-based learning. The evidence-based
   learning program used `story-telling' as the learning framework. The
   stories, which were supported by a range of resources, aimed to engage
   the learners in understanding student and supervisor responsibilities,
   as well as the expectations and competencies needed to support effective
   learning in the clinical environment. Evaluation of this program by the
   learners and stakeholders clearly indicated that they felt authentically
   `connected' with the characters in the stories and developed insights
   that suggested effective learning had occurred. (C) 2014 Australian

Abstract = {{Networking and team working are becoming the foundations of human
   performance in educational, organizational and recreational settings.
   Here, new communities of practice are being established to promote an
   engagement economy that will be able to foster innovation and success by
   sustaining collective well-being and group flourishing. Considered as
   ``positive technologies{''}, Serious Games (SGs) can support these
   processes. By fostering continuous learning experiences blended with
   entertaining affordances, SGs have in fact been able to shape new
   opportunities for human psychological training and assessment. However,
   despite the impressive growth of SGs applications, only a few of them
   have been tested and scientifically considered from an empirical point
   of view. Our study tries to address this gap, evaluating the potential
   of digital game technology compared to paper-based applications not only
   among individuals, but also among groups. The study, conducted with Mind
   the Game, a multiplayer SG, involved 75 students. Preliminary results
   showed only minor but fundamental differences between the two
   experimental conditions. On the one hand, groups who experienced the
   paper-based condition felt more competent than groups exposed to the
   digital experience, reporting higher levels of negative feelings too. On
   the other hand, groups exposed to the digital condition described
   themselves as more challenged and efficient in a collective way.}},

Abstract = {{This survey paper explores the opportunities and challenges of new
   technologies and social media for design research and design ethnography
   in particular, and summarizes the results in a framework. Understanding
   users' needs and observing their behavioral patterns becomes more and
   more important when designing innovative products or services.
   Traditional design ethnography mainly consists of in-depth interviews
   and field observations of individuals or groups in the social context to
   be investigated. Digital technologies might enable new possibilities in
   collecting, analyzing, and visualizing research data. Advanced hard-and
   software, the ubiquitous presence of smartphones, global accessibility
   of data, and new technological and social concepts, such as social media
   or crowdsourcing, allow for new approaches in design research. We
   suggest that technology nowadays is able to not only collect large
   numbers of data but also improve data quality by providing access to new
   approaches in design research as well as facilitating and assisting the
   researcher with coding and interpreting the collected data.}},

Abstract = {{An active research field in product design concerns the analysis of
   end-users' evaluations on virtual products, in order to understand the
   product semantics. This study compares two methods for eliciting user's
   perceptions of a product: a classical model-based method, based on
   conjoint analysis, and a more innovative non model-based test, using
   interactive genetic algorithms. The product proposed to illustrate the
   study is a digital instrument panel integrated in a car dashboard, and
   the semantic dimension considered is the ``sportiness{''}. After the
   definition of the variables of the instrument panel, the two users'
   assessment tests are conducted with a panel of 30 participants. For both
   tests, the most influent variables on the ``sportiness{''} of the
   instrument panel are selected, and representative designs of the
   sportiness are defined (the most or the least sporty). A comparison of
   the results of the tests is proposed, by examining the differences and
   agreements between them. The results show that the agreement between the
   two tests is important and that interactive genetic algorithms can be an
   interesting alternative to classical rating tests to study product
   semantics.}},

Abstract = {{Intracavity laser beam shaping has been achieved by adding intensity or
   phase filters to a Fabry-Perot resonator. Changing the output beam from
   one mode to another is a tedious process, requiring the replacing of
   custom optical elements, and careful realignment.
   The digital laser {[}1] is an innovation which allows the laser beam
   produced by a laser to be dynamically controlled by a computer.
   Essentially, one of the resonator mirrors is replaced by a spatial light
   modulator (SLM), which is a computer-controlled, pixellated,
   liquid-crystal device. While the concept is the device is simple, the
   implementation revealed subtle properties of spatial light modulators
   and the liquid crystals contained in them. These properties had to be
   well understood before their undesirable characteristics could be
   overcome, allowing the laser to function as conceived in the design.}},

Abstract = {{Open source innovation gained its momentum with software development but
   nowadays spread well beyond this project type and has attracted numerous
   participants. So far, literature ignores widely these further project
   examples and assumes that project types are equal in terms of their
   participants. We challenge this assumption and postulate member
   diversity between project types. We stretch beyond repeatedly analyzed
   cases of iconic software initiatives by including content communities as
   well as we introduce fun and business project types to have a
   appropriate resemblance of digital production communities. Our analysis
   reveals significant differences within and between projects in both,
   participants' demographic and contribution rationales. Thus the
   contributions of this study are multifold and target (I) phenomenon
   enrichment, e.g. a detailed comparison of the open source landscape with
   as yet unconsidered community types, (2) research validation, e.g.
   replication of earlier studies aligned to latest developments and with
   yet lacking samples, and (3) theoretical advancement as we respond to
   the call to contextualize research and spark off the discussion of
   diversity in open source innovation.}},

Abstract = {{There are several types of infrastructures to allow people to interact
   distributed. Together with development of information technologies, the
   use of such infrastructures is gaining momentum at many organizations
   and opens new trend in scientific researches. On the other hand, rapid
   increase of mobile technologies allows individuals to apply solutions
   without need of traditional office spaces and regardless of location.
   Hence, realization of certain infrastructures on mobile platforms could
   be useful not only in daily purposes but also in terms of scientific
   approach. Implementation of tools based on mobile infrastructures can
   vary from basic internet-messengers to complex software for online
   collaboration equipment in large-scaled workgroups. Although growth of

Abstract = {{New, energy-saving, efficient and cost-effective processing technologies
   such as 2D and 3D inkjet printing (IJP) for the production and
   integration of intelligent components will be opening up very
   interesting possibilities for industrial applications of molecular
   materials in the near future. Beyond the use of home and office based
   printers, ``inkjet printing technology{''} allows for the additive
   structured deposition of photonic and electronic materials on a wide
   variety of substrates such as textiles, plastics, wood, stone, tiles or
   cardboard. Great interest also exists in applying IJP in industrial
   manufacturing such as the manufacturing of PCBs, of solar cells, printed
   organic electronics and medical products. In all these cases inkjet
   printing is a flexible (digital), additive, selective and cost-efficient
   material deposition method. Due to these advantages, there is the
   prospect that currently used standard patterning processes can be
   replaced through this innovative material deposition technique. A main
   issue in this research area is the formulation of novel functional inks
   or the adaptation of commercially available inks for specific industrial
   applications and/or processes.
   In this contribution we report on the design, realization and
   characterization of novel active and passive inkjet printed electronic
   devices including circuitry and sensors based on metal nanoparticle ink
   formulations and the heterogeneous integration into 2/3D printed
   demonstrators. The main emphasis of this paper will be on how to convert
   scientific inkjet knowledge into industrially relevant processes and
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The development of digital technology has an overturning impact on music
   industry in the network era; the traditional record companies have to
   implement the digital transformation, because new competitive forces are
   joining the industry chains, such as network music operators,
   value-added service providers, terminal equipment manufacturers and even
   mobile operators who aim to lead the development of music industry with
   its music data services; the competition and integration of various
   forces all provide a profound potential prospect for future digital
   music development. However, piracy has been the recurring troubles of
   Chinese music market, meanwhile, the development of network
   technologies, such as search and P2P have facilitated the growth of
   online piracy, even trying to redefine the meaning of copyright law,
   which made the protection of digital copyright in a sea of troubles.
   Although there are benefits from digital music on ring back music gain
   sharing the mature business model still needs to be explored in
   practice, in order to get return of value from original whole piece of
   music. Along the innovative thinking of mesoscopic approach to business
   models, using mature business models and design ideas summarized by
   predecessors, combining the inherent law of digital music industry
   development, focusing on the core value proposition of digital music
   industry, the innovative form of digital music business model can be
   explored. The ``iPod+iTunes{''} model of Apple Company and ring back
   music model of China Mobile show us the huge value of digital music
   innovative model. Each link of digital music industry chain makes use of
   the value space provided by Internet, focuses on content or channel or
   the platform, with various innovation ways, and obtains great value
   promotion for users with lower cost-creating the blue ocean of digital
   music. Finally, users will have more choices and be convenient in the
   music consumption by the value innovation, and enjoy rich high
   perceptual music experience.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technologies persuasively are changing business landscape thus
   disrupting traditional business models of many sectors, particularly
   those that engage with information-based products. Organizations
   struggle to change their business models. Overtime business models

   in progress aims to explore the challenges and success factors in the
   transformation from traditional to digital business models. The assumed
   focus is on cognitive dependencies that hinder and enable such
   transformation given that this transformation involves a fundamental
   shift of core cognitive assumptions and beliefs held by the management

   digital options within digital clusters (that are clusters where
   collaboration is IT-dependent). To this aim, this research focuses on
   digital platforms, a specific IT artifact supporting an
   inter-organizational system (IOS), which finds a typical application
   domain in clusters of enterprises. Thus, the paper first discusses the
   theoretical background and presents a literature review that has been
   used to set up a framework for analyzing the factors influencing the
   exploitation of digital platforms at cluster level. The framework is
   developed through a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology whose
   empirical ground will be represented by a cluster of more than a hundred
   of manufacturing small-medium enterprises. An exploratory case study is
   then discussed in this paper, meant to represent the early stages of
   application of the DSR method.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a mobile X-ray service for elderly residents of
   residential aged care facilities}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{517-521}},
Abstract = {{Objective The Royal Melbourne Hospital established a mobile X-ray
   service (MXS) in 2013. The goal of the MXS is to address the radiology
   needs of frail, elderly or demented residents of residential aged care
   facilities (RACFs) who would otherwise require transportation to attend
   for X-ray. The present study describes the activity of the MXS, and the
   impact of the MXS on emergency department (ED) attendances by residents
   of RACFs.
   Methods The study is a descriptive study and uses a before-and-after
   cohort approach. Activity for the first year of operation was collected
   and described. At the end of the first year of operation, the top 30
   RACF users of the MXS were identified. The hospital Department of
   Radiology database was examined to find all plain X-rays performed on
   any patient presenting from the same 30 RACFs for the 1 year before
   commencement of the MXS (1 July 2012-30 June 2013) and for the 1 year
   period after the commencement of the MXS (1 July 2013-30 June 2014).
   Attendances were compared.
   Results The MXS delivered 1532 service attendances to 109 different
   RACFs. The mean age of patients receiving MXS services was 86 years
   (range 16-107 years). In all, 1124 services (73.4\%) were delivered to
   patients in high-care RACFs. Most patients (n=634; 41.4\%) were bed or
   wheelchair bound, followed by those who required assistance to ambulate
   (n=457; 29.8\%). The most common X-ray examinations performed were
   chest, hip and pelvis, spine and abdomen. There were 919 service
   attendances to the top 30 RACFs using the MXS (60.0\% of all
   attendances). There was an 11.5\% reduction in ED presentations
   requiring plain X-ray in the year following the commencement of the MXS
   (95\% confidence interval 0.62-3.98; P=0.019).
   Conclusion The present study suggests a reduction in hospital ED
   attendances for high users of the MXS. This has benefits for hospitals,
   patients and nursing homes. It also allows the extension of other
   programs designed to treat patients in their RACFs. Special rebates for
   home-based radiology service provision should be considered.
   What is already known about this subject? Digital processing has changed
   the way radiology delivers services. The Australian community is in the
   middle of a shift towards an aging population, with a greater numbers of
   residents in RACFs. It has been suggested in previous studies that
   mobile X-ray reduces the rate of delirium in patients who require X-ray.
   What does this paper add? There is an unmet demand for MXS to residents
   of RACFs. MXS may reduce presentations by elderly residents of RACFs to
   hospital EDs for X-rays. MXS may assist general practitioners, and other
   innovative programs, such as Hospital in the Home and Inreach, to better
   manage care for patients in RACFs.
   What are the implications for practitioners? Providers of radiology
   services should examine the opportunities and benefits of establishing
   MXS. Funders of services should examine ways of rebating MXS to
   encourage further development. Hospitals (Hospital in the Home and
   Inreach services), RACFs and general practitioners should use mobile
   X-ray and integrate these services into their management of aged care
   delivered in RACFs.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Social Innovation is a relative new term, which describes new
   IT-enabled solutions that simultaneously meet a social need and enhance
   capacity to act. It includes the challenge of giving a clear identity to
   the digital essence that assist our way of knowing, and living. It is an
   emergent stream of social innovation research and a response to growing
   social, environmental and demographic challenges. There is great
   potential to exploit digital network effects both in social innovation
   activity and in new services and approaches that generate social value.
   By the development of the internet, especially the popular of social
   media, such as face book, twitter, Wechat, QQ and so on, the way of
   people interact is changed a lot. And this kind of platform is a new way
   of social innovation in healthcare field, but we still need to do more
   research on this field to make it more reasonable. In order to explore
   and define design opportunities related to healthcare field, an
   interdisciplinary course ``Smart Healthcare{''} and workshops which
   combined the smart technology with social innovation were carried out.
   The sub-topic of the workshops related to the aged community, medical
   system. The paper addresses the result of the course and workshops by
   analyzing the case studies and defining design opportunities in the
   healthcare field. This could be a very preliminary step to understand
   how the social problems can be unbarred by digital social innovation
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Residue Number System (RNS) is a non-weighted number system which was
   proposed by Garner back in 1959 to achieve fast implementation of
   addition, subtraction and multiplication operations in special-purpose
   computations. Unfortunately, RNS did not turn out as a popular
   alternative to two's complement number system in those days. The
   rigidity of instruction set architectures of the market-dominant
   computers and microprocessors then has been the main barrier to sustain
   the development of RNS-based applications. In recent years,
   technological advancement in semiconductor technology has revived the
   interests to reconsider RNS for application-specific computing. There
   are at least two unique motivations which make RNS computations more
   attractive and applicable in modern digital signal processing
   applications. Firstly, the modular and distributive properties of RNS
   are used to achieve performance improvements especially in the emerging
   distributed and ubiquitous computing platforms such as cloud, wireless
   ad hoc networks, and applications which require tolerance against soft
   error. Secondly, energy efficiency becomes a key driver in the continual
   densification of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) digital
   integrated circuits. The high degree of computational parallelism in RNS
   offers new degree of freedom to optimize energy performance,
   particularly for very long word length arithmetic such as those involved
   in the hardware implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Our aim in
   this paper is to show this revolution by discussing interesting
   development in RNS and foster the innovative use of RNS for more
   applications. Different applications of RNS are investigated to
   demonstrate how this unconventional number system can be leveraged to
   benefit their implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Password-based authentication is common due to its high usability and
   simplicity to implement; however, it raises many security problems. This
   implies a continuous effort in designing new password-based
   authentication techniques. J. Blocki, M. Blum and A. Datta introduced
   GOTCHA (Generating panOptic Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans
   Apart), an innovative method to perform password-based authentication: a
   challenge-response mechanism that gives humans a great advantage over
   machines. The authors of GOTCHA proposed a public challenge to test its
   strength. We disclosed all 5 passwords of the first round, because of a
   leakage in the released code. In this paper, we present our attack: an
   improved brute-force that revealed each of the 7-digit password in less
   than 0.5 h and the 8-digit password in approximately 1.5 h on a personal
   laptop.}},

Abstract = {{Online business has become a common phenomenon among women
   entrepreneurs. The business can grow globally by using various
   applications that can be accessed through the internet. The purpose of
   this study is to determine the extent the digital inclusion through
   various online applications affects the empowerment of women
   entrepreneurs. The objective of this study is to examine the
   relationship between several factors such as digital inclusion and the
   entrepreneurship characteristics to bring about changes in empowerment
   of women entrepreneurs. Questionnaires were distributed through
   face-to-face interview and online survey to 402 women entrepreneurs aged
   18 to 50 years. The respondents were women who conduct online business
   using various internet applications. The results of this study found
   that 74\% respondents have made internet as a source of entrepreneurship
   information seeking and 86\% of respondents were actively communicating
   with their customer online. By using an analysis of multiple regression,
   the findings indicated that a major contributor of women entrepreneurs'
   empowerment is influenced by business risk-taking and product
   innovation. Nevertheless, digital inclusion is also providing a
   significant contribution through business communications activity and
   source of information through internet. This study also found that women
   entrepreneurs that are willing to take risks, innovative and frequently
   communicate with supplier and customer through online significantly will
   be able to empower themselves as entrepreneurs.}},

Abstract = {{The first part of the present study case has pointed to the efforts
   directed by Procter \& Gamble over time to keep close to its customers
   and the manner in which management has supported innovation within the
   company. Following the principles of disruptive innovation, the CEO of
   the company has set the goal for the company as to produce at least 50\%
   of the innovations from external ideas. So, the aim of this paper is to
   continue to analyse the tools and the approach that P \& G has taken in
   order to launch new products by partnering with other companies.
   Innovating by collaborating with external entities holding a highly
   specialized level of technology and engineering knowhow has been
   appreciated to contribute to the value creation process. In order to
   understand how open innovation strategy has worked for Procter \& Gamble
   and which was the designated tool used to enrich the company with

Abstract = {{To foster the development of innovative products and new technologies,
   nowadays companies use an open innovation system, encouraging
   stakeholders to contribute, using the companies' online platforms for
   open innovation or social media, bringing and sharing creative solutions
   and ideas in order to respond to challenging needs the company directly
   expresses. Accordingly, the current research continues the analysis of
   the LEGO Group innovation efforts, aiming to provide a case study
   approach based on describing the most important projects and online
   instruments company uses to interact with customers and other external
   stakeholders. Thus, by analysing the experience of the company in
   developing projects of involving stakeholders in the innovation
   processes, the article emphasizes the objective of these past projects
   developed by LEGO Group, outlining their objectives regarding the focus
   on the product or process innovation, the team management and
   stakeholders involved in the innovation actions and the results they
   obtained. Moreover, the case study highlights the features of the most
   important online instruments LEGO Group uses at the moment for engaging
   LEGO fans, children, parents, and other external stakeholders in
   developing new LEGO sets. Thus, LEGO online instruments provide the
   opportunity for customers to be creative and to respond to LEGO
   management team challenges. Accordingly, LEGO involve customers in
   bringing innovative ideas for LEGO sets through LEGO Ideas instrument,
   which aims to engage customers in submitting projects, voting and
   supporting ideas and also sharing them on social media. Also, the
   research emphasizes the role of supporting the open dialogue and
   interaction with customers and other external stakeholders through LEGO.
   com Create \& Share Galleries instrument, using their creativity to
   upload innovative models in the public galleries. The continuous
   challenges LEGO launches for their fans create a long-term connection
   between company and its customers, supporting the value co-creation
   process, as the submitted ideas can materialize in new LEGO products
   which can be found on the market. As a consequence, customers'
   engagement in the co-creation process facilitated by the multiple online
   instruments provided by LEGO, resulted in positive outcomes for the
   company regarding new product development for the sets launched on the
   market to satisfy changing needs of their customers. The results
   provided by this case study approach can be useful for the business
   environment and academia as well in order to understand the role of
   engaging customers in the open innovation process, creating a
   competitive advantage on the market for companies.}},

Abstract = {{The current research recognises the concept of innovation as the main
   driver for organisational growth and profitability. The companies seek
   to develop new ways to engage consumers and customers into co - creation
   value through the product design, development and distribution
   processes. However the main concern is manifested for new and creative
   ways of customization products based on consumers' requirements and
   needs. Thus the need for innovative virtual instruments arose as the
   demand from social communities for personalised products or services
   increased. Basically companies should develop own innovative platforms,
   where consumers can participate, with ideas, concepts or other relevant
   contributions, and interact with designers or engineers for product
   development. This paper aims to present the most important features of
   platform development within BMW Group as a concept and as innovative
   instrument. From this point of view it is important to enhance past
   experiences of the company in the field of co - creation projects. There
   will be highlighted the dual consumers' character as co - creator and co
   - evaluator based on their involvement in the proposed and developed
   projects and platform structure. The significant impact on platform
   functioning it has the diversity of company's concerns for Research \&
   Development and innovation activities. From this point of view there
   will be assessed the platform structure, the main proposed themes and
   the evaluation process. The main outcome is to highlight the
   significance of platform development as innovative tool for consumers'
   communities' enhancement. Based on the analysis of ``BMW Co-Creation
   Lab{''}, there will be revealed the main consumers concerns in terms of
   safety, comfort and appearance of the products. Thus it is important to
   understand the evaluation process of gathered ideas and intellectual
   property policy. The importance of platform development and
   implementation will be highlighted by company's results in terms of
   Research \& Development investments and future projects which will be
   proposed, assessed and implemented by BMW Group in order to show the
   responsibility for their products and consumers.}},

Abstract = {{The terms of creativity, co-creation, creative industries, innovation,
   and co-innovation are more and more used nowadays. While co-creation
   offers the possibility and encourages a more active involvement from the
   customers to create value rich experiences, innovation is responsible
   for the little improvements made for a better life, to grow a business,
   to improve products, services or company's productivity. Either
   customers, current and potential, or stakeholders' involvement into
   innovation activities, through their creativity, represent an important
   way of value creation, of actions' performance that increases the worth
   of goods, services, or business as a whole. More and more, different
   size businesses gather ideas for innovation from customers /stakeholders
   by involving them into the early stages of the innovation process.
   Actually, it has been shown that their ideas sketch their needs and
   wishes, and have been described as ``need information{''}. Customers and
   stakeholders, in general, also offer ideas that have been called
   ``solution information{''}, which represents, not only need information,
   but also customer-based proposals that describe how ideas can be
   transformed into marketable products. The term of creative industries
   refers to those goods that can technically be reproduced, industrially
   produced, and commercially sold, this being one of the many definitions
   found in the literature. Mulino Bianco was first launched in Italy,
   being one of the value brands of Barilla Group, which we can say,
   according to the Italian definition and classification, it belongs to
   creative industries: industry of food and taste. Even though Barilla
   Group's Research \& Development department does its job very
   efficiently, developing and creating new products under different
   brands, lately a key strategy for the Group and for Mulino Bianco, by
   default, is customers' pro-active involvement in products' development
   or creation. One of the tools used for this is the Internet Toolkit and
   Web 2.0. by means of which customers are being invited to participate in
   competitions, being asked to design and share their concepts / views for
   new products, or to get involved in by voting those ideas they best like
   and would love to find them on markets. The aim of this paper is to
   explore and identify the involvement of stakeholders in Mullino Bianco's
   product development or improvement through creativity and innovation. As
   methodology approach, a case study about Mulino Bianco was done, and the
   foreseen result is highlighting the Nel Mulino Che Vorrei platform's
   features for consumer's engagement in the value creation and
   co-creation.}},

Abstract = {{Technological changes and need for innovation represents the main
   concerns for organizational growth and profitability. However the main
   priority is still about achieving high performance through product
   development and consumers' engagement activities. As implementation of
   open innovation applications increased and value co-creation became well
   known and major process, companies were engaged into value co-innovation
   activities. From this point of view the need for joint efforts with
   consumers in product development arose. Thus the primary condition for
   an organization to be consumer centric is to define clear the vision and
   mission which reflects the common efforts for co-creation and diffusion
   of innovation. As Research \& Development processes evolved and interest
   for innovative concepts and products arose, companies started to
   implement the specific instruments for consumers' attraction and
   engagement into design and product development. The digitalized
   innovation became the main source for establishing the direct
   communication with the consumers. In order to achieve organization
   growth, profitability and recognition, the companies should be aware of
   the innovation importance and the need for internal change. From this
   point of view, there is necessary to assess the organizational
   structures, to implement new policies and to establish strategic
   targets. Basically it is justified the need for platform occurrence and
   development. Based on case study of BMW Group, recognised leader in
   automotive industry for innovative concepts, there will be analysed main
   features within organizational context which promotes the innovation
   implementation. There will be provided the review of the BMW Group
   experience of innovation activities, main consumers' engagement
   strategies, the values which promote the consumer - centric product
   development, new opportunities assessment, major policies and concerns.
   The foreseen result is to understand how companies are adapting to the
   technical and innovation changes as the main criteria for future product
   development and consumers' engagement motivation through the platform -
   based communication.}},

Abstract = {{International competitiveness forced the manufacturing enterprises to
   look for new ways to accelerate the development of digital products
   through innovation, global alliances and strategic partnerships. In an
   environment of global research and development of distributed
   geographically, all members of the joint teams made up of companies and
   universities need to access updated and accurate information about
   products created by any of the type employed, student, teacher. Current
   design processes involve more complex products consisting of elements of
   design created by multiple teams, disciplines and suppliers using
   independent CAD systems. Even when using a 3D CAD mature technology,
   many companies fail to significantly reduce losses in the process,
   improve product quality or product type to ensure successful innovations
   to market arouse interest. These challenges require a radical rethinking
   of the business model, which belongs to the field of design, which must
   be based on digital development of products based on integrated files.
   Through this work, the author has proposed to provide both synthesis and
   transformations brought news of the integrated NX {[}1, 2, 3] from
   Siemens PLM Software 9, following a news results detailed documentary
   study, and personal results obtained by applying the same version, the
   digital and integrated development of a product type device test beams.
   Based on educational license received for NX 9 was made a detailed study
   of the innovations made by this release, and the application of some of
   them went to graphical modelling and getting all the documentation of a
   test device bearing beams. Also, were synthesized in terms of
   methodology, the steps to take to obtain graphical documentation. The
   results consist of: 3D models of all parts and assembly 3D model of the
   three-dimensional constraints of all component parts and not least
   respectively all drawings and assembly drawing. The most important
   consequence of the paper is the obtaining of integrated files that can
   be subjected to further analysis type CAE / CAM / PDM software
   components by the same company. Additional advantages related files by
   the synthesis of integrated CAD / CAE / CAM / PDM.}},

Abstract = {{Previous strategic analyses of the field of ICT for sustainability
   (ICT4S) have often underplayed the role of ICTs in linking large numbers
   of people, in shaping and transferring ideas, and also the range of
   sustainability effects that ICTs can cause. The Digital Taxonomy for
   Sustainability (digitaltaxonomy.com) was developed to address this,
   through a qualitative analysis of over 500 ICT4S company descriptions.
   It classifies a digital system (software, hardware or social machine) by
   the digital ``means{''} it employs and the sustainability ``ends{''} it
   achieves. The possibilities are mapped out with two component
   taxonomies. The Sustainability Taxonomy identifies around 20 possible
   sustainability effects of a digital system, such as the sustainable use
   of natural resources. The Digital Taxonomy identifies over 80 genres of
   digital system organised onto a matrix. The rows distinguish how the
   increasing power of digital systems (the digital capabilities) can be
   applied to the various stages necessary for achieving change, the change
   processes that form the columns of the matrix. The indirect change
   processes (assessing, innovating, and adopting) develop and propagate
   ideas or things to cause the effects, whilst the driving change process
   acts to cause the effects directly. The digital capabilities are the
   three ways ICTs can engage with people to drive change: for artificial
   capability, the ICT provides the action automatically; for augmented
   capability, the ICT guides them, to inform and influence their
   behaviour; and for collective capability, the ICT connects them with
   others, developing networks that link supply and demand. The rapid
   development and proliferation of ICTs is increasing the power of all
   three capabilities. This systematic mapping out of the structure of the
   industry and the field may help stakeholders coordinate, raise external
   awareness, and inform the development of theory. In particular, it helps
   identify opportunities for new and better ICT4S systems.}},

   well as to the integration of other content and innovative
   technology-based products through their Information and Documentation
   Services (IDS). Among other findings, the study reveals a marked
   under-utilization of networks' potential for taking advantage of their

Abstract = {{This paper surveys work on ecosystems and open innovation of systems in
   the context of software engineering for embedded systems. The primary
   research goal is to develop a research agenda based on the topics
   identified within the research publications on the topic. The agenda is
   based on a systematic mapping study of 260 publications obtained from
   digital libraries and is influenced by a set of areas of interest, i.e.,
   product lines, open source, third party, business models, open
   innovation, and strategy. The results from the study include analysis of
   the type of research conducted in the field, its origin and research
   contribution. The study identifies the need for more solutions to
   specific open innovation problems such as mapping business models to
   technical platforms; defining open ecosystem processes that foster open
   innovation; and improving how ecosystem players can leverage on tool
   support for open innovation. A direction for future research is also
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{The Business Model (BM) notion has become popular because of a business
   environment shaped by ICT and globalization and characterized by an
   increasing complexity and uncertainty. Innovative ICT industry coupled
   with ever-growing products, services, and applications have placed
   business models at the heart of the new digital revolution. In this
   chapter, the authors examine how the concept has been applied in the
   field of ICT and is used in contemporary debate. These new BMs are based
   on new forms of organization and/or on new products and services
   offerings. The BM concept has attracted attention both from
   practitioners and academics. The concept has received wide recognition;
   yet in practice, it is a new and evolving concept. It has inspired
   numerous researchers and academics and has given rise to different
   interpretations, one around which there is not always a perfect
   consensus. However, despite its wide use, the notion of the business
   model has become more complex.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, a general overview of innovation (definition and
   typologies) is presented based on economics and management of innovation
   literature. Since the pioneering work of Schumpeter (1934, 1942), a
   growing body of literature has concentrated on technological change in
   industries. Technology is one of the main factors shaping environmental
   conditions of firms. The dynamics of innovation and technology may
   require several approaches to be analyzed. Innovation in various sectors
   is driven by standards and/or patents and other Intellectual Property
   Rights (IPR). Standards and patents are helpful for tracking
   globalization patterns. The current digital economy is characterized by
   fierce patents and standards battles. Standards and patents are helpful
   for tracking globalization patterns. The increasing development of
   Internet traffic and some of the key enabling technologies for the new
   digital economy called disruptive technologies are introduced.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter explains how the movie industry has to face new challenges
   closely related to globalization, technology innovation (digitization),
   industrial convergence, and new consumer demand since the end of the
   1990s. Market has evolved towards an oligopolistic structure, and
   technology changes are affecting both content production and
   distribution. Consequently, this sector has been confronted by major
   changes in its sources of revenues. Traditional media groups have to
   adapt their services to changing consumer expectations for more
   on-demand content and face new competitors. New operators offer
   Over-The-Top (OTT) services, which increase regularly. This chapter
   looks at causes of change and the impact on value chains and illustrates
   the increasing role of the Internet in the distribution of audiovisual
   content (for both IPTV and OTT audiovisual services).}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this chapter is to shed light on an emerging educational and
   business paradigm, stemming from the digital revolution and the
   opportunities disclosed by Open Innovation. The central idea behind Open
   Innovation is that, in a world of widely distributed knowledge,
   companies cannot afford to rely entirely on their own research but
   should instead buy or license processes or inventions from other actors.
   After pointing out the potential benefits of digital storytelling and of
   Web 2.0 and 3.0 for promoting pedagogical and organizational innovation,
   the authors present an application of the Open Innovation Paradigm in
   education: the Value Generating Framework. The chapter offers empirical
   evidence of the benefits through an in-depth analysis of the alliance
   between the Italian Zoo ``Parco Natura Viva{''} and the Italian
   foundation ``Radio Magica.{''} This knowledge-intensive, collaborative,
   value network paradigm is more successful than the previous firm-centric
   paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{In the styling phase of a product design, it's difficult to meet
   aesthetic and performance requirements simultaneously. An innovative
   design methodology integrating reverse engineering (RE) with
   optimization is illustrated to settle such a problem. In the field of
   automotive styling, the stylist's aesthetic intent is usually expressed
   by a clay model, and on the other hand, the aerodynamic performance may
   be ignored. Reverse engineering is used to convert a clay model to a
   digital model, which is then transferred to computational fluid dynamic
   (CFD) software to evaluate the aerodynamic performance. A variety of new
   design samples may be generated using free form deformation (FFD)
   deduced by a simple control polygon with few parameters, and the
   response surface method (RSM) is adopted to explore the relationships
   between these few parameters and two aerodynamic response variables. The
   final optimized solution can be found through a multi-objective genetic
   algorithm. A detail example is presented to verify the method.}},

Abstract = {{The post-industrial innovation system with its distinct focus on social
   innovation allows for theoretical and conceptual connections between
   innovation research and new fields of social practice. In this article
   we elaborate on the potential of social innovation and especially
   digital social innovation to tackle digitally excluded persons' needs.
   Public internet access points are key infrastructures driving the
   digital inclusion of marginalized persons. Empirical results presented
   in this paper shows that these players act socially innovative by
   creating collaborative spaces for digital inclusion, by developing
   hybrid staff competence profiles and by creating community-based,
   intergenerational learning content. The paper relates research
   perspectives from the social innovation and the digital inclusion
   discourse and argues against the background of research and development
   results of six EU funded projects on social innovation and/or digital
   inclusion in the years 2011-2015.}},

Abstract = {{This paper illustrates some results obtained by the IBAM ITLab in the
   Cultura e Turismo: DiCet project financed with National Operational
   Program (Programmi Operativi Nazionali - PON) funds. In this project
   procedures were developed to produce technical models for an efficient
   management of 3D and 2D resources, and to define best practices and
   methodical protocols for quality certification and process
   standardization, capable of increase cross-sector dialogue. The sites
   were identified as a function of a supply-and-demand analysis with
   regard to a placement on the market of innovative models and services
   based on the creation of hyper-realistic digital models and virtual
   scenarios. Particular attention was given to those uses that permit
   greater visibility, protection, and conservation of cultural assets
   characterized by difficult access, vulnerability, seismic risk,
   hydro-geological risk, etc. In view of this, innovative models and tools
   were designed and developed for capitalizing on and exploiting cultural
   heritage, understood as an integrated and complex system conceived as a
   holistic model strongly based on the use of ICT technologies. Virtual
   enjoyment is understood here as a form of representing reality that
   accelerates and strengthens cognitive capacities, which is to say it
   becomes capable of generating extremely sensitive, ``virtuous{''}
   learning processes based on metaphors of the real world, and thus easy
   to use and understand. Operationally, our working group has made some
   Augmented Reality solutions available; these enable the interactive
   display - directly in situ and especially on mobile devices - of
   archaeological monuments integrated within the urban fabric. A simple
   solution allows the user to display an interactive 3D reconstruction
   directly on the real site, using the latest-generation gyroscope
   function. In addition to this, certain inaccessible monuments of the
   cities of Lecce and Catania have been virtualized, mainly using
   image-based technologies and ultra-realistic laser scanning, to allow
   them to be visited remotely both via smartphone and on large virtual
   theatres. In any case the virtual reconstruction of the ancient
   monuments is the starting point of communication process and represent
   the point of interest around which every technological solution is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) has proven to provide effective tools to assist
   the human work in a wide range of sectors. Many examples can be found in
   literature of innovative AR tools used in medicine, industry and the
   military fields. Recently AR has been successfully applied also to
   cultural heritage, mainly for communication and educational purposes.
   Nevertheless, we argue that also the activity of professional operators
   dealing with cultural heritage, such as conservators and restorers, can
   benefit from the use of AR-systems. The restoration process commonly
   builds on the analysis and study of prior interventions and, very often,
   on the results of pre-operative diagnoses performed on the artwork. All
   the information gathered during these stages is necessary during the
   restoration and, using AR, it can be directly overlaid on top of the
   artwork avoiding the necessity of a continuous visual switch between the
   artwork and the documentation. Moreover, through an AR-system, new
   digital information can be produced directly while working, fostering
   also new forms of documentation.
   We hereby present ARTworks, an AR-system intended to assist the restorer
   both during the operating phases, providing contextualized information,
   and during documentation, allowing the insertion of new registered
   digital information. The system, composed by amechanical interface and
   an Android tablet, has been purposely designed taking into account the
   particular application field of restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in mobile and wireless communication technologies
   have played a vital role in building the u-learning environment that now
   combines both real-world and digital learning resources. However,
   learners still require assistance to control real objects and manage the
   abundance of available materials; otherwise, their mental workload could
   become so high that learning becomes less effective. The learner is the
   priority in every learning situation and is, therefore, a crucial factor
   in executing u-learning. This study presents a u-learning system that
   integrates context awareness and ontological technology to design a
   context-aware knowledge map (CAKM) to improve learning efficiency. A
   case study of an Orchid Island botanical ecosystem course was conducted
   in classrooms and at the Botanical Garden of National Museum of Natural
   Science in Taiwan. Participants were university teachers and students. A
   questionnaire based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) theory was
   designed and used to measure the willingness for adoption or usage of
   the proposed system. The results demonstrate that this innovative
   approach can enhance learning intention. The results also indicate that
   this CAKM not only substantially improves the effectiveness of subject
   learning but also enhances the usability of u-learning systems in the
   museum environment.}},

Abstract = {{Current developments in the medical domain, not unlike many other
   sectors, are marked by the growing digitalisation of data, including
   patient records, study results, clinical guidelines or imagery. This
   trend creates the opportunity for the development of innovative decision
   support systems to assist physicians in making a diagnosis or preparing
   a treatment plan. To this end, complex tasks need to be solved,
   requiring one or more interpretation algorithms (e.g. image processors
   or classifiers) to be chosen and executed based on heterogeneous data.
   We, therefore, propose a semantic framework for sequential decision
   making and develop the foundations of a Linked agent who executes
   interpretation algorithms available as Linked APIs {[}9] on a
   data-driven, declarative basis {[}10] by integrating structured
   knowledge formalized in RDF and OWL, and having access to meta
   components for optimization. We evaluate our framework based on image
   processing of brain images and ad-hoc selection of surgical phase
   recognition algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The need for English and literacy curriculum to connect with young
   people's lifeworlds to build bridges and frames of reference that
   connect traditional English curriculum with digital texts and
   literacies, are increasing priorities in curriculum frameworks in
   Australia and elsewhere. This paper reports on a project in which the
   authors worked with teachers and students in five secondary schools to
   research the ways in which digital games might be incorporated into the
   English curriculum. Central to this endeavour was `turning around' to
   the affordances of digital games and their paratexts to understand how
   they can be understood as text and action. Drawing on classroom
   observations and literature in Games Studies and English curriculum we
   present a timely model and innovative heuristic that we argue
   facilitates teachers incorporating digital games into their English
   classrooms. We illustrate how each assists teachers in `turning around'
   to digital games to make their English classrooms more relevant to
   students' lifeworlds.}},

Title = {{Dental wear patterns in early modern humans from Skhul and Qafzeh: A
   response to Sang and Tillier}},
Journal = {{HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{The use of teeth as tools for manipulating objects and simple
   food-processing methods was common among prehistoric and modern
   hunter-gatherer human populations. Paramasticatory uses of teeth
   frequently produce enamel chipping and distinctive types of dental wear
   that can readily be related to specific tool functions. In particular,
   the presence of unusual occlusal wear areas (named para-facets) on
   maxillary teeth of prehistoric, historic and modern hunter-gatherers has
   been associated with cultural habits involving extensive use of teeth
   (Fiorenza et al., 2011; Fiorenza and Kullmer, 2013). However, Sang and
   Tillier (2014) believe that this wear had been caused by pathological
   occlusal relationships rather than by the use of teeth as tools. In this
   contribution, we show how occlusal contacts are created and how it is
   possible to distinguish between masticatory and non-masticatory wear
   facets by using an innovative digital approach called Occlusal
   Fingerprint Analysis. Statistical results from the analysis of
   comparative modern samples clearly demonstrate that described
   para-facets in Skhul and Qafzeh could not have been produced by dental
   occlusal anomalies such as malocclusions and crossbites. Moreover,
   dental pathologies in prehistoric humans were extremely rare. Only with
   the adoption of the modern lifestyle between 18th and 19th centuries,
   did the emergence of malocclusions become significantly more common.
   Because more than 50\% of the Skhul and Qafzeh individuals analysed in
   our study are characterised by this distinctive type of wear, it is
   highly unlikely that their para-facets occurred as a result of dental
   pathologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oroo', a very peculiar jungle sign language of the semi-nomadic Penan in
   Malaysia, Borneo Island, is at the virtue of extinction with recent
   changes in lifestyle. The youth inhabiting the rainforest are more drawn
   to technology than traditional forest activities needing cognizance of
   Oroo'. In partnership with community members of Long Lamai, as part of a
   long term collaboration, we launched into revitalizing Oroo' through
   digitalization. Complementing previous efforts of database, tangible and
   game developments, we postulate that a language can only be revitalized
   if integrated in daily use. Thus in this paper we present the co-design
   of the Penan's Oroo' Short Message Signs (PO-SMS) application, which
   extends current technology driven communication means. Following a
   community-based co-design approach, a group of local youth and elders
   have led the unique design of their own digital indigenous communication
   tool. Our research contributes directly to the INTERACT 2015 theme of
   ``Connection. Tradition. Innovation{''}.}},

Abstract = {{A Ubiquitous Learning Log (ULL) is defined as a digital record of what a
   learner has learned in daily life using ubiquitous computing
   technologies. It allows learners to log their learning experiences with
   photos, audios, videos, locations, RFID tag and sensor data, and to
   share and reuse ULL with others. The number of ULLs will keep increasing
   as the learners keep learning. The sheer volume of ULLs will be
   accumulated in the ubiquitous learning system called SCROLL. It creates
   a necessity to analyze the ubiquitous learning logs to provide learners
   with appropriate learning logs in accordance with their learning
   abilities, context, time and location. However, researchers on analysis
   and visualization on ubiquitous learning is very few, and there are not
   yet previous works that visualize relationships among learning logs on
   spatial and temporal dimensions. Therefore, this paper introduces the
   overview of SCROLL, and then describes an innovative visualization
   system which integrates network visualization technologies and time-map
   in order to visualize the ubiquitous learning logs accumulated in the
   SCROLL.}},

Abstract = {{This study represents findings from three continents (Asia, Africa and
   South America) regarding usage of ICT in six rural schools. Our goal was
   to analyze the current situation regarding digital technologies in these
   environments, describe similarities and differences relating to the
   digital divide, and provide a roadmap that could improve teaching and
   learning, maximizing the use of existing resources. Our case study was
   carried out with the help of innovative teachers who are supportive of
   technology integration in teaching, but have less options to utilize
   this knowledge in their classrooms because of various barriers. Our
   results show challenges, but also opportunities to embrace new ways of
   teaching; ways that might allow digital technologies to be employed in
   innovative ways to encourage student learning and community growth. Our
   study is based on participating teachers' understanding of the issues
   and challenges within these countries and areas, relating to schooling.}},

   the identification and analysis of the media startups launched since
   2008 and on the results of the 2013 Report of the Journalistic
   Profession published by the Press Association of Madrid. Results. Sports
   journalism is a field that favours innovation and the creation of a
   diversity of projects. Two tendencies stand out: hyperlocal start-ups
   and niche information products. Discussion. The article examines the
   contribution of these projects to the current structure of the
   journalism industry, as well as their viability, characteristic business
   models, and common patterns. Conclusions. Sports journalism is still at
   an expansive phase and involves new ways of managing internet-based
   businesses that rely heavily on the personal brand of journalists, as
   well as new thematic areas and contents.}},

Abstract = {{The present work describes an early research activity on a haptic user
   interface to assist visually impaired in using a multi-experience shower
   that saves energy and water and informs the user about current
   consumptions. The user interface aims to joint visual, tactile and
   kinesthetic feedbacks to improve digital contents accessibility. The
   knob is applied both to interact with the graphic interface by
   able-bodied persons and to emboss Braille text to drive the blind in
   navigating the menu items. The developed prototype is then illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{Interoperability is the key term within the framework of the
   European-funded research project Interedition,(1) whose aim is `to
   encourage the creators of tools for textual scholarship to make their
   functionality available to others, and to promote communication between
   scholars so that we can raise awareness of innovative working methods'.
   The tools developed by Interedition's `Prototyping' working group were
   tested by other research teams, which formulate strategic
   recommendations. To this purpose, the Centre for Manuscript Genetics
   (University of Antwerp), the Huygens Institute for the History of the
   Netherlands (The Hague), and the University of Wurzburg have been
   working together within the framework of Interedition. One of the
   concrete results of collaboration is the development and fine-tuning of
   the text collation tool CollateX.(2) In this article, we would like to
   investigate how the architecture of a digital archive containing modern
   manuscripts can be designed in such a way that users can autonomously
   collate textual units of their choice with the help of the collation
   tool CollateX and thus decide for themselves how efficiently this
   digital architecture functions-as an archive, as a genetic dossier, or
   as an edition. The first part introduces CollateX and its internal
   concepts and heuristics as a tool for digitally supported collation. How
   this tool can be integrated in the infrastructure of an electronic
   edition is discussed in part two. The third and final part examines the
   possibility of deploying CollateX for the collation of modern
   manuscripts by means of a test case: the Beckett Digital Manuscript
   Project (www.beckettarchive.org).}},

Abstract = {{Interactivity has been a central theme in the discussions of digital TV
   in Brazil. Ginga middleware was considered one of the main innovations,
   with potential to change the entire TV. However, seven years after the
   beginning of digital transmissions, full interactivity hasn't occurred.
   Applications broadcast by TV stations use only additional programming
   information. This paper investigates the causes of the slow adoption of
   interactivity in the Brazilian market, namely: lack of interest by
   electronics industry, lack of incentives for the use of interactivity as
   a digital inclusion tool, conceptual model of information control and
   the emergence of more attractive and profitable ways for the audience to
   interact with programming.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the coexistence of the different material formats
   of books (emerging and classical) from a sociological perspective,
   trying to argue that textual practices, devices and digital applications
   available to users are enabling a rearticulation of the book as an
   object, and some other written content, that surrounds them with new
   mediations. In addition, we make a brief review of some key points in
   the evolution of the technologies used to copy textual pieces and try to
   explain that in the recreation of shared routines and senses is where
   the future of the book may be establishing itself, so it is not
   appropriate to simply address the agency in a technology (such as the
   printing press before or Internet nowadays) unless we understand the
   technology as an contingency with a strong social component, not only as
   purely technical innovation.
   Apparently, we live in a time of transition in which several strategies
   are being developed by different corporations in order to impose their
   own conceptions of readings and books among the others. Either way, it
   is not questionable that also the attempts to capture the legal
   condition of the book may have a performative desire. Therefore, the
   technological environment of the book is suffering a kind of
   reorganization in several locations, where new and old elements try to
   fit themselves within variant levels of conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Co-design approaches have been used by different sectors, to understand
   end-user perspectives. They have been diversified from traditional use
   in product development to sectors such as healthcare environments. They
   put emphasis on innovation with end-users where this is seen as a source
   of competitive advantage, and fits with the logic of end-user-led
   innovation. It does however ask the question of how to enable such
   approaches and if digital approaches are more useful than traditional
   paper-based methods. We propose a digital co-design tool for environment
   improvement that can potentially promote user involvement. This paper
   reports on a comparative study on co-designing a healthcare environment
   using the digital tool versus a traditional paper-based tool. Discussion
   centers on the benefits and drawbacks of proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: E-Government, as a new bond linking the government and the
   public, has become the focus of innovation in government services. The
   paper focuses on e-Government service quality issues from the
   perspective of users.
   Design/methodology/approach: From the aspects of online service quality
   perception offline service quality perception, based on IS Success model
   and SERQUAL e-Government Services Quality model has been set up with
   information quality, system and service quality as key factors. Then,
   the survey method was applied to collect data and to test the model.
   Findings: It was found that users' perception of offline service quality
   has a significant on improving their perception of online service
   quality, and online service quality has a significant effect on public
   satisfaction of e-Government services; information system security and
   stability, interactive services and ``one-stop{''} services all have a
   effect on public satisfaction of e-Government services. However, offline
   service perception has certain positive effect on public satisfaction of
   e-Government services but dramatically.
   Research limitations/implications: Mobile e-Government as an important
   direction of the development of e-Government, in the future, we will
   study more about mobile e-Government services channels.
   Originality/value: This study further develops the theory of information
   system service quality, and also provides a theoretical reference for
   government departments. On the one hand, based on the characteristics of
   e-government system, information quality, system quality and service
   quality in the previous system service model are further discussed; on
   the other hand, both online and offline services are taken into
   consideration in the information system service model, thus establishing
   the e-government services quality model and making an indepth study of
   the integration effect of online and offline services. Its conclusions
   can be references for the application of traditional information system
   service model in the field of e-government.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, travel demand modelling focused on long-term multiple
   socio-economic scenarios and land-use configurations to estimate the
   required transport supply. However, the limited number of transportation
   requests in demand-responsive flexible transport systems require a
   higher resolution zoning. This work analyses users short-term
   destination choice patterns, with a careful analysis of the available
   data coming from various different sources, such as GPS traces and
   social networks. We use a Multinomial Logit Model, with a social
   component for utility and characteristics, both derived from Social
   Network Analyses. The results from the model show meaningful
   relationships between distance and attractiveness for all the different
   alternatives, with the variable distance being the most significant.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years journalistic practices are reinventing themselves in
   order to respond to a complex scenario marked by the need of constant
   updating, abundance of information, an improved presence of the audience
   in the communication process and innovations in media formats and
   consumption habits. In this new information ecosystem where the
   abundance of data prevails, new hypermedia tools arise offering the
   possibility to choose and arrange those tools with the aim of creating
   orderly and coherent narratives. Storify is one of these tools. This
   paper aims to study the quality of the Storify published in four
   newspapers of reference in Spain and the United Kingdom: El Mundo, El
   Pais, The Guardian and The Independent. The research involves analyzing
   aspects such as the most used themes for creating Storify, the most
   aggregated networks within the Storify, the extension of them or the
   frequency with which this application is used by the digital version of
   the newspaper.}},

   assessment of DNA integrity in cancer research. In particular, we will
   present the application of the determination of DNA integrity for
   tracking of circulating tumor DNA. Finally, we will conclude by
   illustrating the potential innovative application of DNA integrity as a

Abstract = {{We live in a digital world and access to information is a ubiquitous
   state either we are at work, at home or at shopping. Although the costs
   of access to sources of information is becoming smaller, consumers still
   encounter a lack of information about the products and services they
   purchase in order to take their best decision. Consumers have the right
   to be informed to make good decisions about their acquisitions. This
   paper examines the relationship between efforts made by EU structures
   and organizations at national level towards an Open Data society, as to
   a Data Driven economy, in which real time access to knowledge allows
   consumers to find out almost immediately everything they can about what
   they buy and how they can be protected against frauds of all sorts. The
   paper is highlighting the advantages of integrating technologies and
   digital standards in public politics for protecting consumer rights.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses a diagnostic of the uses of educational
   technology in school and teacher training as well as proposals for
   future use in schools and training centers. It is diagnosed the
   significant penetration of ICT in everyday life is valued and how to
   take advantage of this school designed as a community where his teachers
   collaborate. It aims a school committed to procedures of informal
   learning that encourage ICT, network organization, openness to
   ubiquitous learning and transformation of methodologies. It also aims to
   explore the role in another school of digital book, improvement of life
   in classrooms, to break his limits and rethink some principles from
   those of mass education. Initial and continuing teacher training in ICT
   is related to teaching transformation processes. A set of principles is
   proposed to generate transformations, such as research on learning,
   experimentation with new devices and software, reflection on educational
   principles and the transformation of pedagogical approaches, a new role
   to knowledge and its construction in classrooms, changing the status of
   the evaluation, another way to approach the teaching profession,
   commitment to new partners, management teams and institutions and the

Abstract = {{This article presents one of the studies from the European project
   IRNET, a network that pursues the development of new tools and methods

   digital Education and intercultural competences in teacher training, as
   well as innovative educational practices. Another objective of the
   project is also to identify such practises and/or research projects in
   order to foster intercultural and digital competences in Spain, Poland,
   Slovak, Portugal and Russia. From a comparative perspective and on a
   qualitative paradigm, we have analyzed three comparative units that have
   allowed, among other things, us to look at the impact of projects
   financed with European or national funds as promoters of change and
   innovation related to intercultural training and technologies
   information. Finally, it has been observed that teaching trends point to
   a professorship endowed with skills that integrate intercultural models
   from the joint search for the school of the future, and for that online
   networks and virtual learning communities are key resources.}},

   accommodating individual styles}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{310-328}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of
   the multi-source book review system (MBRS). MBRS was designed to reduce
   information overload using the internet and to accommodate different
   learner preferences.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors experimentally compared MBRS
   with the Google search engine. MBRS first gathers reviews from online
   sources, such as bookstores and blogs. It reduces information overload
   through an advanced filtering and sorting algorithm and by providing a
   uniform user interface. MBRS accommodates different learning styles
   through various sort options and through adding video-mediated reviews.
   Findings - Results indicate that, compared with Google, MBRS: reduces
   the information overload associated with searching for online book
   reviews; increases users finding satisfactory book reviews; and allows
   users to find reviews more quickly. In addition, more than half of the
   participants found video-mediated book reviews more appealing than
   traditional text-based reviews.
   Research limitations/implications - Future studies might examine the
   effects of other recommendations or sorting methods to fit individual
   preferences in a more dynamic way.
   Practical implications - This study assisted readers with a preference
   for visual information in locating reviews of personal interest in less
   time and with finding reviews more aligned with their individual
   learning preferences.
   Originality/value - This study documents an innovative web site
   featuring video-mediated book reviews and other mechanisms to
   accommodate individual preferences. Search engine designers could
   integrate book reviews with different media types to reduce cognitive
   load allowing readers to focus attention on the reading task. Internet
   booksellers or library staff may use this as an effective means to
   enhance reading motivation.}},

   social innovation in Europe. In order to understand this rapidly
   developing if little known area, a visual and interactive survey was
   made in order to crowd-source a map of digital social innovation,

Abstract = {{Digital society has brought deep changes affecting communication as a
   field. Thanks to social networks any person can turn into a content
   generator and, in this context, companies have no other choice but to
   participate, in one way or another, selecting, sharing and managing
   information not generated by themselves. This study intends to analyze
   how platforms 2.0 transform into communication channels for Spanish
   fashion brands; in order to do so we propose the assessment of digital
   communication conducted by the three major Spanish corporations in the
   sector economically speaking. Beginning with interactions and messages'
   appraisal, we offer an in-depth analysis on the use of social media in
   generating a positive discourse that can attract today's active and
   participatory user, and on the efforts for creating communities as
   feedback spaces in a clear attempt to find innovative ideas and to
   achieve a strategic positioning within the market.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusion in the 80s in Spain of the computer in professional design
   practice has unquestionably changed the profession, the way of seeing
   and does design. But the Internet has been the factor that has given a
   final twist to every profession and society in general. This has led to
   the emergence of a hyper-connected society and a global economy. For the
   same reason the professionals have had to train their digital skills to
   be competitive in the new global era. In this research, taking as a
   reference document the DIGCOMP report (Ferrari, 2013), we understand to
   be competent not only involves digital technological mastery also
   includes the ability to handle safely and critical attitude in the use
   of ICT. As a teacher of an educational design center prompted me to
   investigate whether, as trainers of future professionals were prepared
   to instruct them in the required level of digital competence. This study
   aims to analyze the degree of digital literacy into higher education
   faculty of design, and how is present in the curriculum of the
   bachelor's degree in design. Bau Design College of Barcelona, High
   College of Design of Barcelona is studied. The results show that
   although as professionals in assets they use technology to the
   development of their work and the relationship with clients, few ones
   are conscious of the need to train students in these digital skills.
   There is a need for training in these skills in the teaching of design,
   should be encouraged to digital competence be an aspect to work in the
   curriculum of the various subjects and for the educational use of
   technology innovation contribution to design education. A need of
   training exists in these competences in the teaching of design, which
   must be encouraged to digital competence is an aspect to work in the
   curriculum of the diverse subjects and the pedagogic use of the
   technology brings innovation to the education of the design}},

Abstract = {{Public sector organisations seem to be embracing social media for
   information dissemination and engagement, but less is know about their
   value as information sources. This paper draws from the notion of the
   imagined audience to examine how policy teams in the UK Department of
   Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) conceptualise the value of
   social media input. Findings from a series of interviews and workshops
   suggest that policy makers are broadly positive about sourcing useful
   input from social media in topics like farming and environmental
   policies, however audience awareness emerges as an important limitation.
   As different groups of the public use social media for professional
   activities, policy makers attempt to develop their own capacities to
   navigate through audiences and understand whom they are listening to.
   The paper makes suggestions about the technical, methodological and
   policy challenges of overcoming audience limitations on social media.}},

Abstract = {{The paper uses a longitudinal case study of Italy's digital agency to
   investigate eGovernment and a subject that hovers at the far edge of the
   academic radar: agencification, or the setting up of semi-autonomous
   organisations that operate at arm's length from the relative ministry.
   The aim is to make a threefold contribution of international scope and
   significance to the eGovernment debate by mapping Italy's chosen path to
   public-sector innovation. Framing the country's digital agenda within
   the larger picture of ongoing New Public Management-driven
   administrative reforms, the authors assess whether mandating an arm's
   length body to steer the eGovernment strategies at public-sector macro
   level has been successful. The structural-instrumental, cultural and
   environmental lens used to analyse the key contextual factors shows how
   the continuity and discontinuity that has shadowed Italy's ICT policies
   can be blamed on shifts in leadership and diverse ideas of
   modernization; on the digital agency's multiple, even conflicting
   mandates; and on the misalignment of the `original agency model' with
   the public machinery's embedded culture.}},

Abstract = {{Collaboration between the public and the private sector is seen as an
   instrument to make governance smarter, more effective, and more
   efficient. However, whereas there is literature on public-private
   collaboration, very little of it addresses how these collaborations can
   be shaped to make use of the huge potential that technological
   innovations in ICT may offer. To address this gap, this paper addresses
   public-private collaborative development of digital information
   infrastructures (IIs). Drawing on a combination of literature on
   public-private partnerships and on digital information systems or
   infrastructures, this paper studies an initiative for exchanging
   information among international trade supply chain partners and between
   the businesses and government (e.g. for declarations, compliance, border
   control). Specifically, it explores what would be the Dutch end of such
   an II, to understand the interplay between the technological innovation
   and partnerships that form the social context thereof.}},

   by considering the role it plays in the creation of life chances.
   Several ideal types are developed to better understand the
   transformations that middle classes have undergone in the digitizing
   sociality. When digital technologies are applied in the innovative
   process of fusing global market-related opportunities and individual
   resources, the middle classes set in motion a complex interplay of
   action and reverse action between contextual and personal potentials,
   thus digitally creating new life chances.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Humanities (DH) has been depicted as an innovative engine for
   humanities, as a challenge for Data Science, and as an area where
   libraries, archives and providers of e-research infrastructures join
   forces with research pioneers. However DH is defined, one thing is
   certain: DH is a new community which manifests and identifies itself via
   the Internet and social media. In this paper we propose to describe DH
   as a virtual community (VC), and discuss the implications of such an
   epistemic approach. We start with a (re) inspection of the scholarly
   discourse about VCs, and the analytic frameworks which have been applied
   to study them. We discuss the aspects that are highlighted by taking
   such a stance, and use the guidelines proposed by the FP7 European
   Network of Excellence in Internet Science (EINS) in our investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) has evolved as one of the most
   dangerous and ``undetectable{''} digital security deception methods. The
   complexity of this approach (combined with the intricate function of the
   fast-flux ``botnet{''} networks) is the cause of an extremely risky
   threat which is hard to trace. In most of the cases it should be faced
   as zero-day vulnerability. This kind of combined attacks is responsible
   for malware distribution and for the infection of Information Systems.
   Moreover it is related to illegal actions, like money mule recruitment
   sites, phishing websites, illicit online pharmacies, extreme or illegal
   adult content sites, malicious browser exploit sites and web traps for
   distributing virus. Traditional digital security mechanisms face such
   vulnerabilities in a conventional manner, they create often false alarms
   and they fail to forecast them. This paper proposes an innovative fast
   and accurate evolving Smart URL Filter (eSURLF) in a Zone-based Policy
   Firewall (ZFW) which uses evolving Spiking Neural Networks (eSNN) for
   detecting algorithmically generated malicious domains names.}},

Journal = {{TRAVAIL HUMAIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},

Pages = {{165-189}},
Abstract = {{Gamification deals with new human-machine interaction design practices.
   It consists of elements which are inspired from videogames, with the
   hope that this relationship which is designed to be more hedonic,
   engaging and motivating, will lead to positive changes within
   human-machine interactions, especially when applied to work practices
   and productivity matters. In this article, we present a synthesis of
   that notion, paralleled with ergonomics, concerning its definition and
   its design. We first draw a definition from the gamification literature.
   It can be considered as the use of game elements in generally digital
   non-gaming systems which are adapted to the users' profiles in order to
   generate motivation and engagement, with a focus on pleasurable
   experiences, even fun ones. We also mention the context of emergence of
   gamification. We then define and illustrate gamification design.
   Afterwards, this paper highlights critical factors which could help the
   ergonomist to participate in the design of efficient and satisfactory
   gamified systems. We then broaden this discussion to analyze the core
   meaning of gamification at work: the promise of flourishing and
   engagement through innovative interactions, as well as the production of
   coopetitive knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{There is at present, that dictate the order of technologies work and
   manual labour is increasingly replaced by machines-in turn, increasingly
   autonomous and intelligent. In this contemporary era digital - digital
   culture, also known as the computer age and the convergence of
   technology and devices, the information and communication technologies -
   ICT and digital technologies of information and communication-TDIC are
   present in good part, both at work and in the classroom and between
   various moments and situations of the people. It is understood that the
   20th century was the scene of the revolution in the field of
   communications, which, in conjunction with three factors
   microelectronics, computers and telecommunications, no doubt provide
   close relations and greater understanding between the peoples, as well
   as harmonise borders by the virtual world. With that, the education was
   and is the main factor for the development of a nation and to the
   international competitiveness of a country. Soon, ICTs promote
   innovation within education and training, access to information and be
   able to decide them to generate knowledge. So, for the training of
   teachers and students in higher education, the present text, the
   bibliographical research, empirical experience and the experience during
   the master's program in the graduate program in Digital Television from
   UNESP/Bauru-SP With this, it was possible to observe and experience that
   ICT increasingly disseminate the information, but you must construct the
   knowledge - not every information generates knowledge. This construct is
   given by the faculty to be prepared for use by media access and

Abstract = {{Higher education institutions have acknowledged the importance of social
   networks for multiple purposes, such as exploring innovative mechanisms
   for teaching-learning processes, colonizing new social communication
   channels and strengthening their institutional brand. The primary aim of
   this study was to identify the impact of various post formats on digital
   engagement in the context of the Facebook pages of some of the most
   important Mexican universities. It likewise sought to evaluate the use
   that universities made of each format. A quantitative methodology was
   used to analyse 31,590 content units posted by 28 universities,
   resulting in a total of 1,270,621 likes, 252,399 shares, and 80,620
   comments on their respective Facebook pages. The study found that: a)
   there is a statistically significant relationship between a post's
   format and the digital engagement it generates; b) while links are the
   least conducive format for boosting digital engagement, they are also
   the most frequently used; and c) although images usually boost digital
   engagement the most, only 18\% of the studied universities chose this
   format first.}},

Title = {{Uplifting Citizens' Participation: A Gov 2.0 Conceptual Framework}},

Note = {{15th European Conference on eGovernment (ECEG), Univ Portsmouth,

Abstract = {{The rise of digital citizens is no longer a speculation; therefore,
   governments' use of Web 2.0 tools (hereafter Gov 2.0) should be a part
   of all current and future e-government plans. Recent literature has
   emphasised Gov 2.0 as a possibility for greater communication,
   participation, and collaboration with citizens. However, citizens'
   participation levels in Gov 2.0 have not met to the hype. Despite their
   importance and potential, our understanding of the value of Gov 2.0 is
   limited. Systematic studies addressing citizens' participation in Gov
   2.0 are sparse. In the absence of prior work, this paper uses
   empowerment theory in a new context (Gov2.0) and investigates the role
   of citizens' empowerment in increasing citizens' participation in Gov
   2.0. We conducted an extensive review of e-government and empowerment
   literature, in order to form a sound theoretical explanation of this
   phenomenon. This paper seeks to identify factors derived from
   empowerment theory that influence citizens' participation in Gov 2.0 to
   develop a conceptual framework to enhance understanding of citizens'
   participation in Gov 2.0. Further, the paper extends the theory of
   empowerment by showing that higher levels of satisfaction and
   empowerment can increase citizens' participation in Gov 2.0. A further
   positive outcome of citizens' empowerment is higher levels of
   satisfaction with Gov 2.0. Three constructs have been found to influence
   citizens' participation in Gov 2.0, namely, citizens' empowerment
   process, citizens' empowerment outcomes, and citizens' satisfaction with
   Gov 2.0. Our conceptual framework indicates that these three constructs
   should feature and enhance trust, satisfaction, and commitment; and the
   outcomes lead to increased citizen loyalty, and higher participation
   levels in Gov 2.0. These suggestions make a strong case for citizens'
   empowerment in Gov 2.0 to enhance the public value. The framework is
   expected to benefit both citizens and government agencies that wish to
   enhance their Gov 2.0 activities. Citizens will enjoy a higher sense of
   control, including having an equal relationship with the government
   agency. Government agencies decision-makers can benefit from new
   insights into citizens' participation and enhanced citizen experiences.
   This paper is expected to make two significant contributions: (1)
   extension of empowerment theory and its role in increasing citizens
   participation in Gov 2.0; and (2) provide a framework for better
   understanding of citizens' participation in Gov 2.0. Both, preliminary
   evidence for the framework and general implications for research are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of benchmarking as a tool for learning, information
   sharing, and goal setting or supporting performance management has been
   recognized since the 1980, but it is mainly from the 2000s that
   benchmarking in e-Government issue has received growing interest.
   International e-Government Benchmarks has supported policy makers,
   provoking valuable discussions, setting new ambitions and identifying
   countries to learn from. Nonetheless, benchmarking studies in the field
   of e-Government at international level are mostly based on models
   measuring online services in terms of availability and sophistication.
   Hence, after 10 years a transformation would be welcome to set a new
   generation of e-Government services, since it is important to understand
   and measure the change in users' needs and how actually governments are
   exploiting the benefits of e-Government. International e-Government
   Policies aim at facilitating the transition of current Administrations
   to a new generation of e-Government projects at local, regional,
   national and international levels, improving Public Administration
   efficiency and effectiveness, while maximising the advantages deriving
   from ICT for both Administration and its users. The aim of the paper is
   to propose a two-step e-Government maturity framework able first to
   compare different Countries, Areas or Cities, among defined maturity
   performances and then to understand the impact of context-specific
   variables on that maturity, in order to support policy makers decisions.
   Referring to the first step, e-Government maturity can be summarized
   through four different dimensions: i) penetration, in terms of usage of
   online e-Government services; ii) process digitalization, in terms of
   Public Administrations ability to produce efficiency and effectiveness
   in internal procedure and services supply; iii) user's satisfaction of
   online services, both in terms of overall evaluation of the experience
   and comparing it with expectations and objectives; iv) standardization,
   which means quality of services in terms of usability features, which
   allows ease to learn of services, minimizing services accessibility
   barriers. Nevertheless, undertaking an e-Government project, could have
   different meanings in different contexts and a Public Administration
   investing in e-Government generally has more medium-term objectives,
   such as gaining efficiency or increase the quality of services; thus
   e-Government maturity is affected by different factors and can have
   different meanings depending on the specific referring context Therefore
   the second step involves a cross analysis on context-specific factors,
   in order to understand relative performances of single Administration
   analysed taking into account exogenous factors in putting those
   performances in the right perspective. The first performance benchmark
   is translated into a more specific analysis in order to understand: i)
   the impact of a specific context on e-Government maturity performances;
   ii) the differences between context of countries belonging to the same
   performance cluster; iii) the differences between countries with the
   same context but belonging to different performance clusters. This
   in-depth context framework allows to identify relevant considerations
   and implications, describing the state and the evolution of each life
   event and the e-Government analysed service. The conclusions, anchored
   to the high level political priorities, allow each Country (or Areas, or
   Cities) to identify different policies, specific to their context, to
   achieve strategic objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Fragment of an educational program on the basis of online-monitoring of
   the power quality parameters is discussed.
   The future of electric power is smart grid, one of it's main parts is
   smart substation. To date, there is a decrease in consumption of
   electricity in three-phase networks with linear loads of 6-10 kV and
   increased consumption in single-phase 0.4 kV networks. Because the
   active introduction of power electronic equipment (TV, computers,
   servers, compact fluorescent and LED bulbs, office equipment, etc.) is
   the emergence of higher harmonics in the 0.4 kV networks. Higher
   harmonics cause additional energy losses in distribution transformers
   and wires. These new trends require innovations in engineering
   education.
   On the working distribution transformer substation 7000kVA RTP-34 at
   Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI), there is a comprehensive
   system for onlinemonitoring of electric power quality parameters using
   these parameters in the educational process via the Internet. Remote
   access via the Internet to the actual industrial equipment has allowed
   to create a fundamentally new infrastructure of the educational process.
   Monitoring system provides power quality control and digital fault
   recording solutions.
   At common coupling points RTP-34 measure electrical parameters on the
   high side -10kV (12 voltages, 42 currents) and low side -0.4 kV (15
   voltages, 99 currents). The measured instantaneous values of voltages
   and currents of the three phases are calculated values of the total and
   active power, quality factors and other parameters according to IEC
   61000-4-30: 2015 standard. Performed spectral analysis of voltage and
   current harmonics up to the fortieth. Evaluated the contribution of
   individual harmonics in the level of additional losses in the phase and
   neutral conductors is done by special `` harmonic calculator{''}.
   Monitoring system allows us to calculate the additional losses in the
   power transformer. The effectiveness of the active filter is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Histological dissection of human tissue has relied on conventional
   procedures, which have largely remained unchanged for decades. Practices
   to determine measurement parameters employed in these procedures have
   largely relied on the use of rulers and weighing scales. It is well
   documented in the scientific literature that both fixation and
   processing of tissue can significantly affect the viability of the of
   tissue sections both for doctorial and immunocytochemical
   investigations. Both of these factors can be compounded in their
   negative effects by inappropriate sampling of tissue at histological cut
   up. There are five key factors to ensure good surgical grossing
   technique, flat uniformly perpendicular specimen cutting face,
   appropriate immobilisation of the tissue specimen during grossing, good
   visualisation of the cutting tissue face, sharp cutting knives and the
   grossing knife action. Meeting these factors implies the devices are fit
   for purpose. Here we describe an innovative approach to designing cut up
   devices to improve accuracy and precision, which take these five key
   requirements into consideration. The devices showed accuracy and
   precision, enabling tissue slices to be produced in a uniformly
   perpendicular fashion to within 2 mm in thickness and to enable
   consistency and reproducibility of performance across a series of tissue
   types. The application of a digital rule on one of these devices ensures
   accuracy and also enables quality control issues to be clearly assessed.
   As cellular pathology laboratories conform to ever increasing standards
   of compliance and performance in practice, the advent of assured
   precision and accuracy at cut up is awaited. Recommendations from
   accreditation bodies such as the United Kingdom Accreditation Service
   (UKAS) continue to push for improvements in this area of histological
   investigation. These newly designed devices may give the answers to
   these requirements and provide the impetus for a new generation of
   innovative equipment for histological dissection.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid advancement of the global optical disc industry results from
   systematic changes during the product life cycles of digital
   audio-visual technology. Compact discs (CD) and Digital Versatile Disc
   (DVD) sales reached record highs in 2004 and 2006 respectively, and the
   markets continue to shrink as CDs, DVDs, and related consumer electronic
   products have entered the mature stage of development following the
   entry of Blu-ray Disc(TM) (BD) products. This research explores the
   history, evolution, and systematic innovation driven by consumer demands
   for these products. The research provides a life cycle analysis of
   technology and market trends for the optical disc industry. Logistic
   curves are used to model the patent statistics and market values of DVD
   and BD technologies to document data trends from the mid-1990s till now.
   The results show that BD technology patent filings rapidly reached the
   decline point two years after DVD technology matured. The results also
   show that systematic innovation of optical disc technology is consumer
   demand driven with BD technology forecasted to replace DVDs in a very
   short period of time. Technology and market growth curves are used to
   model the entry times of DVDs and BDs into the mature stage of the
   product life cycle. The patent based forecasts indicate that new DVD
   entrants should be cautious since there will be decreasing economic
   benefits as the new BD technologies gain popularity and market share.
   The most valuable contribution of this research is the use of the
   quantitative logistic analytic techniques for technology forecasting
   incorporating both patent and marketing data. The methodology enables
   the integrated analysis of technology and marketing intelligence and can
   be applied to other industry domains and assist the allocation of
   research funding in their systematic innovation development.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a walkthrough of the geohazard risk assessment performed
   for the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) of a planned large-diameter
   natural gas pipeline, extending from Eastern Europe to Western Asia for
   a total length of approximately 1,850 km. The geohazards discussed
   herein include liquefaction-induced pipe buoyancy, cyclic softening,
   lateral spreading, slope instability, groundwater rise-induced pipe
   buoyancy, and karst. The geohazard risk assessment lifecycle was
   comprised of 4 stages: initially a desktop study was carried out to
   describe the geologic setting along the alignment and to conduct a
   preliminary assessment of the geohazards. The development of a
   comprehensive Digital Terrain Model topography and aerial photography
   data were fundamental in this process. Subsequently, field geohazard
   mapping was conducted with the deployment of 8 teams of
   geoprofessionals, to investigate the proposed major reroutes and delve
   into areas of poor or questionable data. During the third stage, a
   geotechnical subsurface site investigation was then executed based on
   the results of the above study and mapping efforts in order to obtain
   sufficient data tailored for risk quantification. Lastly, all gathered
   and processed information was overlain into a Geographical Information
   database towards a final determination of the critical reaches of the
   pipeline alignment. Input from Subject Matter Experts (SME) in the
   fields of landslides, karst and fluvial geomorphology was incorporated
   during the second and fourth stages of the assessment. Their experience
   in that particular geographical region was key to making appropriate
   decisions based on engineering judgment. As the design evolved through
   the above stages, the pipeline corridor was narrowed from a 2-km wide
   corridor, to a 500-m corridor and finally to a fixed alignment. Where
   the geohazard risk was high, rerouting of the pipeline was generally
   selected as a mitigation measure. In some cases of high uncertainty in
   the assessment, further exploration was proposed. In cases where
   rerouting was constrained, mitigation via structural measures was
   proposed. This paper further discusses the cost, schedule and resource
   challenges of planning and executing such a large-scale geotechnical
   investigation, the interfaces between the various disciplines involved
   during the assessment, the innovative tools employed for the field
   mapping, the classifications developed for mapping landslides, karst
   geology, and trench excavatability, determining liquefaction stretches
   and the process for the site localization of the Above Ground
   Installations (AGI). It finally discusses the objectives of the FEED
   study in terms of providing a route, a +/- 20\% project cost estimate
   and a schedule, and the additional engineering work foreseen to take
   place in the detailed engineering phase of the project.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Technological innovations in mining equipment have led to
   increased productivity and occupational health and safety (OHS)
   performance, but their introduction also brings new risks for workers.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide support for mining
   industry managers who are required to reconcile equipment choices with
   OHS and productivity.
   METHODS: Examination of the literature through interdisciplinary digital
   databases. Databases were searched using specific combinations of
   keywords and limited to studies dating back no farther than 1992. The
   ``snowball{''} technique was also used to examining the references
   listed in research articles initially identified with the databases.
   RESULTS: A total of 19 contextual factors were identified as having the
   potential to influence the OHS and productivity leverage of equipment
   innovations. The most often cited among these factors are the level of
   training provided to the equipment operators, operator experience and
   age, supervisor leadership abilities, and maintaining good relations
   within work crews.
   CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between these factors are not discussed in
   mining innovation literature. It would be helpful to use a systems
   thinking approach which incorporates interaction between relevant actors
   and factors to define properly the most sensitive aspects of innovation
   management as it applies to mining equipment.}},

Journal = {{JLIS.IT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-31}},
Abstract = {{RDA (Resource Description and Access) is going to promote a great
   change. In fact, guidelines - rather than rules - are addressed to
   anyone wishes to describe and make accessible a cultural heritage
   collection or tout court a collection: librarians, archivists, curators
   and professionals in any other branch of knowledge. RDA offers a ``set
   of guidelines and instructions to create data for discovery of
   resources{''}. Guidelines stress four actions - to identify, to relate
   (from FRBR/FRAD user tasks and ICP), to represent and to discover - and
   a noun: resource. To identify entities of Group 1 and Group 2 of FRBR;
   to relate entities of Group 1 and Group 2 of FRBR, by means of
   relationships. To enable users to represent and discover entities of
   Group 1 and Group 2 by means of their attributes and relationships.
   These last two actions are the reason of users' searches, and users are
   the pinpoint of the process. RDA enables the discovery of recorded
   knowledge, that is any resource conveying information, any resource
   transmitting intellectual or artistic content by means of any kind of
   carrier and media. RDA is a content standard, not a display standard nor
   an encoding standard: it gives instructions to identify data and does
   not care about how display or encode data produced by guidelines. RDA
   requires an original approach, a metanoia, a deep change in the way we
   think about cataloguing. Innovations in RDA are many: it promotes
   interoperability between catalogs and other search tools, it adopts
   terminology and concepts of the Semantic Web, it is a global standard,
   it can be applied by different agencies to create data. RDA is expected
   to be enriched by wide community of professional, from all the world, in
   a collaborative, well-aware, recognized and global perspective. By RDA,
   the great tradition of cataloguing goes one step further and joins the
   digital age definitively.}},

Abstract = {{Experience has shown that higher shutter speed or framing rate may cause
   signal drop out and the loss of the weak flame emission. On the other
   hand, slow shutter speed or frame rate will not be able to resolve the
   higher flame oscillation frequency. In this study, two synchronised high
   speed cameras are used to investigate the effect of camera shutter speed
   and frame rates on the colour imaging quality and oscillation frequency
   of a premixed methane flame. Through an innovative digital imaging
   enhancement technique, the weak blue flame colour pixels can be
   selectively enhanced for better visualisation and analysis. As a result,
   the same flame imaged at different shutter speed can be compared and
   contrasted with good accuracy. Test cases are carried out to provide
   better understanding of flame structure and dynamics. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Experts state that in this context of digital age and new economy, the
   consumer behaviour has changed substantially. The way how people think
   and decide about consumption is affected by elements specific to
   knowledge-based society: continuous innovation, new technologies and new
   ways of communication. The aim of this paperwork is to analyse the
   extent to which a model of buying behaviour created 40 years ago still
   can be relevant in the knowledge-based society and to identify the
   important changes inside the model. To achieve the goal of the paper, we
   use the results of a quantitative marketing research conducted among
   Romanian consumers regarding the purchasing behaviour of high-tech
   products. This market was chosen due to its special characteristics such
   as permanent innovation, adoption of product uncertainty, high financial
   risk. The main objective of this paper is to provide a range of
   solutions for manufacturers and sellers of high-tech products about the
   best ways of approaching, attracting and then retaining the current
   consumers which due to the availability of information in a digital age
   are able to change the fundamental rules of the game. Also, this paper
   aim to support academics interested in researching the consumer
   behaviour in the digital age since its understanding is a complex and
   lengthy process. The perceptions about lifestyle changed, many
   prejudices of social or moral terms have been removed, and thus the
   consumer's personal horizons widened. Also, the changes in professional
   and personal life occur more easily. Changes are happening faster and
   some more clear insight on consumer behaviour requires a continuous
   observation.}},

   specific training contents with the integrated of new technologies,
   especially those items that adequately support teachers to meet the
   diverse challenges of the information society (virtual environment for
   communication-collaboration, digital courses, e-learning platform
   www.istorie-geografie.ro). Teachers of history and geography covered by
   the project (5150 persons, from primary to upper secondary level, in 22
   counties) were instrumented on informational and methodological level
   (by 100 trainers in 138 training centers) by using a kind of integrated
   course: face-to-face, online self-study, evaluation, resources on a
   virtual platform. From the philosophy of the project, the option for the
   two training modules Curricular empowerment and Differential instruction
   is justified by the importance of the curriculum documents in classroom
   activities, on the one hand, and various training needs of the children,
   on the other hand. From the technical and technological competencies
   point of view by developing online platform for teachers of history and
   geography, belonging to curricular area of Man and Society, the project
   was able to propose and to put into practice an example of good
   educational practices, that may become a standard benchmark for

Abstract = {{The capital value of knowledge is fundamental in modern cyber-physical
   systems. The user is provided with information from multiple and
   sometimes conflicting sources. This large amount of information must
   then be analyzed and interpreted by the human brain. Information must be
   used in a profitable way, and transformed into useable knowledge, which
   can then be effectively used in decision making activities. It is
   therefore critical to provide the required information and knowledge in
   order to support digital factory activities such as modelling and
   simulation of manufacturing systems. The advent and implementation of
   Industry 4.0 will make it a requirement for virtual planning and real
   systems within smart factories, to interact and share large quantities
   of information with each other. In this respect, one of the major
   challenges is making sure that the right people have the right
   information, at the right time to make the right decisions. The aim of
   this research is to provide a multi-level just-in-time simulation tool
   to support decision making in digital factory planning. The tool makes
   use of a suitable means for the capturing and representation of
   manufacturing system knowledge in several types of industrial sectors
   and types of companies (large, SME). Furthermore, to support the
   modelling activity, the human-system interface of the simulation tool
   makes use of just-in-time information retrieval (JITIR). The aim of
   JITIR is to proactively yet non-intrusively provide the required
   information at the right time based on the users' context during the
   modeling and simulation activity. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The main challenges for companies in today's environment are an
   increased demand for customized products, shorter product life cycles
   and the resulting higher amount of variants. This leads to significant
   growth in existing production data. Additionally, improved ICT-systems
   and networks enable production planners to access a broader range of
   data, containing previous solutions and best practices and therefore the
   required knowledge and experience. Currently this knowledge and
   experience is not sufficiently used, as the process planning, work
   scheduling and route sheet generation is often a manual process, relying
   on the personal experience of the planner. This paper presents an
   approach to support the process planning with the help of an innovative
   method and corresponding digital tool. The digital tool gathers the
   master data records and numerical control code from previous products.
   It provides a library of attributes describing the products and the
   production processes. Through the employment of the developed method and
   digital tool, process planning can be sped up and standardize by
   eliminating or reducing manual search. Double work can be avoided. In
   total, the method and digital tool enable process planners to react
   faster and more accurately while gaining a competitive edge in dealing
   with the challenges on the global markets. (C) 2014 Published by

Title = {{Technology mentors: enablers of ICT uptake in Australian small business}},
Journal = {{EDUCATION AND TRAINING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{658-672}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on the innovative
   employment of students as technology mentors as part of a Blended
   Learning Program (BLP) that supported a group of owner-managers of small
   businesses to adopt appropriate information and communication
   technologies (ICT) to enhance their work practices.
   Design/methodology/approach - This discussion uses various evaluations
   undertaken throughout the project to examine why the technology mentor
   role is vital in supporting small businesses to develop digital
   literacies. The participants' self-reporting of their ICT skills as well
   as their progress in using ICT was also assessed by technology mentors
   in the course of the program and reported in mentor reflections.
   Academic staff also evaluated the performances of technology mentors in
   relation to each business.
   Findings - Participants in the BLP pilot program singled out the
   technology mentors as being essential in promoting their uptake of ICT
   and in their ability to use specific technologies at work.
   Research limitations/implications - Findings are based on a pilot
   program involving six learners and two technology mentors. While this is
   a statistically insignificant number of evaluations, both the findings
   and the model of the BLP remain of interest. This model has the capacity
   to address a long-standing and global challenge to support small
   businesses in the use of ICT. A scaled up version of the program is
   required to validate the findings.
   Practical implications - In the final evaluation, participants all
   self-assessed as having increased ICT knowledge and skills. They
   provided specific examples of how they now use ICT. The BLP could be
   taken up by local and state governments who periodically attempt to
   support small businesses in the uptake of technologies. The BLP could
   also be applied to vocational education students in business,
   information technologies or information systems. As well as supporting
   small businesses to adopt ICT, this model also provides an important
   alternative to resource-intensive work-placement programs that are
   designed to develop students' employability skills through
   work-integrated learning.
   Originality/value - Less effective attempts to support small businesses
   often involve face-to-face training for unrealistic periods of time that
   foreground technology rather than real world, useful and relevant
   outcomes (IBSA, 2013). This BLP successfully supported owner operators
   of small businesses to identify, apply and evaluate a range of software
   applications ({''}apps{''}) and online programs to enhance their work
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{The digital environment is taking over more and more of our present
   time, preparing challenging new horizons and leading the whole world to
   a new dimension, improving our lifestyle in all possible ways. As
   technology is more widespread as ever, as it comes to take over the way
   we act and react, the way we socialize, we communicate and we work
   together, it is important to see which its impact at the labour market
   level is. Therefore, in this research paper we aim to see how technology
   has developed the labour market in Romania, how it has influenced the
   level of salaries, the educational trends and which is its outcome for
   the economy. Using different statistical and econometrical methods, we
   want to build an inventory of the tech companies in Romania and their
   added value for the labour market. The data will be taken from the
   National Institute of Statistics, Eurostat, European Commission's
   studies and several private entities. In the end, our goal is to analyse
   whether the technology is one of the leading industries in Romania or we
   still need to catch up compared to other EU countries. Moreover, if
   technology has imposed itself as a main drive for the economy, we also
   want to study the sustainability of this situation. We want to propose a
   number measures for Romania in order to substitute some weak links of
   the economy with the tech industry, making it more stable, attracting
   the best human capital and relaxing economic measures, enabling
   education and innovation in this field. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to compile the teaching materials for
   education on college of commerce and management, and develop the
   corresponding digital learning achievement test and creativity test as
   evaluation mechanism. It aims to apply digital technology and the
   creative pedagogy to the curriculum of college of commerce and
   management at technology universities, in order to stimulate students'
   learning interests, learning initiatives, and critical thinking skills.
   This project is a three-year research plan and currently only the first
   year of the project was permitted and under engagement. This study
   compiled the digital-media teaching materials in the field of business
   administration, corresponding with the requirements of two courses
   ``Innovative Technology Management{''} and ``Cultural and Creative
   Industries Management{''}. The innovative pedagogy is applied to the two
   courses to achieve the main goal of developing student's problem-solving
   knowledge and abilities. The participants will be the junior students in
   the college of commerce and management at China University of Science
   and Technology. The two courses require students to download and preview
   the digital teaching materials from the WebDrive in advance of each
   class. There are activities of group discussion and achievement
   evaluation during each class to facilitate enhancing students' learning
   interests and learning effectiveness. Both group discussion and
   achievement evaluation are conducted once every three weeks and there
   are total six group discussions and six assessments in the 16-topic/week
   session. For course ``Innovative Technology Management{''}, the digital
   teaching materials cover topics of creativity theories and practices,
   commercial innovation models and innovative technology management. And
   course ``Cultural and Creative Industries Management{''} developed
   teaching materials of 16 units, and also held a ``project planning
   contest for local cultural roots{''} for the junior students to
   cultivate their creativity, integration and implementation capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{At present, the major hurdle to widespread deployment of zebrafish
   embryo and larvae in large-scale drug development projects is lack of
   enabling high-throughput analytical platforms. In order to spearhead
   drug discovery with the use of zebrafish as a model, platforms need to
   integrate automated pre-test sorting of organisms (to ensure quality
   control and standardization) and their in-test positioning (suitable for
   high-content imaging) with modules for flexible drug delivery. The major
   obstacle hampering sorting of millimetre sized particles such as
   zebrafish embryos on chip-based devices is their substantial diameter
   (above one millimetre), mass (above one milligram), which both lead to
   rapid gravitational-induced sedimentation and high inertial forces.
   Manual procedures associated with sorting hundreds of embryos are very
   monotonous and as such prone to significant analytical errors due to
   operator's fatigue. In this work, we present an innovative design of a
   micromechanical large particle in-flow sorter (MILPIS) capable of
   analysing, sorting and dispensing living zebrafish embryos for drug
   discovery applications. The system consisted of a microfluidic network,
   revolving micromechanical receptacle actuated by robotic servomotor and
   opto-electronic sensing module. The prototypes were fabricated in
   poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) transparent thermoplastic using
   infrared laser micromachining. Elements of MILPIS were also fabricated
   in an optically transparent VisiJet resin using 3D stereolithography
   (SLA) processes (ProJet 7000HD, 3D Systems). The device operation was
   based on a rapidly revolving miniaturized mechanical receptacle. The
   latter function was to hold and position individual fish embryos for (i)
   interrogation, (ii) sorting decision-making and (iii) physical sorting..
   The system was designed to separate between fertilized (LIVE) and
   non-fertilized (DEAD) eggs, based on optical transparency using infrared
   (IR) emitters and receivers embedded in the system. Digital oscilloscope
   were used to distinguish the diffraction signals from IR sensors when
   both LIVE and DEAD embryos were flow through in the chip. Image process
   analysis were also used as detection module to track DEAD embryos as it
   flowed in the channel.}},

Title = {{Enacting technology Accounting for the interplay between mHealth

Journal = {{INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE}},

Pages = {{442-465}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss implications of
   human-technology interaction in organizational change, especially where
   mobile phones are introduced to replace paper-based reporting.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs a case study approach,
   focusing on implementation of mobile technology for health (mHealth)
   solutions to support remote data communication, between health
   facilities and a district health office (DHO), in Malawi.
   Findings - The findings suggest that mobile phones are relevant to parts
   of multi-stage tasks such as data reporting, which comprise compilation,
   transportation, and digitization of data, and delivery of feedback.
   Consequently, innovation due to the introduction of mobile phones, is
   found in their interaction with other artefacts (paper, desktop
   computers, etc.), and existing paper-centric and emerging work
   practices.
   Research limitations/implications - Although lessons from this study
   could be transported across contexts, practitioners, and researchers
   should pay particular attention to contextual differences.
   Practical implications - In accounting for the mutual shaping between
   technology and context/work practices the paper demonstrates that
   mHealth innovation demands significant practical work.
   Originality/value - mHealth research is often preoccupied with
   capabilities of mobile devices. First, the authors account for
   interaction between artefacts, existing, and emerging use contexts, and
   the use process, at multiple levels of organization. Through this, the
   authors argue for a need to seriously consider idiosyncrasies of
   artefacts and tasks at hand, as well as distributed affordances across
   artefacts, in mHealth implementations. Second, the authors argue that
   contrary to the general focus on mobile phones as tools for supporting
   people on the move, their relevance might actually be found in reducing
   people's mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the medical information system is meeting many difficulties
   when conveying information via the network, such as leaking out the
   patients' information, falsifying medical records, and destroying the
   structure of medical images etc. For these questions, the new algorithm
   with ultra-strong robustness is proposed, its innovation lies in
   perfectly combining digital watermarking technology, which is the domain
   technology in information security area, the emerging perceptual Hash
   technology, the classical three-dimensional reconstruction technology,
   information encryption technology, and ``the third party{''}
   certification together. Firstly, it is important to preprocess the
   original watermarking by means of Arnold scrambling; secondly, to obtain
   the needed information by 3D-DFT, we utilize perceptual Hash function to
   stratify and reduce the dimensions, as well as compress the medical
   volume data into 8 X 8, then the visual feature vector will be gained
   after reconstructing the three-dimensional image, which is the result of
   3D-IDFT; ultimately, employing the bit operation of Hash function
   between the encrypted watermarking and visual feature vector, we can
   realize the embedding process. The experiments indicate that the
   approach is suitable for medical application because of its robustness.}},

Abstract = {{The system of time-to-digital conversion is based on the Field
   Programmable Gate Array (FPGA){[}1], compared with the TDC system
   existing now, the innovation of this design is can measure the width of
   the continue pulses. This system is designed on the Spartan-6 platform
   of the Xinlinx company. There are three modules included in this design,
   the coarse count measurement modules, exact measurement modules and the
   manage of the measured data module. The key and the difficult of this
   design are in the exact measurement module, it is measured by using the
   carry chain which is consisted by the slices, the slices in the
   Configurable Logic Blocks(CLBs), which are the main logic resources for
   implementing sequential as well as combinational circuits, and each CLB
   element contains a pair of slices. The measurement accuracy of this
   design is within 100ps, and the measurement dynamic range is
   flexibility, it is based on the bits of the register used in the design,
   the register used in this design is 32 bits, so the dynamic range can up
   to about four seconds.}},

Abstract = {{Whether sponsored by academic institutions, governments, international
   agencies, or private landowners, the results of archaeological
   investigations are the same: the production of knowledge and an
   accumulation of things. The material manifestations (artifacts and
   samples) and the accompanying daily notes, digital records, maps,
   photographs, and plans together comprise a comprehensive record of the
   past. Once these items have been amassed, they are deposited in dig
   houses, magazines, museums, repositories, storage containers, and
   sometimes in personal basements and garages to be held in perpetuity.
   Across the globe, storage (here implying curation and permanent care) is
   one of the most pressing issues facing archaeology today. The following
   examines the curation crisis and some of the traditional and innovative
   solutions to the storage wars, arguing that rather than something that
   is viewed as a time-consuming, costly afterthought; curation should be
   an integral part of archaeological praxis.}},

Abstract = {{No Considering color pallet of the buildings of every city, arouse a
   debate related to identity and aesthetics of urban environment. This
   debate is succeeded by researches about the color of cities, from
   limited hues of traditional city to numerous colors of modern city. The
   French Lenclos was the first one who after dedicating many years to the
   color subject, innovated a method of surveying color of cities; which is
   used by anyone who is researching in this field. This article after
   mentioning Lenclos' method of surveying color plan of cities, represents
   author's case study in color pallet of Lahijan. Author's method in this
   case study is a combination of digital photography and photo shop
   software along with Lenclos' method. Results (shown in a bar chart)
   confirm that although traditional color pallet of the city is still
   dominant, but it has some differences with citizens' opinion achieved by
   interviews and questionnaires.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years, numerical modelling has emerged as a useful tool for
   landslide runout analysis and risk assessment. Several of the developed
   models have included innovations that have significantly advanced both
   the ability to simulate real events and the understanding of rapid
   landslide processes. However, it is here evidenced that in both
   interpreting run-out results and evaluating numerical model performances
   a particular care is necessary. To this aim, the continuum-mechanics
   based code RASH3D is used to back-analyse the case of the Baio Dora
   debris flow. Carried-out analyses are intended to highlight the
   influence that some factors like (1) Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
   resolution; (2) rheological law; and (3) entrainment process can have on
   numerical results. In particular, it is observed that a low resolution
   DEM can make fail all the attempts of selecting and calibrating the more
   appropriate rheology. On the other side, the selection of a wrong
   rheology can give a unrealistic run-out path, that is the moving mass
   can go as far taking a completely incorrect flowing direction. Finally,
   it emerges that the entrainment of channel path material can
   significantly change the mobility of a flow, through rapid changes of
   both the flow volume and rheology.}},

Abstract = {{History is full of innovative researchers, such as; Aristotle, Newton
   and Einstien. This cumulative evolutionary of science has stimulated
   industrial activitiy and ultimately contributes to society. The
   publication of science also contributes to the body of collective
   knowledge and enables researchers to build on the success of its
   pioneers. A sequenced example of fundamental principles, by Orsted,
   Faraday and Maxwell, highlights the evolution of electromagnetic
   induction, from electric currents through to validated concepts
   associated with Electro-Magnetic Fields (EMF). This chapter documents
   innovative contributions representing advances in Knowledge-Based and
   Intelligent Information and Engineering System. New research recognises
   that society is familiar with modern AIP technology and documents how
   they routinely incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques into
   industrial applications. There is an increasing reliance on
   automatically processing declarative knowledge with less human input.
   Society has already digitised its past and continues to progressively
   automate knowledge management for future access by mobile systems. This
   book focuses on this trend and collectively discusses select topics.
   They are grouped into five categories that include: classifiers, data
   mining, knowledge management, AIP techniques and a number of models that
   can be used to solve industrial level problem. Each topic represents the
   state of art in research by innovative subject matter experts. All five
   categorise represent a broad spread of topics across the domain and
   highlight how research is being realised to benefit society. Students,
   professionals and interested observers within the knowledge-based and
   intelligent information management domain will benefit from the

Title = {{What Are Complex eHealth Innovations and How Do You Measure Them?
   Position Paper}},
Journal = {{METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: eHealth and innovation are often regarded as synonyms - not
   least because eHealth technologies and applications are new to their
   users. This position paper challenges this view and aims at exploring
   the nature of eHealth innovation against the background of common
   definitions of innovation and facts from the biomedical and health
   informatics literature. A good understanding of what constitutes
   innovative eHealth developments allows the degree of innovation to be
   measured and interpreted.
   Methods: To this end, relevant biomedical and health informatics
   literature was searched mainly in Medline and ACM digital library. This
   paper presents seven facts about implementing and applying new eHealth
   developments hereby drawing on the experience published in the
   literature.
   Results: The facts are: 1. eHealth innovation is relative. 2. Advanced
   clinical practice is the yardstick. 3. Only used and usable eHealth
   technology can give birth to eHealth innovatio. 4. One new single
   eHealth function does not make a complex eHealth innovation. 5. eHealth
   innovation is more evolution than revolution. 6. eHealth innovation is
   often triggered behind the scenes; and 7. There is no eHealth innovation
   without sociocultural change.
   Conclusions: The main conclusion of the seven facts is that eHealth
   innovations have many ingredients: newness, availability, advanced
   clinical practice with proven outcomes, use and usability, the
   supporting environment, other context factors and the stakeholder
   perspectives. Measuring eHealth innovation is thus a complex matter. To
   this end we propose the development of a composite score that expresses
   comprehensively the nature of eHealth innovation and that breaks down
   its complexity into the three dimensions: i) eHealth adoption, ii)
   partnership with advanced clinical practice, and iii) use and usability
   of eHealth. In order to better understand the momentum and mechanisms
   behind eHealth innovation the fourth dimension, iv) eHealth supporting
   services and means, needs to be studied. Conceptualising appropriate
   measurement instruments also requires eHealth innovation to be
   distinguished from eHealth sophistication, performance and quality,
   although innovation is intertwined with these concepts. The demanding
   effort for defining eHealth innovation and measuring it properly seem
   worthwhile and promise advances in creating better systems. This paper
   thus intends to stimulate the necessary discussion.}},

Abstract = {{Developed from art, computer digital color is a new subject integrating
   computer technology, graphics and color science, as well as an open
   system which is not limited in the a certain field. In artistic design
   field, color model, color domain and color application rely on the
   five-grade color table of digital color to obtain the more precise color
   performance, making the original complex, disorderly and blue
   traditional color matching become simple and orderly with distinct
   levels. Computer digital color also carries out color harmony and
   innovation of artistic design works from several angles, such as hue,
   brightness, tone and color mixing, greatly promoting the development of
   modern color science and opening up the broad prospects of the
   application of digital color in the artistic design industry.}},

   the other two currencies, by clarifying and comparing the concepts of
   electronic money, virtual currency and digital currency. Starting from
   the basic characteristics of digital currency, two controversial issues
   were reviewed and discussed, i.e. whether digital currency is
   trustworthy and will it become a real currency. Analysis indicates that
   the prospect of digital currency as a disruptive innovation should not
   be underestimated, but its healthy development cannot be guaranteed
   without recognition of the government and protection of laws, as well as
   compromising and integrating innovation with traditional financial
   system. Finally, the paper pointed out the current research directions

Title = {{Analyzing the Mobile ``Digital Divide{''}: Changing Determinants of
   Household Phone Ownership Over Time in Rural Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: We had a unique opportunity to examine demographic
   determinants of household mobile phone ownership in rural Bangladesh
   using socioeconomic data collected as part of a multiyear longitudinal
   cohort study of married women of reproductive age.
   Objectives: This paper explores how the demographics of household mobile
   phone owners have changed over time in a representative population of
   rural Bangladesh.
   Methods: We present data collected between 2008 and 2011 on household
   mobile phone ownership and related characteristics including age,
   literacy, education, employment, electricity access, and household
   wealth among 35,306 individuals. Respondents were enrolled when found to
   be newly pregnant and contributed socioeconomic information once over
   the course of the time period serving as a ``sample{''} of families
   within the population at that time. Univariate and multiple logistic
   regressions analyses were performed to identify the socioeconomic
   determinants of household phone ownership.
   Results: Across 3 fiscal years, we found that reported household
   ownership of at least 1 working mobile phone grew from 29.85\% in the
   first fiscal year to 56.07\% in the third fiscal year. Illiteracy,
   unavailability of electricity, and low quartiles of wealth were
   identified as overall demographic constraints to mobile phone ownership.
   However, over time, these barriers became less evident and equity gaps
   among demographic status began to dissipate as access to mobile
   technology became more democratized. We saw a high growth rate in
   ownership among households in lower economic standing (illiterate,
   without electricity, low and lowest wealth index), likely a result of
   competitive pricing and innovative service packages that improve access
   to mobile phones as the mobile phone market matures. In contrast, as
   market saturation is rapidly attained in the most privileged
   demographics (literate, secondary schooling, electricity, high wealth
   index), members of the lower wealth quartiles seem to be following suit,
   with more of an exponential growth.
   Conclusions: Upward trends in household mobile phone ownership in
   vulnerable populations over time underline the potential to leverage
   this increasingly ubiquitous infrastructure to extend health and finance
   services across social and economic strata.}},

   uses cost and learning theory to point to the means of growing producer

Abstract = {{Purpose: The paper describes the process of designing, manufacturing and
   design verification of the intervertebral of a new structure of lumbar
   disc endoprosthesis-INOP/LSP. 1101. Methods: Modern and noninvasive
   medical imagining techniques, make it possible to record results of
   tests in a digital form, which creates opportunities for further
   processing. Mimics Innovation Suite software generates three-dimensional
   virtual models reflecting the real shape and measurements of components
   of L4-L5 spinal motion segment. With the use of 3D Print technique,
   physical models of bone structures of the mobile segment of the spine as
   well as the INOP/LSP. 1101 endoprosthesis model were generated. A
   simplified FEA analysis of stresses in the endoprosthesis was performed
   to evaluate the designed geometries and materials of the new structure.
   Results: The endoprosthesis prototype was made of Co28Cr6Mo alloy with
   the use of selective laser technology. The prototypes were subject to
   tribological verification with the use of the SBT-03.1 spine simulator.
   Conclusions: The structure of the endoprosthesis ensures a full
   reflection of its kinematics, full range of mobility of the motion
   segment in all anatomical planes as well as restoration of a normal
   height of the intervertebral space and curvature of the lordosis.
   The results of the tribological tests confirmed that SLM technology has
   the potential for production of the human bone and joint-endoprostheses.}},

Abstract = {{Drugs used during anesthesia could enhance microvascular flow
   disturbance, not only for their systemic cardiovascular actions but also
   by a direct effect on the microcirculation and in particular on
   hemorheology. This is particularly important in high-risk surgical
   patients such as those with vascular disease (diabetes, hypertension,
   etc.). Therefore, in this work we propose a set of innovative parameters
   obtained by digital analysis of microscopic images to study the in vitro
   hemorheological effect of propofol and vecuronium on red blood cell from
   type 2 diabetic patients compared to healthy donors. Obtained innovative
   parameters allow quantifying alterations in erythrocyte aggregation,
   which can increase the in vivo risk of microcapillary obstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Online learning and flipped classroom models provide pedagogical
   challenges to instructors in developing a sense of community within
   digital learning environments. Although technology has made learning
   increasingly accessible, educators often struggle to find new and
   innovative teaching strategies to develop and sustain these flipped and
   blended digital communities. Flipped classes refer to providing students
   with work to do prior to the class session in order to familiarize them
   with the content, and then they are prepared to do collaborative work
   during class time. Following this preparation, the face to face classes
   enable students to work collectively to analyse and synthesize their
   understanding of the content. The development of meaningful
   collaborative learning environments in flipped, asynchronous and blended
   classes provides unique pedagogical challenges. Further to this, the
   term ``online learning{''} has increasingly divergent interpretations,
   and may include MOOCs, synchronous, asynchronous and many other
   modalities. With the emphasis on Personalized Learning Environments,
   educators are challenged to create digital pedagogy that allows for
   individualized learning, while facing the very real possibility of
   isolation and alienation from a distance learning community. This paper
   is a qualitative analysis of the development of these flipped
   collaborative learning environments in four undergraduate courses. The
   courses are delivered using a blended model of three hours flipped video
   podcasts and one hour synchronous Adobe Connect sessions. Adobe Connect
   is a video web-based tool where students have virtual classes using
   webcams in synchronous real time tutorial sessions. This paper
   chronicles how students from a variety of backgrounds developed
   meaningful learning relationships with one another. Based on principles
   of problem-based learning, students were challenged to build
   professional and personal connections with colleagues using
   predominantly a flipped, asynchronous classroom. Flipped classroom
   models provide accommodation for anywhere, anytime learning, and also
   can provide a greater selection of high quality courses, as well as the
   emergence of more engaging learning management applications. This
   qualitative, narrative inquiry clearly demonstrates the powerful use of
   `` Digital Moments{''} to inspire creativity, empowerment and a sense of
   community in digital learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{The need to diversify digital communications for a global twenty-first
   century has prompted many theorists to reimagine literacy teaching and
   learning. Although the new Australian curriculum acknowledges
   multimodality and multimodal texts, professional learning continues to
   privilege print-focused literacy. Utilizing a multiliteracies' and
   community of practice framework, this study scaffolded seven primary
   school teachers in critical and collaborative professional learning. A
   case study explored the teachers' evolving perspectives and knowledge
   work during monthly meetings in a multiliteracies book club. Drawing on
   a qualitative approach, this paper focuses on how the teachers, who were
   based in regional Western Australia, problematized conceptual and
   contextual issues. More broadly, the discussion highlights how the
   teachers perceived and (re) negotiated contradictory constructions of
   literacy and professional learning. Findings suggest that generating
   scaffolded spaces for-and-with teachers is important for innovation in
   professional literacy learning.}},

Abstract = {{New business models are emerging in the FMCG retail sector due to the
   wide diffusion of digital technologies; innovative tools - such as
   Pervasive Retailing Information Systems - are wide spreading all over
   the world aiming to increase customer loyalty and retailer performance.
   Furthermore, the recent mass diffusion of mobile technologies is also
   contributing to modify customer satisfaction towards the shopping
   process. In this context, new generations of self-service systems - i.e.
   mobile Self-Checkout Systems (mSCSs)- are becoming widely adopted by
   FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) retail companies: the aim is to both
   speed up the customer-shopping trip and increase customer satisfaction.
   A mSCS is a self-checkout system based on mobile technology.
   Traditionally, self-checkout systems have been applied to speed up the
   customer purchase process; impacts on retailer performance could also be
   evaluated in order to optimize labor force at store level. The paper
   proposes a comparison analysis about the application of different types
   of mSCSs at FMCG retail stores: the study will focus on analyzing
   quantitatively impacts on time based metrics both from the customer and
   the retailer points of view. The study will be helpful for practitioners
   in designing their own mSCS; furthermore, a structured model for
   evaluating potential impacts of innovative technologies at the retail
   sector as a result. Finally, a discrete-event simulation model has been
   developed to quantitatively compare different mSCSs in a case study.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to examine the impact of product innovation
   attributes (complexity, relative advantage, compatibility, trialability
   and observability) on brand equity, and whether these attributes exert a
   different effect on low-versus high-equity brands. The moderating role
   of consumer innovativeness in this relationship is investigated further.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on survey data from
   users of two brands of digital audio players of different brand equity
   levels.
   Findings - Overall, it was found that innovation attributes have an
   effect on brand equity, and this effect differs between low- dand
   high-equity brands, with a low-equity brand being benefited more than a
   high-equity brand from perceptions towards a product's innovation
   attributes. Additionally, it was found that the impact of complexity and
   relative advantage on brand equity increases when consumer
   innovativeness increases in the case of a high-equity brand. However, no
   significant difference was found between low- and high-equity brands
   regarding the proposed moderating effect of innovativeness.
   Research limitations/implications - The study only examines two brands
   belonging to one particular industry, which limits the findings'
   generalizability. Thus, the use of more test brands from different
   industries should be the goal for future research.
   Practical implications - Managers should consider the firm's current
   brand equity level and its competitive position to maximize the effect
   of product innovation attributes.
   Originality/value - The study makes an original contribution to the
   research on the relationship between product innovation and brand equity
   and provides theoretical and managerial implications in the field of
   innovation and brand management.}},

Abstract = {{The public construction sector has recently started to put more effort
   into cost savings and improvement of efficiency. Therefore, public
   clients have started to promote new strategies, embracing innovative
   approaches such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and
   e-Procurement. Tendering plays a key role for the success of the overall
   process; however, the selection of the best contractor is still a
   difficult task. The paper investigates how tendering can be integrated
   with Model Checking in order to control the compliance between the
   client's requirements and bidders' offers within a digital environment.
   The research shows that, although the BIM is still not widely adopted in
   tendering procedures, Model Checking tools are already available to
   support the jury, as well as bidders. Moreover, even though BIM can be
   implemented in several procurement procedures, it is more effective if a
   collaborative and integrated behaviour is promoted. Results can help
   increase public clients' awareness of the limits and potentials of an
   innovative approach and to set BIM requirements and guidelines. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Building Information Modeling (BIM) has proven its value for design in
   the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. However,
   currently only a few leading firms succeed in reaping the full potential
   of BIM. Especially, specialist designers remain excluded from innovative
   practices. Reasons include the technical hurdles of BIM adoption and a
   misfit between human agency versus the affordances of BIM. Not all
   designers have the capabilities required to actively partake in BIM.
   Thus, BIM practice is often `messy' and characterized by a large degree
   of unnecessary rework and workarounds. ``How and why digital workarounds
   unfold in BIM design?{''} is at the core of the inquiry reported in this
   paper. Based on a `fresh' theoretical approach entitled Theory of
   Workarounds, we explicate the nature of BIM related workarounds. The
   industrial setting involves an office refurbishment project in Oslo,
   Norway. Many specialist designers remained excluded from BIM in this
   project and a range of different workarounds have been conducted. We
   portray how and why digital workarounds happened. This provides valuable
   learning for researchers and practitioners interested in digital
   workarounds in construction. We contribute to better understanding of
   messy practices surrounding BIM and to drawing the attention of scholars
   to workarounds as an area in need of further research. Lastly, our work
   constitutes an early application of Alter's Theory of Workarounds in the
   setting of a construction project. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The modern digital revolution that encompasses the computers,
   connectivity, data, iPhones and internet, is both disruptive and
   divisive. It is disruptive because it can and has displaced millions of
   workers. It is divisive because it divides those who are experienced and
   technology-savvy from those who are just experienced. The former will
   have promising career options and business opportunities while the
   latter will see their experience and their jobs replaced by intelligent
   technology. This disruption and division will significantly impact the
   emerging markets. Take for example, Foxconn, an icon of Chinese
   manufacturing, at its height of its production employed 1.5 million
   workers to assemble electronics. With the rising cost of labour and
   falling cost of automated manufacturing, it has since replaced workers
   with robots. China's path of progress will see more companies similar to
   Alibaba that recently made a spectacular debut on the New York Stock
   Exchange that employs only about 20,000 people.}},

Title = {{``The tablet is on the table!{''} The need for a teachers'
   self-hetero-eco technological formation program}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LEARNING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{209-220}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The Federal Government has begun distributing tablets to
   teachers in public schools in Brazil. However, no preparation was
   provided to guide professionals on how to use them for pedagogical
   purposes. As a result, teachers have been carrying tablets around or
   leaving them alone on their classroom tables. Considering this
   situation, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the possibility of
   adopting a ternary conception of formation processes - the
   self-hetero-eco formation process - to help teachers learn how to use
   tablets for educational purposes; and on the potential of such a process
   to congregated teachers in the joint creation and maintenance of a
   Didactic Digital Material/App Data Bank.
   Design/methodology/approach - Theoretically, this paper is grounded on
   complexity principles (Morin, 2008, 2010), and especially on the studies
   made by Moraes (2007), Freire (2009) and Freire and Leffa (2013).
   Findings - The movement of perceiving each teacher as responsible for
   his/her formation (personalization), interacting with others to expand
   possibilities, co-constructing knowledge to reach co-formation
   (socialization), and interacting with the environment with/from which
   s/he learns (ecoligization) will reveal the self-hetero-eco
   technological formation process which may help teachers create steady
   links amongst themselves at school and resolve many difficult situations
   such as the need to overcome the lack of technological skills to use
   tablets. Besides that, the idea of joining teachers together and jointly
   creating and maintaining a Didactic Digital Material/App Data Bank may
   not only impact on the use of the tablet itself but also on
   interpersonal relationships, intensifying respect, companionship and
   friendship, among other important ties that help bind people together.
   Originality/value - This paper presents an innovative formation concept
   which is not based on time development, but which is based on the agents
   involved in the process and in the environment where the formation takes
   place. This concept is based on complexity and seems to be more attuned
   to the features of the contemporary world.}},

Title = {{The Informational World City London}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{834-864}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The Department of Information Science of the
   Heinrich-Heine-University in Dusseldorf is currently conducting a
   research project on Informational World Cities - the prototypical cities
   of the knowledge society, which have been growing in the twenty-first
   century. In total, 31 potential Informational World Cities were
   identified and a set of criteria was developed to evaluate the degree of
   informativeness of a city through coherent criteria. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate London.
   Design/methodology/approach - The investigation was based on the
   Grounded Theory, ethnographic field research, interviews, bibliometrics,
   patentometrics, official statistics and the analysis of web content.
   During the stay in London, eight semi-standardised interviews according
   to SERVQUAL were conducted.
   Findings - The characteristics of an Informational World City are
   well-marked in most cases, especially London's knowledge infrastructure.
   Furthermore London places value on smart innovations and tries to adapt
   public transport to the growing population. This includes, next to an
   enhancement of the train capacities, information and communication
   technology, since the digital infrastructure keeps gaining importance.
   The ethnic/cultural diversity as well as the international connectivity
   and the creative infrastructure are also distinguishing marks of London.
   Nevertheless, especially the digital and smart infrastructure require
   enhancement. London's government is ambitioned, though, to make progress
   and pursues plans which are of benefit to the city's informativeness.
   Social implications - This paper gives insight into the characteristics
   of the prototypical city of the upcoming knowledge society.
   Originality/value - This paper follows an interdisciplinary approach and
   combines information science, urban studies and sociology to analyse
   cities of the knowledge society. Furthermore it is the first time that
   London is considered an Informational World City in an empirical study.}},

Abstract = {{The OER movement has tended to define ``openness{''} in terms of access
   to use and reuse educational materials, and to address the geographical
   and financial barriers among students, teachers and self-learners with
   open access to high quality digital educational resources. MOOCs are the
   continuation of this trend of openness, innovation, and use of
   technology to provide learning opportunities for large numbers of
   learners. In the last years, the amount of Open Educational Resources on
   the Web has increased dramatically, especially thanks to initiatives
   like OpenCourseWare and other Open Educational Resources movements. The
   potential of this vast amount of resources is enormous. In this paper an
   architecture based on Semantic Web technologies and the Linked Data
   guidelines to support the inclusion of open materials in massive online
   courses is presented. Linked Data is considered as one of the most
   effective alternatives for creating global shared information spaces, it
   has become an interesting approach for discovering and enriching open
   educational resources data, as well as achieving semantic
   interoperability and re-use between multiple Open Educational Resources
   repositories. The notion of Linked Data refers to a set of best
   practices for publishing, sharing and interconnecting data in RDF
   format. Educational repositories managers are, in fact, realizing the
   potential of using Linked Data for describing, discovering, linking and
   publishing educational data on the Web. This work shows a data
   architecture based on semantic web technologies that support the
   discovery and inclusion of open educational materials in massive online
   courses in engineering education. The authors focus on a type of
   openness: open of contents as regards re-use and re-mix, i.e. freedom to
   reuse the material, to combine it with other materials, to adapt and to
   share it further under an open license.}},

Abstract = {{Today, as virtually everyone considers himself of herself a
   photographer, the commercial photography industry experiences a
   ``suicide-cutthroat competition{''}. Both large photography agencies and
   small photography studios have to lower their prices to survive within
   the industry. Such a cutthroat competition will doom to lead to the
   decline of image quality in the photography. Under such a vicious
   competition, due to lacking innovation ability and policy response, many
   photography agencies have closed down, and the rest still struggle to
   keep their heads above water. As to the digital art photography, various
   photographies enter to the picture market, thus leading to the phenomena
   of immature creative ideas and poor connotation of works from another
   side. Image product is the nourishment for the mind for the majority of
   people and is especially favored by most teenagers. We need to
   strengthen the management for content of image product, especially the
   examination for imported content. Strictly strike and completely
   eradicate illegal business, increase the protection for intellectual
   property of image derivatives, maintain healthy market order, build good
   development environments, perfect the development mechanism of the whole
   image industry, and facilitate the benign development of image industry.}},

   These data include results from both 2002 and 2010. The profit pool
   observations are then compared with additional data on intangible assets

   ggrevenue and/or profitability and competitive intelligence activity may
   be generally weak (though pronounced in some specific high-growth

Abstract = {{The scope of this study is set to examine the current disruptive
   revolution in software industries caused by digitalisation and
   globalisation, which is altering how knowledge work and related sourcing
   network is organised. This transformation profoundly affects the
   evolution of ICT products and services and the ways intellectual capital
   assets are used and organised as well as how knowledge work in diverse
   teams, different organisations and sourcing networks is conducted. The
   acquisition, creation and sharing of collective intelligence through
   social networks and knowledge communities are crucial factors for
   success and will be investigated through the study of distributed teams
   involved in software development (SD). The objectives of the DD-SCALE
   programme presented in this paper are to acquire knowledge about the
   competencies and tools of SD companies in assessing knowledge work
   operations, especially when they use comprehensive evaluation systems,
   create new work practices and manage dynamic distributed sourcing
   network operations in global value constellations. Concerning the
   practical outcomes the study aims to create a new scalable framework for
   evaluating the efficiency and performance of SD work taking place on
   multisite settings-this will lay the groundwork for the DD-SCALE.
   Secondly, the experience and knowledge gained by using of performance
   measurement tools and new work practices should allow the development of
   managerial methods and practices for use by those company
   representatives responsible for maintaining a company's expert skills
   and competencies. Thirdly, the work expertise practices that are
   implemented in collaboration with participating companies will provide
   guidance to international knowledge work settings and help to analyse
   offshoring, nearshoring and onshoring decisions in global value
   networks. Case evidence from the challenges the four leading Finnish SD
   companies face will be introduced. The selected case companies are
   leaders in their industry and possess high-performing software teams
   that are focused on scaling up their operational excellence and
   innovation performance in new distributed settings in order to sustain
   competitive advantage. DD-SCALE is a co-creation research programme that
   has funding from 2014 to 2016 to concentrate on company-specific
   development projects. The programme combines the knowledge and ability
   of three academic institutes, four SD companies and the leading Finnish
   technology and innovation funding agency, Tekes, in the desire to
   improve their performance in global SD work. The programme will also
   assist in formatting industrial policy settings to improve the Finnish
   ICT sector's understanding of SD's changing sourcing environment, detect
   their competencies in executing this work in different work settings and
   enable dynamic sourcing through multiple sites.}},

Abstract = {{Intellectual Capital (IC) is valuable knowledge for an organization
   composed of human capital, organizational (structural) capital, and
   relational capital. IC includes not only intellectual property such as
   trademarks, patents and copyrights, but also the company's global
   knowledge, experience, relationships, processes, innovations, market
   presence and community influence. Due to the intangible nature of IC, it
   is very difficult to fix a price tag on a specific piece of knowledge.
   In fact, intangible assets are often measured as the difference between
   firms' market value and their book value. Since advances in IC come on
   the heels of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), the
   continuous expansion of the latter means the relative importance of the
   former is increasing with respect to tangible capital assets. In fact,
   intangible resources are recognized to be of value to an organization as
   they improve its competitive levels, particularly in international
   markets. In order to increase their IC value, organizations have focused
   their efforts on improving relational capital by enhancing their
   relationship with external agents (suppliers, dealers, sellers, and
   customers). With this aim, most companies have established communication
   channels with users and customers through ICTs, including websites to
   promote e-commerce and release products and services, and social media
   to enhance their corporate image. The growing use of ICTs has not only
   involved the adoption of new interaction paradigms, but also increased
   the amount of information shared, which is often of great interest for
   public and private organizations. The majority of medium-sized and large
   businesses and public administrations have adapted their structures and
   internal processes to the realities of globalization and the technology
   era. However, many of them still need to improve their management
   practices in order to both acquire and manage IC. One of the most
   promising ways to acquire IC is to use Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS). GIS are computer programs used by public administrators, natural
   resource managers, marketing and sales analysts, civil engineers, etc.,
   that capture, analyze, store and present spatial data. In parallel with
   the development of GIS, a new discipline has emerged known as
   geomarketing (Geographical marketing), which is used to segment the
   market by considering spatial properties in order to identify the areas
   where a company may have maximum impact. geomarketing strategies
   integrate data from company databases and their markets, data from
   statistical databases on demographic and economic variables, as well as
   GIS to acquire information from digital maps. The present paper
   highlights the advantages of employing geomarketing techniques and GIS
   to acquire IC (human capital and relational capital), which is then used
   to support decision-making processes at different levels, and
   ultimately, therefore, increase organizations' market value.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to articulate clear understanding
   about the role of enterprise information systems (EIS) in developing
   innovative business practices. Particularly, it aims to explore the
   different ways that make EIS enables innovation development.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted exploratory case study,
   based on qualitative approach. Investigations included two case studies
   each involved interviewing a number of senior information technology
   staff, working at these cases.
   Findings - The paper provides empirical insights about the EIS role in
   enabling innovation. The analysis of the case studies revealed that
   integrating an EIS with other system(s) or with digital devices can
   provide new practices that could not be easily available without these
   technologies. The study also found that applying data analytics tools
   into data accumulated from EIS, to extract new insights, lead to
   innovative practices.
   Practical implications - The study provides a set of recommendations for
   organizations interested to maximize the benefits from their investments
   in EIS.
   Originality/value - The paper provides evidences from cases in United
   Arab Emirates for the EIS role in enabling business innovation.}},

Abstract = {{The Italian orange fruit export development outside EU countries has
   required commercial agreements regarding the restriction of parasites
   spread especially Mediterranean fruit fly. The correct use of cold
   treatment during the shipment is used to satisfy this requirement. This
   paper reports the results of a simulated refrigerated transport of
   citrus fruits (14600 kg of `Tarocco' oranges) in a 40ft refrigerated
   container. Temperatures have been monitored inside the refrigerated
   container in different positions of the load (in the air, in the pallet
   and in the fruits) using 40 innovative direct-to-digital temperature
   probes. Moreover, an innovative package (with an increased vented
   surface) was compared to the standard boxes. Results show that the
   difference of average temperature between the temperature probes in head
   space was less than 0.5 degrees C. Temperature peaks showed the on/off
   cycle of the automatic defrosting system. Though temperature probes
   placed on the floor showed a good homogeneity, the air temperature
   reached a minimum level of about -0.8 degrees C, near the cold air
   outlet, which is considered too low for the oranges cold storage. The
   vented boxes allowed a more rapid cooling, lowering the overall thermal
   resistance of fruit boxes, and so making fruits mostly affected by the
   cold air temperature near the air cooler outlet.}},

Title = {{Network Coded Multicast over Multibeam Satellite Systems}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{We propose a multicast scheme for multibeam satellite systems exploiting
   both the multiuser and spatial diversity inherent in this type of
   systems while taking into account realistic physical distributions of
   User Terminals (UTs) over the coverage. Our proposed scheme makes use of
   the well-known Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) feature in Digital
   Video Broadcasting over Satellite, 2nd Generation (DVB-S2) and Extension
   (DVB-S2X) standards but also incorporates a set of innovative features.
   First, multilink reception, that is, receivers that can syntonize
   different frequencies and/or polarizations, together with Network Coding
   (NC) is used to enable decoding of signals from adjacent beams (spatial
   diversity). Second, efficient and fair allocation of resources is
   achieved through Proportionally Fair Multicast (PFM) scheduling. Our
   results, obtained over realistic nonuniform UTs distributions, show
   average system multicast throughput gains up to 88\% with regard to
   state-of-the-art multicast schemes. Furthermore, a complete cross-layer
   architecture is proposed, fully compliant with the standard providing
   Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees.}},

Abstract = {{The research group with the responsibility of the STereo Camera (STC)
   for the ESA BepiColombo mission to Mercury, has realized an innovative
   and compact camera design in which the light collected independently by
   two optical channels at +/- 20 degrees with respect to the nadir
   direction converges on unique bidimensional detector. STC will provide
   the 3D-mapping of Mercury surface, acquiring images from two different
   perspectives. A stereo validation setup has been developed in order to
   give a much greater confidence to the novel instrument design and to get
   an on ground verification of the actual accuracies in obtaining
   elevation information from stereo pairs. A series of stereo-pairs of an
   anorthosite stone sample (good analogue of the hermean surface) and of a
   modelled piece of concrete, acquired in calibration clean room by means
   of an auxiliary optical system, have been processed in the
   photogrammetric pipeline using image correlation for the 3D model
   generation. The stereo reconstruction validation has been performed by
   comparing the STC DTMs (Digital Terrain Models) to an high resolution
   laser scanning 3D model of the stone samples as reference data. The
   latter has a much higher precision (ca. 20 mu m) of the expected in-lab
   STC DTM (190 mu m). Processing parameters have been varied in order to
   test their influence on the DTM generation accuracy. The main aim is to
   define the best illumination conditions and the process settings in
   order to obtain the best DTMs in terms of accuracy and completeness,
   seeking the best match between the mission constraints and the specific
   matching aspects that could affect the mapping process.}},

Abstract = {{The innovative features of information system, known as, Radiology
   Information System (RIS), for electronic medical records has shown a
   good impact in the hospital. The interoperability of RIS with the other
   Intra-hospital Information Systems that interacts with, dealing with the
   compatibility and open architecture issues, are accomplished by two
   novel mechanisms. The first one is the particular message handling
   system that is applied for the exchange of information, according to the
   Health Level Seven (HL7) protocol's specifications and serves the
   transfer of medical and administrative data among the RIS applications
   and data store unit. The same mechanism allows the secure and
   HL7-compatible interactions with the Hospital Information System (HIS)
   too. The second one implements the translation of information between
   the formats that HL7 and Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine
   (DICOM) protocols specify, providing the communication between RIS and
   Picture and Archive Communication System (PACS).}},

Abstract = {{The availability of new technologies for helmet-and head-mounted
   displays facilitates the design of innovative cockpit layouts like a
   completely virtual flight deck. After the introduction of the so-called
   ``glass cockpit{''}, where formerly mechanical instruments have been
   converted digitally onto large panel screens, the virtual flight deck
   could be the logical next step into the future. Obviously, such a
   concept will save installation cost of conventional display hardware.
   Furthermore, and probably of greater importance, stressful and
   time-consuming accommodation changes for the pilots' eyes between
   outside- and inside-view can be avoided.
   During the last months we have developed a concept for virtual cockpit
   instrumentation. Our implementation is based onto the JedEye (TM), a
   monochrome green, ``looking-through{''} HMD, which offers a resolution
   of more than HD-TV, good enough to show detailed information as on
   presently installed head-down instruments. Our approach augments our
   latest ``3D helicopter landing symbol format{''} with basic virtual
   instruments (PFD, ND, knee-board) in the near field of the cockpit
   environment in `` no-window{''} areas. Besides, we have implemented a ``
   drag and drop{''} mechanism, which enables pilots to arrange
   instrumentation on their personal preference. Tests in our Generic
   Cockpit Simulator (GECO) are currently conducted. As first pilots'
   feedback show, our concept offers a great potential to be introduced
   into the future flight deck.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Recently, Gamification is a significant trend among
   practitioners and scholars. Defined as ``the use of game design elements
   in non-game contexts{''}(Deterding et al., 2011a), gamification is
   useful to engage/fun users in solving problems and increase their
   contributions, 1 drawing on the strengths of co-creation, leading to a
   wider understanding/adoption of applied co-creation practices. Stemming
   from these premises, we aim at discussing gamification as an application
   to foster creativity, understand how such a perspective may become a
   core driver in supporting existing brands and helping them in involving
   customers throughout the (co) design process of new products/services.
   Analyzing MulinoBianco digital strategy, our purpose is twofold: how
   gamification changes behaviors, develops skills and drives innovation in
   various industries(Hamari et al., 2014b); how gamification would shape
   the future of knowledge creation(Hamari, 2013).
   Design/methodology/approach - Our article dwells on the theoretical
   analysis of gamification and its applicability on the engagement of
   consumers, throughout the design process, broadly definable as `any act
   of collective creativity'(Sanders, Stappers, 2008), by using elements of
   game thinking and mechanics in a non-game contexts, integrating
   consumers into advertising and brand-building, which would enable even a
   boost to companies' outcomes.
   Practical implications - What emerges from our paper is that
   gamification applied to a food company digital strategy brings it into
   direct contact with consumers and their creativity, also creating new
   opportunities for business. It is quite interesting to stress how
   gamification, intertwining with interaction design, pulls consumers into
   the brand and engages them in exhilarating/addictive ways of developing
   non-game products and services ``having more engaged customers, to
   crowdsourcing innovation or improving employee performance{''}(Burke,
   2012).}},

Abstract = {{Research in economics and social sciences has established that
   innovation has a territorial dimension which determines its dynamics.
   Therefore, companies may be more or less innovative depending on the
   characteristics of the territory where they are established or embedded.
   (Tremblay et al, 2010;. Matteaccioli and Muriel, 2007; Camagni and
   Maillat, 2006; Maskell, 2001; Porter, 1990). In recent years, the
   concept of industrial cluster has attracted interest and investment.
   Inspired by Michael Porter, the term cluster refers to a geographic
   concentration of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers,
   related industries and associated institutions in a particular field,
   also called intermediate bodies. They are not only in competition, but
   they cooperate together and support firms in training, financing, etc.
   In our article, we focus on the contributions of close relationships or
   networks to knowledge development, innovation and business management by
   relying on a survey of corporate actors in the field of information
   technology (IT) and mainly multimedia. We will analyze in particular the
   role of intermediary organizations and their impact on the knowledge
   development and innovation process of companies in the sector, and their
   role in entrepreneurship development, including incubator activities.
   Purpose - The goal of our research is to highlight the role of
   intermediary bodies, their roles in training or supporting learning in
   the workplace, as well as the development of companies, in
   entrepreneurship development in IT and multimedia. We also wanted to
   identify the role of proximity and to determine if relational or
   physical proximity is more important. Do firms need to be close to each
   other physically in order to develop cooperation, entrepreneurship and
   innovation ? Or is relational proximity, exchanges and interactions,
   more important?
   Design/methodology/approach - We conducted a study of the computer
   industry, multimedia and video game based on the consultation of the
   literature and semi-structured interviews with representatives of the
   sector between 2009 and 2015. Interviews with representatives companies
   focused on their vision of intermediary organizations, innovation
   policies and their contribution to innovation in the Montreal economy
   and their business. We achieved a good sixty interviews over the years,
   but retain here a set of 23 interviews, the latest interviews, which
   focus more on knowledge development and training, enterprise
   collaboration and competitiveness of the IT sector. The interviews were
   all transcribed, coded and analyzed in depth. Not to reveal the identity
   of the companies surveyed, we indicate that about half were in the area
   of video games, or more broadly interactive services and digital media
   (video games often providers), while others are in the broader IT
   sector.
   Originality/value - Our study seeks to demonstrate that there is an
   ongoing effort to value and promote the importance of knowledge
   development and cooperation for development of the IT, gaming and
   multimedia industry. We highlight the importance of the concept of
   cluster, and the determining effect of its dynamics.
   Practical implications - This study situates itself within an ongoing
   attempt in Quebec, where for several years the actors and
   intermediaries, political as well as from civil society, have thought
   together and sought the establishment of a local metropolitan cluster of
   fashion in which creativity and innovation are encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - How information systems are enabling innovative models and
   processes for managing information in health domains? A possible answer
   is through virtual health communities (or patient-centered eHealth):
   digital social networks where people share their clinical history,
   health information and treatments results. The purpose of this paper is
   to provide a framework for understanding those virtual health
   communities, identifying their models and main characteristics.
   Design/methodology/approach - Our main objective is to identify and
   systematize the overlapping research area between online social network
   and health sector. In order to accomplish this aim we conduct a first
   exploratory literature review.
   Originality/value - Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
   deeply changed the way in which organizations manage (collect, store,
   analyse, transmit and use) information and data. ICT also enabled and
   triggered business models in which external actors contribute in the
   production of information and knowledge valuable for the company (eg.
   open innovation, FLOSS, citizen-science programs). Health sector, due to
   the peculiarity of its nature and the sensitiveness of the information
   processed, has been one of the latest ones to take advantage of this new
   opportunity. The newness of the phenomenon, as well as the growing
   number of people using virtual health networks (VHN), call for a work of
   systematization of the emerging models and factors.
   Practical implications - In VHNs, a consistent number of patients
   (considered external to organizations in the traditional
   management/innovation models) voluntarily disclose their health
   information to other patients. Thus, even presenting some accuracy and
   truthfulness issues, nevertheless this model of information sharing
   constitutes an incredibly rich source of data for researchers (and
   potentially for pharmaceutical industries and health organizations).
   VHNs could integrate or expand the traditional pharmaceutical clinical
   trials; in such case, innovation will not be managed only internally by
   a company, but will be opened to patients' direct contribution. Risks
   and opportunities of this approach still have to be carefully evaluated}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The main tenet of this paper is to analyse the contribution
   given by urban socio-ecological systems (Ostrom \& Cox, 2010), such as
   those created through of platforms of co-design and cooperation linked
   to public urban space life and transformations, effectively defined as
   urban living-labs (Concilio \& Molinari, 2014) to knowledge-sharing
   processes and innovations in the city. Against this background, cities
   are developing collaborative open-innovative (Chesbrough \& Appleyard,
   2007) and digital environments to boost local competitiveness and
   prosperity by using knowledge networks and partnerships (Paskaleva,
   2009). This paper will describe the process enacted within those
   initiatives, explaining their relevance in the perspective of urban
   policy and design.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors will firstly identify the
   general framework of their research through a brief review of literature
   related to urban living labs, then they will focus on a relevant
   case-study in order to describe paths of knowledge and value creation
   process generated by cooperative and shared design projects in the
   public domain, with the effective support of technologies (Folke, Hahn,
   Olsson, \& Norberg, 2005). They will analyse the Atenistas experience,
   an ongoing Greek experience, which experiments actions around public
   space, improving citizens involvement in city life. The conclusion will
   sketch some emerging tendencies and criticalities arising from the
   relation between space and organizations, also in comparison with other
   international mature cases.
   Originality/value - The absence of a strong frame and objective, the
   variability of the roles played by actors involved in the
   decision-making processes about urban environment, and the combination
   with virtual platform, as described in the cases study, are in our
   perspective some key factor to open up new paths and process for the
   design of collective spaces. To analyse existing local based
   experiences, can help to underline where and how innovative processes
   can concretize and become value co-creation process with concrete
   effects on the urban environment.
   Practical implications - The paper describes some possible outcomes for
   planning and policy design, identifying some starter device which
   generate unplanned chains or clusters of process-project that are
   developing in time. This reveal some eventual opportunities in the way
   technicians and institution may operate, learning form how the binomial
   ``urban places-cyberspaces relations{''} is testing new practices. These
   experimentations can have some economical and governance impacts but
   make us reflect on the material result in terms of vision, projects and
   transformation of the space.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Recently, the role of place-based innovation has gained
   relevance and is being explored by a growing number of scholars. We see
   this as an opportunity to instantiate a new discourse on bottom-up
   governance, where the role played by the circulation and management of
   knowledge is at the same time crucial and displaying unexpected
   dynamics. Starting from the evidence that places, namely urban places,
   are more and more showing up as innovation drivers (Hou, 2010), the
   paper first describes the social streets phenomenon as an example of
   place-based innovation, then analyses three Italian cases, and finally
   discusses the relevance of spatial proximity for knowledge sharing and
   behavioural alignment, thus contributing to the theoretical and
   pragmatic debate on Urban Living Labs and related innovation processes.
   Design/methodology/approach - Social streets are informal associations
   of residents, living in the same street or in close urban proximities
   (blocks or neighbourhoods), aimed at establishing links, sharing needs,
   exchanging abilities or knowledge, and collaborating on shared projects,
   so as to reciprocally benefit from a deeper social interaction and
   collaboration. This paper explores social streets as innovative examples
   of place-based innovation. We first investigate the nature of social
   streets' innovation, in order to discover the role space has in it.
   Three specific cases are analysed in detail that differ to one another
   in having various origins, governance/organizational models and also
   spatial scales. These three dimensions are used as relevant to describe
   place-based innovation.
   Originality/value - The analysis conducted in this paper contributes to
   the theoretical discussion on Living Labs in general (Folstad, 2008;
   Stahlbrost, 2008; Svensson et al., 2010) and Urban Living Labs in
   particular (Concilio and Molinari, 2014; Concilio et al. 2013), by
   adding to the analysis of the specific role of urban space in user
   driven, open innovation environments, where users are no longer passive
   consumers of services but rather protagonists of real innovation, thanks
   to their being place dwellers, `` owners{''} and ``shapers{''}. The
   proposed paper focuses on place-based innovation through the analysis of
   the social street phenomenon. In discussing alternative governance
   models of the related socio-digital environments, it suggests deepening
   the operational perspective of emerging, alternative models of urban
   government and management.}},

Abstract = {{India like any other knowledge economy depends strongly upon the
   development in education sector. Quality of its education significantly
   defines its academic capital and status of human resource. Research
   findings have often pointed out to the deficiency of technology enabled
   quality education in India. The authors have tried out to identify the
   key issues to this disappointing scenario of ICT-enabled education in
   India. In this quest, it has been found that innovative use of ICT would
   help overcome different barriers like geographical, socio-economic and
   cultural constraints to a good extent. Implementing ICT in education
   primarily involves massive drives of digital literacy, development of
   requisite infrastructure, and devising of special measures to
   incorporate different ICT tools. ICT-enabled education would not only
   improve the quality of education but also redefine the traditional mode
   of learning to an interactive, efficient and interesting one. To review
   the scenario of ICT implementation in education and familiarity of
   students in the digital environment of education, a survey has been
   conducted over a group of students in India. The reports pointed out to
   the intense lack of ICT-enabled teaching methodologies. The authors have
   worked on proposing solutions for an inclusive development of the
   education standard and technique using ICT as a potential tool. Massive
   Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are also discussed in this perspective which
   has emerged as one of the most promising methods of catering Higher
   Education in an open and online fashion. In this connection, the authors
   have viewed MOOCs as a way to promote a Ubiquitous Learning environment
   in India which holds the potential in promulgating education to everyone
   and everywhere. Overall a vivid vision has been portrayed to sheath the
   existing education system in India with a technology cover which would
   not only improve the teaching-learning experience but also would show
   the way to ubiquitous learning in India, ensuring quality education for
   all.}},

Abstract = {{Optical methods for study biological tissue and cell at micro-and
   nanoscale level step now over diffraction limit. Really it is single
   molecule localization techniques that achieve the highest spatial
   resolution. One of those techniques, called bleaching/blinking assisted
   localization microscopy (BaLM) relies on the intrinsic bleaching and
   blinking behavior characteristic of commonly used fluorescent probes.
   This feature is the base of BaLM image series acquisition and data
   analysis. In our work blinking of single fluorescent spot against a
   background of others comes to light by subtraction of time series
   successive frames. Then digital estimation gives the center of the spot
   as a point of fluorescent molecule presence, which transfers to other
   image with higher resolution according to accuracy of the center
   localization. It is a part of image with improved resolution. This
   approach allows overlapping fluorophores and not requires single photon
   sensitivity, so we use 8,8 megapixel CMOS camera with smallest (1.55 um)
   pixel size. This instrumentation on the base of Zeiss Axioscope 2 FS MOT
   allows image transmission from object plane to matrix on a scale less
   than 100 nm/pixel using 20x-objective, thereafter the same resolution
   and 5 times more field of view as compared to EMCCD camera with 6 um
   pixel size. To optimize excitation light power, frame rate and gain of
   camera we have made appropriate estimations taking into account
   fluorophores behaviors features and equipment characteristics. Finely we
   have clearly distinguishable details of the sample in the processed
   field of view.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays there is a great attention in the biomedical field on the
   possibility to measure physiological parameters on a subject using a
   minimal invasive approach. In this paper, the authors propose an
   innovative, non-contact measurement method for the assessment of the
   heart rate (HR). The novel approach is based on the use of a digital
   camera to assess the color variation measureable on a subject face and
   caused by the periodic pumping action operated by the heart which allows
   the blood circulation. The paper report the methodological approach
   followed and the results obtained on ten voluntary subjects. Measured
   data are compared with HR values simultaneously measured by reference
   instruments. Cameras are available in many devices and this permits a
   large diffusion of this new method for the measurement of the heart rate
   that is the most important parameters to determinate a subject status of
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments can represent a valid approach to unravel the
   complex interplay between the geochemical behaviour of radon and rock
   deformation mechanisms. In light of this, we present a new real-time
   experimental setup for analysing in continuum the alpha-emitting Rn-222
   and Rn-220 daughters over variable stress-strain regimes. The most
   innovative segment of this setup consists of the radon accumulation
   chamber obtained from a tough and durable material that can host large
   cylindrical rock samples. The accumulation chamber is connected, in a
   closed-loop configuration, to a gas-drying unit and to a RAD7 radon
   monitor. A recirculating pump moves the gas from the rock sample to a
   solid-state detector for alpha counting of radon and thoron progeny. The
   measured radon signal is enhanced by surrounding the accumulation
   chamber with a digitally controlled heating belt. As the temperature is
   increased, the number of effective collisions of radon atoms increases
   favouring the diffusion of radon through the material and reducing the
   analytical uncertainty. The accumulation chamber containing the sample
   is then placed into a uniaxial testing apparatus where the axial
   deformation is measured throughout a linear variable displacement
   transducer. A dedicated software allows obtaining a variety of
   stress-strain regimes from fast deformation rates to long-term creep
   tests. Experiments conducted with this new real-time setup have
   important ramifications for the interpretation of geochemical anomalies
   recorded prior to volcanic eruptions or earthquakes.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose an innovative method for digital holographic
   microscopy named as photorefractive phase-conjugation digital
   holographic microscopy (PPCDHM) technique based on the phase conjugation
   dynamic holographic process in photorefractive BaTiO3 crystal and the
   retrieval of phase and amplitude of the object wave were performed by a
   reflection-type digital holographic method. Both amplitude and phase
   reconstruction benefit from the prior amplification by self-pumped
   conjugation (SPPC) as they have an increased SNR. The interest of the
   PPCDHM is great, because its hologram is created by interfered the
   amplified phase-conjugate wave field generated from a photorefractive
   phase conjugator (PPC) correcting the phase aberration of the imaging
   system and the reference wave onto the digital CCD camera. Therefore, a
   precise three-dimensional description of the object with high SNR can be
   obtained digitally with only one hologram acquisition. The method
   requires the acquisition of a single hologram from which the phase
   distribution can be obtained simultaneously with distribution of
   intensity at the surface of the object.}},

Abstract = {{The Advanced Computational Sensors Team at the Johns Hopkins University
   Applied Physics Laboratory and the Johns Hopkins University Department
   of Electrical and Computer Engineering has been developing advanced
   readout integrated circuit (ROIC) technology for more than 10 years with
   a particular focus on the key challenges of dynamic range, sampling
   rate, system interface and bandwidth, and detector materials or band
   dependencies. Because the pixel array offers parallel sampling by
   default, the team successfully demonstrated that adding smarts in the
   pixel and the chip can increase performance significantly. Each pixel
   becomes a smart sensor and can operate independently in collecting,
   processing, and sharing data. In addition, building on the digital
   circuit revolution, the effective well size can be increased by orders
   of magnitude within the same pixel pitch over analog designs. This
   research has yielded an innovative class of a system-on-chip concept:
   the Flexible Readout and Integration Sensor (FRIS) architecture. All key
   parameters are programmable and/or can be adjusted dynamically, and this
   architecture can potentially be sensor and application agnostic. This
   paper reports on the testing and evaluation of one prototype that can
   support either detector polarity and includes sample results with
   visible, short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and long-wavelength infrared
   (LWIR) imaging..}},

Abstract = {{Internet and digitization are fundamentally changing and disrupting
   newspaper companies' traditional operating models. Disruptive innovation
   theory offers explanations for why companies succeed or fail to respond
   to disruptive innovations. This study builds on disruptive innovation
   theory by ascertaining the role of dynamic capabilities in the
   performance of response to digital disruption. Empirical results suggest
   that first-order dynamic capabilities that are created by changing,
   extending, or adapting a firm's existing resources, processes, and
   values are positively associated with building digital platform
   capabilities, and that these capabilities impact the performance of
   response to digital disruption. For information systems (IS)
   researchers, this study clarifies the role of first-order dynamic
   capabilities in responding to digital disruption. For IS practice, it
   helps managers to focus on the most promising factors for creating
   first-order dynamic capabilities, for building digital platform
   capabilities, and for reinventing their core functions to accelerate
   digitization.}},

Abstract = {{Social networking sites, particularly Facebook, have been rapidly
   assimilated into young people's daily social lives. Facebook has
   attracted much research attention in the social sciences, although the
   site's widely used photo sharing functionalities have been
   underexplored. In this article, we argue for the use of innovative
   methods to access and explore young people's digitally and visually
   mediated worlds from their own perspectives. We use an illustrative
   research example that explored students' drinking cultures on Facebook.
   Nine undergraduate students engaged in interviews with an
   Internet-enabled laptop, sharing their Facebook pages and discussing
   online photos and photo-sharing practices. Screen records of Facebook
   activity alongside participants' talk provided multiple modes of data,
   which were analysed together to show that Facebook photos were important
   discursive resources that had implications for students' identities,
   friendships, and drinking practices. Creative qualitative approaches
   such as these can provide novel insights into young people's social
   worlds.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to identify characteristics of patients'
   contributions to innovation in health information technology (HIT). The
   paper outlines a theoretical definition of patient innovation and
   presents an analysis of four digital prototypes and 22 low-fidelity
   mock-ups designed by people affected by the chronic illness diabetes
   mellitus. Seventeen families (a total of 60 people) with one or more
   diabetic family members participated in design activities in a four-year
   research project focused on the design of digital support for everyday
   living with diabetes. Our analysis documented the originality of the
   analysed patient designs and identified three characteristics of
   patients' designs: socio-technical networks, objects with associated
   personal meanings and technology supporting the expression of identity.
   The paper concludes that patient innovation is defined by what is
   perceived as new by patients and/or others within the social system of
   adaptation. The analysed patient designs are original (as distinct from
   replications of or improvements on known products), and their
   characteristics are innovative contributions to the social system of
   everyday living with diabetes (i.e. they are perceived as new to the
   patients in the research study). The results of the analysis contribute
   to the credentials of patients as key actors in HIT innovation and call
   for participatory approaches in health informatics.}},

Title = {{A new boresighting method of the aircraft gun using a laser tracker}},
Journal = {{SENSOR REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{251-262}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose an innovative method
   to extend the operating range of the laser tracking system and improve
   the accuracy and automation of boresighting by designing a measurement
   instrument. Boresighting is a process that aligns the direction of
   special equipment with the aircraft reference axis. Sometimes the
   accurate measurement and adjustment of the equipment and the aircraft
   are hard to achieve.
   Design/methodology/approach - The aircraft is moved by an automatic
   adjustment system which consists of three numerical control positioners.
   For obtaining the position of the bore axis, an instrument with two
   measurement points is designed. Based on the multivariate normal
   distribution hypothesis, an uncertainty evaluation method for the aiming
   points is introduced. The accuracy of the measurement point is described
   by an uncertainty ellipsoid. A compensation and calibration method is
   proposed to decrease the effect of manufacturing error and deflection
   error by the finite element analysis.
   Findings - The experimental results of the boresighting measurement
   prove that the proposed method is effective and reliable in digital
   assembly. The measurement accuracy of the angle between the bore axis
   and the reference axis is about +/- 0.004 degrees. In addition, the
   measurement result is mainly influenced by the position error of the
   instrument.
   Originality/value - The results of this study will provide a new way to
   obtain and control the installation deviation of part in aircraft
   digital assembly and will help to improve the precision and efficiency.
   This measurement method can be applied to obtain the axis of a deep
   blind hole.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the religious presence and possibilities in the
   virtual world. An analysis of communication progress leads to the
   present scenario of new media environment. Based on the idea of
   revelation and a system of autopoiesis, religion appears like a closed
   communicator. Religion's communication needs to be placed within the
   context of evolving new media environment. Basing on McLuhan's theory of
   extension, religious narratives need new forms of presence in the
   digital world. When it comes to diffusion of innovation (Everett Rogers)
   the state of religion appears precarious. From a communication
   perspective adoption of innovation by religion can come under- the
   category of `laggards' and `luddites'. The transference of religion's
   presence from the real to the virtual demands new innovative and
   participatory models to serve the digital natives.}},

   3D-model of the production system using a HiL-approach. In order to
   increase the level of maturity of Virtual Commissioning and enrich the
   quality of the virtual 3D-model of the production system an innovative
   simulation approach using physics-based simulation capabilities based on
   game engine technology has been adopted. In particular, a physics-based
   model of pneumatic components (cylinders, clampers, etc.) typically
   found in automated assembly systems has been developed. The
   physics-based pneumatic model (PPM) enables more realistic simulations
   in real-time and is expected to be used within the next generation of
   Virtual Commissioning. However, before being utilized in industrial
   application PPM has to be validated. Kinematic and dynamic accuracy as
   well as compressed air consumption - a key performance indicator for
   energy consumption of the entire production system - of the PPM model
   are analytically and experimentally validated. In detail, validation was
   carried out considering different internal and external model
   parameters, such as pressure level, throttle valve settings, etc. and
   analyzing their impact on the PPM's informative value. Overall, PPM's
   validation shows promising results throughout all three different
   aspects (kinematics, dynamics, and compressed air consumption) and has
   thus a high potential for application in Virtual Commissioning. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{As percutaneous endovascular procedures address more complex and broader
   disease states, there is an increasing need for intra-procedure 3D
   vascular imaging. In this paper, we investigate C-Arm 2-axis
   tomosynthesis ({''}Tomo{''}) as an alternative to C-Arm Cone Beam
   Computed Tomography (CBCT) for workflow situations in which the CBCT
   acquisition may be inconvenient or prohibited. We report on our
   experience in performing tomosynthesis acquisitions with a digital
   angiographic imaging system (GE Healthcare Innova 4100 Angiographic
   Imaging System, Milwaukee, WI). During a tomo acquisition the detector
   and tube each orbit on a plane above and below the table respectively.
   The tomo orbit may be circular or elliptical, and the tomographic
   half-angle in our studies varied from approximately 16 to 28 degrees as
   a function of orbit period. The trajectory, geometric calibration, and
   gantry performance are presented. We overview a multi-resolution
   iterative reconstruction employing compressed sensing techniques to
   mitigate artifacts associated with incomplete data reconstructions. In
   this work, we focus on the reconstruction of small high contrast objects
   such as iodinated vasculature and interventional devices. We evaluate
   the overall performance of the acquisition and reconstruction through
   phantom acquisitions and a swine study. Both tomo and comparable CBCT
   acquisitions were performed during the swine study thereby enabling the
   use of CBCT as a reference in the evaluation of tomo vascular imaging.
   We close with a discussion of potential clinical applications for tomo,
   reflecting on the imaging and workflow results achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The onslaught of big data continues even as growth in data storage
   density tapers off. Meanwhile, the physics of holography continues to
   suggest the possibility of digital data storage at densities far
   exceeding those of today's technologies. We report on recent results
   achieved with a demonstrator platform incorporating several new
   second-generation techniques for increasing holographic data storage
   (HDS) recording density and speed.
   We present data showing the recovery of HDS data at a density of 2
   Tbit/in(2). Since the highest reported areal densities for hard disk
   drive products currently hover in the 1 Tbit/in(2) range, we have
   adopted 2 Tbit/in(2) as a milestone likely to generate interest in the
   technology. The demonstrator is based on an advanced pre-production
   prototype, and so inherits highly functional electronic, mechanical, and
   optical subsystems. It employs a high-NA monocular architecture with
   proven angle-polytopic multiplexing.
   The demonstrator design includes several second-generation innovations.
   The first, dynamic aperture multiplexing, greatly increases the number
   of multiplexed holograms. The second, the DREDTM medium formulation,
   provides dramatically higher dynamic range to record these holograms.
   These two features alone theoretically allow the demonstrator to exceed
   2 Tbit/in(2). Additionally, it is equipped with the capability of
   quadrature homodyne detection, permitting phase quadrature multiplexing
   (QPSK modulation), and the potential to further increase user capacity
   by a factor of four or more. The demonstrator has thus been designed to
   achieve densities supporting the multi-terabyte storage capacities
   required for competitive products, and to demonstrate the potential for
   Moore's-Law growth for years to come.}},

Abstract = {{Optical, nano-meter range, contactless, non-destructive sensor devices
   are promising acquisition techniques in crime scene trace forensics,
   e.g. for digitizing latent fingerprint traces. Before new approaches are
   introduced in crime investigations, innovations need to be positively
   tested and quality ensured. In this paper we investigate sensor
   reproducibility by studying different scans from four sensors: two
   chromatic white light sensors (CWL600/CWL1mm), one confocal laser
   scanning microscope, and one NIR/VIS/UV reflection spectrometer.
   Firstly, we perform an intra-sensor reproducibility testing for CWL600
   with a privacy conform test set of artificial-sweat printed, computer
   generated fingerprints. We use 24 different fingerprint patterns as
   original samples (printing samples/templates) for printing with
   artificial sweat (physical trace samples) and their acquisition with
   contactless sensory resulting in 96 sensor images, called scan or
   acquired samples. The second test set for inter-sensor reproducibility
   assessment consists of the first three patterns from the first test set,
   acquired in two consecutive scans using each device. We suggest using a
   simple feature space set in spatial and frequency domain known from
   signal processing and test its suitability for six different classifiers
   classifying scan data into small differences (reproducible) and large
   differences (non-reproducible). Furthermore, we suggest comparing the
   classification results with biometric verification scores (calculated
   with NBIS, with threshold of 40) as biometric reproducibility score. The
   Bagging classifier is nearly for all cases the most reliable classifier
   in our experiments and the results are also confirmed with the biometric
   matching rates.}},

Title = {{Changes of the eSheath Outer Dimensions Used for Transfemoral
   Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Innovative catheter systems with lower-profile sheaths and a dynamic
   expansion mechanism (DEM) were recently introduced for transcatheter
   aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, the labeling of 14 F and 16 F
   eSheaths denote the inner nominal diameter. Exact changes of the
   clinically relevant outer diameters during usage are not available.
   eSheaths were measured every 30 mm using a digital caliper. Unused 14 F
   and 16 F eSheaths served as controls. Maximum eSheath diameters were
   measured after insertion of the Edwards Commander Delivery System (ECDS)
   into 14 F and 16 F eSheaths. Finally, eSheaths were retrieved and
   measured after TAVR. Outer diameters of control 14 F eSheaths were 5.8
   mm and 6.50 mm for the 16 F eSheath. Introduction of the 23 mm and 26 mm
   ECDS into 14 F eSheaths showed a maximum diameter of 7.65 mm and 7.64 mm
   (P = NS). Introduction of the 29 mm ECDS into the 16 F eSheath showed
   the greatest diameter of 8.18 mm (P = 0.03). After TAVR, diameters of
   the 14 F eSheaths were 7.14 mm (23 mm valve) and 7.26 mm(26 mm valve) (P
   = NS), while 16 F eSheaths were 8.10 mm(29 mm valve) (P = 0.03). Nominal
   14 F and 16 F eSheaths showed a significant increase of the outer
   diameter during advancement of the ECDS and after TAVR implantation.}},

Abstract = {{High temperature deformation and strain are important measures for
   characterizing behaviors of structural components under high temperature
   conditions. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a full-field technique
   based on white-light illumination for displacement and strain
   measurement. But Light spectrum on the sample surface at high
   temperature affect the quality of acquired speckle pattern images for
   traditional DIC measurement. This paper proposes an innovative UV-DIC
   system which in conjunction with ultraviolet illumination and a
   filtering system to minimize the surface radiation effect and enable
   deformation and strain measurements at high temperatures. The test
   sample with a specially-selected coating material was heated by means of
   high temperature furnace, which process to form stable speckle pattern
   on the sample surface. The surface was illuminate by UV light and
   simultaneously an UV sensitive CCD camera was used to record digital
   speckle image of test sample surface under different temperatures. Using
   DIC method for image analysis and processing obtains full-field thermal
   deformation, which implements a set of image average algorithms for
   eliminates interference of vibration and noise. The experimental results
   show that the UV-DIC can achieve high temperature measurement, and
   effectively remove the interference of vibration and noise in high
   temperature measurement.}},

Title = {{Organizational strategies for promoting patient and provider uptake of

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate organizational strategies to promote personal
   health records (PHRs) adoption with a focus on patients with chronic
   disease.
   Methods Using semi-structured interviews and a web-based survey, we
   sampled US health delivery organizations which had implemented PHRs for
   at least 12 months, were recognized as PHR innovators, and had scored
   highly in national patient satisfaction surveys. Respondents had lead
   positions for clinical information systems or high-risk population
   management. Using grounded theory approach, thematic categories were
   derived from interviews and coupled with data from the survey.
   Results Interviews were conducted with 30 informants from 16 identified
   organizations. Organizational strategies were directed towards raising
   patient awareness via multimedia communications, and provider acceptance
   and uptake. Strategies for providers were grouped into six main themes:
   organizational vision, governance and policies, work process redesign,
   staff training, information technology (IT) support, and monitoring and
   incentives. Successful organizations actively communicated their vision,
   engaged leaders at all levels, had clear governance, planning, and
   protocols, set targets, and celebrated achievement. The most effective
   strategy for patient uptake was through health professional
   encouragement. No specific outreach efforts targeted patients with
   chronic disease. Registration and PHR activity was routinely measured
   but without reference to a denominator population or high risk
   subpopulations.
   Discussion and conclusion Successful PHR implementation represents a
   social change and operational project catalyzed by a technical solution.
   The key to clinician acceptance is making their work easier. However,
   organizations will likely not achieve the value they want from PHRs
   unless they target specific populations and monitor their uptake.}},

Title = {{Negation detection and word sense disambiguation in digital archaeology
   reports for the purposes of semantic annotation}},
Journal = {{PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},

Pages = {{118-134}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the role and
   contribution of natural language processing techniques, in particular
   negation detection and word sense disambiguation in the process of
   Semantic Annotation of Archaeological Grey Literature. Archaeological
   reports contain a great deal of information that conveys facts and
   findings in different ways. This kind of information is highly relevant
   to the research and analysis of archaeological evidence but at the same
   time can be a hindrance for the accurate indexing of documents with
   respect to positive assertions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a method for adapting
   the biomedicine oriented negation algorithm NegEx to the context of
   archaeology and discusses the evaluation results of the new modified
   negation detection module. A particular form of polysemy, which is
   inflicted by the definition of ontology classes and concerning the
   semantics of small finds in archaeology, is addressed by a domain
   specific word-sense disambiguation module.
   Findings - The performance of the negation dection module is compared
   against a ``Gold Standard{''} that consists of 300 manually annotated
   pages of archaeological excavation and evaluation reports. The
   evaluation results are encouraging, delivering overall 89 per cent
   precision, 80 per cent recall and 83 per cent F-measure scores. The
   paper addresses limitations and future improvements of the current work
   and highlights the need for ontological modelling to accommodate
   negative assertions.
   Originality/value - The discussed NLP modules contribute to the aims of
   the OPTIMA pipeline delivering an innovative application of such methods
   in the context of archaeological reports for the semantic annotation of
   archaeological grey literature with respect to the CIDOC-CRM ontology.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of using personal digital assistance (PDA) in the healthcare
   industry has been sparsely explored from the viewpoint of an emerging
   market like Malaysia. Since the potential benefits of adopting PDA are
   immense, this study aims to investigate the intention of medical
   professionals to adopt PDA in their daily work. Interestingly, only
   personal innovativeness in technology (PIIT) was found to be
   insignificant in this study. The study is important, as it provides
   vital information not only for hospital management but also for system
   developers and even government agencies when devising their corporate
   and marketing strategies.}},
