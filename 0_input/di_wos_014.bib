Abstract = {{Some posit that crowdsourcing will disrupt labor markets within a
   decade. Therefore we need to understand how to manage this innovation.
   Our study is focused on large organizations -- the enterprises -- that
   buy these crowdsourcing services. Such large organizations can also be
   government organizations.
   What is crowdsourcing? It is a messy umbrella term that has become all
   things to all people. Specifically, our focus is on paid crowdsourcing:
   hire the testers through the cloud from uTest; hire coders through the
   cloud from Topcoder; hire the corporate graphic designer through the
   cloud from freelancer. com or 99designs. com; for the massive digitation
   project, hire microtaskers at mobileworker. com.
   The governance issues are similar to generic sourcing governance.
   However, there are some special dimensions that may be more acute for
   crowdsourcing. I will focus on five dimensions of interest: quality,
   risks in IP and privacy, risks in project control, risks in
   organizational reputation because of exploitation, and management of the
   crowd itself.
   A significant number of U.S. enterprises are dabbling in
   crowdsourcing--some of them spending in excess of one million USD. But
   these projects are still small, scattered, occasionally skunk-works. And
   the enterprise managers who pioneer crowdsourcing have few peer networks
   and no benchmarking.}},

Abstract = {{The Digital Infrastructure group at Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) is
   responsible for the development and maintenance of the organization's
   data management, archive and distribution. Data acquired from sensors on
   cabled ocean observatories off the coast of British Columbia and in the
   Arctic are made available via ONC's online interface to a
   multidisciplinary community of scientists, the public, government and
   non-governmental agencies.
   In order to better enable scientists, ONC has embarked upon an
   initiative to leverage the OPeNDAP-NetCDF-CF framework for
   interoperability that has been gaining momentum with the oceanographic
   and climate communities. Funded by Canada's Advanced Research and
   Innovation Network's (CANARIE) Research Platform Interface program, the
   Extending Possibilities by Leveraging OPeNDAP for Remotely Exchanging
   (ExPLORE) Complex Oceanographic Data project aims to be operational by
   the end of 2014. Together with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
   Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)-compliant web-services, this project will
   significantly extend ONC's interoperability commitment.
   This framework was chosen due to the maturing infrastructure for
   developers and end-users, increasing community support, and demand from
   end-users for webservices. In brief, OPeNDAP (Open source Project for a
   Network Data Access Protocol) includes software and a protocol for
   transporting data across the web. The NetCDF (Network Common Data Form)
   data format and associated software libraries are particularly suited to
   scientific data arrays. Since these files are machine-independent and
   self-describing, data access and sharing are streamlined. The CF
   (Climate and Forecast) metadata convention designed for NetCDF files
   specifies metadata attributes and standardizes variables (names and
   measurement units).
   Building upon existing web-services and tools, ONC will be publishing
   additional web-services for increased functionality such as dataset
   discovery, metadata browsing and data access. Training resources like
   documentation, sample scripts and tutorials will assist the community in
   adopting these tools. Initial implementation will support
   multi-dimensional data from instruments like Acoustic Doppler Current
   Profilers or mobile platforms like gliders and vertical profilers.
   System architecture, novel implementation aspects, customized extensions
   and usage will be highlighted during the presentation. It is expected
   that this approach will enhance the utility of ONC's extensive datasets
   for researchers, and facilitate interoperability with other
   oceanographic data providers. Researchers will benefit by being able to
   query ONC data from within their working environment (e.g., MATLAB, R,
   Python), merge ONC data with other sources more seamlessly, and share
   routines for processing and visualization with less effort. Data
   providers and portals that support these standards will be able to
   integrate ONC data and form collaborative partnerships.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Game-Based approach to E-Learning that tries to
   mimic games to harness motivational properties in Tanzanian Preschools.
   A prototype system was developed, using a rapid development approach.
   The system was evaluated by twelve preschools across three regions in
   Tanzania namely Arusha, Iringa and Dar es Salaam to give an indication
   of the system's ability to make work with exercise in alphabetical sound
   articulation more engaging and fun. The pedagogical model of the
   application was based on learning theories. The results of the study
   have shown that the learning outcomes of the integrated digital-learning
   activities of alphabetical sound articulation among preschoolers
   improved. It projected that innovative digital content framework can
   serve as a means to inform policy makers, educators, and teachers about
   the potential use of Game-Based method in preschoolers' education and
   offer ideas and means to standardize sound articulation and language
   learning thus, improve the overall quality of education.}},

   collaborative work and students' production of curriculum material. The
   research methodology is the action research (Lewin, 1946; Barbier,
   1996), which facilitates change in social and educational settings.
   Three moments in the change process are discussed: unfreezing, moving,
   and freezing (Lewin, 1946). The process of collaborative artistic
   creation is nurtured by the experience of participants in the
   reinterpretation of their own living identities. They develop their own

Abstract = {{Personalized learning is an important goal for the future education
   reform and innovation. Nowadays, analysis of the classroom learning
   process for elementary school relies on the teacher's experience because

   received as real-time processing and analyzed in the process of learning
   for elementary school, which leads to lacking of practical basis for
   personalized learning. This study is focused on using PAD for teaching
   and studying in digital classroom under the network environment, based
   on the learning process information exchanged between teachers and
   students, so as to construct the PADClass model. Based on the model,
   educational data can be collected and descripted in the learning
   process, and it can be gotten the teaching strategies and suggestions
   from educational data mining and analysis according to the domain
   knowledge. Teachers using these data and analysis results can control
   teaching process and teaching reflection in real time, so as to improve
   the classroom teaching quality. Students using these data and the
   results of analysis, can discover the problems of learning themselves

Abstract = {{With the continuous development and improvement as well as the wide
   application in the digital area, the digital media technology affects
   each industry more and more profoundly. Meantime, the fast growing
   digital media technology also provides brand new contents to the modern
   product design. The new contents not only broaden the technological
   space and cultural space for the design process, but also impose
   significant impact on aesthetic shape of products. The revolutionary
   technology innovation changes not only the contents and method of
   product design, but also the structure, functions, and aesthetic
   characteristics of products, consumption habit, and social status quo.
   Like many post-modern product designs, the developing digital media
   technology will challenge the modern functionalism design. With the
   application of the digital media technology, we must rethink about the

Abstract = {{The paper highlights certain important pages of computer science history
   that are virtually unknown not only to the general scientific community
   both in Russia and abroad, but to many computer and telecommunications
   specialists as well. Attention is brought to achievements of the team of
   scientists and engineers at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute (LPI)
   attained in development of real-time computerized systems designed in
   mid-90th to support launching missiles and putting artificial Earth
   satellites in orbit. Discussed are problems related to early ballistic
   trajectories parameters' measurement and processing, which necessitated
   innovative design and construction of specialized digital computers of
   the Quartz and Temp series. Described is the subsequent invention of
   unique hardware that was based on original diodless ferrite logic
   elements (ferrite-ferrite logic) en mass assembled and packaged into
   compact shielded construction modules ({''}plates{''}). The variety of
   ready-made off-the-shelf plates has offered a wide range of complex
   functionality and has led to design of various extremely reliable
   automated control systems (ACS) that were extensively used both in the
   space research and the defense projects of the USSR. The key role of
   University research is emphasized and the progress stages of Professor
   Taras N. Sokolov's school of thought are mentioned. The relevant events
   in the period of confrontation between the United States and the Soviet
   Union during the cold war and the space race are revealed. The text is
   accompanied by numerous links to serve as a guide to references given in

Abstract = {{Road constrained vehicle applications such as Intelligent Transport
   Systems (ITS) and Location Based Services (LBS) have become much more
   widespread over the last decade, creating the need for effective
   solutions to the problem of reliable and accurate road-constrained
   vehicle positioning. While the problem of tracking has been to a
   satisfactory degree solved for some applications in good GNSS visibility
   situations, this is not the case where satellite signal quality is
   degraded or non-existent particularly where the application is reliant
   on ubiquitous high quality positioning. Attention has increased over the
   last decade on formulating signal outage handling algorithms however we
   argue that the problem is far from comprehensively solved. Such outages
   can still cause significant disruption to positioning accuracy even when
   occurring over short period. We argue that in principle the problem of
   bridging partial outages (between 1 and 3 satellites visible, inclusive)
   can be adequately solved when accurate digital road map data is combined
   ({''}fused{''}) effectively with partial satellite information in a
   statistically robust way. Our contribution is a statistically rigorous
   positioning algorithm which implicitly fuses road map data with
   satellite range measurements to sequentially estimate the position of a
   moving on-road vehicle. An innovative approximation scheme to handle
   network non-linearities efficiently is incorporated using Gaussian sums
   and locally linear models. We present results showing the effectiveness
   of this algorithm when compared to benchmark methods such as the
   Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and map-matching. Tests involved error
   comparison of tracking accuracy between algorithms over periods of
   (artificially induced) partial signal outages.}},

   built from composite materials. For example damages induced by impact in
   composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) operating in space

Abstract = {{Today in the digital age, with our advances in modern technology and
   communication, there are additional stressors for our military personnel
   and Veterans. Constant dangers exist both on and off the battlefield,
   unlike prior wars that had clearly-defined war zones. In addition,
   medical advances have assisted in saving the lives of many more gravely
   injured troops than ever previously possible. As the wars in Iraq and
   Afghanistan come to an end, large numbers of service men and women are
   returning home with multiple injuries. This group of Veterans has
   significantly higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
   traumatic brain injury than ever before reported. Although existing PTSD
   therapies have been found to be highly effective for many Veterans,
   there is a substantial minority unsatisfactorily treated. Mantram
   repetition, an innovative, complementary, evidence-based treatment, is
   proving to be successful for these new Veterans. When used regularly it
   helps with ``road rage, impatience, anger, frustration, and being out of
   control.{''} A mantram is a brief, sacred word or phrase that embodies
   divine power or the greatest positive energy one can imagine (Easwaran,
   2008a). Mantram repetition is a simple, quick, personal, portable, and
   private complementary practice that may be used as an adjunct to current
   treatments for PTSD. Growing research evidence supports mantram
   repetition's value for dissemination and adoption in the 21st century.
   This chapter summarizes Mantram Program research conducted from 2003 to
   2014. It describes the health-related benefits of the Mantram Program in
   various populations. The current research focuses on benefits for
   managing psychological distress and promoting quality of life in
   Veterans. Future areas for research are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Kin-Men National Park is the first national park established for
   maintaining historical assets and war memorials. It contains natural
   resources, and both cultural and historical importance. It is highly
   vital in view of historical perspective and plays a milestone of bygone
   era by itself. In order to strengthen Kin-Men National Park's
   characteristics, and accomplish the goal of continual development, the
   project of digitalization of Kin-Men National Park has been initialized
   since 2009, and so far the project has gone of development. The first
   stage focuses on digitalization and establishing archives. The second
   stage is to construct an academic network and introductory websites for
   public's use, and promote related subjects through online educational
   methods, and combine homesteads, local gourmets, and specffic tourist
   spots into a larger map for tourism. The third stage prioritizes on
   promoting the digital archives of Kin-Men Nation Park. The fourth stage
   focuses on value-increasing applications, and develops merchandises,
   electronic business process, and educational materials. Other than
   possessing special materials and massive digital archives, the project
   of developing digital archives of Kin-Men National Park is moreover a
   complete, innovative and a digital archive which contains aspects of
   continual development.Website: http://digital-kinmen.kmnp.gov.tw/}},

Abstract = {{The platform CORRECT was created within the frame of a research and
   development program which gathers 9 partners coming from institutional,
   industrial and educational background.
   In such a context, this program focuses on a wide range of technical
   challenges from the correction of OCR outputs to their improvements
   through a crowdsourcing approach. The project follows 3 main targets:
   first to promote a crowdsourcing approach, to fulfill the need for
   e-accessibility /digital access (for all users and for all access
   devices), lastly to develop innovative tools and approaches based on
   man-machine relationship.
   One of the main technical challenges was to develop tools dedicated to
   the production of digital transcription consistent with the original
   documents. The next issue at stake was the possibility led to the
   improvement of the digital transcriptions in order to produce new
   versions of these transcriptions under several formats (such as e-books
   format or disabled people editions dedicated to disabled people).
   One of the main challenges was also to recruit, mobilize and manage a
   great number of contributors. Reflections on such issues and challenges
   had been undertaken at different levels: up to what extent and how users
   should be involved within the project and through what kind of
   collaborative mechanisms; the technical requirements of platform tools
   (IHM and assistance/help features) and, lastly, thoughts about contents
   made available.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbine icing represents the most significant threat to the
   integrity of wind turbines in cold weather. Advancing the technology for
   safe and efficient wind turbine operation in atmospheric icing
   conditions requires the development of innovative, effective
   anti-/de-icing strategies tailored for wind turbine icing mitigation and
   protection. Doing so requires a keen understanding of the underlying
   physics of complicated thermal flow phenomena pertinent to wind turbine
   icing phenomena, both for the icing itself as well as for the water
   runback along contaminated surfaces of wind turbine blades. In the
   present study, an experimental investigation was conducted to
   characterize the surface wind-driven water film/rivulet flows over a
   NACA 0012 airfoil in order to elucidate the underlying physics of the
   transient surface water transport behavior pertinent to wind turbine
   icing phenomena. The experimental study was conducted in an icing
   research wind tunnel available at Aerospace Engineering Department of
   Iowa State University. A novel digital image projection (DIP)
   measurement system was developed and applied to achieve quantitative
   measurements of the thickness distributions of the surface water
   film/rivulet flow at different test conditions. The measurement results
   reveal clearly that, after impinged on the leading edge of the NACA0012
   airfoil, the micro-sized water droplets would coalesce to form a thin
   water film in the region near the leading edge of the airfoil. The
   formation of rivulets was found to be time-dependent process and relies
   on the initial water runback flow structure. The width and the spacing
   of the water rivulets were found to decrease monotonically with the
   increasing wind speed. The film thickness icing scaling law is evaluated
   by the time-average measurement film thickness. The measurement results
   show good consistent with the analytical scaling predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Archives are an extremely valuable part of our cultural heritage.
   Although their importance, the models and technologies that have been
   developed over the past two decades in the Digital Library (DL) field
   have not been specifically tailored on archives and this is especially
   true when it comes to formal and foundational frameworks, as the
   Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, Societies (5S) model is.
   Therefore, we propose an innovative formal model, called NEsted SeTs for
   Object hieRarchies (NESTOR), for archives, using it to extend the 5S
   model in order to take into account the specific features of the
   archives and to tailor the notion of digital library accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{This research, now in its first phase of development, focuses upon
   evaluation of Digital Humanities, here indicated as the disciplines,
   included within the Italian Disciplinary Areas 10 and 11, innovating
   their research outputs through the application of technological methods.
   These research outputs are relevant both quantitatively and
   qualitatively, but do not seem to be considered of value by the current
   procedures of quality evaluation. The research methodology is including
   a comparison of the evaluation policies and quality assurance procedures
   in Europe regarding the different typologies of digital publications.
   The final product will be a KOS (Knowledge Organization System) based on
   the Web standards, such as RDF and Linked Open data, to represent and
   organize the digital products and publications as well as the related
   agents (persons, institutions, etc.). The KOS will include the results
   derived by user studies including: 1) a toolkit that will provide rich
   and meaningful information about the research activity and publications
   in Digital Humanities. The toolkit will consist of decision tools, able
   to analyze the content of the proposed knowledge organization system; 2)
   a platform for the diffusion of Project results, including digital
   publications, OER for training and other communication tools.}},

   in their high-end segment; broadcast value grew noticeably; OOH media
   development suffered in the face of government restrictions and there
   was widespread Internet-based activity, which also underwent some
   restructuring. In terms of industry model innovation, these arose with
   regard to capital operation and technology applications, as well as a
   marketing management model for creative communication in the digital
   age. However follow-up services and resource supply/demand remained
   problems, and investment in, along with supporting policies for, an

Abstract = {{Facebook is the most popular Social Network Site (SNS) among college
   students. Despite the popularity and extensive use of Facebook by
   students, its use has not made significant inroads into classroom usage.
   In this study, we seek to examine why this is the case and whether it
   would be worthwhile for faculty to invest the time to integrate Facebook
   into their teaching. To this end, we decided to undertake a study with a
   sample of 214 undergraduate students at the University of Huelva
   (Spain). We applied the structural equation model specifically designed
   by Mazman and Usluel (2010) to identify the factors that may motivate
   these students to adopt and use social network tools, specifically
   Facebook, for educational purposes.
   According to our results, Social Influence is the most important factor
   in predicting the adoption of Facebook; students are influenced to adopt
   it to establish or maintain contact with other people with whom they
   share interests. Regarding the purposes of Facebook usage, Social
   Relations is perceived as the most important factor among all of the
   purposes collected. Our findings also revealed that the educational use
   of Facebook is explained directly by its purposes of usage and
   indirectly by its adoption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper differentiates three dimensions of access for eInclusion
   instruments: Firstly, digital media are understood as environments that
   offer multiple channels for interaction between persons with
   disabilities and their environment. This dimension is challenged by
   barriers that hinder people to use digital media. Peer support could be
   understood as a second dimension: Social media can empower people to act
   as social innovators and help people with disabilities. Barriers are
   identified in the effort that has to be done or in unsuitable
   ICT-applications. On a third dimension, the advantages of ``space{''}
   are explored: Public internet access points can be understood as a
   ``space{''} that offers ICT access, support for individual needs and
   competences, facilitated by specialized staff. The high costs, missing
   political backing and need for competences could be understood as main
   barriers here. The paper suggests to capitalize on social innovation
   approaches to design new support instruments for eInclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can be used in diverse
   applications to accelerate information dissemination to improve
   efficiency of public services, to increase the transparency and
   accountability of government administration, to reduce corruption, and
   to facilitate citizen participation in local governance. Given the fact
   that few ICT projects in rural areas have scaled up, it seems that the
   full potential of ICT as an enabler of development is yet to be tapped.
   This chapter analyzes two projects from India that have overcome these
   challenges and have scaled up. In moving forward on digital inclusion so
   far, the focus has been on creating equitable access to Internet and
   other technologies. Adequate effort has not gone into understanding the
   context in which these technologies can deliver value by alleviating key
   problems of development in rural areas. A paradigm shift is needed.
   Instead of developing a technology and then looking for a context where
   it can be used, it would be more effective to understand the problems of
   the poor and identify what technology innovations can help solve any
   part of the problem. Invariably, technology will not be enough; other
   components will need to be put together to create a development.
   Mobile-based delivery, which can overcome some of these constraints,
   needs to be explored in a major way. In addition, new content useful for
   rural populations needs to be made available in the public domain.}},

Abstract = {{Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has altered the different
   ranges where we move, the way we interact with society, the way get
   information and the way we work. ICT is, undoubtedly, the innovation
   that is more responsible for change once ``technology is in everything,
   all the times, anywhere{''}. ICT is used as an educational tool that has
   a huge potential. Its use is unavoidable in everyday school life, no
   matter the age or the school level of the students. ICT can be used to
   improve learning/teaching process or even to introduce new challenging
   approaches. Since the eighties (XX century) the Portuguese government
   have supported a set of projects with the aim of promoting the
   integration of ICT in different school levels. As far as the primary
   school is concerned, we can highlight the Minerva, Nonio Seculo XXI,
   uARTE, EDUTIC and Equipa de Missao Computadores, Redes e Internet na
   Escola projects, among many others. All the referred projects shared the
   objective of stimulating the use of ICT in educational environments,
   through the formation of both students and teachers, in financing
   equipment acquisition and in supporting the development and
   dissemination of contents. In the scope of the modern information
   society and facing the role technology may have in the improvement of
   educational practices, it is necessary to assess truly the impact of ICT
   in changing processes and educational practices. The project Interactive
   Approaches in Education is being carried out by researchers from the
   Research Unit for Inland Development (UDI), from the Polytechnic
   Institute of Guarda. Our main goal is to assess the actual influence of
   the use of ICT in education in all Guarda's elementary schools, namely
   as far as computers and software are concerned - in general - and the
   Magalhaes computer in particular. Besides the analysis of the
   integration and use of ICT in the overall context of elementary schools,
   we intended to study the development of competences in ICT and the
   digital literacy of the students and their parents and ICT's influence
   in the construction of knowledge from a multidisciplinary point of view.
   The study was carried out from April 2012 to June 2012. In a first
   phase, the study implied the development of the questionnaire and its
   validation. The methodology used is empirical and descriptive. This
   methodology allows to describe the characteristics of population. The
   questionnaire was the tool used to collect data for our study. Thus, the
   target market of our research has involved all the students, teachers
   and parents from the public primary schools in Guarda's county. We are
   presenting partial results of the study, currently highlighting
   assessment of the perceptions of parents and students from primary
   schools in Guarda's county, their habits in using computers and their
   sensitivity towards Magalhaes computer. From the results obtained, we
   can conclude that almost all students have a permanent contact with
   technologies, that parents value this sort of practice. It can also be
   observe that the practice is held in different contexts and for
   different finality.}},

Abstract = {{The eduCAT 1x1 project began in 2009-2010 in secondary schools of
   Catalonia with the aim of ensuring the use of a laptop for each student.
   This project follows the transformation of existing classrooms into
   ``Digital classrooms{''} by placing internet access and content in the
   classroom as well as educational resources in digital format.
   This project evolved into another project called eduCAT 2.0 which
   impacted a large number of schools and an exponential sum of students
   and teachers. As a consequence of this transformation, the technological
   and publishing sectors invested in new products and materials adapted
   for the new digital schools. This is the first time that these sectors
   significantly prioritise their investments in the digital transformation
   of education. It is therefore very important that educators assess these
   sectors to improve the quality and innovation of educational resources.
   This project of massive integration of technology in the classroom is
   one of the most ground-breaking methodological changes in the history of
   education. The relevance of this digitalization process is framed within
   the importance of the introduction of 21st century tools and resources
   in education. These tools and resources enable innovative learning
   processes however, only giving a laptop to each student does not
   guarantee educational success.
   The eduCAT 1x1 project has accelerated the technological provisions of
   secondary schools in Catalonia. This has revitalized teaching, yet it
   has shown a low level of digital competence in teachers and the digital
   divide with their students. Hence, we need a systemic change, which will
   require numerous efforts at the beginning of the process with close
   support to teachers. At the same time, it is necessary to carry out
   research of the developments and results of the project's process.
   Therefore, the overall objective is to diagnosis the initial phase of
   the eduCAT1x1 project with participation of teachers. As well as guide
   future implementation of technology in the classroom by considering four
   main categories: infrastructure (plugs, computers, WIFI), internal and
   external educational resources, training and support for educators, and
   methodology and classroom management.
   Thus, this paper identifies the strengths and the weaknesses of the
   experience in the pilot eduCAT 1x1 project in 70 secondary schools of
   Catalonia with the participation of the teachers involved in the
   project. These elements are key for designing future strategies related
   to the introduction of new technological devices in teaching and
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Digital history, is ``an approach to examining and representing the past
   that takes advantage of new communication technologies such as computers
   and the Web. It draws on essential features of the digital realm, such
   as databases, hypertextualization, and networks, to create and share
   historical knowledge.{''} This definition comes from the Roy Rosenzweig
   Center for History and New Media, one of the earliest proponents of
   digital history, whose web site showcases several digital history
   projects. In Europe and the US, such an approach or methodology is very
   popular and provides an effective teaching mechanism. However, in
   Malaysia, ``digital history{''} is quite unknown and rarely explored by
   academicians or teachers of history at the undergraduate or even
   secondary-school levels. Even at the university level, there is not yet
   a course offered on digital humanities.
   Thus, this study seeks to instil awareness among teachers on the use of
   new media in teaching history. An educational history web site was
   created or developed to provides history modules that integrate the new
   media and innovative approaches in teaching Form Five History. A blog
   was also set up as another means of channeling information to history
   teachers in a more interactive, quicker, and easier manner.
   In summary, this approach has the capability to significantly impact the
   delivery of Form Five history and at the same time inculcate deep
   interest based on innovative, interactive, and attractive teaching and
   learning methods. If such an approach is given the best opportunity to
   be employed as a teaching and learning tool, history as a boring subject
   will only be a myth believed by those who are technologically
   illiterate.
   This study evaluates the receptivity of teachers towards incorporating
   the new media in teaching history. It seeks to identify barriers and
   challenges by offering some reflections on a number of issues limiting
   history teachers' potential to use the new media. This study goes on to
   offer solutions to overcome these challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Although Guidelines on the importance of validation of competences
   acquired in formal and non-formal settings exist at the European and
   national level, awareness of these themes amongst adult audiences is
   still lacking. Do they really know that life can become an actual
   learning environment? In general terms, what kind of learning can the
   third sectors offer to adults?
   KVALUES - Key competences: Validating Adult Learners' EdUcational
   ExperienceS is a EU funded project that aims to contribute to this
   debate by identifying what competences and skills can be evaluated.
   KVALUES is a two-year project that brings together adult cultural
   educators from Italy, UK, Germany, Sweden, Estonia, Bulgaria to develop
   and test the digital storytelling methodology as an innovative tool to
   guide adults and young adults in disadvantaged conditions to
   self-evaluate and recognize skills and key competences acquired through
   informal learning contexts.
   The idea of the project springs from the successful feedback received
   from the previous project DeTALES - Digital Education Through Adult
   Learners EU-Enlargement Stories, which showed that digital storytelling
   is a useful mean to engage people of all ages and backgrounds. Based on
   past experiences in adult education and in the cultural field, KVALUES
   partners realized that the target group in question (adults, young
   adults in disadvantaged conditions, unemployed, inactive people) is not
   aware that work or life experiences can be turned into learning
   opportunities. They aren't aware that, not only practical skills are
   useful to find a job or a better job position, but also the key
   competences such as social, transversal, cultural, creative and
   entrepreneurial thinking skills are an added value to their curricula.
   The implementation of a digital curricular story puts the individual at
   the center of the learning, fostering key competences (creative,
   entrepreneurial, basics, cultural, etc.) and, consequently, the
   need/willingness to undertake a new training process. The process of
   validation helps learners to think about what they have achieved so far
   and identify their strengths and skills. It helps to identify
   longer-term goals and what they need to do to achieve them. The use of
   digital tools, combined with the narrative process, aims to encourage
   individuals, usually excluded from traditional pathways of formal
   training and aiming at transferring practical skills, to become more
   aware of the importance of key competences to help them to re-enter the
   labour market.}},

Abstract = {{The History of the Book course is a traditional mainstay of library and
   information science (LIS) education and a perennial favorite among
   students valuing contact with physical artifacts. In the digital age,
   knowledge representation has become independent of individual objects
   and such classes need to reflect these changes. Working collaboratively
   with experts from the University of Pennsylvania Libraries' Kislak
   Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts, Drexel
   University and UPenn faculty have developed a new online version of this
   discussion based course offered as part of the MS(LIS) degree by Drexel
   University's College of Computing and Informatics. This new version,
   augmented with video created specifically for the course and other
   digital materials available on the Internet, draws on traditional
   content but situates it in the context of knowledge representation
   through the ages, with a special emphasis on the role of information in
   the 21st century and beyond.
   The new online version of the course was beta tested in the winter 2014
   term with 26 students; a companion section of the traditional
   face-to-face version of the course was also offered in the winter 2014
   term. Only eleven students registered for the face-to-face version of
   the course, suggesting that the online format appeals to many students
   on the basis of convenience. The challenge for the two instructors was
   to keep the two sections of the course aligned in terms of the
   intellectual content and provide similar educational experienced for
   both groups of students. For example, students in the online version of
   the course ``visited{''} virtual collections of rare books while
   students in the face-to-face section visited the physical collections
   held at the University of Pennsylvania. Both groups of students wrote
   and presented research projects on some aspect of the history of the
   book; presentations delivered by the online group were done through
   video using a variety of presentation media including Jing, iMovie, and
   YouTube.
   The wealth of digital content related to the history of the book now
   available from many of the major libraries and museum worldwide offers
   students in the online environment new opportunities for exploring the
   development of knowledge representation. While the digital content does
   not provide the same experience as the physical artifacts (e.g., the
   smell and feel of old manuscripts), it can often facilitate a higher
   level of detailed examination than would be allowed to students working
   with the physical artifacts. The following paper will discuss the
   process involved with developing, delivering, and evaluating the beta
   test of the online version of the course compared with the traditional
   version. Data from student feedback throughout the term was analyzed to
   identify what aspects of the new version were most/least successful,
   including the use of technology both for the delivery of educational
   content and student presentations. Recommendations for future
   changes/enhancement will be presented. The experiences described will be
   relevant not only for educators in the LIS field but also for those
   interested in delivering online content in the areas of museum studies,
   art history, archeology and any other discipline in which face-to-face
   classes have traditionally involved field trips and visits to view
   physical artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{In the Spring of 2014 Copenhagen School of Design \& Technology received
   funding for an experimental research grant to analyze and contextualize
   the school's current use of technologies in learning, and to use this
   research to develop tools to help the lecturers and students qualify
   their choice of digital learning tools.
   An empirical study from 4 different educations revealed heterogeneity of
   ad hoc practices in their choice of technologies to support learning.
   To approach this methodologically, a dialogue tool was developed
   ``Learning Landscape{''} its design is contextualised through ANTtheory
   (Latour, Bruno, n.d.), Social Studies of Knowledge Practices (Law,
   2002), and Situated Learning (Lave, J and Wenger, E, n.d. 1991).
   This paper thus investigates the effects of using a practical method
   that organizes a conscious negotiation between the relevant actors
   involved and accounts for the theoretical foundation of its design.
   In the experimental research we investigated the value of a cocreation
   process between students and lecturers with the goal of engaging
   students in the process of developing blended learning designs working
   from the understanding and values of The Formular of Competences
   Development (Kompetenceformlen) by Knud Illeris (2012). Illeris purports
   that competence development consists of three important aspects that
   will be elaborated on in the paper.
   The dialogue between lecturer and student is framed by the design of a
   ``Learning Landscape{''} a practice where the learning process starts
   with the negotiation of how to plan a course, continues to the practical
   experience and is concluded with internalization through reflection and
   evaluation.
   The design is inspired by the concept of checklists (Gawande, 2011). The
   Learning Landscape helps the students and lecturers to take the
   important details of the blended learning experience into account. It
   does so by guiding actors through the process of discussing choices in
   relevant categories, working with their own learning context, topics and
   learning goals as working case.
   We use the principles from The Decision Model by Poul Heimanns1 (Hansen,
   2010: 137), with two added categories suggested by Jens Jorgen Hansen,
   Ph.d. (Hansen, 2010: 144).
   The two categories, Learning Technologies and Learning Space, draw
   attention to the influence and role that modern digital technologies
   have in education today.
   As part of our research we were conducted tests twice in February 2014
   and a redesigned version will be tested again in May 2014, the results
   from that will be presented at the IATED conference in july 2014.
   Findings
   The tests reveal the method has potential as a knowledge sharing tool
   and as a tool for acknowledging new possibilities in choosing
   technologies for learning. In the cocreation process the students showed
   the need for guidance from the lecturers; to define the importance of
   the project, to acknowledge contributions and to link the activity to
   the students' education and learning.
   Technology and learning as a topic is new to both lecturers and
   students. In this regard some were insecure concerning the goal of the
   dialogue. And technology tends to be discussed through frustrations
   related to malfunctioning facilities (when the WIFI is down e.g.) and
   not through their learning potential.}},

Abstract = {{The modern development of education and the introduction of innovative
   technologies in education suggest the need for new techniques in
   teaching foreign languages. Most of the investigations dedicate a lot of
   their time to the analysis of the ways of new technologies' application
   in the foreign language classroom.
   It is not a secret that nowadays thanks to the process of globalization
   and IT development the educational establishments have an incredible
   opportunity to make use of all the digital resources, network, etc.
   These resources open new frontiers to the learners of any foreign
   language. Among them, we consider advertising texts as one of the
   traditional, but, unfortunately, less used, resources. Usually we
   underestimate the advantages of advertising texts application in the
   foreign language classroom. However, there are still some difficulties
   while introducing the material into the classroom, the reason of which
   are sometimes deep inside the basis of ``teacher-student{''} frame.
   This study focuses on the analysis and review of techniques of
   advertising texts application in teaching of foreign language, the

Abstract = {{The dynamic nature of translator training, set as it is against a
   background of exponential growth in Information and Communication
   Technology, has channelled the ongoing research of a large number of
   University teachers for the last two decades. Innovative teaching
   initiatives have been developed to review the key component of the
   research and teaching conducted in this context.
   Our main objectives have been to implement the current changes under way
   in the Spanish university system; introduce a new didactic model, PATT
   (Professional Approach to Translation Training), designed to coordinate
   the learning taking place in a series of core and elective course
   modules that ran across four years of the undergraduate Translation and
   Interpreting degree program; and adapt PATT model to the Web 2.0
   technologies with the development of new resources (Digital library,
   Open Software library, Social Networks, Wikis, Blogs, etc.).
   This didactic model has grown ever more sophisticated over the years and
   the gradual testing and refinement of transparent assessment tools has
   enabled us to create a learning/teaching environment that draws on the
   most productive aspects of social constructivism to offer learners a
   modern, blended e-learning course environment closely attuned to the
   reality of the Digital Native generation through the rigorous
   integration of Web 2.0 interactive social networks.}},

Abstract = {{In order to explore the relationship between what they think and what
   they do with digital technologies, those professors who work in initial
   teaching training program, this study describes and analyzes the beliefs
   and practices are doing with ICT in teaching activities carried out, by
   113 professors at primary teaching training programs in Chilean
   universities. Through a mixed, sequential exploratory research, a
   standardized questionnaire for to identify beliefs and common uses made
   with ICT in classroom practice was applied. Then, through
   semi-structured interviews, deep descriptions of the performances made
   with these technologies in the lessons was obtained. The analysis of the
   relationships between belief and practice, allows us to show as a
   result, the characterization of four groups of professors, who differs
   by the level of autonomy they give their students in classes. It is
   proposed in conclusion, that the existence of different ways to use
   technology in class is related to the pedagogical choice of professors.}},

Abstract = {{In Russia various projects within the framework of the State program for
   education development for 2013-2020 were initiated. The project ``School
   as a laboratory of Innovation{''} being one of them, it is aimed at the
   development of innovative movement in Russian education, the involvement
   of the educational community in the assessment process of innovation
   educational organizations, as well as dissemination of innovative
   practices among the educational community of the country.
   The creation of educational resource centers is another innovative
   project of Russia to create and maintain educational information space
   of the regions on the basis of regional research educational
   telecommunication networks and regional educational portals. These
   centers are intended for consolidation of educational information
   resources, digital libraries, CD depository, database resources for
   transmission via satellite channel etc.
   In Russian universities foreign language learning including teaching
   Russian as a foreign language to students tends to be professionally
   targeted and focused on professional terminology and genres. But it
   should be directed to achieving both academic and professional goals.
   Learning a foreign language should be aimed at the acquisition of both
   specialized and scientific knowledge, to study the specifics of
   professional and scientific communication. Since the integration of
   science and education is one of the strategic directions of modern
   society development.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to test the complete invariance between
   two different techniques of data collection to see if they can be
   regarded as equivalent. Therefore, we assumed a previously validated
   global model which analyses the existing relationship between the
   features of the teaching methodology used with university students, the
   motivation and the satisfaction. The total sample was constituted by 535
   students of a Spanish public university in different qualifications,
   courses and academic years. 294 questionnaires were completed in paper
   form and 241 were completed digitally through the questionnaire
   developed with a free software programme called LimeSurvey. A
   Confirmatory Factor Analysis was carried out from the multigroup
   structural equation models perspective in order to analyse complete
   invariance, using the program EQS 6.1. Besides the Cronbach's alpha
   coefficient, several goodness-of-fit measures were assessed and a proper
   fit was achieved both in the web-based and paper-based questionnaires
   samples, so it can be accepted that the factor structure of the proposed
   model does not depend on the administration mode of the questionnaire,
   with equal factor loadings, equality of variances in the factors error
   terms and equality of covariances across factors.}},

   particular, the role of the `e-moderator' as pedagogical leader in
   relation to e-learner capabilities. The Pedagogical Variation Model
   (PVM, Rogers 2013) is introduced, which based on a leadership paradigm
   (Bass and Avolio, 2000) that takes the two variables of leadership i.e.
   Transactional (task-giving) and Transformational
   (Motivational/empowering leadership) as the basis for e-moderator
   behaviour. These variables are shown in a 2 x 2 matrix (e.g. similar to
   the Boston Matrix format) while the e-learner behaviours are depicted
   again in a 2 x 2 Matrix with the variables as ``Collaborative
   behaviour{''} and ``Knowledge Construction Capability{''}. When these
   two matrices are overlaid, The Pedagogical Variation Model for online
   Learning and Teaching emerges as a completely innovative
   conceptualisation for both e-moderators and students participating in
   Virtual Spaces.
   The PVM was developed through a hypothetico-deductive methodology
   (Popper, 2002) whereby rigorous attempts were made to falsify the model
   with samples of experienced, e-moderator practitioners. The model
   up-to-date has withstood attempts of falsification, giving rise to the
   validity of the conceptual framework upon which the PVM is based.
   Furthermore the research was carried out using the methodology of
   Personal Construct Psychology (PCP, Kelly 1955) whereby respondents were
   provided with a set of six elements (i.e. online e-moderator
   competencies) namely socialising, scaffolding, knowledge construction,
   weaving, summarising and archiving. From these six elements interviewees
   were given the opportunity to select a set of triads (i.e. three
   elements at a time). By applying a formula to determine the number of
   possible triads from a set of six elements interviewees had the
   opportunity to select their triads from a total of twenty possible
   triads. The next stage in the PCP method then invited interviewees to
   identify two elements from their selected triad which were seen to be
   similar and asked to give reason(s) and also to provide reason(s) why
   the third or odd-one-out was different from the other two. By following
   this research procedure a vast number of elicitations proved invaluable
   in supporting the PVM through successful corroboration.
   Future research could be the development of diagnostic tools for
   e-moderator evaluation of e-learner capabilities and e-learner
   preferences regarding the selection of a particular online learning
   environment. It is suggested that effective online teaching is dependent
   not only on e-learner context but also on e-moderators' pedagogical
   leadership. The PVM is an attempt to show how adaptations in design and
   delivery can be made in asynchronous learning networks (ALNs), in order
   to motivate and facilitate successful outcomes for e-learners, whether
   they are digital natives or digital immigrants (Prensky 2001).
   Online course providers and developers may use the PVM as a blueprint
   for exploring ways of implementing new emerging learning technologies
   fit for the 21st Century.}},

Abstract = {{The innovative and creative use of technologies in learning and
   education is dramatically influencing teaching and learning paradigms
   and learner's experiences by replacing traditional learning in many
   countries. ICT enhanced learning, open educational resources and the
   associated digital technologies, applications and contents are rapidly
   evolving, which in turn continuously changes and affecting the benefits,
   effectiveness, and impact on learning outcomes. The impact of online
   learning platform needs to be assessed regularly to ensure its usability
   and usefulness through solving possible errors and suggest improvement.
   However, because of the novelty and diversity of ICT tools and emerging
   digital technologies in the educational context and the complexity of
   factors affecting their outcomes, measuring the impact is a challenge
   task. Impact assessment has always shown great potential for improving
   ICT based systems and tailoring it toward users' requirements,
   satisfaction and stakeholders' expectations. Despite of the importance
   of this field, still there is a lack of research on the measurement of
   the impact of the learning platforms themselves or their efficiency and
   effectiveness. This research investigates the methodology to develop a
   framework for measuring impact of an eLearning platform. The framework
   proposed in this paper is developed for measuring the impact of an Open
   eLearning and innovation platform, known as Open Discovery Space (ODS),
   which aims to provide open contents, technologies, services, scenarios,
   lesson plans, and tools for the teachers and schools communities across
   the Europe particularly and globally at large. The developed impact
   evaluation framework proposing in this paper provides the methodological
   steps for measuring the impact on areas such as regional curricula;
   schools; educational systems; the use and usability platform; teaching
   and learning outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The Font del Ferro Institute has organized and held the first Practicum
   in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Secondary School (IARO) in
   november 22th of 2013. The definition of Practicum is: the practical
   part of a training activity in which a student participates. The essence
   of practicum IARO is practice to learn and learning by doing under the
   slogan: we do learn, we do not compete, we do share. The Practicum
   connotation suggests the practical activities related to intuitive type
   that we have studied or received training in the theoretical, ie to
   practice what I have previously learned and, if it means practice,
   practice.
   IARO has also been widely disseminated with the reference: ``Conference
   on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Education{''}. This
   educational activity provides a practical orientation, with modern,
   innovative and captivating tools. It has the clear intent and purpose of
   conducting practice of what we have learned with the aim of promoting
   the mathematical, scientific, digital and technological competences. The
   main educational level involved in IARO is the secondary school.
   The general goal of this event is to integrate the student in a learning
   environment bridging its knowledge with the professional entities which
   applies robotics and intelligent systems like related to the actual
   practice of professional role to play. This will enable him about the
   acquisition of knowledge, information, skills and competencies necessary
   to practice in a particular area of the labor market.
   The methodology of this Practicum is based on robotics challenges done
   by the students which is divided in two stages. In the first stage, each
   team presents an oral presentation of their robot and also some robotics
   experiences they have had during the preparation phase. This challenge
   has to be emphasized with the exhibition of the mechanical robot
   features, a brief description of the software and the applied code and
   furthermore, a real robot application. The presentations, made entirely
   by students, were exposed to a mixed audience composed of students from
   various institutes and schools, teachers and professionals.
   A second stage includes a basic training oriented to real cases, from
   the perspective of professional entities. Interesting topics were
   discussed like educational artificial intelligence, 3D printing,
   industrial robotics and mobile. These professionals offered the most
   up-to-date information on their research area and also their expertise
   applied in the fields associated with the practicum, indicated in the
   activity program. Furthermore, there was an exhibition consisting of
   various robots and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, shared
   among students of various educational centers open to the public. It was
   focused on the students, the main protagonists.
   Keep in mind that when it comes to putting into practice we inevitably
   talk about skills and core competencies specifically given that we
   propose a model applicable to any typology and profile of students with
   their merits and virtues. So we will make a brief reference to the
   powers from the point of view first and second with a formal academic
   projection.
   The evaluation of the activity was performed by satisfaction surveys and
   the result was very positive. Finally, the interaction among the
   participants at the beginning and at the end of the conference as well
   as the comments done by the professionals and teachers suggests us
   remarkable aspects to incorporate more content in future editions.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of digital transformation, the use of information and
   communication technologies (ICT) has become as a must in order to
   achieve more people with affordable prices. Hence, in the delivery of
   psychological testing, the psychologists, counselors, and other experts
   become more and more integrated into the use of the ICT. Such
   integration would not only help to achieve more people, particularly
   those who are under privilege, but would also improve the quality,
   flexibility, and the rapidness of the services. In the global era, the
   importance of psychological testing has been markedly increasing in
   education as well in business world. However, the accessing more people
   and preparing the reports for those people are expensive and need more
   time. Therefore, most of the counseling and psychology based centers and
   institutions have preferred to use intensively the psychological testing
   by using ICT.
   This paper has focused on the usage of ICT on psychological testing in
   one of the selected public university in Turkey. The aim is to find out
   why psychologists and counselors, and even students use ICT on
   psychological testing and their perceptions and expectations about this
   new service. A simple random sampling was chosen to select 38
   undergraduate students who had taken the psychological testing online.
   Additionally, two psychologists and three counselors, who had been using
   ICT on psychological testing more than 8 months, were engaged to the
   research. In the research study, the phenomenological analysis had been
   preferred by giving nine research questions. The participants had
   answered why they used this service, and what were their perceptions and
   expectations in the semi-structured interviews.
   By using Atlas. ti 7, the collected data were studied critically. The
   findings of this study revealed that the psychologists and counselors
   use ICT on psychological testing for reaching more students. More
   importantly, according to the participants as experts, the number of
   attendance has increased significantly because of the flexibility of
   time and space. Additionally, the quality of testing has improved
   dramatically due to the ICT's effectiveness and efficiencies in
   collecting and storing data. Furthermore, as the psychologists and
   counselors point out, they have spent less time in reporting and they
   find better opportunities to collect more data and to make comparative
   studies. On the other hand, according to them, even though their
   perceptions and expectations about using ICT on psychological testing
   are negative at the beginning, they change after seeing the positive
   sides for themselves as well for the students.
   Furthermore, most of the students (98\%) clarify that they enjoy being
   parts of this service since it is easy, friendly use, flexible,
   attractive, and innovative. Since they can access even through the
   social media, the large number of the students (86\%) have clarified
   that integration of ICT through the use of chat rooms, email and social
   networking, they become more interested and being aware about certain
   aspects. Even though a large number of them (91\%) say that they like to
   have face-to-face relationship with the psychologists and counselors,
   they all agree that ICT increase visibility, affordability, and
   accessibility of the service. In conclusion, the study recommends that
   ICT would play important roles to achieve more and more students with a
   few experts since they increase capacity building by improving
   visibility, affordability, and accessibility of the service.}},

Abstract = {{Technological innovations have transformed and renovated
   teaching-learning processes. The merging of technology and pedagogy is
   patent, for example, in collaborative learning mediated by ICT.
   The presence of ICT in the classroom poses the need for new learning
   methods that can take full advantage of the value added contributed by
   ICT, since new skills and competences relating to the new technologies
   have to be developed For this reason, ICT-mediated collaborative
   learning methodologies are becoming increasingly important in the
   context of educational innovation and their study is fundamental for
   creating new initiatives to foster them.
   The University of Salamanca and the International Centre for Advanced
   Technologies (CITA) are carrying out ICT-mediated collaborative work in
   the context of School 2.0. One example of this work is the ACOTIC
   (Collaborative Learning through ICT) project, aimed at studying cases of
   collaborative learning in the third cycle of Primary Education (ages
   10-11), in order to gain an understanding of these learning processes
   and the role played by ICT in them. To carry out this study, a series of
   data collection tools were created that allow these collaborative
   processes to be analysed. The instrument consists of an observation
   scale the dimensions of which are related to study of the context,
   characteristics of the ICT elements present in the classroom, location
   of the resources, methodology, role study, assessment and communicative
   competences. Within each of these dimensions a series of observable
   items is established in an attempt to determine the quality,
   consistency, efficiency, motivation and level of cooperation present in
   the collaborative project under scrutiny.
   This paper is presented by the teams of GITE (Research Group in
   Educational Technology) and CITA in order to present the scale created
   ad hoc to interpret the evidence obtained from the observations. It was
   constructed taking into account the study and decision-making of the
   most significant items when compiling concrete data on these
   ICT-mediated collaborative learning processes.
   The data collected through the tool we designed has made it possible for
   us to confirm the results of observation of the collaborative working
   dynamics using ICT in the classroom of the last two years of Primary
   Education. To date we are able to affirm that learning processes carried
   out using apps on digital tablets enable collaborative learning and
   knowledge management through ICT.}},

Abstract = {{The IMAILE project is the first unique project on a European level which
   addresses the area of the ICT in the field of Education and e - learning
   both from the demand side and the supply side. The project takes an
   innovative grip on shifting research and innovation to become more
   customized and to be based on the actual needs from the end - users (
   our European schools, teachers and students).
   The IMAILE consortium believes that our actual situation and problems
   have one common origin the lack of customized ICT products/ services
   merging from the demand side (our European schools) In order to change
   this scenario partners in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Austria,
   Portugal and Spain together has developed the IMAILE project based on
   the PCP method (Pre - commercial - procurement) An instrument recommend
   by the Commission that stimulates a dialogue between public procurers
   representing the demand side and industry/ SME as suppliers on the other
   side.
   PCP requires one identified and common challenge and the IMAILE
   consortium has identified and decided to focus upon the challenge of an
   increased demand of personalized learning where new technology should
   support schools and teachers in an innovative and creative way. The
   suppliers should provide innovative solutions of the next generation PLE
   (personal learning environment) that address students in primary and
   secondary school in the topics Science, Math and Technology (STEM) and
   that support different learning styles with the following personal
   content:
   Content and digital curricula of STEM topics, self assessment
   Tools for collaboration, communication, cooperation with others
   Classroom management (interaction with teachers for planning and
   selecting the tools, assessment according to 21st century skills)
   Connectedness, parents, wider community, other students
   The innovative PLE technology/ solutions shall bring the following
   effects to meet our demands:
   Support to teachers and students in primary/ secondary education within
   Science, Math and Technology
   Reduce the planning hours for the teachers
   Support all students to reach their goals in a personalized way (gifted
   and with special needs)
   Create more 1 to 1 meetings between teacher and student in the classroom
   Increases the motivation to learn for our students using creative and
   collaborative learning methods in a personalized way
   Create a real shift from teacher centered learning to student centered
   learning (research shows that lessons in math and science still is
   mostly teacher-centered, with few opportunities for the students to have
   influence on their own learning and using digital tool).
   Be applicable to all devices (not fully BYOD concept) but our solution
   should be a tool that replicates the students' personal devices.
   and to all learning styles (tactile, visual auditory)
   Reduce the numbers of early drop outs

Abstract = {{The European Convergence involved, even before its final implementation,
   the need to rethink the model of university education. It also implied
   the need to incorporate new experiences of innovation based on the use

   After years of experience in teaching innovation, this paper analyses
   three experiences of innovation supported by the use of ICT in Labour
   and Social Security Law in the School of Labour Studies at the
   University of Murcia. These experiences reflect on three representative
   cases: a pilot experience in Labour Sciences Degree through the Open
   Course Ware (2008-2009), the continuous participation in the university
   teaching innovation project for the production of syllabi in a subject
   that is part of the Degree in Labour Relationships and Human Resources

Abstract = {{Middle and high school students in the 21st century are using ever more
   powerful cyberspace and interactive digital media in their everyday
   lives. This includes such activities as communicating with friends,
   locating information on things that interests them, and interacting with
   an ever growing circle of ``friends{''} through social networking media.
   This is a picture of students who are creative, motivated and
   collaborative. However, what students do outside of school typically
   stands in stark contrast to what happens in the classroom, including
   science classrooms, which often involves: teachers introducing a concept
   verbally, typically through lecture, and then using a ``cookbook{''}
   activity to illustrate and ``verify{''} the concepts they just
   presented, and finishing with end-of-chapter questions in which students
   practice using the new concept. In these teacher-directed textbook and
   lecture-based science classrooms, students often appear passive,
   unmotivated and disengaged (Osborne, Simon \& Collins, 2003). They tend
   to learn by memorizing the various concepts, terms, and facts (Gobert,
   Pallant, \& Daniels, 2010) rather than through engaging in
   content-integrated scientific practices as called for in the Next
   Generation Science Standards {[}NGSS] (NRC, 2013) and the new national
   framework for K-12 science education (NRC, 2012).
   This paper reports on the preliminary results of a National Science
   Foundation supported grant project on Water Awareness Research and
   Education-Research Experience for Teachers (WARE-RET at the University
   of South Florida. WARE-NET is a three-year, immersive opportunity for
   middle and high school teachers in Hillsborough County Public Schools,
   as well as pre-service teachers from the College of Education, to
   participate in structured research, training, and professional
   development in the STEM fields. As part of the project, inservice and
   preservice teachers also collaborated with graduate students in
   engineering and instructional technology to develop innovative
   e-learning modules that bring the cutting-edge research experience to
   the middle and high school classrooms. In Fall 2013 and Spring 2014,
   eight scenario-based interactive inquiry-based serious games were
   developed by graduate students in an instructional technology class in
   collaboration with the pre-service, inservice teachers, and engineering
   graduate students and faculty. The iterative module development process
   as well as the preliminary implementation results will be presented in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{C2Learn (www.c2learn.eu) is an ongoing European research project aimed
   at fostering co-creativity in learning: learners, individually as well
   as mainly collaboratively and also communally, come up with novelty that
   has emerged through shared ideas and actions and which involves
   participants taking account of the impact of that novelty. Playfulness
   and in particular digital gaming constitute our chosen means for learner
   involvement. Game design defines the elements of learners' playful
   digital experiences and produces the specifications for the development
   of the corresponding digital games and other playful activities.
   Importantly, also, end-user school communities are engaged in iterative
   dialogic cycles leading to the various design decisions and their
   implementation. The paper particularly focuses on educational scenarios,
   i. e. the aspect of the design of the C2Learn solution which is most
   strongly shaped by the collaborating school communities and framed by
   their educational realities. They are a design tool aiming to provide
   input directly from educational practice, so that the innovative
   technologies deployed and practices introduced will correspond to the
   needs, circumstances, expectations and aspirations of the end users. At
   the same time, they illustrate to the world of education the range of
   possibilities offered and examples of effective use of the C2Learn
   solution. Educational scenarios remain open to elaboration and
   refinement throughout the project.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, technology is a part of education. According to Prensky (2001)
   students are ``digital native{''} and their needs have changed regarding
   how to learn. As a result, teaching methodologies have also changed,
   understanding the importance of using digital resources and materials to
   keep pace with their students.
   In this context it's necessary for schools to be aware of all the
   possibilities that technology can offer. At the same time, it's
   important for businesses that offer technological solutions for teaching
   know the real needs of teachers and schools. For this reason, ITwolrdEdu
   (ITWE) was born with the objective to be the most important summit which
   brings together both users and providers of educational solutions and
   services.
   Since 2008, ITworldEdu takes place in Barcelona every year. Over the
   first five editions it has brought together a total of more than four
   thousand participants.
   ITWE connects the educational community with the information and
   communication technological sector through in various formats:
   conferences, round tables, best practices presentations, bilateral
   meetings, networking spaces and ITworldEdu awards.
   ITWE gives technology providers a space to present their educational
   technology solutions to the education sector that includes all types of
   education and training for public and private sectors, that is, formal
   and non-formal education, primary, secondary, university and lifelong
   learning, etc.
   ITWE is presented in three different environments: the classroom
   environment (learning, teaching, and digital contents tools);
   organizational management (tools for the management of educational
   organisations/centres) and the educational community (tools facilitating
   the relationships among the different members of the educational
   community).
   The conclusions drawn from the summit are also presented in the same
   three environments. The main results have confirmed that changes in
   society and the new needs of students demand a new model of teaching and
   learning that integrates technology in schools. In addition, the
   conclusions verify that the educational community believes in the
   possibility of technology as the key for real change to innovate
   education.}},

Abstract = {{Recent teaching approaches of emphasize the role of technology-enhanced
   environments in science learning: such environments allow learners to
   explore scientific phenomena interactively. Multimedia and
   computer-based tools enable learners to perform complex learning
   activities. One such approach is Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE)
   where students work together in small groups and the instructor serves
   as a facilitator or ``coach{''} instead of a lecturer. IBSE is a
   student-centered active learning strategy focused on questioning to
   discover natural laws, linking information into a meaningful context,
   developing critical thinking and promoting positive attitudes towards
   science. In this pedagogical method the students are guided through
   investigations to ``discover{''} concepts. In line with these current
   trends about developing learning sequences in science education we have
   designed innovative inquiry oriented lessons aiming at providing
   university students a comprehensive understanding of Physics principles.
   The developed units make an extensive use of ICT-based tools such as
   video analysis, capture of movement with high-speed digital camera and
   Moodle platform. In the present academic year we have implemented these
   units based on the Inquiry-Based Physics philosophy in the programme of
   Physics I for the grade of Mechanical Engineering in the University of
   Malaga. We present in this communication the followed process and
   results obtained for the lesson of Momentum, Impulse and Collisions.
   Preliminary studies showed a relevant evolvement in student ` s
   understanding of concepts in momentum conservation and its application
   to collisions between two bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Current economic problems have reinforced the already strong sense of
   uncertainty and risk associated with the end of classic models of public
   education; potentially limiting opportunities and educational access to
   the detriment of social trajectories. As digital technologies become
   pervasive in society. HEIs have an opportunity for expanding engagements
   and promoting new partnerships of learning and assessment. We aim to
   collaborate with community and employer led initiatives to create
   innovative and flexible learning assessment protocols. The FAIR
   assessment tool provides a progression framework incorporating the
   recognition of prior learning, initial profiling, personal development
   mapping, variable assessment mechanisms and routes to accreditation
   including achievement from real life and work based experiences.
   The digital FAIR assessment tool will be an easy to access portfolio
   building and personal profiling space providing access to supported
   self-assessment and stepping stones to educational resources and
   qualifications. Profiling and self-assessment is a means by which to
   capture experience and its learning impact and value the existing
   aptitudes of the individual. The aim is to avert failure and build on
   the existing strengths of the individual or enhance their skills,
   competencies and attitudinal habits.
   The FAIR assessment project will develop a co-operative approach to
   designing and delivering affordable and accessible education, learning
   and skills development suitable for post-16 engagement. This context
   centred experiential learning framework provides a comprehensive open
   curriculum shell that can absorb or adapt to negotiated and participant
   derived content.
   This project aims to develop confidence in the inexperienced learner;
   recognising their independent strengths, capitalising on their learning
   assets and moving forward in their personal journey towards improved
   educational rewards.
   The initiative will have a direct impact on communities in Salford
   through collaboration with the Salford Community Learning Trust, the
   City Council, the University, Salford City College and various
   communityled networks. It has the potential to replicate its processes
   and sytems in other educational partnerships and is currently
   corresponding to parallel development in other UK contexts; Bradford,
   Middlesex and Glasgow.
   The combined aim of this practice will:
   Establish a broad and inclusive collaborative framework to review and
   adapt the digital badges.
   Create a review process that will develop robust systems of 360 degree
   assessment incorporating personal, peer, associate, mentor, employer and
   educator input.
   Test a comprehensive progression framework and learner managed portfolio
   system with individual participants in a supportive and networked
   environment.
   The method of delivery places emphasis on peer to peer guidance,
   facilitator feedback and employer consultation to develop the
   functionality and design of the on-line tool. The FAIR assessment too is
   conceived as a modelled framework constructed from open source software
   that allows accessible transfer and widespread usability. What is
   proposed is a reflective and continuous learning tool that will allow
   the learner to improve and refine their own, personalised educational
   information personal narrative and expression.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyse the organization and development of two different
   e-learning MSc. programmes regarding to sustainability and protection of
   natural resources in the frame of the Erasmus multilateral projects.
   Environment is facing an accelerated climate change as a result of
   global warming, mainly for human activities, even in remote areas. In
   the other hand, population has migrated to big cities and consequently
   has abandoned the rural areas. The promoter of this project, Technical
   University of Madrid (UPM), among their partners have identified a clear
   lack of educational provision regarding Climate Change, Degraded Land
   and Ecotourism, in both educational and non-educational settings. In
   this context, we have developed two different programmes in order to
   alleviate these hazards by providing adequate training on Climate
   Change, Sustainability and Ecological Tourism. The first program: MSc
   Degree on Management of Sustainable and Ecological Tourism (MEST) is
   focused in tourism alternatives and natural heritage preservation,
   trying to combine conservation of nature with socioeconomic development
   of many local communities. Thus, it establishes a link between local
   people, tourists and nature. The second program: MSc Programme in
   Climate Change and Restoration of Degraded Lands (RECLAND) is dedicated
   to land recover and climate change effects on land and its uses, as well
   as degradation of soil and vegetation that aggravate the emission of
   greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Thus, three subjects were defined:
   climate change, degraded land and land restoration.
   The study of climate change and degraded land, as well as sustainable
   and ecological tourism, requires innovative techniques in teaching that
   will be analysed and discussed in this manuscript. UPM and their
   partners are expertise in developing tailored e-learning programmes and
   their strengths rely on their ability to adapt ICT solutions to the
   particular needs of the educators by incorporating the latest
   developments in communication. These techniques should be integrated
   among the various project partners, which increase the difficulty of
   applying homogeneous bases. The two examples of Master Erasmus
   programmes provide details regarding to the documentation, project
   management, teaching strategies such as Virtual Learning Platform that
   contains learning materials in a digital format including text,
   audio-material, images and video-material, meetings as a tester
   workshops organized in participating countries, future interaction with
   the student, etc. The target groups are responsible for: 1) assess
   proposed MSc modules 2) make recommendations for fine tuning of modules,
   3) participate on tester workshops, 4) enrol on pilot MSc course and 5)
   prepare students for the regional and global postgraduate job market.
   Finally, the document is intended as an aid to future teachers to detect
   a lack of training in an area that affects the environment in Europe so
   they can propose a training program, innovative and high acceptance
   towards the Graduates of Business and Planning faculties who intend to
   work in the infrastructure projects, graduates of environmental
   faculties who intend to specialise in Climate Change, Sustainability and
   Ecological Tourism management}},

Abstract = {{The research project aimed at developing a digital book for deaf
   children based on a bilingual perspective, which is the object of this
   paper, is supported by the National Council of Scientific and
   Technological Development (CNPq), an agency of Brazil's Ministry of
   Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). Its main attributions are to
   promote scientific and technological research and stimulate researcher
   training in the country. The research is being carried out within the
   ambit of the Interdisciplinary Design/Education Laboratory - Arts \&
   Design Department at Pontifical University Catholic of Rio de Janeiro
   (LIDE|DAD|PUC-Rio). From 2004 to 2007, the LIDE team developed a
   research project called `Multi-Tracks: a game to assist in acquiring a
   second language by deaf children'. The public for this project was deaf
   children enrolled in elementary school at the National Institute of Deaf
   Education of Rio de Janeiro - INES/RJ. With the objective of moving
   forward with the Multi-Tracks project, which resulted in a game with two
   versions, one a board game, and the other in multimedia, the intention
   is to create a digital children's book with interactivity possibilities,
   comprised of scenes narrated in LIBRAS and written Portuguese. The
   narrative will be defined together with pedagogues and teachers of deaf
   children. The proposal will also consider joint artistic creation, in
   which the author, illustrator, animator, programmer, sound person and
   narrator work in partnership The intention is to take Multi-Tracks to a
   new platform, since the content to be created will be provided in
   tablets, and/or similar support, aimed at innovating the
   teaching-learning process for deaf children. Based on the skills and
   competences determined by the Laws for Guidelines and Bases for
   Children's and Elementary Education (Law no. 9.394/96 - Law for
   Guidelines and Bases for National Education, BRASIL, 1996), the stories
   in their hard copy or digital formats stimulate vocabulary and provide
   countless gains in skills for children, including deaf children. In this
   sense, the study includes discussions on issues related to Design and to
   contemporary languages in education. For such, hypermedia concepts in
   educational environments will be examined, giving priority to
   interaction, user experience and the role of teaching-learning for deaf
   children.}},

Abstract = {{The gradual progress of mobile devices, together with the wide
   availability of educational content in both free and paid form, has
   encouraged the spread of different models of learning and training. This
   evolution has seen a gradual shift of the models of learning towards
   greater personalization and self-management of pathways to access
   content, and therefore a substantial differentiation in the rhythm and
   pace of learning. The transformation of the user experience also
   requires attentive reflection on the language and the meaning of
   monitoring and the requirements of tutoring, in relation to a learning
   process that transforms, expands and is enriched through the addition of
   new and diversified input.
   From the point of view of organizations, in fact, mobile learning
   requires a greater structuring of the contents, in order to make the
   profiling of users possible, the adoption of different languages and the
   use of different times for studying that may be segmented into short and
   immediate experiences.
   In this sense, a learning model based on learning experiences, which is
   concise and effective, in a sequence and structure suitable for the
   user, and above all with a strong dimension offline, requires a
   substantial revision of the organizational models of classic e-learning
   systems.
   The major challenge for organizations is to manage the entry of new
   paradigms of learning by adapting or transforming the organizational
   model of business education.
   The introduction of learning that can be enjoyed even on mobile devices,
   in fact, opens the doors to a new perspective, which on the one hand
   incorporates new categories of workers traditionally excluded from
   e-learning due to the lack of places to study, while on the other hand
   it places new demands on teaching by shifting the focus of training from
   monitoring usage and the results obtained, towards the personalization
   and empowerment of individual self-learning particularly offline.
   To make the prospects of employing mobile devices feasible, in the field
   of organizations, it therefore becomes important to define patterns and
   areas of intervention.
   The creation of an editor of digital content -oriented towards
   organizations both online and offline, provided us with an opportunity
   to reflect on these issues and to come up with an initial response to
   the management of the process of change of e-learning. This paper
   intends to analyse the emerging demands within the organization, trying
   to answer the following questions:
   a) How can the training model be changed so as to conduct training
   courses and e-learning in business using mobile devices?
   b) What instances are generated to control the training from the point
   of view of the organization?
   c) What are the advantages and opportunities for those who have to
   organize training and also for the user?
   d) How to manage a mobile - based course including the personalization
   of the study path?
   e) How to change the information needs of the organization?
   f) How can you monitor your training?
   g) How does the process of tutoring in mobile learning work?}},

Abstract = {{Nurses make clinical decisions and provide information and treatment
   ``in the moment{''}. In turn, professional nursing practice must be
   sensitive, effective, and responsive to patient needs and have the
   capacity to adjust to changing circumstances. Professional nursing
   practice must also be based on an appreciation of the right of
   healthcare recipients to information that is both understandable and
   timely and which supports patient decision-making and
   self-determination. This balance of patient-centred approaches and
   evidence-based decision-making is central to quality nursing practice
   and commonly underscores nursing curricula (Edgar, 2013). However,
   translating these concepts into practice reality is challenging.
   This presentation summarizes an innovative technology-enhanced
   teaching-learning-practice approach. Second year nursing students at the
   University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) and Durham College
   (DC) participated in trialing the use of iPad mini devices for both
   practicum and classroom learning. Through this
   teaching-learning-practice innovation, both evidence and knowledge
   translation (patient teaching) strategies are placed in the hands of
   future healthcare providers as they are learning their profession and
   directly at the point of care. Enhancing nursing student digital
   literacy skills and moving them beyond the classroom to the point of
   care has potential to impact both the healthcare experience of patients
   and the practice experiences and attitudes of nursing students
   (Johansson, Petersson, Saveman \& Nilsson, 2012; Schlairet, 2012).
   Findings to date from mixed method data collection will be presented.
   Student perspectives on the benefits and challenges associated with the
   movement toward technology at the point of care will be discussed. Next
   steps in terms of expanded research will be presented.}},

Abstract = {{B-learning (blended learning) usually combines classical face-to-face
   classroom methods and computer-mediated activities. It emerges to
   overcome the total absence of human contact in the e-learning
   (electronic learning) which tends to compromise the learning outcomes.
   Professors have an important role in oral explanations and at the same
   new technologies also offer some advantages. Related to the face to face
   methods, they can be partially replaced by virtual classrooms (in mobile
   devices, m-learning) and computer-mediated activities can include
   pre-recorded lectures to improve this method. In this way, students, in
   some subjects, can receive the face education from anywhere without the
   necessity of being physically at the same location where the class
   physically takes place. Therefore, students who do not have the means or
   time to be present can benefit from the advantages of receiving the
   student class anywhere. This paper will explain experiences on Masters,
   Seminars and Courses conducted at the Universidad Catolica of Avila
   (UCAV) and Universidad Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M) during the 2013-2014
   academic year, which has combined both specialties b-learning and
   m-learning. They have combined the (physical or virtual) face education
   taught by teachers with computer-mediated activities.
   Master of Forestry Engineering, Remote Sensing Seminar and GIS
   (Geographical Information Systems) course applied to the Territorial
   Planning could be followed, depending on the personal student
   circumstances, either in person at Universidad Catolica of Avila or from
   their own homes or mobiles devices in virtual classroom (through the
   Blackboard Collaborate platform). Live Audio \& Video panel,
   Participants panel, dynamic Collaboration toolbar whit digital
   slideshows provided students access to the same presentation they would
   see in the actual lecture hall. Chat simulated conversations students
   would have in study groups. Virtual classroom simulated a real-world
   interaction asking frequently questions and using tools as raising hands
   and stepping away from the session and menus for selecting polling
   responses and feedback options. Main drawbacks resulted from video
   issues, poor Internet connections, and mainly Java updating and firewall
   issues. Training (workshop for teachers) and technical support are both
   very important to obtain good results in the frame of virtual
   classrooms.
   Industrial Engineering Master at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid was
   composed of a series of slideshow material focusing on the background
   that the student should master previously to the Master Courses
   ({''}0-course{''}) and pre-recorded lectures offered in moodle-like
   platforms. Students could consult them several times or choose the parts
   of the presentation they need to listen at with more attention. These
   pre-recorded videos were useful to close the gap of some students in a
   not too large interval of time, so they could also focus on the proper
   Master Course subjects. At the same time, students who already had the
   necessary background on the considered topics also took profit of these
   lectures, by consolidating their knowledge on the basis and strengthen
   its application to real practical engineering problems.
   This article will talk about these experiences, academic results and
   discuss about the benefits and drawbacks found by the implementation of
   these techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The `third age' of human life is becoming noticeably longer, which on
   one hand generates a need for elderly people's adaptation to information
   and communication technology (ICT) and on the other offers additional
   opportunities for elderly to obtain ICT skills. Due to demographic
   changes, empowered elderly people are also important from societal
   perspective; e therefore the competence and experience of elderly people
   will be absolutely crucial in the future in order to stabilise economies
   and to maintain the overall competence of the societies. As there are
   claims that digital ICTs have the potential to support elderly people to
   live independently, and self-reliantly in a manner to `age well', to
   promote social inclusion and to facilitate access to commercial and
   government services (e.g. eHealth services) a study of elderly people's
   willingness to adapt ICT based on multiplier blended learning paradigm
   has been performed in scope of the PRIMER-ICT project.
   The main objective of the PRIMER - ICT project was to intensively
   promote the use of ICT among elderly people, and to help them adapt to
   ICT and gain ICT skills by using inter-generational and multi - sectoral
   approach which was based on blended learning paradigm. In the
   personalized teaching method, the training for the elderly people
   started two steps away from the actual ICT training courses designed for
   them; with educating the teachers and multipliers with various
   backgrounds such as health, nursing, community nursing and ICT. A study
   was performed during ICT training courses for elderly people where
   different self-assessed variables concerned with the success of teaching
   and its use in real world were assessed. The training courses for
   elderly people were led by the multipliers mainly in the academic
   domain, elderly homes (care homes), day and community centres and lasted
   three days. The maximum group size was 5-8 elderly participants who
   worked in mobile e-classrooms consisting of 5 - 8 portable computers. In
   addition to well-developed course materials and individual work with
   multipliers, elderly were further motivated to participate in the
   courses with videoconferencing, Nintendo Wii games and small awards.
   Altogether there were 146 elderly people included in the study from
   Austria, Ireland, Slovenia and UK.
   Elderly people significantly improved their ICT skills during the
   intensive courses. However, one month after the completion of the
   training course, skill level slightly decreased. The project generated a
   great interest among elderly people, especially in elderly homes and
   other organisations connected to elderly people. The primary reason for
   the success of the project is the development of the innovative three
   levelled educational scheme (Multiplier based blended learning
   paradigm), intergenerational cooperation and the inclusion of
   well-trained multipliers into the learning process.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of digital distance
   learning tools such as Open Educational Resources (OERs) and Massive
   Open Online Courses (MOOCs), all of which present traditional education
   systems and structures with exciting new opportunities, but also some
   challenges. Properly exploited, these new resources thus have a huge
   amount to offer: they can promote knowledge-sharing and intercultural
   communication; they can broaden access to education, by enabling
   teaching and learning to take place virtually anywhere; and in their
   ability to reach large numbers of learners, including by creating
   virtual communities of common interest, they can increase
   cost-efficiency. Furthermore, by their very nature they can promote
   innovation in education and new methodologies. At a broader level, the
   EU is in danger of lagging behind other regions of the world in this
   field. Therefore there is a need for thinking ``out of the box{''} and
   try to create large scale and nationwide research and testing
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{In times of economic, political, ethnic and national divisions main
   issues that should be discussed at faculties are related to the cultural
   being and its survival, whether it belonged to the so-called great, or
   popularly called endangered languages. The language, as an essential
   marker of cultural identity, enables the search for meaning, cultural
   and historical identity, and in a broader sense the national being.
   Considering that the preservation and fostering of linguistic and
   cultural diversity of the human species is equally important as is the
   care for biodiversity for the survival of man and nature, the duty of
   every individual, a philologist above all, is to preserve linguistic
   diversity, in order to preserve the cultural heritage and autonomous
   view of the world. Faculties of Philology are the natural bases for such
   ideas, considering that languages are thought through their programs not
   only by mastering the vocabulary, morphology, syntax, phonetics of
   language, but also by comprehending the history, culture, literature and
   spirituality of a particular nation.
   The Council of Europe, European Parliament, European Commission, United
   Nations, UNESCO, and with them all of us who are in constant
   communication with them throughout various projects, continually draw
   attention to the need for lifelong learning of foreign languages, as
   well as to the necessity to increase plurilingualism as a precondition
   of multicultural understanding. The efforts of the European institutions
   to make available the most important documents to as many languages as
   possible, to support philological studies, especially studies of
   simultaneous and consecutive interpretation, to overcome language
   barriers by expanding the channels of communication via the Internet,
   digital media, databases, distance learning, enable easier migration of
   students and teachers, are leading to increase of multilingualism, but
   also to a higher rate of competitiveness of individuals in a labor
   market.
   Faculty of Philology of the University of Belgrade strives at designing
   optimal study program successfully incorporating foreign language and
   cultural studies in accordance with national and international
   recommendations, by developing modularity and electiveness of
   philological and cultural courses to foster plurilingualism. Hence, it
   is our intention to link language studies with other scientific fields,
   such as the study of literature, librarianship, museology, but above all
   with cultural studies. This could be achieved by educating staff who
   will, upon graduation, possess appropriate language competences, as well
   as pedagogical-psychological and methodical knowledge and who will
   strive to transfer European democratic values to their students,
   enabling them to be open for a dialogue of cultures and making them
   self-conscious in promoting their own. The final result of such study
   program would be the development of multicultural society, entirely
   ready and able to cooperate with other communities. This paper will
   indicate language learning innovations, as well as design and
   development of a new curriculum at the Faculty of Philology of the
   University of Belgrade.}},

Abstract = {{Facilitation is proved to improve group problem-solving effectiveness,
   research new concepts and innovative solutions. This paper addresses
   facilitation role during a creative session in the digital environment.
   We evaluate existing collaborative software based on the metaphor of the
   sticky note and we show that they are designed for use without
   necessarily taking into account the presence of a facilitator. They
   offer however, a set of functions that are relevant to the group and its
   individuals. According to our findings, we suggest a set of principal
   features to fully integrate the role of the facilitator into digital
   creativity sessions.}},

Abstract = {{From the analysis of manufacturing process flow of aluminum wires,
   carried out on the rolling mills at ALRO Slatina Company, in Romania,
   the authors of this paper have found that significant losses in end
   product occur, in shape of wire coils, because of the conceptual
   shortcomings of the machine located at the flow output - the winding
   machine. These shortcomings lead often to a variable winding pitch,
   around the drum, of the wire coming out of the rolling mill. Thus, a
   rate of 5 ... 10\% of wire coils resulted from flow are remelted and
   returned into the fabrication circuit, because they do not fit the gauge
   and mass specified for the end products, which are to be delivered to
   the beneficiaries. The authors propose an innovative solution for energy
   efficiency and management of manufacturing aluminum wires, based on
   cutting such losses in end product down by half.
   The classical reference system for drive of the winding machine is
   characterized by: electromechanical drive of the drum, with adjustable
   speed electric motor and reducer; electrohydraulic drive, without
   control loop, of the reeling device, which moves linearly, along the
   drum, the wire coming out of the rolling mill. This drive system has the
   disadvantage of lack of synchronization between the drum rotative speed
   and the linear constant travel speed of the reeling device, the random
   variations in the travel speed of the reeling device being the cause for
   variable pitch of wire winding around the drum.
   The proposed solution consists in the development of an electrohydraulic
   digital control system for driving the reeling head, which enables
   control of the position and speed of the latter by means of an
   electrohydraulic control loop. The system provides a reduction in the
   positioning error of the reeling head by at least one order of
   magnitude. Additionally, the proposed solution can provide the
   management of predictive and centralized monitoring of the entire
   production of wire. To materialize the proposed solution, the authors
   have used the next working methods: completion of the schematic diagram
   of the reeling head drive; development of a prototype of this drive
   system (through numerical simulation, design and construction);
   monitoring the operation over time of this new drive system, installed
   on an aluminum wire winding two-ply machine, existing at Alro Slatina
   Company, using SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, management systems invest strongly on the concepts of
   innovation and creativity, two pillars necessary for the advancement of
   any modern economy. These two concepts play a strategic role in the
   evolution of any organization, defining its competitive advantages and
   thus securing its future survival. Here, in this chapter, we examine
   them in the light of the public sector and especially in the area of
   educational organizations management. We investigate under which
   circumstances they emerge, how they flourish or fail, and what impact
   they have on the daily operations of a PSEO. These concepts are dynamic,
   so the corresponding phenomena are discussed using analytical as well as
   discrete methodologies. We focus our attention on policies and
   strategies developed by the public sector, in the frame of e-government
   initiatives, so as to prepare the organizations for competition in the
   digital future. Finally, we propose a methodology appropriate for
   transforming a typical conservative PSEO into a modern,
   innovation-endorsing, and sustainable business model. It is important to
   aim at and describe in detail a step-by-step process that leads smoothly
   to the new situation, avoiding incongruities and disruptions. This is
   depicted in a roadmap sketched using the basic concepts embedded on a
   transition diagram. The work ends by wrapping up a psychological profile
   appropriate to cultivate to all PSEO stakeholders, in order to manage to
   administer changes of this magnitude and importance.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, public confidence and trust in government has
   declined visibly in several Western liberal democracies owing to a
   distinct lack of opportunities for citizen participation in political
   processes, and has given way instead to disillusionment with current
   political institutions, actors and practices. The rise of the Internet
   as a global communications medium has opened up huge opportunities and
   raised new challenges for government, with digital technology creating
   new forms of community, empowering citizens and reforming existing power
   structures in a way that has rendered obsolete or inappropriate many of
   the tools and processes of traditional democratic politics. Through an
   analysis of the No. 10 Downing Street ePetitions Initiative based in the
   United Kingdom, this chapter seeks to engage with issues related to the
   innovative use of network technology by government to involve citizens
   in policy processes within existing democratic frameworks in order to
   improve administration, reform democratic processes and renew citizen
   trust in institutions of governance.}},

Abstract = {{Access to information may have contributed to the yawning gap between
   Nigeria's wealth in human and material resources and the level of
   development recorded. Sustainable development can be engendered through
   the adoption of digital publishing innovations by publishers in the
   dispensation of their corporate social responsibility often geared
   towards developing the total person in society. In Nigeria, available
   gadgets for accessing publications and processing information can be
   adopted to solve fundamental problems that hitherto plagued production
   and distribution of information resources. Since ICTs facilitate content
   development and dissemination, they can be employed for adequate supply
   of educational books, agric extension information in any language,
   access to and participation in political dialogues, materials for
   language learning, etc. Therefore, the publishing industry in Nigeria
   has at its disposal all that it needs to join the world of e-publishing
   and e-solutions. The central objective of this chapter, therefore, is to
   argue that Nigerian publishers are in the position to ensure sustainable
   development through digital publication and dissemination of information
   resources, even beyond their present educational books niche, to meet
   other unmet book and information needs. This is because e-books are
   easier to market and distribute, and e-payment eliminates transaction
   bottlenecks. Publishers, however, need the support of government through
   a viable book policy, stable curriculums, and provision of digital tools
   to schools; cooperation of and collaboration with the academia (or
   established material developers); and collaboration with mobile network
   owners (for effective dissemination).}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, a team of two university and four school
   teacher-researchers, members of a Liquid Networked Innovating Community
   (LiqNIC) called the Cultural Landscapes Community (CoLab), draw on an
   interactional ethnographic perspective to examine the theoretical roots
   of the CoLab, how it emerged as a LiqNIC, and its impact on their
   professional learning. By constructing four telling cases, the team
   investigates how they drew on the CoLab's shared theory of action,
   ResponsiveDesign, to innovate their practices teaching writing to
   incorporate new media and digital tools (Twitter, Googledocs, Weebly,
   Edmodo, Prezi, Storify). Analyses reveal the local ways each teacher
   drew on ResponsiveDesign's iterative cycles of exploring, envisioning
   and enacting as habits of action. In and through the local ways they
   harnessed ResponsiveDesign to integrate digital tools into their writing
   instruction, the teacher-researchers developed habits of mind as
   prototypers and innovators of teaching practices. Analyses also reveal
   how ResponsiveDesign's core theoretical traditions were lived out in the
   habits of action and habits of mind that the teachers developed.}},

Abstract = {{Educators teach, inform and inspire other teachers by using classroom
   innovations and they are interested in using new visual, digital and
   concrete materials to engage students in the learning process. KM (KM)
   is one such innovation that provides valuable and helpful processes that
   enhance the learning environment. Project based learning, as a classroom
   activity can be directed at both the content and process of classroom
   learning and KM can be included in projects to enhance the learning
   experience.
   To deliver successful project outcomes, students need to be engaged in
   the learning and continuous learning needs to occur. Continuous learning
   can be derived in terms of developing guidelines for creating, sharing,
   and reusing knowledge in a project management environment. Guidelines
   for learning can integrate KM practices with project management. Owen
   (2008) contends that knowledge is created, transferred, captured and
   reused within a project and she provides a structure to link
   project/program management to KM. According to Owen (2008), a project
   can be defined as a task where knowledge is created as the result of the
   activities that are carried out by project teams. Project team members
   are able to create, transfer, and reuse knowledge created from the tasks
   when a KM framework supports the project. This framework helps project
   team members to conceptualize the task, and reuse and apply past
   knowledge and experiences more effectively and efficiently. Based on a
   thematic analysis of two classroom projects (Soffler, Zanetich and
   Zambrano, - 2014), the major components of KM were identified within
   classroom project activities for both a Science Technology Engineering
   and Mathematics program in an elementary school and a college level
   international classroom research project.
   Capturing knowledge and working collaboratively with the aid of
   technology promotes growth in teachers and students alike. The creative
   use of technology and the creative act of sharing these experiences are
   paramount to knowledge sharing and its management. KM is used
   extensively in the business industry and has helped with the efficiency
   and effectiveness of organizations. It is just beginning to take hold in
   academia and has not been applied to classroom learning activities. This
   paper will provide a template that teachers can use to support
   project-based learning by using KM in the classroom.
   In this presentation a set of KM Guidelines for Teachers will be
   presented. The guidelines will identify both classroom activities and
   the system requirements for capturing, transferring data, information
   and knowledge between and among students, as well as storing artifacts
   and documenting classroom project outcomes. A basic KM template
   containing the major components of KM (knowledge creation, storage, and
   transfer of knowledge) will be included so that the teacher can assume
   the role of knowledge manager in the classroom project.}},

Abstract = {{Design education is often criticised for distancing itself from the
   everyday activities of practice. Such distancing leads to graduates
   well-versed in theory, creativity and concept, but ill-equipped for the
   challenges associated with constructing their conceptual imaginings.
   Additionally, students are often unfamiliar with technological processes
   and advances that guide industry. This paper argues that complexity and
   innovation in spatial design require a more pronounced link between
   design theory, design drawing and the eventual articulation of design.
   This link must be informed by technological advances in digital
   fabrication and should include a deeper understanding of industry
   manufacturing processes and the embedded nature of materials. This
   underpinning to design can be obtained by exposing students to real-life
   problems and by encouraging hands-on experimentation with materials and
   manufacturing processes. Within a South African educational context,
   such explorations are however often limited to manufacturing processes
   of low complexity and students are rarely offered opportunities to
   engage directly with digital fabrication during the design development
   phase. This paper employs a case study to investigate how this
   shortcoming can be overcome through mutually beneficial university and
   industry interactions. Additionally, the paper investigates the learning
   opportunities offered by full-scale prototyping through digital
   fabrication methods and the impact thereof on design education. The case
   study refers to a rapid prototyping workshop where interior architecture
   students from the University of Pretoria engaged directly with industry
   specialists from RAW Studios (a design and manufacturing practice). The
   workshop was implemented outside of the typical pedagogical structures
   that guide studio activities during the semester, which resulted in a
   series of richly varied design products and enriched design processes.
   The learning opportunities offered by this project will be discussed
   under the themes that emerged from a retrospective critique of the
   project.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, new digital technologies have significantly changed the
   way we live and work, as well as the way organizations operate. These
   new technologies caused the need for a serious approach to modification
   of higher education processes in the areas of business, especially
   business informatics. If they are to effectively direct strategies of
   modern organizations in the changed environment, managers, as key
   products of education in these areas, first and foremost must understand
   the occurring transformations (what is driving them, where they are
   headed). In addition to that, managers themselves need to become digital
   innovators, actively involved in these changes. Relatively inexpensive,
   easy-to-use digital infrastructure consisting of computers, mobile

   creates an opportunity for all business professionals to be a part of
   the innovation process and contribute to the success of their
   organizations.
   Digital innovations that are embodied in or enabled by information
   technologies (IT) are very broadly defined and include products,
   processes and business models. Such innovations require an analytical
   approach to both core and elective courses of business informatics
   curricula, as well as to and their purposeful modification.
   This paper briefly presents the characteristics of digital innovation as
   the basis for changes of curricula in the field of business informatics.
   Content of courses made necessary by digital innovations are
   particularly highlighted. A detailed analysis of competences and course
   contents was carried out based on a selection of existing curricula in
   this area that are implemented within several highest ranked
   universities in Europe. Lastly, this paper presents a preliminary
   proposal of an up-to-date business informatics curriculum which is in
   line with trends initiated by digital innovation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper builds upon a previous presentation at ICERI 2013 relating to
   new digital technologies influence on tertiary education sector. From
   the study of iPads as springboard, it keeps redefining new disciplinary
   and academic literacies to stay abreast of change. Recent research shows
   contrary to common view that youth are digital natives, experienced and
   willing to adopt new technology as they encounter problems when required
   to walk on areas of higher-level thinking. They just keep to superficial
   levels of usage instead. The challenge to education is greater now that
   life and learning are multi-dimensional, multi-modal and distributed.
   This is particularly visible in fields that require making artefacts and
   innovation instead of using technology passively. For instance,
   industrial design was traditionally thought to assist increasing
   production and consumption through mechanical or process innovation. The
   profession leans on a long legacy of craftsmanship and making. However
   old-style constraints and measures of success seem to be challenged by
   recent developments in technology.
   This presentation extends on new digital technologies as they are also
   impacting the material culture of design. The advent of a new
   incarnation of makers, initially represented by affordable 3D rapid
   prototyping and associated software, has brought about the need to query
   the profession. There are a number of societal and cultural implications
   affecting our designers' role as change makers. Technology is delivering
   cheaper and more efficient devices and communication. Democratization on
   means of production is on the increase and designers cannot longer claim
   control by positioning themselves as the expert elite who provides
   stylish services to a mass of consumers in a naive market. Learning from
   history, graphic design and desktop publishing were greatly affected
   when computing industry expanded into a new niche of home market back in
   1990s. Additionally, globalisation increased competition when cheaper
   services based on lower labour costs were offered from elsewhere. Now
   technology is also forcing similar changes in industrial design.
   Many design courses focus on design thinking while still falling short
   from reflecting current professional circumstances. They still need to
   overcome the paradox of preparing creative ``world-class subject-matter
   experts who too often lack commercial aptitude,' `graduates often have
   little or no idea of how a company works, and how they could fit in. The
   cost: too many great technological ideas are squandered as their
   creators have little to no idea how to express their inventions{''}. It
   is said designers have difficulty on breaking away from isolationism and
   lack of analysis, contextual and historical inquiry, abstraction and
   theory, writing and reading, process thinking, understanding of science,
   etc. The author proposes a framework of ``
   makers-thinkers-enactors-enablers{''} for a new breed of designers. A
   new design discourse that considers
   First, previous boundaries that are now blurred.
   Second, how constrains and freedoms are shifting places.
   Third, the act of extended creation between designers and users in a
   process of co-making and open design. Examples on methodology and
   implementation of that framework are provided to grow design expertise
   from traditional skillsets onto new competencies for the new age.
   The paper also moves onto recommendations on transformative framework
   development based on a current course renewal in process of
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{A lot has been written about artists and designers fate to lead society
   onto new levels of development and progress. Kandinsky proclaimed them
   at the top in a ``dictatorship{''} of artistic and design ``illuminate
   through consensus and taste{''}. A century later, Paula Antonelli (2009)
   mentioned designers are expected to become ``the reference point for
   policy makers{''}, ``the intellectuals of the future{''}, and ``the
   culture generators{''}. These statements represent two of three
   challenges to modern designers for analysis in this paper. They are
   neither well trained on policy nor on cultural studies. The third test
   to consider is coming from design innovation and its management. As per
   Norman (2010), there is an increasing demand for designers to move on
   from acting by assumption and naive psychology relating to human
   behaviour onto informed knowledge management, appropriate design based
   research and theory. Norman and Verganti (2011) agree, both incremental
   and radical innovations depend on designers' capacity to figure out
   complex projects through co-designed production and carrying meaning for
   their users. Consequentially they invite others to expand the still
   uncharted waters of product design, its management, meaning making, and
   the link and role for designers between technology and culture. This
   paper extends on their work by bringing to attention new circumstances
   for product meaning from areas of language, culture and creativity.
   First, an explanation on how products may carry meaning however they may
   not be meaningful, as they do not reach a status of appropriate
   immersion and significance according to a socio-cultural context. The
   advance of digital technology is increasing carry-meaning alternatives.
   Today, typical industrial design products may become significant by
   their intangible component, experience and value instead of its
   materiality. Designers need to rethink their position to be key cultural
   intermediaries, gatekeepers of innovation and producers of symbolic
   goods and services for society. Second, the paper proposes traditional
   grouping of players on either side of the camp, production or
   consumption, is no longer sufficient. A new digital native generation is
   coming to age in an era of improved access to information such as MOOCs,
   open source and design. Co-design and production are already modifying
   to show end users participation in design and production as sign of a
   more democratic and pluralistic process. An indication of this change
   appeared in fine arts first, from Breton and his experiments on language
   and communication (Exquisite Corpse, 1928) to Happenings by Duchamp
   (1930), Kaprow (1959) and others. More recently, production of meaning
   can also be linked to user participatory architecture, design for social
   innovation, and bottom up innovation, flash mobs, hacking spaces, and
   open source design and maker culture. Third, educational institutions
   and industry will also have to change and accommodate their business
   models to a more diverse division of labour and production, policy and
   funding structure. The capacity to adapt to this new context should
   allow them to progress through radical random and/or directed iterations
   of technology as well as enabling them to modify and lead socio-cultural
   change.}},

Abstract = {{As a palimpsest of civilization, architecture is conceptually one of the
   most dynamic media reflecting the temporal and cultural shifts in human
   development. Despite this plasticity, the physical dimensions of
   architecture have traditionally remained relatively static whether on
   account of material or technological limitations. For millennia wood and
   stone served as the basis for an architectural palette while
   construction was limited to the quality of labor available. Since the
   turn of the 19th century architecture has undergone a direct and
   dramatic evolution reflecting material and technological advances on a
   networked global scale. The result has been a growing ubiquity of
   fantastic architecture that continuously pushes the conventional
   boundaries of architecture. Unfortunately the majority of these works
   remain physically static as both a larger component to the urban fabric
   as well as a modulator of human activity. It is with the latter that the
   architectural community, specifically its educators, has become engaged
   with integrating physical computing technologies into the built
   environment.
   As current pedagogical trends encourage interconnectivity and
   cross-disciplinary collaborations, architectural interventions are
   increasingly adopting new technologies to foster greater interaction
   between the built world and its users. Microprocessors and embedded
   technologies are quickly adopted in architectural pedagogy. Though
   nascent, this integration is not only an innovation in the education of
   an architect, but instrumental in determining the future trajectory of
   architecture as a discipline. This presentation demonstrates the success
   of integrating physical computing into architectural pedagogy over
   several years within an upper year digital tools course in an
   architectural science program. Through an evolving balance of
   conventional, blended, and experiential learning opportunities,
   students, this curriculum inculcated a strong spirit of innovation in
   interactive architecture. Documentation of the pedagogy, process, and
   final prototypes generated by the students will serve to emphasize the
   impact of these innovative practices. The paper concludes with key
   findings that educators and researchers may leverage in the development
   of processes that mandate technological innovation in design industries
   and institutions.}},

Abstract = {{The convergence between the digital and physical worlds has pervaded
   contemporary existence; from recreational routines to professional
   workflows, activities that do not entail both physical and digital
   conditions and are exclusive to one are becoming extinct. Within both
   professional and academic realms, design experimentation and processes
   have recently become a confluence of digital and physical media. With
   parametric modeling and software innovations working in tandem with
   physical outputs such as 3D printing and CAM technologies, design
   students have become empowered with an unprecedented arsenal of tools to
   bring their ideas to reality. Though this has enhanced design processes
   beyond imagery into tangible reality, it has yet to return to an
   acknowledgement of a fundamental design consideration - the nature of
   the physical material. This paper posits that innovations in digital
   technologies have come full circle in empowering students to learn of
   fundamental issues thereby fostering innovation and novel design.
   Not satisfied with the current paradigm, leading edge design pedagogy is
   focusing upon the base capacities of the physical properties of
   operational media to elicit design innovation. A series of projects
   showcasing a return to a sensitivity to material properties as design
   drivers through contemporary digital fabrication technologies within an
   architecture curriculum highlights the new direction current design
   pedagogy is undertaking in reaffirming design traditions of the past. In
   doing this review of applications in an upper level architectural
   science program, the authors present key strategies in adopting
   contemporary digital technologies to catalyse innovative practice and
   pedagogy. With the imminent ubiquity of these digital tools in industry
   and the classroom it is imperative that such strategies be adopted in a
   wide spectrum of disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{The `learning design for smart growth' is an important part of co-funded
   by Leonardo Da Vinci agency projects which aim at transferring
   innovation via distance education. Such projects are focusing on
   information and digital skills needed by professionals to build online
   training sessions for employees or disseminate information related to
   products and services to customers. Learning design is usually
   problematic due to many reasons. Obstacles to be overcome when designing
   for innovation and learning have to do with learners' habits of
   learning, educators' resistance to change, workload of teaching online,
   organizational/institutional constrains, technological affordances to
   name few. Information decay and information obesity are two more
   external exigencies that make distance education more difficult than
   ever before to monitor and maintain quality of performance. The specific
   model uses updated European Union research, literature and the new
   perspectives in education to inform trainers about learning technologies
   and methodologies that seem to address market demands and take into
   consideration students' frustrations. The format of the learning design
   is based on a new model called EDECES: create more experiences (less
   instructions more real - life scenarios) and personal learning spaces
   (personalized curriculum), active critical dialogue and peer reviewing,
   explanations about what you have learnt and adaptation to new digital
   environments (reflections and reflexivity), creativity (products of
   rhizomatic learning), constant democratic evaluation (weekly polls) and
   finally sharing with the community of practice. While connecting human
   to human and information, the EDECES model relies on the powers of the
   networks to maximize impacts. It is important to discover new paths and
   follow them to see where they are going like Odysseus looking for
   Ithaca.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on digital inequalities from a learning perspective
   for 21st century education. An interpretation of digital inequalities is
   developed through use of the `frictions' concept as an analytic lens.
   This enables the analysis of affordances and abilities, and attunements
   to constraints in technology-rich learning environments to elucidate
   insights and understandings. As such, this article enhances a proposed
   frictionless learning environment innovation (FLE) in describing an
   approach to addressing existing and emerging digital inequalities in
   21st century education. Further, this article points to how the FLE,
   combined with activity theory to form the FLEAT model, is extendable for
   use with the learning dimension of smart cities in addressing digital
   inequalities. This work is designed to enrich, challenge, and contribute
   additional suggestions to the research questions, intended outcomes, and
   assessment indicators for a proposed research study to investigate the
   FLEAT innovation with smart teams of educators, learners and community
   partners.}},

Abstract = {{The project described in this paper is the result of an
   interdisciplinary project undertaken by history and geography teachers
   at the Paula Frassinetti School of Education (ESEPF), Porto, Portugal.
   It was implemented by students from the Masters course in teaching the
   1st and 2nd cycles of basic education. The aim was to provide basic
   education teachers with a digital map to facilitate understanding the
   itineraries and locations of the main battles of the Peninsular War in
   Portugal. The authors planned to distribute a tool that would both
   motivate students to learn history and encourage geographical thinking.
   The tool also promotes the interdisciplinary perspective by showing how
   geography was important in the ending of some battles. Students can
   locate the battles spatially to investigate the places chosen by French
   troops for their invasion of Portugal in the 19th century; they can
   examine the local/regional geography, the influence of rivers on routes
   that were chosen and the importance of mountains as natural barriers.
   The map was launched at the end of 2013 and is still being updated by
   new students carrying out large scale research of each battle. The
   objective was achieved since the map was named best map on ArcGis Online
   by ESRI Portugal. Schools and teachers have recognised the importance of
   the project since it promotes the interdisciplinary teaching and
   learning of history and geography, geographic thinking and GIS
   competencies, and also motivates students.}},

   complex design challenges. Through digital innovation, the field
   continuously expands to new application areas. To develop design
   competence, students need to build up a repertoire of experiences

   students are young and have limited workplace experience. These
   circumstances are challenging to IS education and teaching. In this
   paper we share experiences from teaching and designing IS education to
   be adapted to this situation. We propose three teaching strategies for

Abstract = {{This article reports on experiences gained in a three week project at
   Sor-Trondelag University College, Trondheim, Norway (HiST). The aim of
   the project was to explore the effects of implementing applied digital
   game-based learning in English foreign language education (EFL) and
   social sciences training with a focus on democracy, ideology, economy
   and politics. A further aim was to situate this in a digital learning
   environment at HiST, using digital SMART Boards, and observe the
   learning process.
   The game employed, Democracy 3 {[}1] is a political simulator in which
   the player, upon assuming the highest political office in his country of
   choice, has to administer economy, infrastructure, education and the
   day-to-day political administration of his country. While doing so, he
   will have to monitor the electorate and his own cabinet in order to
   ensure successful implementation of his policies and re-election.
   This complexity mirrors actual political realities and this makes the
   game an apt tool for education. In the one subject, social sciences,
   political ideology and economy are central components, as is the
   dissemination of democratic attitudes and values. In the other, EFL,
   reading, speaking and conversation skills are as fundamental as a
   contextual and cultural understanding of the countries in which the
   language is used. Because of this, a collaborative, cross-curricular
   project using Democracy 3 would meet several subject goals, but also
   allow innovative learning and a motivating, concrete approach to
   abstract concepts.
   A group of approximately 45 students from the preparatory course for
   engineering studies at HiST were formed into groups and instructed to
   select an English speaking country and a political ideology which they
   were to follow throughout the simulation. This ideology could agree with
   or run counter to the preeminent one in the country of their choice, but
   all their decisions had to be taken in accordance with that ideology.
   During this process, the students were to monitor the economy, which was
   to be the arena in which political ideology clashed with political
   reality. The working language in the discussions and the final report
   was English, providing not only language skills training but also an
   introduction to academic and political terminology and lingo.
   This article will present the pedagogical and methodological experiences
   and conclusions drawn upon completion of the project, with special
   attention to the intersection between the application of digital game
   content, method and subject goals.}},

   in the dimensions of information theory, network theory, innovation and
   digital convergence is particularly relevant in the design and

   introduce the term Telecommplexity with the purpose of developing a
   framework to explore telecommunications as a system where the
   interaction and interdependence of technological, sociocultural, legal
   and economic factors play a key role in the characterization of this
   system, hence a disciplinary approach is insufficient for a
   comprehensive analysis of the system. This analysis of
   telecommunications as a socio-technical system may also contribute to
   increasing its effectiveness and social impact as an important enabler
   of social wellbeing.}},

Abstract = {{Becoming a successful 21st Century citizen requires 21st Century skills.
   21st Century skills reflect the needs of the fastest growing sectors of
   our global economy such as technology, health sciences and supply chain
   logistics. These sectors require the simplest 21st skills such as
   communication, and collaboration, as well as more complex demands such
   as digital and web literacies, creativity, and innovation. Open badging
   can help remedy deficiencies in these skills by allowing individuals to
   achieve proficiency via project or evidence-based learning authenticated
   by the badge provider. Analytics and big data applied in tandem with
   open badges provide valuable insight into how the skills gaps are being
   eliminated best and other key areas supporting confidence and
   predictability in achieving desired outcomes. Leveraging open standards
   and the interoperability of open badging, learners from a variety of
   backgrounds would gain unlimited access from content providers to

Abstract = {{Social media have been widely adopted. In education, the hype
   surrounding social media has created a lot of speculation about how it
   might be used in education. The goal of our research is to successfully
   implement social media in higher education.
   We conducted research that shows that the personal use of social media
   by students at NHL University is widespread, although the use of social
   media in education is limited. Main challenge of introducing social
   media in higher education is the gap between the structured experience
   that a university offers on one hand and the user driven character of
   social media on the other hand. NHL University bridges the gap using the
   living lab theory.
   In order to implement social media in higher education, we formulated
   crucial guidelines for social media implementation strategies in higher
   education curricula. We conducted intensive research. We looked for
   lecturers at NHL University who already use social media in their
   classes and appointed them as early adopters. We interviewed these
   innovators and published the interviews in a digital book. We shared the
   information by sending the book to all lecturers al NHL University.
   Finally, we attended meetings with lecturers and shared our experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Internet technologies, mobile phone and social media have brought new
   challenges to higher education. E-learning has been gaining a huge
   acceptance among educators, especially in Higher Education Institutions
   (HEI). This happens due to the exponential growth of the use of Internet
   and educational technologies that have fostered deep transformations in
   the teaching-learning process and paradigm. Our institution began
   e-learning activities in 2003 with WebCT, but soon changed its approach
   with the adoption of the open source platform Moodle (Modular
   Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) and the integration of
   specialized staff to assist teachers and students on a daily basis.
   Since then, there is evidence that the b-learning model has been
   maturing the school's educational culture, according to the teacher's
   willingness or availability to integrate technology in the
   teaching-learning process. However, it is important to know if the
   integration of web technology in the teaching-learning process is being
   combined with a shift in the pedagogical methodologies, and if teachers
   are taking full advantage of the capabilities offered by these learning
   environments and not using learning management systems as simple digital
   libraries for learning contents for students to download. To answer
   those questions we present a case study that describes how teachers have
   been using web technology to support their learning/teaching activities.
   We discuss the results of the analyses made on about 200 teachers'
   interactions according to different points of view and criteria. This
   analysis will focus mainly on the technological but also on pedagogical
   achievements, also on the challenges there are still to overcome and
   propose a set of good practices to support a more rewarding use of
   e-learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{Entrepreneurship has gained a lot of attention over the recent years.
   New innovative ideas, as well as research outputs, may now be
   implemented and result into actual products and/or services, having a
   positive impact on a both economic and social level. However, a lot of
   work needs to be done in educating the entrepreneurs of tomorrow towards
   enabling them to effectively apply their managerial and decision-making
   skills within the current and future competitive environment. To this
   end, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for entrepreneurship
   education in Higher Education Institutions, based on the motivational
   aspects of Game Based Learning (GBL) elements, combined with the
   engagement and interaction opportunities offered by mobile devices. GBL
   has proven to be an effective mechanism when it comes to business skills
   development. The interactive interface included in all GBL applications
   provides learners with a chance to experiment with their entrepreneurial
   ideas and strategies in a simulated environment, where they can easily
   benefit and learn, drawing from hands-on experience rather than
   obtaining basic theoretical knowledge. Furthermore, mobile devices have
   evolved considerably and offer ubiquitous access to innovative broadband
   services and applications, engaging users in social interactions. As a
   result, Higher Education Institutions, who are considered as major
   enablers and adopters of new ideas and innovation, can benefit from
   mobile devices and use them as a complementary medium towards offering
   integrated and innovative learning material to their students, in the
   form of an exciting game based application. This paper builds upon the
   theories of Experiential and Digital Game Based learning and presents a
   Roadmap for the effective implementation and integration of Ubiquitous
   Game Based Learning in Entrepreneurship Education at Higher Education
   Institutions.}},

Abstract = {{The Renaissance period left a lasting impression not just on the art
   world, but in the fields of education and business as well. In this
   unprecedented era of innovation, individuals leveraged the resources,
   human capital, and technology of the day to transform human culture
   forever. In the present Digital Age, we are struggling to leverage the
   embarrassment of riches we possess through the ubiquitous nature of
   digital tools and other emerging technology in our classrooms and other
   workforce-readiness arenas, leaving a sizable skills gap for businesses
   relying on the products of these institutions for fuelling their
   enterprises and growing their bottom line. The CreArte philosophy and
   its implementation framework, the CreArte Method, are designed to enable
   educators, trainers, and leaders to maximize the potential of their
   students, employees, and other dependents via their personalized
   participation in cross-functional, interdisciplinary, and
   innovation-nurturing applied projects inspired by the impactful lessons
   learned from the Renaissance.}},

   Classroom). It is a digital space developed in Moodle, offered to
   teachers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico so they can
   have one or more virtual classrooms as a support for their face to face

   In addition to showing and describing what is Your Virtual Classroom and
   how it works, we consider of interest to other colleagues to present
   here a review of the different ways in which it has been used this
   virtual classrooms, as well as the digital tools that teachers have
   integrated and implemented around it. Given the high number of
   classrooms in our project, we will present one of the existing
   categories in Your Virtual Classroom, specifically the classrooms of the
   Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (ENP) (one of the two high school programs
   of UNAM) considering a sample of virtual classrooms used during the last
   year.

Abstract = {{It is recognized that the contemporary era is marked by the widespread
   availability of technologies, a source of radical change that is deeply
   influencing the modes of learning and knowledge-building of the
   so-called digital natives.
   More recently, the children and young people of today have been defined
   as ``the touch-screen generation{''} due to their constant use of
   tablets and related applications, which is bringing about further
   changes in their relationship with culture. This last development in
   particular seems to have led to a different way of exploring objects and
   consequently of exploring contents. While we do not wish to pre-empt the
   results of studies that are currently underway, preliminary
   observational findings suggest that children's approach to contents is
   increasingly mediated by contact with touch surfaces, which in turn
   implies a different use of the sensory skills. This represents a new
   two-dimensional revolution that adds a new perspective to the existing
   key and multiple vanishing points of the civilization of image: this
   novel perspective includes a time dimension that is regulated by touch
   and is more predictable than the exploration of reality.
   These early observations already prompt us to problematize some key
   issues, in particular the need to provide opportunities for young
   children to engage directly with objects and materials (Edwards Forman
   \& Gandini 1993) not in opposition to their natural predisposition as
   members of the touch-screen generation, but to offer them a valuable and
   complementary mode of exploration and research that can contribute to
   the development of integrated and complex modes of knowledge-building
   (Zuccoli, 2010). In this paper, we analyze observations and
   video-recordings collected in early childhood services, discussing the
   value in today's context of making unstructured materials available for
   children's play, with a particular emphasis on those materials defined
   as ``unconventional{''}, including industrial waste products (Guerra \&
   Zuccoli, 2012). The last-mentioned materials are particularly
   contemporary and therefore suitable for the younger generations, while
   their undefined nature may help to develop complementary competencies
   that are less easily drawn out by other means.}},

Abstract = {{Europe is facing an accelerated climate change as a result of global
   warming, mainly for human activities, and because of population
   departure and consequent abandon of rural areas. In this line, higher
   education is exploring new horizons. Deforestation, climate change, sea
   pollution and other causes involve the need to conserve natural
   heritage.
   There is a need to find ways to support the management of such hazards
   by providing adequate training on environmental matters. One academic
   proposal for understanding and training appropriate personnel to
   mitigate threats to the environment is higher education, so in this way,
   authors proposed MSc Programmes related to environmental subjects.
   Another strong point of these programmes is to prepare students for the
   regional and global postgraduate job market. This paper is intended to
   explain and analyse the stages in the preparation of documentation and
   project management in an e-learning Master under lifelong learning
   framework (Erasmus Programme), including teaching strategies, such as
   Virtual Learning Platform that contains learning materials in a digital
   format including text, audio-material, images and video-material,
   meetings as a tester workshops organized in participating countries,
   future interaction with the student etc. Finally, the document is
   intended as an aid to future teachers to detect a lack of training in an
   area that affects the environment in Europe so they can propose a
   training program, innovative and high acceptance towards the Graduates
   of Business and Planning faculties who intend to work in the
   infrastructure projects, graduates of environmental faculties who intend
   to specialise in environmental management. This work has been funded by

Abstract = {{In 2006, the International Telecommunication Union resolved on a digital
   television broadcasting plan to migrate all television broadcasting
   systems from analogue to digital by June 2015. The stated objective of
   the switch to digital systems is to achieve qualitative and quantitative
   rationalization in order to maximize communication benefits. While
   digital migration may be seen as part of the exponential developments in
   science and innovation, it obscures serious conceptual issues and social
   inequalities. This chapter offers a theoretical examination of the
   ideological and political-economic logics behind the global digital
   terrestrial migration plan. From a broad critique of the concepts of
   ``Knowledge Society/Information Society,{''} taking a critical lens into
   the works of Daniel Bell (1974) and Manuel Castells (2000), and drawing
   from Guy Berger's (2010) critique of the digital migration process,
   author questions the logic of approximating digitization to development
   and argues that the mandatory migration of TV broadcasting systems
   requires critical analysis regarding its social costs to Africa.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter interrogates the migration process from Analog to Digital
   Terrestrial Television occurring in Rwanda, which has, since May 2013,
   entered its final stages. Following the commitment of the East African
   Community (EAC) inspired by the 2006 recommendations of the
   International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Rwanda switched to digital
   terrestrial broadcasting in December 2013. In the meantime, the
   government sought to increase television penetration from 7\% in
   December 2012 to 30\% when the switch off process came to its end. This
   chapter focuses on the challenges and constraints of this transition in
   a country where 80\% of the population belongs to the primary sector,
   and where only 10.6\% of Rwandans have access to electricity as a main
   source of lighting. Based on the author's experience as the Project
   Leader and Managing Director of TV10, the first private television
   channel in Rwanda, this chapter discusses and analyzes salient aspects
   of this migration, which is part of a very ambitious technological
   catch-up policy. It also highlights the different initiatives put
   together by the private and the public sector to develop innovative
   solutions that could mobilize the population and improve their access to
   television. These initiatives sometimes seem to focus on technical
   considerations to the detriment of local content development, an
   undeniable and crucial source of employment in the creative industries.
   Finally, this chapter points out the opportunities and significant
   growth potential that digital broadcasting could bring to all the
   stakeholders involved.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter investigates and endorses the integration of two existing
   research traditions, electronic discourse analysis (EDA) and critical
   discourse analysis (CDA), into a more powerful and comprehensive form of
   analysis of electronic discourses, Critical Electronic Discourse
   Analysis (CEDA). It sets this analytic project against the massive,
   unpredictable changes in culture and society which are associated with
   the electronic media revolution. It argues for innovative forms of
   analysis, in which `electronic discourse analysis' acquires two
   over-lapping interpretations: electronically enabled analysis of
   discourses in all media; and all forms of analysis of electronic
   discourses and the social forms they express. It uses McLuhan and
   multi-modality theory to argue for major continuities and significant
   breaks in semiotic modes over long periods. It argues that powerful
   innovations in analysis and technology need to recognize and incorporate
   the two fundamental semiotic modes, digital and analogue, and not seek
   to replace one with the other.}},

Abstract = {{Students who avail of an Erasmus mobility gain invaluable experience in
   an international environment. The period abroad is a unique opportunity
   for personal, linguistic and cultural development. However, studying in
   a partner institution comes with its many challenges. As well as dealing
   with academic matters and day to day living, students need to make a new
   circle of friends. Preparation prior to departure undoubtedly
   contributes to the success of the study abroad period. Nevertheless, the
   language they learn in an academic setting only partly equips them to
   communicate with their peers in the foreign country. Slang expressions
   and colloquialism are widely used among young adults. A lack of
   familiarity with this register of language can hamper the development of
   new relationships.
   This project was developed with a group of students in the Dublin
   Institute of Technology, Ireland. The Erasmus mobility is a compulsory
   element of their programme of study. The project aims to support
   students prior to their departure by helping them to gain an insight
   into the colloquialisms used by their French counterparts. The approach
   is innovative on two accounts. Firstly, it harnesses the potential of
   peer learning by drawing on the cohort of French Erasmus students who
   are on an exchange with the Institute. These students are an invaluable
   resource for full-time students on the programme who often find it
   intimidating to approach and engage in conversation with their foreign
   peers. Secondly, the project is innovative in that it requires students
   to produce their own learning resources by creating a digital story.
   Digital storytelling is increasingly popular. Among other advantages, it
   has the power to engage students in their learning and it equips them
   with a valuable set of digital literacy skills. Digital storytelling in
   this project is also a vehicle to encourage students to meet their
   French peers, establish a dialogue with them, provide them with a topic
   of conversation and learn new terminology. The project is an exploration
   of how the integration of digital storytelling with peer learning can
   lead to language learning and contribute to student engagement.}},

Abstract = {{The use of technology in the classroom and its integration into the
   curriculum in the form of Information and Communication Technologies has
   had a major impact on schools and the education system as a whole. It
   has yet to be shown by longitudinal studies over time that the use of
   technology and computers in the classroom has had a major impact on
   academic performance. One of these studies, Sigales, Monimo and Badia's
   (1) research on the integration of the internet in Spanish schools found
   indicators in their research that the use of technology in the classroom
   was scarce and limited in the schools they investigated. Their research
   concluded that there were a number of points that should be worked on by
   the educational community:
   To improve teacher's skills in ICT use.
   Adapt and improve resources and connectivity to the internet.
   Revise school curriculum.
   Too often, discussions of the role of digital technologies for learning
   skate over the wide variety of differences which exist between different
   groups of learners. Often, `the learner' is presented as a single,
   unitary figure defined solely by age; as `children', `teenagers',
   `adults' etc. And yet, there are clearly wide differences in the ways in
   which different groups of children respond to, benefit from, or are
   excluded by specific uses of mobile digital technologies.
   This study focuses specifically on the use of mobile digital
   technologies to enable children in primary and secondary school to learn
   effectively. Its goal is to move beyond some of the hype and marketing
   rhetoric that sometimes characterises this field and to ask nuanced
   questions about the evidence that exists of the role of mobile digital
   technologies in academic achievement.
   Sigales, Monimo, Maneses and Badia's (1) research on the integration of
   the Internet and ICT in Spanish schools has been a starting point for
   this project. They found indicators in their research that the use of
   technology in the classroom was scarce and limited for the majority of
   teachers and students that they investigated. They also found that just
   introducing technology in the classroom did not guarantee pedagogical
   innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Internet means have delineated non-geographical territories for
   communication and meeting. Their accessibility as well their mobility
   are bringing people closer together through cyberspace. Internet enables
   a way of ubiquity for it makes physical borders invisible. This allows
   us to be in different virtual places simultaneously.
   Social networks represent cyber scenarios for social interactions in
   which dynamic exchanges are performed in the Web. Networks are formed by
   people that share common needs and problems. For Digital Natives (DN)
   the issue of being active members of Networks appears to be a natural
   life fact. For DN personal motivations treated interactively in the Web,
   are public matters too, which plays a determinant role in certain
   physical behaviors.
   Among the students of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Innovative Education
   there may be several individuals that could be considered as Digital
   Natives. In this respect, it becomes a relevant matter to investigate
   about the influence that social networks imprint on the students `school
   work and professional formation. The information generated in this study
   will make possible to reflect over two functional postures, that the
   young people's immersion in the Web is futile, and on the other hand,
   that the youngsters' immersion in the Web is driven by evident
   individual motivations and habits that are motivated by the need of
   information and communication. Also, this study seeks to identify better
   strategies that allow the optimization of the available resources in
   order to establish an effective communication as well as to create
   appropriate environments for the young students' development.}},

Abstract = {{. The Concordia Laptop Orchestra (CLOrk) is an ensemble of 20-25 laptop
   performers, which operates in the framework of a university course in
   Live Digital Practices-an advanced undergraduate course for
   electroacoustic studies (EaSt) majors at Concordia University's Music
   Department in Montreal. The curriculum is built around highly
   participatory planning, production, and realization of innovative
   interdisciplinary and networked laptop orchestra performances, which
   take place in professional, academic, and cyber settings. In its three
   years, CLOrk has collaborated with a symphonic orchestra, jazz and
   chamber ensembles, laptop orchestras, soloists, dancers, and VJs, among
   others. The innovativeness of CLOrk's performances has encompassed
   artistic (new forms of creation, collaborative composition), sonic
   (sound design, space, aural perception), technological (tools, network),
   and social (listening culture, encounter, interaction, collaboration,
   audience) facets. These innovations constantly introduced new, and often
   unique, practical and philosophical challenges to the creative process,
   but also opportunities to apply innovative educational approaches. Due
   to its adaptability to quickly evolving processes, action research has
   served as a useful transformational inquiry method for supporting and
   developing a better understanding of CLOrk's creative and educational
   evolution. Action research involves participants as co-researchers to
   promote a better understanding of a social process in the group most
   involved in it. It is structured in cycles of observation, critical
   reflection, and action designed to allow improving a process while
   studying it-metaphorically ``designing the plane while flying it{''}
   {[}1].
   In CLOrk's context, the ``plane{''} being designed is its body of
   performance work and its educational structure, while each performance
   functions as a research cycle. Qualitative data are collected from
   recorded (pre- and post-event) discussions, email communications among
   all stakeholders (students, teacher, and collaborators), and anonymous
   questionnaires regarding efficacy and emerging problems related to all
   aspects of the performance's planning and realization. The structure of
   each performance and the roles of every student (creative, technical,
   managerial) emerge democratically through this process of
   transformational inquiry. All data are coded, categorized, and analysed
   using responsive evaluation methods, considered through a process of
   critical reflection, and used to design further actions. While at times,
   this process may yield (social, artistic, technological) hierarchies
   related to the performances, the action research study remains open to
   equal impact from all participants, due to its openness to all emerging
   issues. This article provides context for the ongoing creative and
   educational research conducted with CLOrk and demonstrates this
   research's process through an account of CLOrk's telematic performance
   with the McMaster Cybernetic Orchestra as part of the Musicacoustica
   2013 festival at the Beijing Conservatory {[}2].}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to update and describe the process of
   teachers' professional development and opportunities in the context of
   the provision of information communication technology (ICT) competencies
   in Latvia. Society places high demands on teachers as they,
   specifically, have an important role in the education of school
   children, young people and adults. Teachers' professionalism, and their
   ability to enrich the learning process with innovative approaches and
   methods, encourages the development of the education system, influencing
   the achievement of education goals and the quality of education. The
   technological challenges of the 21st century, and opportunities within
   schools, significantly influence teaching, the content of education and
   student learning. Today's students' skills in working with modern
   technology influence their cognitive interests and learning needs,
   transforming the acquirement of information and processing methods and
   techniques. Being involved in the world of technology provides diverse
   opportunities: it enables the exchange of communication and ideas,
   promotes self-expression and self-realization in specific areas of
   individual and social expression, and draws one into the development and
   testing of innovative ideas.
   In the area of education, modern technology, in particular, can assist
   teachers in providing an individualized approach to each student,
   independently of the latter's range of interests, level of knowledge and
   abilities in the specific subject to be learned. The quality of
   education and the preparedness of students for work and a successful
   life in the modern world, depends to a large degree on the extent to
   which a teacher is able to stay abreast with the times and to skilfully
   use these tools in their dialogue with students. These factors increase
   the importance of further education, as the need to master new
   technology and to adapt to a changing labour market increases each year.
   It's no longer possible to maintain competitiveness today, if knowledge
   isn't updated, and is why further education is becoming increasingly
   popular. Learning has become today's keyword for a nation to be
   competitive in world markets, and creative, even outstanding employees
   are needed for it to be economically competitive. For education to be
   successful, creative, thinking educators - teachers, are required. They
   have to be involved in the educational process - in professional
   development which is provided through further education courses.
   Further education must help teachers integrate into European and world
   education systems, which demand quick responses, adaptability to new
   demands and novel situations in school/university practice. This means
   that increasingly teachers need a range of diverse professional
   competencies, with ICT competency and the skill to use, find and create
   their own digital teaching resources, being an inseparable part.
   Attention has been focussed in the research on the current situation
   relating to the professional development of teachers on ICT issues in
   Latvia, collating what is being offered in further education courses and
   investigating the improvements required, consistent with contemporary
   teaching processes - for both children and adults.}},

Abstract = {{Because of its territorial dispersion (1721Km2) and low population
   density (15.10 inhab/km2 | 26036 inhab. total), Odemira is seen as a low
   density region.
   Grounded in an involved and team work, and having this in mind, the
   Local Education Plan (PEL) was built as the anchor to the research,
   planning and concretion of the educational policy in Odemira. Featuring
   distinctive guidelines and built on scientific basis, the PEL quickly
   stood out being the ``most innovative in the country{''}, according to
   Professor Antonio Rochete (University of Coimbra).
   Connecting these levels of innovation with the great effort that the
   City put on studying seriously the conditions that contribute to the
   existence of certain local educational indicators (some of which lower
   than the Portuguese average), it was possible to draw a path involving
   all actors of the educational community in the way of change and social
   innovation in the definition of an educational policy.
   Under the PEL and within a straight partnership with TAIPA and
   University o Evora, Odemira started the implementation of an
   ``Observatory of Educational Policies of the Region of Odemira{''}
   (OPECO). This pioneering tool aims to define a methodology of data
   collection and analysis which is expected to promote a better monitoring
   of the academic course of students in this region, from pre-school to
   the conclusion of higher education. It will also contribute to support
   the definition and implementation of public policies that promote the
   development and improvement of indicators of education and training in
   the region.
   OPECO will consist in two related digital media: the new PEL (Odemira:
   Territorio Educativo - 20142016) website and a tool for data collection,
   analysis and for granting public access to them (with different levels
   of access). Both website and OPECO tool are developed by Portugal
   Telecom, one of the most important Portuguese enterprises in this field,
   and this project was first page of one of the most important Portuguese
   daily paper (Jornal Publico) in march, and Odemira, with this project,
   was considered in November the second best Portuguese municipality to
   study in ``Future Education{''} Prizes.
   This communication's seek to present the foundations, features and the
   potential of the OPECO as an innovative element in the management of
   local educational policies.}},

Abstract = {{The overall performance and viability of societies and organizations
   result from innumerable small actions by individuals. In a society with
   broad personal competences, decision-making everywhere will maximize
   personal goals, provide effective public agencies and governance, make
   commerce and industry competitive, and ensure that personal and family
   decisions and actions will improve societal functions and Quality of
   Life. Hence, it has become important to understand how people reason and
   how to ascertain that they have the best available knowledge and support
   for whatever function they need to perform. Wiig's assertions equally
   apply to developing countries. But, as Johri and Pal point out,
   assistance provided is primarily framed in the theory and practice of
   development and empowerment, signifying a disproportionate emphasis on
   fulfilling basic needs of users in low-resource environments without
   adequate attention to user-motivated concerns which would enrich their
   lives rather than merely provide access and satisfy basic needs.
   So, how can the emerging knowledge societies and the individual
   knowledge worker be better served mastering the changing spheres of work
   and needs for self-development? How can we address the growing digital
   and innovation divide? And, what provisions have to be made to overcome
   potential current barriers in order to serve three perspectives:
   (1) personal focus on personal fulfilment and quality of life;
   (2) society's economic/business focus on workforce competence; and
   (3) society's operational/functional focus on citizenship
   capabilities/societal behaviour.
   As a way out of this dilemma, a novel approach to promote Personal
   Knowledge Management (PKM) focuses on supporting life-long-learning,
   resourcefulness, creativity and teamwork of individuals throughout their
   academic and professional life and their role as contributors and
   beneficiaries of organizational and societal performance. Based on the
   assumption of decentralized autonomous capacities and nourished by
   creative conversations of many individuals' personal knowledge
   management, PKM systems are envisaged to constitute `the elementary
   process that makes possible the emergence of the distributed processes
   of collective intelligence, which in turn feed it.' Accordingly, Levy
   alerts us to the fact that one of the most important functions of
   teaching, from elementary school to the different levels of university,
   will therefore be to encourage in students the sustainable growth of
   autonomous capacities in PKM.
   The concept proposed in this paper and system-in-work give preference to
   grass roots, bottom-up, lightweight, affordable, personal devices which
   offer effective low-cost applications (accessibility easiness), enable
   the authorship and contribution of own ideas based on one's background
   (expressive creativity), alone or in collaborative environments with
   other users/owners (relational interactivity), and with the opportunity
   to add productively to the world's extelligence (ecological reciprocity)
   and, hence, are compliant with Johri's and Pal's suggested primary ICT
   for Development design characteristics. Currently, the respective
   prototype is about to be converted into a viable commercial PKM system
   profiting individuals, institutions, and society. The paper complements
   a series of recent papers concentrating on the PKM challenges to be
   addressed as well as the conceptual aspects and focusses on the capacity
   development issues in the educational and career context.}},

Abstract = {{Currently in its fourth generation, mobile phone technology, has
   impacted society's way of life and has rapidly been adopted by young
   people. This gives them the opportunity to use it as an educational
   tool.
   The current era established at the beginning of the 1990s is known as
   the information or knowledge era which is characterized by globalization
   - in which we are currently living-. Knowledge era has as an important
   feature, the constant change of information technology. This era of
   technological development is known as digital gap, which has been a
   recognized phenomenon related to scientific aspects such as
   technological devices, access, use, consumption, ownership,
   technological convergence, among others (Almanza and Rodriguez, 2011).
   Along these years, generations have been confronted with unforeseen and
   turbulent changes on a more frequent basis. For Tapscott (2009) the way
   in which the youth, baptized by him as Net Generation, uses and shapes
   the ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) and mobile phones,
   influences social change, where young people have habits different from
   the ones of previous generations. This is why it is important to
   identify the form of ownership, use and frequency of these tools by
   young people in their daily lives.
   The constant changes in technology are relevant in all fields. These
   innovations have had a major impact on young people's way to communicate
   and tackle various fields, including the education context.
   Innovation in ICTs is changing the learning way of young people and how
   teachers teach. There are digital tools found on the Web that provide
   different strategies that encourage students' collaboration, research
   and interaction. These tools that were not necessarily created with
   learning purposes enable and facilitate new generations' innovative
   possibilities to obtain, store, classify, share, communicate and work
   together, among other things.
   Mobile phones, mobile devices that facilitate access to the network, are
   becoming tools that young people use as an extension of themselves, to
   get access to the use of digital tools that enable or facilitate their
   learning.
   This quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional research aims to:
   identify the use that UPAEP students give to Smartphone with social and
   educational purposes. An instrument with 18 items was applied to a
   sample of 240 UPAEP students, with a 95\% confidence level and a 7\%
   margin of error.
   To conclude, we can say that the students in this university use their
   Smartphone in general for social purposes, the majority of students use
   their Smartphone at least 30 minutes a day for activities related to
   their learning, and that teachers in general, use and promote activities
   supported by information technology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a project called InStePP at Oxford Brookes
   University in the UK involving student volunteers working in partnership
   with staff to develop digital literacies across the university.
   Students, known as ePioneers, were commissioned by staff to help them
   develop a variety of digital learning resources and activities.
   The findings presented here are based on analysis of documents and
   records of the two year project and 16 semi-structured interviews with
   student ePioneers and their staff partners.
   We found that the ePioneers gained work experience and employability
   skills, felt valued by other university members and gained a sense of
   being part of the wider academic community by contributing to a whole
   university endeavour. In creating bridges between the different worlds
   of the university, InStePP partnerships were mutually beneficial,
   empowering for students and a driving force for their staff partners,
   bringing fresh perspectives and approaches to bear on educational
   problems. Such a partnership approach offers the potential for
   substantial institutional benefits for developing digital literacies.
   Our findings also reveal challenges, which include supporting students
   to move out of a subservient role to become equal partners with staff;
   negotiating the opportunities and perils of organizing unpaid amateurs
   to do the work of paid experts in the institution; and developing a
   coherent system of rewards and incentives for extra-and co-curricular
   activity. We discuss these and offer suggestions for how they might be
   mitigated.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of the project is to provide education through
   personalized teaching lessons in a varied range of subjects and
   vocational fields. This will be raised on a unique and innovative
   digital platform powered by adaptive learning strategies by expert
   facilitators. A core team of facilitators and IT experts have joined
   hands for this project.
   The idea to raise this digital platform was initiated keeping in mind
   that the principal objective of development planning is human
   development and the attainment of higher standard of living for the
   people. This requires a more equitable distribution of development
   benefits and opportunities, better living environment and empowerment of
   the poor and marginalized. There is special need to empower women who
   can act as catalysts for change. In making the development process
   inclusive, the challenge is to formulate policies and programmes to
   bridge regional, social and economic disparities in as effective and
   sustainable a manner as possible.
   Presently the work is on at the senior secondary level (grade 11 \& 12)
   and slowly middle school students, college students, vocational courses,
   organizations having access to village communities, women in the
   villages desirous for change, health and family welfare units, organic
   farmers, water harvesters, environment friendly sustainable housing
   planners will be brought into the system.
   The project has been selected by the Centre for Innovation Incubation
   and Entrepreneurship (CIIE) under the prestigious Indian Institute of
   Management, Ahmadabad, India as one of the most innovative projects out
   of several hundred entries. Now the project is being incubated and hand
   held by CIIE, which is a great motivation for us.
   Recently International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) India invited
   us for a meeting and gave a patient hearing about the project. They have
   agreed, in principle, to help create data analytic programs essential
   for the project's adaptive learning strategies. This has been possible
   due to our relentless deliberations with IT Architects at IBM, USA to
   help create a robust digital platform.
   There has been substantial progress but a lot remains to be explored in
   partnership among key participants.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that cooperative learning provides long-term support
   and assistance for academic progress {[}1]. However, large production
   groups have been inefficient and cause a decline in creativity. By
   following a formal, cooperative learning strategy centered on dyadic
   teams, my project-based courses have yielded the most innovative
   results. The usefulness of dyads as an alternative to larger groups or
   individual work has been shown to make learning more collaborative and
   active {[}2].
   Motion Tools 1 is a digital media video capture and editing class using
   DSLR cameras. This course requires a variety of video/audio exercises
   and projects producing creative videos. During the production phase of
   these projects, students pair up in teams of two creating dyad
   communication. Dyads yield much higher efficiency and quality. Dyadic
   interaction also produces higher creativity than those working alone or
   in larger groups.
   This paper will explain the development of this project-based course in
   order to yield impressive results. In the presentation, examples of
   student work will be shown, and a cooperative learning strategy that
   enhances creativity and the quality of projects will be explained.}},

Abstract = {{Europe is facing an accelerated climate change as a result of global
   warming, mainly for human activities, and because of population
   departure and consequent abandon of rural areas. In this line, tourism
   alternatives are exploring new horizons. Deforestation, climate change,
   sea pollution and other causes involve the need to conserve natural
   heritage.
   In this frame the concept of ecotourism appears, trying to combine
   conservation of nature with socioeconomic development of many local
   communities, involving a direct participation of them, so as a feedback
   between local people, tourists and nature. There is a need to find ways
   to support management of such hazards by providing adequate training on
   Sustainable and Ecological Tourism. One academic proposal for
   understanding and training appropriate personnel to mitigate threats to
   the environment is higher education, so in this way, authors proposed an
   MSc Program related to Sustainable Tourism. Another strong point of this
   program is to prepare students for the regional and global postgraduate
   job market. This paper is intended to explain and analyze the stages of
   preparation of documentation and project management, whole preparation
   of a Master Erasmus Program, including teaching strategies, such as
   Virtual Learning Platform that contains learning materials in a digital
   format including text, audio-material, images and video-material,
   meetings as a tester workshops organized in participating countries,
   future interaction with the student etc. Finally, the document is
   intended as an aid to future teachers to detect a lack of training in an
   area that affects the environment in Europe so they can propose a
   training program, innovative and high acceptance towards the Graduates
   of Business and Planning faculties who intend to work in the
   infrastructure projects, graduates of environmental faculties who intend
   to specialise in Sustainable and Ecological Tourism management. This
   work has been funded by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive
   Agency (EACEA), as an Erasmus Multilateral Project through project
   number 539517-LLP-1-2013-1-ES-ERASMUS-EKA.}},

   as multimodal education, teaching practice provides Eminus institutional
   educational platform developed by the Universidad Veracruzana, as an
   integral element of services and spaces for knowledge-sharing, provided
   to students and teachers.
   Its name refers to the latin ``at a distance{''}, developed in 2003 by
   the technological innovation Department attached to the management of
   development informatics support academic of the General Directorate of
   information technology. Initially only supported 800 users by school
   period, the evolution of the platform genre later versions like: Eminus
   2.0 that supported 1500 users, for version 2.2 of Eminus, users
   increased to approximately 10,000; Subsequently, Eminus 2.4 included
   more features and was enriched by the collaboration of teachers, and the
   use of 19,800 students per period and the academic staff were of to
   1,100.
   Currently Eminus evolves to version 3 to adapt to the new academic
   requirements leverages existing technologies and the increased use of
   mobile devices.
   The new version is designed to meet the demand of users that today work
   in Eminus, 25,000 students and to 1,300 academics, as well as providing
   support for multiple devices with a clear, intuitive and rich interface.
   Use Eminus as to fully electronic notebook, allows to cultural change,
   generating awareness of ecological, economic and sustainable at the same
   time that develop skills of self-learning and use of virtual educational
   platforms. That integrates tools more friendly interaction with users.
   The materials which are stored in the platform can occur in various
   digital formats. The Organization of the contents by the facilitators is
   reflected more flexible, versions prior to this had stiffness in his
   design.
   The evolution of information technology have led its developers to adapt
   to Eminus mobility, allowing its interface adapts to tablets and
   smartphones, making optimal use and the hand.
   The new version of this platform have generated in the academic interest
   in their use, integration and application in their teaching practice,
   they reflect that there is still a resistance to change to the digital
   age and web 2.0. But Eminus is recognized in the new version, as a tool
   that will better organize their teaching work. Training in the tool
   fostering in them the use of technology and are aware of why exploit

Abstract = {{Studies of undergraduate science education show that student must be
   actively engaged in the learning process for it to be effective. Passive
   lecturing ({''}teaching by telling{''}) is known to be insufficient for
   developing critical thinking skills. Research also provided a mounting
   evidence of the importance of social interaction in an active
   student-centered learning environment. For example, small-group
   collaborative active learning environment is known to be much more
   effective for developing conceptual understanding in introductory
   physics than the traditional lecture setting. For these reasons, science
   education is gradually moving from this traditional method of lecturing
   to more interactive approaches. One such approach is Inquiry-Based
   Science Education (IBSE) where students work together in small groups
   and the instructor serves as a facilitator or ``coach{''} instead of a
   lecturer. IBSE is a student-centered active learning strategy focused on
   questioning to discover natural laws, linking information into a
   meaningful context, developing critical thinking and promoting positive
   attitudes towards science. It is associated with the idea ``involve me
   and I understand{''}. In this pedagogical method the students are guided
   through investigations to ``discover{''} concepts. Targeted concepts are
   generally not told to the students in lectures before they have an
   opportunity to investigate (or at least think about) the idea.
   The application of IBSE principles to physics learning leads to the
   so-called Inquiry-Based Physics. Physical experiments play a key role in
   Inquiry-Based Physics because they are the basis for inquiry. The
   students are guided to form conclusions based on evidence they acquire
   from the experimental problems. By Inquiry-Based Physics it is possible
   introduce the laboratory component into the classroom as a regular
   learning activity.
   In the present academic year we have implemented innovative units based
   on the Inquiry-Based Physics philosophy in the programme of Physics I
   for the grade of Mechanical Engineering in the University of Malaga. We
   present in this communication the followed process and results obtained
   for the unit Newton's Laws. In our classroom, the students sit at tables
   (2 teams of 3 students each) for classroom activity. In the academic
   activity, the students have to use automated video analysis software
   based on image recognition (Tracker) to measure the position as a
   function of time of a physical system in order to resolve an
   experimental problem. Each group of 3 students have a personal computer.
   An ultra-high-speed digital movie of an experiment is used as working
   material to resolve the experimental problem. The instructor circulates
   to keep students on track, answer questions and promote useful
   discussions. In this way, a dynamic collective learning environment is
   created which fully engages students. Students were very involved in the
   learning experience and their satisfaction was very high (4.7 out 5).}},

Abstract = {{DIAMOND(1) is a two-year LLP-Grundtvig funded project aimed at realizing
   museum cultural/educational activities addressed to marginalized groups.
   It intends to do so by exploiting the enormous potential of museums as
   tools of empowerment and social inclusion and that of Digital
   Storytelling (DS) within the cultural and social domain by training
   museum professionals in the DS methodology and by using it in the
   implementation and evaluation of the project's activities.
   This paper presents ``the phases{''} of the Project, including the
   training Courses and the preliminary results on the impact of DS as they
   emerged from the first pilot experiences realized in Rome by the Museo
   Civico di Zoologia.}},

Abstract = {{Could we convert a laboratory practical into innovative material capable
   of arousing public interest? How do you do it? The overall objetives of
   this work are: a) To disclose rigorous science in an entertaining manner
   to society, b) To arouse the curiosity of students in the general public
   of the work done in university departments, c) To increase the knowledge
   of students of the Science and Technology world. The specific objectives
   of this work were to combine scientific rigor with playful aspects when
   introducing new technologies, encourage scientific vocations among young
   students and introduce new formats and communication styles for
   education. To answer these questions a multidisciplinary team at the
   Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena (Spain) selected several scientific
   experiments presenting them in a fun as well as educational format. It
   is ``Science and Engineering Pictures{''}. The format chosen consists of
   several short digital audio-visual segments (micro spaces), which can be
   used in a lecture, in educational media, in TV or even in movies. These
   digital audio-visuals briefly show the development of a laboratory
   practical, from the initial idea in the laboratory to their transfer to
   the society and companies. These laboratory exercises belong to various
   degrees such as Chemical, Industrial, Telecommunications and Agronomic
   Engineering. Each micro-space lasts about 5-10 minutes and the intention
   is to promote a new style of educational audio-visual communication and
   scientific culture. This audio-visual shows traditional content in an
   innovative way and provides new formulas in line with new audiences and
   possibilities offered by new information technologies and communication,
   helping to promote scientific and engineering knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays social networks can be considered as psycho-technological
   environments (De Kerckove, 1999) {[}1] with a high identity-making
   value. Pedagogy cannot ignore these new places, with the aim of making
   formal training increasingly more `connected' to informal training
   through Social networks, as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr. This paper aims
   to present an action-research that is based on new and innovative ways
   to incorporate technology and social media into teaching methodology
   (Joosten, 2012) {[}2], as forms of distance and online education
   programs. While until now most popular researches try to study the
   social network influence on young people and on their academic
   performances (Helou \& Rahim, 2012) {[}3], to analyse the content of
   user profiles, and try to diversify users and nonusers, our
   action-research explores the pedagogical relevances of Facebook in
   interactive laboratorial experiences, carried out with graduating
   students in the academic year 2012/2013 at the University of Naples
   ``Federico II{''}. We tried to implement frontal lessons with social
   networks technologies creating a closed group on Facebook and adopting a
   questionnaire (created ad hoc and tested with a pilot study) to evaluate
   students' beliefs on educational scopes of Facebook and its usefulness
   for teaching learning. Through the exploratory experience of the
   Facebook groups, students have also realized that
   externalization/construction of meaning and knowledge is not an
   individual but a social community act. The appearance, therefore, more
   interesting is the ability for students to turn knowledge from tacit to
   explicit. Using metaphors, analogies, and especially through reflections
   on experiences in common, students are able to explain and to share
   knowledge, which is difficult to express through purely frontal teaching
   methods. Teachers, as ``digital immigrants{''}, do not always seem to
   grasp the potentiality of social networks, which are the preferential
   medium of exchange and self-representation of their students, considered
   as ``native digitals{''} (Prensky, 2001) {[}4]. Native digitals require
   a rethinking of the traditional didactic structure, employing e-learning
   usability. The surprising results of our research demonstrate that
   according to students, Facebook should be useful for educational
   practices, first as a platform and as an open virtual space for
   instructional materials and sharing narratives, second as a virtual
   community of research, where it's possible to co-construct knowledge and
   reflexion upon contents and upon themselves (Strollo, 2012) {[}5].}},

Abstract = {{This work has been carried out in the Degree in Industrial Design and
   Product Development Engineering, framed within the European Higher
   Education Area.
   Here, students have been proposed to develop an ePorfolio (or Digital
   Portfolio) which comprises their own works, so that it could be both
   visualized from the Internet or mobile devices, and, even, transmitted
   by means of the current social communication platforms.
   The main purpose of this work focuses on boosting students'
   entrepreneurship and self-employment, by providing them with appropriate
   tools and strategies that would allow them properly make diffusion or
   their projects. To do so, both academic and non-academic works they
   might have developed will be taken into account.
   As these students are related to the design field, it is important
   fostering not only their projects' contents, but also the way they
   implement appropriate formats and structures so the final work has a
   sense of completion in all aspects. In this way, it is important them to
   consider the graphic and conceptual developments of the ePortfolio as
   basic issues, as it could become their ``letter of introduction{''} in
   their application for possible recruitments or, even, for being directly
   hired as freelance designers by a customer. Therefore, the achievement
   of a professional result of the ePortfolio is a crucial aspect, as it
   would show a competitive image both of students' and of their work that
   could contribute to their working insertion and development.
   Furthermore, the use of professional digital creation tools in the
   making process of the ePortfolio helps students' acquiring specific
   competences in the handling of these tools that could enhance their
   professional development in other design fields.}},

   years, which has resulted in more students taking freshman composition
   courses online than ever before. One of the significant trends in

   higher education. However, high enrollment in online courses and degree
   programs is coupled with higher attrition rates and lower course
   satisfaction among online students when compared to onsite students,
   which suggests that the needs of online and nontraditional students are
   not being adequately met by online postsecondary institutions.
   The rapid increase in online learning programs has also led to an
   increase in the number of students taking composition courses online, so
   there is a need to develop teaching practices and approaches to feedback
   designed specifically for online learning environments. One way of
   developing such practices is by using Web 2.0 tools that allow for
   streamlined sharing of digital audio and video content. Using
   transactional distance theory and the community of inquiry (CoI) model,
   the presenter will show how the affordances of Web 2.0 tools that
   facilitate audio-visual commentary have the potential to reduce
   transactional distance, increase cognitive and teaching presence, and
   increase student course satisfaction in online composition courses.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of the digital age, this paper reports the perceptions of
   stakeholders about an integrated implementation of tablet computers in a
   secondary school in Flanders. The main focus is on the central role that
   teachers play in this implementation process. Focus group interviews
   show that teachers can be distinguished into two categories, namely the
   innovative and the instrumental teachers, which has consequences on the
   manner of giving courses and the needs concerning professional
   development. These results indicate that the role of innovative teachers
   has to be promoted and attention has to be given to digital didactics.

Abstract = {{The Japanese language is among the international languages which are
   highly demanded in the education system in Malaysia, all the more so
   since the Look East Policy Program was launched in July 1981 by the 4th
   Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. Japanese language
   course has been offered at the National University of Malaysia (UKM) as
   early as 1975. The course uses the textbook Minna no Nihongo and
   Introduction to the Hiragana and Katakana Japanese Writing. However, the
   exclusive dependence on both textbooks has created a passive and
   teacher-centred learning environment. In line with the present
   development of information and communication technology, it is felt that
   an innovation in terms of Japanese language pedagogy should be carried
   out to balance the needs of the Internet (I is always capitalised)
   generation. The Net and digital generation is a social generation that
   actively communicates, cooperates, and connects using technology in the
   virtual realm. One of the technologies that can be utilised is by using
   Web 2.0 applications. Therefore, an eclectic method of intervention is
   needed by integrating and practising Web 2.0 elements to realise an
   educational environment and system that is even more conducive, modern
   and futuristic. This study focused on students taking the Japanese
   language course SKVA2723 at the School of Language Studies and
   Linguistics in UKM from February to December 2012 for 2 semesters. A
   total of one teacher and 55 students were involved in this study. The
   applications of Web 2.0 such as JING, Screencast.com, YouTube,
   OnlineNihongo website, and Wordpress were utilised in the teaching and
   learning of Japanese language. The period of learning for the Japanese
   language subject was four hours for fourteen weeks per semester. Through
   questionnaires, observations and tests conducted, the findings showed
   that the group of students who were exposed to the 2.0 applications
   showed more motivation, enthusiasm, excitement and higher scores
   compared to the group that was not exposed to the applications. The
   implication from this study is that the use of Jing can be applied to
   more complex kanji orthography, particularly those that require more
   than 10 strokes. It is hoped that applications such as Screencast. com,
   YouTube and Wordpress can inspire new ideas, encourage student-centred
   learning and can be shared with Japanese language and foreign language
   courses from other universities and other institutions. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Currently, with the rise of online communities, communication has
   shifted away from traditional modes that have long been based on
   face-to-face models of interaction, to a more digital approach such as
   social networks. Thus the acquisition of online literacy in social
   networks such as Facebook might create a gap or linguistic difference
   that distinguishes generation Y aged from 20 to 30 years old who are the
   active users of Facebook from the baby boomers aged from 40 years and
   above who are adopters of social network. Hence, the aim of this study
   is to examine topics they post, use of non standard language and the use
   of multimedia application in social network to highlight the issues that
   could allow misunderstandings to occur in social network conversation.
   The data is derived from the `status' of selected Facebook users and
   analyzed qualitatively. The pilot findings show that there are
   differences in term of spelling innovations and capitalization, acronym
   and abbreviation, emoticons and punctuations. In the matter of content,
   baby boomers posts are more informative, direct and in order compared to
   generation Y. Baby boomers are also more likely to respond to the
   comments that are relevant to their post compared to generation Y. This
   study proposes that in order to minimize the differences and bridge the
   communication gaps generation Y need to formalize their writing and
   avoid unnecessary spelling innovations, capitalization, abbreviation,
   emoticons and punctuations that can course uncertainty to baby boomers.
   At the same time baby boomers should also be aware of the online
   literacy to mingle with the future generations. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Research studies have discovered that digital storytelling which
   combines the art of storytelling with a variety of interactive media
   tools can benefit language learning in a variety of ways. It has been
   found to encourage and motivate students and at the same time enhance
   their communication skills and enable them to build conceptual skills
   and technological skills - all in-line with 21st century skills required
   by the job market. This paper will describe the use of digital
   storytelling as an innovation for learning English in an English for
   Academic Purpose (EAP) course, and the teachers and students' responses
   to the innovation. The analysis of preliminary data will be derived from
   interviews with five teachers, and the students' questionnaire survey.
   The discussion of the preliminary findings will explore to what extent
   the project enhances the promotion of 21st century skills, such as
   interactive communication skills, interpersonal skills, technology
   literacy skills as well as language skills. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Smart manufacturing is a key aspect for innovation and competitiveness,
   and involves several dimensions of the production chain to be analysed,
   assessed and enhanced within a factory. To target this issue, concepts
   and ideas behind the IoT (Internet of Things) are applied, so that
   connected smart entities cooperate in order to achieve broader goals or
   increase the overall knowledge in the factory through information
   sharing. Smart entities in the IoT are typically referred as WSNs
   (Wireless Sensor Networks) that capture physical (real) data and events
   and produce virtual (digital) information to be processed.
   Unfortunately, current WSNs have limited interoperability and processing
   capabilities, reducing the integration degree with existing
   applications. This chapter proposes a solution for both previous
   technical challenges within a factory. Interoperability is achieved by
   means of SWE (Sensor Web Enablement) whereas processing capabilities are
   provided through virtualizing smart objects in a datacentre, placed
   commonly in the factory but it could also be located elsewhere, applying
   cloud-based techniques. The architecture and deployment has been
   arranged for the specific use case of a manufacturing company and a risk
   prevention scenario. Experimentation results show that smart objects
   could be provided at runtime with fine granularity level depending on
   the tasks to be performed. Moreover, smart objects are able to
   co-operate forming meta-objects to satisfy global tasks or minimize
   certain risks. Finally, smart objects are able to encapsulate private
   (health and/or personal) data that should not be shared with other
   objects or processes.}},

Abstract = {{The digital surface models (DSM) are the most popular products to
   determine visible surface of Earth which includes all non-terrain
   objects such as vegetation, forest, and man-made constructions. The
   airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is the preferred technique
   for high resolution DSM generation in local coverage. The automatic
   generation of the high resolution DSM is also possible with stereo image
   matching using the aerial images. The image matching algorithms usually
   rely on the feature based matching for DSM generation. First, feature
   points are extracted and then corresponding features are searched in the
   overlapping images. These image matching algorithms face with the
   problems in the areas which have repetitive pattern such as urban
   structure and forest.
   The recent innovation in camera technology and image matching algorithm
   enabled the automatic dense DSM generation for large scale city and
   environment modelling. The new pixel-wise matching approaches are
   generates very high resolution DSMs which corresponds to the ground
   sample distance (GSD) of the original images. The numbers of the
   research institutes and photogrammetric software vendors are currently
   developed software tools for dense DSM generation using the aerial
   images. This new approach can be used high resolution DSM generation for
   the larger cities, rural areas and forest even Nation-wide applications.
   In this study, the performance validation of high resolution DSM
   generated by pixel-wise dense image matching in part of Istanbul was
   aimed. The study area in Istanbul is including different land classes
   such as open areas, forest and built-up areas to test performance of
   dense image matching in different land classes. The obtained result from
   this performance validation in Istanbul test area showed that, high
   resolution DSM which corresponds to the ground sample distance (GSD) of
   original aerial image can be generated successfully by pixel-wise dense
   image matching using commercial and research institution's software.}},

Abstract = {{Several successful contemporary dance companies in Europe are
   experimenting with new ways of presenting choreography and movement
   utilising digital media. Here, an analysis is offered of the context in
   which these innovations are stimulated, focusing on their efforts to
   demonstrate that contemporary dance is a `knowledge-producing'
   endeavour. I tie this to the demands of knowledge economies. I then
   offer an analysis of specific projects and the `choreographic objects'
   that result from them utilising exchange theory drawn in part from
   Melanesian anthropology. The resulting analysis of things-in-the-making
   and things-in-circulation reveals how choreographic objects are shaped
   by dance practitioners' views of themselves, their interests, and their
   desire to control perceptions of their practice as well as by the need
   to find an appropriate mode in which to demonstrate the value of this
   practice through the transfer of knowledge. The move towards `knowledge
   production' and towards recasting relationships with audiences are
   construed as experiments with the form of social relations through new
   forms of transaction. I come to represent the digital creations of dance
   companies as `prototype' forms for relational engagement with audiences
   and the wider public.}},

Title = {{Digital support for medication administration A means for reaching the
   goal of providing good care?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{327-343}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe staffs' perceptions
   of digital support for medication administration (DSM) and out of the
   perceptions interpret underlying values.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 22 persons working in elder care
   participated in the study. The study had a qualitative approach and
   focus group interviews were used to collect data. To analyze the
   manifest content a phenomenographic method was used. An interpretation
   of perceptions was then undertaken aimed at identifying underlying
   values.
   Findings - Three descriptive categories, ``utility,{''} ``impact on
   working environment{''} and ``economic impact{''} were the result of the
   manifest analysis. The values of having a ``good working
   environment,{''} ``benefits{''} and ``good economy{''} were interpreted
   as guidance for staffs' acceptance or rejection of the DSM.
   Social implications - The care-giving process and its challenges from
   the perspective of the staffs need consideration. Staffs in this study
   sometimes expressed strong emotions as a sign of frustration for losing
   prerequisites to perform their work well. In big complex organizations
   where economy and effectiveness are often discussed, knowledge of power
   relations in innovation and implementation processes would be
   beneficial. Although moral distress is a well-known phenomenon, future
   research may be needed to find solutions that diminish this negative
   trend in more economic focussed organizations.
   Originality/value - This study had a twofold approach with the intention
   of going beyond descriptions. To gain a deeper understanding a normative
   interpretation was completed. Ethical conflicts are frequently
   characterized as conflicts between at least two values. In this study
   staffs expressed fear of losing prerequisites needed to perform their
   work well. Prerequisites that were identified as values and these values
   were threatened by the DSM.}},

Abstract = {{Educational reform theorists argue that schools of education and their
   neighboring public schools must enhance collaborative efforts so as to
   attain ``simultaneous renewal{''} wherein elementary and secondary
   students and pre-service teachers are served in authentic ways that
   deepen all students' learning (Goodlad, 1994). One way to accomplish
   this is through use of sustainable, innovative projects that connect
   pre-service teachers' early learning experiences directly to public
   classrooms. The purpose of this chapter is to offer a model for
   successful collaborations between pre-service teachers and urban high
   school students. The authors provide an overview of the digital poetry
   project and subsequent analysis of the reciprocal impact this project
   had on both the pre-service teachers and adolescents, including
   increased engagement with instructional objectives, enhanced literacy
   and technological competencies, and fostering of intellectual
   transitions.}},

Abstract = {{The explosion of apps for the medical and wellness sectors has been
   noted by many. Consumer apps, which provide innovative solutions for
   self management for a range of health problems have flooded the market,
   due to high consumer demand. More recently we have seen increased
   presence of truly medical applications for clinical professionals and
   patients of serious conditions. In the majority of cases consumer based
   mHealth apps allow people to do old things in new ways, such as
   recording health measures digitally rather than on paper. Medical apps,
   aimed at increasing the quality and efficiency of existing health care
   delivery models, provide clinical staff with convenient tools and easy
   to access resources and communication mechanisms. Finally, in rare and
   exciting cases we are seeing mHealth applications that are doing things
   in entirely new ways to drive real innovation in health care delivery
   through mobile devices. This tutorial will inform participants about the
   breadth of mHealth applications that are transforming the Health
   Services sector and put forward a strong case for HCI and efficacy
   research.}},

   tensioned membrane structure and portable charging station commissioned
   by Volvo Car Italia to showcase the new Volvo V60 Hybrid Electric Diesel
   car. Officially launched in Milan, Italy in October 2013, this
   experimental structure was developed through a process of rigorous
   research and development that investigated methods of associative
   modelling, dynamic mesh relaxation, geometric rationalization, solar
   incidence analysis, membrane panelling, and material performance. It is
   an experimental structure that, similar to a concept car, is a working
   prototype that speculates on the potential future of personal mobility
   and alternative energy sources for transportation while also exploring
   digital design methodologies and innovative structural solutions. This
   paper will illustrate the design, development and fabrication processes
   involved in realizing this structure.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of digital tools in the production of architecture
   undoubtedly constitutes the main force behind contemporary architectural
   innovation. In addition, the interaction of digital technologies with
   analog craft manufacturing -a rather unexplored field of study- suggests
   a wide range of novel opportunities. This research focuses on developing
   a framework for deploying digital design techniques to the production of
   bricks under vernacular technology as a medium of achieving geometrical
   variations and functional complexity in domestic-scale projects.
   Solid clay bricks are embedded in traditional ceramic-construction
   culture. Thus, this investigation faces the challenges of making a
   feasible innovative system in a country where digital fabrication is not
   an economically viable option, and engaging a design that can be easily
   implemented with current hand-labour. Consequently, the new bricks would
   be massively introduced in the construction market, allowing novel
   formal and functional possibilities for designers.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years the protection and safeguarding of cultural heritage
   has become a key issue of European cultural policy and this applies not
   only to tangible artefacts (monuments, sites, etc.), but also to
   intangible cultural expressions (singing, dancing, etc.). The
   i-Treasures project focuses on some Intangible Cultural Heritages (ICH)
   and investigates whether and to what extent new technology can play a
   role in the preservation and dissemination of these expressions. To this
   aim, the project will develop a system, based on cutting edge technology
   and sensors, that digitally captures the performances of living human
   treasures, analyses the digital information to semantically index the
   performances and their constituting elements, and builds an educational
   platform on top of the semantically indexed content. The main purpose of
   this paper is to describe how the user requirements of this system were
   defined. The requirements definition process was based on a
   participatory approach, where ICH experts, performers and users were
   actively involved through surveys and interviews, and extensively
   collaborated in the complex tasks of identifying specificities of rare
   traditional know-how, discovering existing teaching and learning
   practices and finally identifying the most cutting edge technologies
   able to support innovative teaching and learning approaches to ICH.}},

Abstract = {{While Indian agriculture contributes merely 13.9\% of the country's
   Gross Domestic Product, nearly 52\% of the population still depends on
   agriculture for its livelihood. Close to half of the farmers are small
   farmers (owning 1.0 ha or less) facing near-stagnant productivity. This
   is due to several factors, but farmers often indicate that access to the
   right information at the right time is one of the most sought after
   need. Addressing this need to aid in the development of a productive and
   sustainable agricultural sector has certainly emerged as one of the
   major humanitarian challenges in India. There have been numerous efforts
   in this direction with the setting up of agricultural advisory systems,
   to provide information to farmers, but not many have succeeded in the
   objective of providing easily accessible, sustainable, personalized
   advisories to farmers. Recognizing this, the IndoUK Advanced Technology
   Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks, Systems and Services
   (IUATC), a major technology transfer initiative, supported by the
   Department of Science and Technology (DST) in India and UK Government
   under the Digital Economy Theme is attempting to address the challenges
   in Indian agriculture through Information and Communication Technology
   (ICT) networks. This paper presents a functioning Agricultural Advisory
   System that has been built with the aim of bridging information gaps
   between farmers and agriculture knowledge workers (such as agricultural
   scientists and extension workers) and is an extension of a technology
   effort that has been previously presented. While our earlier work only
   discussed the potential of using an innovative ICT approach to providing
   personalized agricultural advisories, this paper covers details of the
   technology implementation, presents a brief summary of the impact
   analysis carried out with the farmers registered into our system and
   discusses new features that could make the system more effective.}},

Abstract = {{European Community Agenda assigns to Culture a primary role in
   achievement of the so defined ``Knowledge Society{''}, as inferred by
   the numerous events inside the ``Culture Program{''}, established in
   2007 with the ``Lisbon Agreement{''} (according to art. n. 167). The
   ``Europe 2020{''} Program continues the policy outlined in Lisbon,
   pointing on Innovation, Research, Digitalization and ICT detailed
   implementation on Cultural Heritage. The spread of new technologies,
   including those from Information and Communication (ICT), has deeply
   changed the way of learning transmission, increasing the possibility to
   create knowledge. The aim of this paper is to illustrate examples of
   enhancement of cultural heritage through new communication strategies
   based on the use of digital technologies for the construction of images
   that convey cultural content, and oriented to fruition as a visual
   experience, which is lived, told and shared, to catch the attention,
   expand knowledge and create a sense of identity and belonging.
   The starting point of the proposed considerations is the research
   activity carried out by PhD in ``Architecture, Industrial Design and
   Cultural Heritage{''} of the Second University of Naples. We are dealing
   with courses of reflection and planning strategies in which the skills
   of Architecture, Archaeology, History of Art and Design for
   Communication are fused into transverse paths that interpret in a
   progressing manner the complex issue of cultural policies, which are
   oriented to the enlargement of the `mental space' through the intimate
   relationship with the cultural heritage. This is an indispensable
   condition for the building of a society really oriented to the
   production of knowledge. Examples in this way are the case studies
   presented, some of which carried out within the research and teaching
   activities of the Department of Architecture and Industrial Design SUN
   where obvious is attempting to use the potential of ICT (Information
   Communication Technologies) in order to enable ``capital emotions{''}
   and therefore the processes of identity and cultural appropriation of
   heritage through the telling and sharing of experience.}},

   considered, spanning scales from the granularity of a subcharacter up
   through the scope of the internet. Enhanced capabilities include
   character articulation, word-sized graphs and images, textual animation,

Abstract = {{The aim of this research is to present the results of research project
   called ``Pompei, Knowledge Factory{''}, whereas the `Knowledge Factory'
   represents a specific territorial infrastructure that, along with
   integrating know-how and technologies, may serve as the driver of
   innovation within the cycle of the protection and regenerative
   development of the cultural, environmental, landscape and industrial
   assets. Regeneration that could modify Pompei in a smart city. The
   definition of smart city, which has emerged in recent years, identifies
   a technological and interconnected city, that is also sustainable,
   comfortable, attractive, confident, with a balanced development and
   better management of energy resources and transport, reducing emissions,
   waste, pollution and congestion. In short, a ``smart{''} design should
   not to dwell on mere regulations, but rather propose an integrated
   concept of the city landscape and development, reordering priorities and
   mobilizing the key issues in a logic of smart territories and
   communities that functions as a major stimulus for innovative research
   as well as projects.
   The ambitious goal of this project was to define operational protocols
   for the analysis, the survey and sustainable management of the territory
   of Pompei, not limited to the enclosure of the archaeological
   excavations, but rather included the whole municipality, with it being a
   carrier of critical elements, that has enormous chances still to be
   highlighted and valorised. In fact, the City of Pompei is unique due to
   the presence of two important tourist attractions (over than 6 million
   of tourists each year): the archaeological excavations of the City
   submerged by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A. D. and the Shrine of
   Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompei, now a Marian pontifical shrine and
   minor basilica, one of the most popular Italian destinations ``to be
   blessed{''}. These tourist attractions lie in the modern City of Pompei,
   beyond which lies a sprawling, chaotic conurbation, that in the absence
   of any form of planning has spontaneously risen over the years.
   Preliminary knowledge of the city and archaeological site areas is the
   fundamental critical premise, both in the collection of data as well as
   their return. The research was also an opportunity to set up an
   experiment, with the integrated use of survey techniques and tools, a
   field laboratory in order to develop a methodology for multidimensional
   and multi-scalar integrated digital surveying, that can be exported to
   other contexts.}},

   be able to respond to both current and future challenges; they should
   systematically re-evaluate the strategy of distribution channels and,
   more importantly, their corporate values and culture. This paper
   systematizes the knowledge about present use of ICT of selected service
   enterprises in Slovakia in the EU context. Based on comparison,
   analysis, synthesis, and generalization, the paper will establish the
   level of Internet infrastructure development in Slovakia in accordance
   with trends in the ICT area.}},

Abstract = {{Contour Crafting is a construction technology that potentially reduces
   energy use and emissions by using a rapid-prototype or 3-D printing
   process to fabricate large components. Comprised of robotic aims and
   extrusion nozzles, a computer-controlled gantry system moves the nozzle
   back and forth,The chief advantages of the Contour Crafting process over
   existing technologies are the superior surface finish that is realized
   and the greatly enhanced speed of fabrication.Considering the alarming
   nature of the shelter problem facing the world at the onset of the 21st
   century, traditional methods of meeting the worlds housing demands will
   not be sufficient. New and innovative means of constructing shelter must
   be considered. Contour Crafting technology is the best way to address
   the housing problem of the 21st century. Using materials readily
   available at the build site, construction by Contour Crafting can build
   dignified houses or colony of houses with all the utilities for
   electrical and plumbing in less than 24 hours (per house). The potential
   of Contour Crafting to quickly and efficiently alleviate housing
   concerns cannot be overlooked. this article introduces the new
   technology and evaluates the advantages of CC on low income housing.}},

Abstract = {{This article is an analysis of possible relationships between the
   concept of 21st century skills and mobile learning, seeing these
   constructs as central to pedagogical innovation. The rationale for the
   claims we put forward draws on the idea that most children grow up
   culturally immersed in digital technology rich habitats, indirectly
   forcing teachers to use technology and thus to develop new skills. The
   skills to be developed by teachers should be analyzed under new learning
   theoretical perspectives that consider the nature of mobile learning and
   address proposals to improve teachers' professional development through
   the notion that, in order to succeed in mobile learning implementation,
   teachers should know how to integrate mobile technologies with other
   tools. Our assumptions are based on the notion that we live in a social
   world of constantly emerging new technologies that challenge the field
   of education.}},

Abstract = {{The study identifies ICT and new media impact on Arabic acquisition as a
   supplement to traditional face-to-face learning within the framework of
   formal education system. For the last three years more than one hundred
   teachers of Arabic from seven Russian institutions have participated in
   the study under the advanced distance training program `` The Arabic
   language and innovative education{''} (hereinafter -the Program). The
   onemonth-long Program was developed and implemented by the authors of
   the present study. The Program is aimed to give the teachers of Arabic
   additional skills to improve their professional competence, such as
   creating digital teaching materials (e-books, presentations, multimedia
   applications, etc.), acquiring competency in the ICTsupported learning
   capacities, etc. The Program is implemented by means of
   videoconferencing and of SAKAI Collaboration and Learning Environment.
   The present study addresses the introduction and implementation of new
   technologies for Arabic learning on the basis of the examples obtained
   in the course of cooperating with seven institutions across Russia on
   developing common learning practices and teaching strategies. The fact
   that three of the seven institutions are Islamic Universities, which
   have their own, special objectives, methods and traditions in Arabic
   instruction, is highly important. The results show how ` digital
   literacy' opens up new pedagogical capabilities and how using ICT in
   Arabic language instruction can enrich it by integrating it with social,
   economic and cultural elements.}},

   mutual cooperation, which urges for personalized treatment of students,
   greater cooperation and better links between formal and non-formal

   Very important are academics skills, including digital literacy,
   improving the quality and modern teach their subjects. They have to
   learn new teaching methods, forms, students develop a host of innovative
   thinking. Universities must become effective partners for global
   development. Only through the proliferation of networks between
   like-minded alliances can transformation occur at the scale that is
   immediately needed in order to advance our present global knowledge
   economy. Our communities must open their eyes to this imminent future

   influence and the potential to manifest technologies and concepts that
   can change lives the world over.}},

Title = {{Medical Acoustics}},
Booktitle = {{SPRINGER HANDBOOK OF ACOUSTICS, 2ND EDITION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Pages = {{877-937}},
Abstract = {{Medical acoustics can be subdivided into diagnostics and therapy.
   Diagnostics are further separated into auditory and ultrasonic methods,
   and both employ low amplitudes. Therapy (excluding medical advice) uses
   ultrasound for heating, cooking, permeablizing, activating and
   fracturing tissues and structures within the body, usually at much
   higher amplitudes than in diagnostics. Because ultrasound is a wave,
   linear wave physics are generally applicable, but recently nonlinear
   effects have become more important, even in low-intensity diagnostic
   applications.
   This document is designed to provide the non-medical acoustic scientist
   or engineer with some insights into acoustic practices in medicine.
   Auscultation with a stethoscope is the most basic use of acoustics in
   medicine and is dependent on the fields of incompressible (circulation)
   and compressible (respiration) fluid mechanics and frictional mechanics.
   Detailed discussions of tribology, laminar and turbulent hemodynamics,
   subsonic and supersonic compressional flow, and surfactants and
   inflation dynamics are beyond the scope of this document. However, some
   of the basic concepts of auscultation are presented as a starting point
   for the study of natural body sounds. Ultrasonic engineers have
   dedicated over half a century of effort to the development of ultrasound
   beam patterns and beam scanning methods, stretching the current
   technical and economic limits of analog and digital electronics and
   signal processing at each stage. The depth of these efforts cannot be
   covered in these few pages. However, the basic progression of progress
   in the fields of transducers and signal processing will be covered. The
   study of the interaction of ultrasound with living tissues is
   complicated by complex anatomic structures, the high density of
   scatterers, and the constantly changing nature of the tissues with
   ongoing life processes including cardiac pulsations, the formation of
   edema and intrinsic noise sources. A great deal of work remains to be
   done on the ultrasonic characterization of tissues. Finally, the effect
   of ultrasound on tissues, both inadvertent and therapeutic will be
   discussed.
   Much of the medical acoustic literature published since 1987 is
   searchable online, so this document has included key words that will be
   helpful in performing a search. However, much of the important basic
   work was done before 1987. In an attempt to help the reader to access
   that literature, Denis White and associates have compiled a complete
   bibliography of the medical ultrasound literature prior to 1987. Under
   Further Reading in this chapter, the reader will find a link to a
   complete compilation of 99 citations from Ultrasound in Medicine and
   Biology which list the thousands of articles on medical acoustics
   written prior to 1987.
   The academically based authors develop, use and commercialize diagnostic
   ultrasonic Doppler systems for the benefit of patients with
   cardiovascular diseases. To translate ultrasonic and acoustic innovation
   into widespread clinical application requires as much knowledge about
   the economics of medicine, the training and practices of medical
   personnel, and the pathology and prevalence of diseases as about the
   diffraction patterns of ultrasound beams and signal-to-noise ratio of an
   echo. Although a discussion of these factors is beyond the scope of this
   chapter, a few comments will help to provide perspective on the likely
   future contribution of medical acoustics to improved public health.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, there can be identified at ease a number of significant areas
   based on a conventional digital circuitry, such as evolvable or adaptive
   hardware, fault-tolerant architectures, reconfigurable systems or
   circuit development, where the introduction of partial reconfiguration
   principles may bring significant benefits with respect to traditional
   approaches. In case of polymorphic digital circuits (polymorphic digital
   circuit is able to perform more than one intended function, it typically
   has one stable structure for all required functions and the actually
   performed function or mode depends on a state of an environment) only
   one small-scale solution has been reported so far - the REPOMO. In this
   paper, main attention is given to the proposal of an innovative approach
   with increased flexibility, where the resulting capabilities are
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Figs Ficus carica is a temperate species well thrived in the
   Mediterranean basin and well recognized for its nutritional attributes.
   Indeed, fig fruit constitute an important food for local populations of
   the Mediterranean region, and they are considered as a prestigious snack
   due to their dietetic and healthy properties. Nevertheless, this
   cultivation is often marginalized in rural areas where it could
   significantly contribute to their sustainable development. The constant
   expanding global market makes it necessary for agro-food industries to
   satisfy customer's requirements and exigencies from both qualitative and
   quantitative points of view, leading them to adequate current post
   harvest technologies to more innovative and more accurate ones. In this
   context, the present work aimed to assess dried figs skin colour, as a
   qualitative parameter, using a computer vision system. Colour skin of
   both high-quality dried figs (PDO Fichi di Cosenza, Italy) and improper
   ones has been analyzed using two different analytical methods: RGB image
   analyses obtained with a digital camera, compared to colour analyses
   carried out by mean of chromameter. Data were expressed in terms of CIE
   XYZ, CIELAB and HunterLab colour spaces, moreover to the browning index
   measurement of each fruit belonging to the two groups. Data have been
   statistically analysed according to PCA and PLS-DA based methods.
   Subsequently, in-line sorting trials have been effectuated using a
   prototype based on computer vision, composed by three principal units:
   reception, inspection and separation; where inspection is achieved by
   means of two industrial progressive-scan colour cameras. Obtained
   results are satisfactory and promising for agro-food industries. Both
   PCA and PLS-DA analyses could show a complete distinction between
   high-quality dried figs and improper ones according to colour parameters
   obtained by both analytical methods. However, automatic colour
   assessment according to image analyses seemed to be more precise since
   it allowed the identification of different tonalities of more
   homogeneous groups within the high-quality figs group. In-line sorting
   results showed that 99.5\% of improper figs were classified correctly,
   as well as high quality DOP figs presenting a light skin colour
   (89.0\%). A lower percentage was obtained however for DOP figs because
   of the heterogeneity of the skin colour.}},

Abstract = {{Digital reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) neuronal morphology
   from light microscopy images provides a powerful technique for analysis
   of neural circuits. It is time-consuming to manually perform this
   process. Thus, efficient computer-assisted approaches are preferable. In
   this paper, we present an innovative method for the tracing and
   reconstruction of 3D neuronal morphology from light microscopy images.
   The method uses a prediction and refinement strategy that is based on
   exploration of local neuron structural features. We extended the
   rayburst sampling algorithm to a marching fashion, which starts from a
   single or a few seed points and marches recursively forward along
   neurite branches to trace and reconstruct the whole tree-like structure.
   A local radius-related but size-independent hemispherical sampling was
   used to predict the neurite centerline and detect branches. Iterative
   rayburst sampling was performed in the orthogonal plane, to refine the
   centerline location and to estimate the local radius. We implemented the
   method in a cooperative 3D interactive visualization-assisted system
   named flNeuronTool. The source code in C++ and the binaries are freely
   available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/flneurontool/. We validated
   and evaluated the proposed method using synthetic data and real datasets
   from the Digital Reconstruction of Axonal and Dendritic Morphology
   (DIADEM) challenge. Then, flNeuronTool was applied to mouse brain images
   acquired with the Micro-Optical Sectioning Tomography (MOST) system, to
   reconstruct single neurons and local neural circuits. The results showed
   that the system achieves a reasonable balance between fast speed and
   acceptable accuracy, which is promising for interactive applications in
   neuronal image analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel gradient-constrained morphological filtering
   algorithm for bare-earth extraction from light detection and ranging
   (LiDAR) data. Based on the gradient feature points determined by
   morphological half-gradients, the potential object points are located
   prior to filtering. Innovative gradient-constrained morphological
   operations are created, which are executed only for the potential object
   points. Compared with the traditional morphological operations, the new
   operations reduce many meaningless operations for object removal and
   consequently decrease the possibility of losing terrain to a great
   extent. The applicability and reliability of this algorithm are
   demonstrated by evaluating the filtering performance for fifteen sample
   datasets in various complex scenes. The proposed algorithm is found to
   achieve a high level of accuracy compared with eight other filtering
   algorithms tested by the International Society for Photogrammetry and
   Remote Sensing. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has minimal error
   oscillation for different landscapes, which is important for quality
   control of digital terrain model generation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd, All

Abstract = {{The innovative GridPix detector is a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) that
   is read out with a Timepix-1 pixel chip. By using wafer post-processing
   techniques an aluminium grid is placed on top of the chip. When
   operated, the electric field between the grid and the chip is sufficient
   to create electron induced avalanches which are detected by the pixels.
   The time-to-digital converter (TDC) records the drift time enabling the
   reconstruction of high precision 3D track segments. Recently GridPixes
   were produced on full wafer scale, to meet the demand for more reliable
   and cheaper devices in large quantities. In a recent beam test the
   contribution of both diffusion and time walk to the spatial and angular
   resolutions of a GridPix detector with a 1.2 mm drift gap are studied in
   detail. In addition long term tests show that in a significant fraction
   of the chips the protection layer successfully quenches discharges,
   preventing harm to the chip. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The FDIRC (Focusing Detector of Internally Reflected Cherenkov light) is
   a new concept of PID (Particle IDentification) detector aimed at
   separating kaons from pions up to a few GeV/c. It is the successor of
   the BABAR DIRC and benefits from the knowledge accumulated with a first
   FDIRC prototype built and operated at SLAC. The FDIRC is intended to be
   used in an environment with a luminosity 100 times higher than for BABAR
   and Belle. Backgrounds will be higher as well; yet, the FDIRC has been
   designed to perform at least as well as the BABAR DIRC. The main
   improvement is a complete redesign of the photon camera, moving from a
   huge tank of ultra-pure water to much smaller focusing cameras with
   solid fused-silica optics. Furthermore, the detection chain will be 10
   times faster than in BABAR to reject more background and to measure more
   accurately Cherenkov angles. This is achieved using H-8500 MaPMTs and a
   new front-end electronics (FEE) with significantly improved timing
   precision, higher hit rate capability, and small dead time A full-scale
   FDIRC prototype covering 1/12th of the barrel azimuth is installed at
   SLAC and has just started recording cosmic-ray data. In this paper, we
   summarize the FDIRC design, present the status of the prototype test at
   SLAC and review the ongoing work to analyse the data. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Remote sensing of discharge and river stage from space provides us with
   a promising alternative approach to monitor watersheds, no matter if
   they are ungauged, poorly gauged, or fully gauged. One approach is to
   estimate river stage from satellite measured inundation area based on
   the inundation area - river stage relationship (IARSR). However, this
   approach is not easy to implement because of a lack of data for
   constructing the IARSR. In this study, an innovative and robust approach
   to construct the IARSR from digital elevation model (DEM) data was
   developed and tested. It was shown that the constructed IARSR from DEM
   data could be used to retrieve water level or river stage from
   satellite-measured inundation area. To reduce the uncertainty in the
   estimated inundation area, a dual-thresholding method was proposed. The
   first threshold is the lower limit of pixel value for classifying water
   body pixels with a relatively high-level certainty. The second threshold
   is the upper limit of pixel value for classifying potentially flooded
   pixels. All pixels with values between the first threshold and the
   second threshold and adjacent to the classified water body pixels may be
   partially flooded. A linear interpolation method was used to estimate
   the wetted area of each partially flooded pixel. In applying the
   constructed IARSR to the estimated inundation areas from 11 Landsat TM
   images, 11 water levels were obtained. The root mean square error (RMSE)
   of the estimated water levels compared with the observed water levels at
   the US Geological Survey (USGS) gauging station on the Trinity River at
   Liberty in Liberty County, Texas, is about 0.38m. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Memristive devices are triggering innovations in the fields of
   nonvolatile memory, digital logic, analogue circuits, neuromorphic
   engineering, and so on. Creating new memristive devices with unique
   characteristics would be significant for these emergent applications.
   Here we report the coexistence of nonvolatility and volatility in
   Pt/Nb-doped SrTiO3 (NSTO)/In memristive devices. The Pt/NSTO interface
   contributes a nonvolatile resistive switching behaviour, whereas the
   NSTO/In interface displays a volatile hysteresis loop. Combining the two
   interfaces in the Pt/NSTO/In devices leads to the unique coexistence of
   nonvolatility and volatility. The results imply more opportunities to
   invent new memristive devices by engineering both interfaces in
   metal/insulator/metal structures.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable data on the ionising radiation environment is regarded as very
   important to ensure an efficient design and operation of spacecraft.
   Here we present a novel Highly Miniaturised Radiation Monitor (HMRM)
   that aims to greatly reduce costs and complexity of radiation detectors.
   At the core of the current design is a CMOS Image Sensor. Size and mass
   are considerably reduced thanks to this approach and there is also scope
   for a reduction in power consumption. This makes the HMRM much easier to
   integrate on a spacecraft. The innovative architecture of the proposed
   radiation monitor will also make particle identification possible.
   The image sensor is based on a 50 by 51 pixel array. The selected pixel
   is a 4T, to reduce the noise The array is read our in snapshot mode at a
   frame rate of 10,000 fps.
   Biasing currents and voltages are generated on chip to reduce the number
   of signals required to control the sensor. The sensor is designed to
   work on a large range of temperatures, from -40 degrees C to +80 degrees
   C; hence a temperature sensor has been integrated.
   The digital output data is obtained with a three bit column parallel ADC
   with programmable thresholds. An analogue readout has been also designed
   to characterise and debug the ASIC.
   In this following paper we also want to present the results obtained
   from the measurements on the prototype. Preliminary PTC plots show a
   gain of 60 mu V/e(-) with CDS and a noise of 17 e(-) rms, which includes
   the noise from the external board. (C) 2013 Elsevier EN. All rights

Abstract = {{Today's technological development is leading to major and varied changes
   regarding the communication world. Related to a digital context that is
   multimedia, hypertextual and that allows interactivity, these changes
   imply a transformation of traditional journalistic genres and formats,
   which must be redefined in order to take advantage of the possibilities
   that the new media may offer. One of them is the documentary genre,
   which has been transformed adopting an innovative and interactive
   multimedia format known as `web documentary', `webdoc', etc. This
   reformed genre explores the Internet potentials adopting new forms of
   discursive approach when describing reality. Based on these aspects,
   this article aims to delve into the construction of the new narratives
   inside interactive multimedia documentary, paying a particular attention
   to the important role assigned to a receiver/user that becomes an active
   element when it comes to telling the story. It is taken as an specific
   object of study the `webdoc' conducted by the Laboratorio de Radio
   Television Espanola, whose analysis will provide the main
   characteristics that allow us to separate the classic format of
   documentary from the innovative new format whose characteristics are
   related to the so-called narrative experience for the receiver/user in
   documentary genre.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing concern about diminishing fossil resources and the
   impacts of the global warming is driving the growth of the new
   bioeconomy. Bioplastics, thermoplastic biopolymers that are either
   biodegradable or at least partly bio-based, are one of the fastest
   growing markets. The average growth rates over the past years have
   constantly been double-digit. Though the production capacities are
   small, currently approximately 0.5\% of the global plastics productions,
   recent market forecasts expect a sharp rise in the upcoming three years.
   Due to identical property profiles and established recycling processes,
   the largest growth is expected for partly bio-based conventional
   plastics, especially for bio-PET.
   This development was made possible by numerous innovations in the fields
   of chemical catalysis, biotechnology, and plastics engineering. It
   reflects an ongoing change in the bio-plastic industry, which
   increasingly focuses on the production of durable, bio-based plastics,
   after years of concentration on biodegradable plastics used for niche
   applications. But also the markets for bio-based and biodegradable
   plastics are expected to continue their rapid growth.
   This article reviews advances in production processes and material
   properties of selected bio-based plastics. It focuses on the most
   important bio-based plastics with established production and commercial
   applications. It furthermore provides an overview of new applications,
   and trends, as well as of major producers.}},

Abstract = {{In her article ``New Technologies and Teaching Comparative
   Literature{''} Graciela Boruszko discusses the use of new technologies
   in literary studies curricula. Innovative processes are becoming
   fundamental components of our educational systems as students challenge
   faculty to immerse themselves in their rapidly changing world. Learning
   in the twenty-first century is assisted by various information
   technologies because the networked information economy made possible by
   the Internet allows students to access a rich array of online resources
   including community based and collaborative knowledge exchange systems.
   Current students are ``digital natives{''} grown up using a variety of
   digital platforms. Students multitask and process information quickly
   and therefore demand more from the learning processes proposed to them.
   Rather than consuming information, students form their own information
   networks and participate in learning communities. The discipline of
   comparative literature relies on the interaction of ideas and concepts
   which evolve from an initial core of seemingly disconnected literary
   works. Technology is an important facilitator of those connections,
   enabling deeper thought to be given to the comparative process that
   follows the initial challenge of understanding how connections are
   formed or what a particular constellation of connections represents.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an in-depth analysis on the statistical distribution
   characteristics of human tongue color that aims to propose a
   mathematically described tongue color space for diagnostic feature
   extraction is presented. Three characteristics of tongue color space,
   i.e., tongue color gamut that defines the range of colors, color centers
   of 12 tongue color categories, and color distribution of typical image
   features in the tongue color gamut, are elaborately investigated in this
   paper. Based on a large database, which contains over 9000 tongue images
   collected by a specially designed noncontact colorimetric imaging system
   using a digital camera, the tongue color gamut is established in the CIE
   chromaticity diagram by an innovatively proposed color gamut boundary
   descriptor using one-class SVM algorithm. Thereafter, centers of 12
   tongue color categories are defined accordingly. Furthermore, color
   distributions of several typical tongue features, such as red points and
   petechial points, are obtained to build a relationship between the
   tongue color space and color distributions of various tongue features.
   With the obtained tongue color space, a new color feature extraction
   method is proposed for diagnostic classification purposes, with
   experimental results validating its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Inaccurate visualization of the inter-occlusal relationship has raised
   an important challenge to virtual planning for orthognathic surgery
   based on cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT). The aim of this study
   was to evaluate an innovative workflow for orthognathic surgery planning
   and surgical splint fabrication. The clinical protocol consists of a
   single cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) scan of the patient,
   surface scanning of the dental arches with an intraoral digital scanner,
   and subsequent fusion of the two datasets. The ``virtual patient{''}
   thus created undergoes virtual surgery, and the resulting file with the
   intermediate intermaxillary relationship is used to obtain the
   intermediate splint by CAD/CAM technology (computer-aided design and
   computer-aided manufacturing). A proof-of-concept study was performed in
   order to assess the accuracy and reliability of this protocol. The study
   comprised two parts: an in vitro evaluation on three dentate skull
   models and a prospective in vivo assessment on six consecutive patients.
   Vector error calculation between the virtually simulated intermaxillary
   position and the intraoperative intermediate intermaxillary relationship
   revealed high accuracy. The greatest average variation corresponded to
   the y axis. Compared to previously described methods for obtaining an
   augmented three-dimensional virtual model, this procedure eliminates the
   need for dental impressions, simplifies the necessary technical steps
   and computational work, and reduces the patient's exposure to ionizing
   radiation.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative single-camera two-dimensional digital image correlation
   (DIC) technique based on camera self-calibration is developed for use in
   the field where specialized fixed setups are not practical. The
   technique only requires attaching a planar calibration cover to the
   specimen surface and capturing images of the specimen from different
   orientations before and after deformation. A camera calibration
   procedure allows the camera to be freely repositioned without fixed
   mounts or known configurations, after which displacements are calculated
   with DIC. Computer simulated, random speckle images are used to test the
   proposed technique and good results are reported. Compared with the
   classical techniques which require precise fixed setups, the proposed
   technique is easier to use and more flexible, advancing the DIC beyond
   the laboratory into the real world. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

   with two estimators involved in the Kalman filter, the first corresponds
   to stochastic gradient describing the transition function and the second
   obtains the innovation process gain through fuzzy logic. The filtering
   process has time constraints for your response occurring before the
   reference system changes to another state. The results are formally
   described throughout the document. Auto-Regressive Moving Averages model
   was proposed (ARMA (1, 1)) as the reference system. The filtering
   algorithm was developed in MatLab (R) software getting the integrated
   filter operations illustrated with its graphics of convergence and
   response, concluding with brief an analysis of the results.}},

Abstract = {{Background Digital technologies are proliferating into dental practices.
   While their technical attributes have often been studied, it remains
   unclear why some dentists adopt and use these technologies more than
   others. Aim To explore the incentives for and barriers against accepting
   and using digital dental technologies Method Eleven semi-structured
   qualitative interviews were conducted with experts in dentistry, dental
   technology and dental education in the Netherlands. Results Dentists'
   acceptance and use of digital technologies are to varying degrees driven
   by the perceived advantages over analogue methods, perceived influence
   on treatment quality, dentists' personal and professional orientation,
   and social influence from peers and external groups. These effects are
   complemented by personal and dental-practice characteristics.
   Conclusions The findings suggest that there are large differences in
   motivation to adopt and use digital technologies between early adopters,
   late adopters and non-adopters, which should be examined in greater
   detail. We recommend that educators, dentists, and representatives of
   the dental industry who deal with the diffusion of these technologies
   take account of dentists' widely different attitudes to digitalisation.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of Information and Communication
   Technologies, vehicular networks that communicate with each other will
   have an innovative application in traffic safety and congestion. This
   study describes a preliminary study on an automated on-ramp merging
   control algorithm for vehicles on freeways under condition of
   Internet-connected vehicles. On the basis of vehicular operation
   characteristics during the merging process analysis, a cooperative
   driving algorithm based on Internet of vehicles was designed to achieve
   ramp merging without collision. Then two on-ramp merging cases,
   including one vehicle and two vehicles merging into the platoon on main
   lane, were discussed in detail. Simulation works were carried out and
   the results proved that the on-ramp merging algorithm was effective, but
   the vehicle following the leading vehicle on ramp lane is disturbed
   seriously by the leading vehicle. At the same time, the simulation
   results also showed the scenario that merging a platoon into the two
   vehicles on main lane affects the traffic flow more seriously than
   letting each individual vehicle on ramp lane consecutively to merge in
   between the two vehicles in the main lane under the same initial
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{Rural ICT centers are the initiative of the third millennium and widen
   the accessibility horizons of information and Communication Technology
   among disadvantaged groups of societies, and play a significant role in
   rural development processes. Adoption of new technology in rural Iran
   has been the main challenge and focal point of all agricultural
   extension activities since the modernization era of the 1950s.
   Consequently the rapidly growing gap between urban and rural economy has
   reinforced the critical role of ICT in creating an equal society.
   Identifying the factors which foster adoption of ICT is among the
   important challenges of alleviating digital divide. ICT centers attract
   different groups within rural communities and create a forum for
   unprivileged rural settlers to learn about and to use computer and
   internet. This paper attempts to identify the factors influencing the
   adoption of ICT in rural Gharn Abad's ICT center of Golestan Province.
   The sample included 218 individuals, who were selected by stratified
   random sampling method. Survey method was used, and data was analyzed by
   correlation as well as multiple regression techniques. Based on the
   results, the existence of ICT center itself, with various funding
   sources, reinforced the adoption regardless of the users' economic
   status. At the same time, the other factors such as individual, social,
   the households' informative \& communicative, as well as the innovation
   related factors were found influential. This case study could be used as
   a sample for planning, establishing, and developing the ICT centers in
   the other similar situations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The use of aggregate complaints data as an indicator of cumulative
   social impacts of mining: A case study from the Hunter valley, NSW,
   Australia}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Generally speaking, there is a greater amount of quantitative data
   available to measure and model the cumulative environmental or economic
   impacts of mining than the social impacts. In part, this is because
   social impacts are often inherently more difficult to quantify, but
   historically there have also been fewer regulatory drivers for companies
   or state agencies to invest in collecting such data. Regulators in some
   jurisdictions are now starting to require resource companies to report
   on aspects of their social performance, but companies and regulators are
   still struggling to identify appropriate metrics, particularly in
   regards to cumulative impacts. This paper describes an innovative
   quantitative approach to tracking how communities experience and respond
   to increased mining activity, using data from the complaints registers
   maintained by mines located in the Upper Hunter Valley in New South
   Wales, Australia. In this study, complaints lodged with five separate
   mines adjacent to the township of Muswellbrook over several years were
   aggregated and trends analysed. The aggregated set showed that complaint
   frequency increased with the increase in mining activity but then
   decreased as individual complaints were addressed. However, when
   complaints from near-neighbours were removed, it emerged that the
   proportion of complaints that came from the town itself steadily
   increased over time. Further analysis indicated that this increase was
   closely associated with the amount of mine-disturbed land that could be
   seen from the town over time, as measured using a combination of
   remotely sensed data and a digital elevation model. This is persuasive
   evidence of a cumulative social impact that is more than just the sum of
   the local impacts of individual mines. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents experimental investigations of the fundamental
   behavior of concrete filled steel tube (CFT) beam-columns under fire
   loading. A total of thirteen specimens were tested to determine the
   axial force-moment-curvature-temperature behavior of CFT beam-columns.
   The experimental approach involved the use of: (a) innovative heating
   and control equipment to apply thermal loading and (b) digital image
   correlation with close-range photogrammetry to measure the deformations
   (e.g., curvature) of the heated region. Each specimen was sequentially
   subjected to: (i) constant axial loading; (ii) thermal loading in the
   expected plastic hinge region following the ASTM E119 temperature-time
   T-t curve; and (iii) monotonically increasing flexural loading. The
   effects of various parameters on the strength and stiffness of CFT
   beam-columns were evaluated. The parameters considered were the steel
   tube width, width-to-thickness ratio, concrete strength, maximum surface
   temperature of the steel tube, and the axial load level on the composite
   CFT section. The experimental results provide knowledge of the
   fundamental behavior of composite CFT beam-columns, and can be used to
   calibrate analytical models or macro finite element models developed for
   predicting behavior of CFT members and frames under fire loading.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the process of physics teaching assistants' (TAs)
   PCK development in the context of teaching a new undergraduate
   introductory physics course. Matter and Interactions (M\&I) has recently
   adopted a new introductory physics course that focuses on the
   application of a small number of fundamental physical principles to the
   atomic and molecular nature of matter. The purpose of this study is to
   describe how the PCK of physics TAs in the M\&I course was developed and
   enacted. Data collection began during the TA preparation workshop that
   was held before the semester and continued during the recitation and
   laboratory classes that the TAs taught during the semester. Through a
   qualitative, multiple case study research design, data were collected
   from multiple sources: non-participant observations, digitally recorded
   video, semi-structured interviews, TAs' written reflections, and
   researchers' field notes. Data analysis consisted of cross-case and
   within-case analyses. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative
   method. After data analysis, 2 main themes emerged related to the
   development of TA's PCK: (a) TAs' PCK developed from propositional
   knowledge to personal practical knowledge and (b) the process of
   knowledge development consisted of 3 phases: accepting, actualizing, and
   internalizing. The results of this study will not only contribute to the
   quest to identify the nature of professional knowledge of science
   teaching but also help guide preparation for innovative introductory
   physics courses and other college level science courses in the future.}},

Title = {{A forceful upper jaw facilitates picking-based prey capture:
   biomechanics of feeding in a butterflyfish,Chaetodon trichrous}},

Abstract = {{Biomechanical models of feeding mechanisms elucidate how animals capture
   food in the wild, which, in turn, expands our understanding of their
   fundamental trophic niche. However, little attention has been given to
   modeling the protrusible upper jaw apparatus that characterizes many
   teleost species. We expanded existing biomechanical models to include
   upper jaw forces using a generalist butterflyfish, Chaetodon trichrous
   (Chaetodontidae) that produces substantial upper jaw protrusion when
   feeding on midwater and benthic prey. Laboratory feeding trials for C.
   trichrous were recorded using high-speed digital imaging; from these
   sequences we quantified feeding performance parameters to use as inputs
   for the biomechanical model. According to the model outputs, the upper
   jaw makes a substantial contribution to the overall forces produced
   during mouth closing in C trichrous. Thus, biomechanical models that
   only consider lower jaw closing forces will underestimate total bite
   force for this and likely other teleost species. We also quantified and
   subsequently modeled feeding events for C trichrous consuming prey from
   the water column versus picking attached prey from the substrate to
   investigate whether there is a functional trade-off between prey capture
   modes. We found that individuals of C. trichrous alter their feeding
   behavior when consuming different prey types by changing the timing and
   magnitude of upper and lower jaw movements and that this behavioral
   modification will affect the forces produced by the jaws during prey
   capture by dynamically altering the lever mechanics of the jaws. In
   fact, the slower, lower magnitude movements produced during
   picking-based prey capture should produce a more forceful bite, which
   will facilitate feeding on benthic attached prey items, such as corals.
   Similarities between butterflyfishes and other teleost lineages that
   also employ picking-based prey capture suggest that a suite of key
   behavioral and morphological innovations enhances feeding success for
   benthic attached prey items. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{ICT innovation is known to significantly elevate a country's growth and
   to enhance productivity. It is now well-acknowledged that emerging
   economies are beginning to innovate at a rapid rate despite some of the
   challenges they face. Given that these countries with such economies now
   comprise a third of the world's largest 25 economies, and that they are
   likely to be critical for the success of a global economy, it is
   important to understand how these economies innovate, what factors
   affect innovation in such nations, and what are the impacts. However, to
   the best of our knowledge, little research till date has been conducted
   on this topic, and the few existing studies have failed to catch the
   attention of the mainstream IS research community. We believe that the
   absence of studies is primarily due to a lack of understanding of what
   has been found with respect to ICT innovation in emerging economies,
   what needs to be studied, and how they should be studied. We attempt to
   contribute in this area by: (1) providing a comprehensive framework of
   existing research on ICT innovation in emerging economies, (2)
   highlighting the gaps that have been left behind, and (3) providing
   specific guidelines to future researchers, including a research model
   summarizing the salient issues that need examination. We believe that
   our study makes an important contribution to research on ICT innovation
   in emerging economies, and can be a useful resource for future
   researchers interested in this topic.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the theoretical background to a wider project that
   is attempting to increase our understanding of the impact and uses of
   large-scale digitization, being undertaken by the first author at
   University College London with the working title `What is the impact of
   large-scale digitization upon researchers and the information sector?'
   It discusses the controversy surrounding the emergence of mass
   digitization: the creation and collection of huge resources containing
   millions of pages of textual cultural content. It demonstrates that the
   polarized nature of the literature about this technological development
   is far from unprecedented, and in fact can be traced through the theory
   of a number of varied fields: the debate surrounding mechanization and
   digital technologies, our understanding of the role of the sublime in
   modern representations of technology, the similarities between the
   sociology of city life and digital information overload, and the way in
   which innovations are diffused throughout society. It proposes that
   these theories explain why debates around technological innovation often
   become so hyperbolic, creating an almost mythological view of
   technological determination. It concludes that, as a result of the
   processes outlined in this theory, mass digitization has become stuck
   between two conflicting rhetorical movements, and that it is therefore
   necessary to begin working to increase our understanding of this
   technology and to move the debate onwards using evidence from the real
   world.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need in the humanities for a 3D WebGIS with analytical tools
   that allow researchers to analyze 3D models linked to spatially
   referenced data. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow for complex
   spatial analysis of 2.5D data. For example, they offer bird's eye views
   of landscapes with extruded building footprints, but one cannot ` get on
   the ground' and interact with true 3D models from a pedestrian
   perspective. Meanwhile, 3D models and virtual environments visualize
   data in 3D space, but analytical tools are simple rotation or lighting
   effects. The MayaArch3D Project is developing a 3D WebGIS-called
   QueryArch3D-to allow these two distinct approaches to ` talk to each
   other' for studies of architecture and landscapes-in this case, the
   eighth-century Maya kingdom of Copan, Honduras. With this tool,
   researchers can search and query, in real time via a virtual reality
   (VR) environment, segmented 3D models of multiple resolutions (as well
   as computer-assisted design and realitybased) that are linked to
   attribute data stored in a spatial database. Beta tests indicate that
   this tool can assist researchers in expanding questions and developing
   new analytical methods in humanities research. This article summarizes
   the results of a pilot project that started in 2009, with an art
   historian and an archaeologist's collaborative research on the ancient
   Maya kingdom and UNESCO World Heritage site of Copan in Honduras-called
   MayaArch3D. The project researches innovative approaches to integrate
   GIS, 3D digital models, and VR environments online for teaching and
   research on ancient architecture and landscapes. It has grown into an
   international, interdisciplinary project that brings together art
   historians, archaeologists, and cultural resource managers with experts
   in remote sensing, photogrammetry, 3D modeling, and VR. The Start Up
   Phase was funded by two National Endowment for the Humanities, Digital
   Humanities Start-Up grants to the University of New Mexico (PI: Jennifer

   by means of controlling bars or by boron dilution in the water from the

Title = {{Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Safety Event Reporting: PROSPER
   Consortium Guidance}},
Journal = {{DRUG SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{The Patient-Reported Outcomes Safety Event Reporting (PROSPER)
   Consortium was convened to improve safety reporting by better
   incorporating the perspective of the patient. PROSPER comprises
   industry, regulatory authority, academic, private sector and patient
   representatives who are interested in the area of patient-reported
   outcomes of adverse events (PRO-AEs). It has developed guidance on
   PRO-AE data, including the benefits of wider use and approaches for data
   capture and analysis. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) encompass the
   full range of self-reporting, rather than only patient reports collected
   by clinicians using validated instruments. In recent years, PROs have
   become increasingly important across the spectrum of healthcare and life
   sciences. Patient-centred models of care are integrating shared decision
   making and PROs at the point of care; comparative effectiveness research
   seeks to include patients as participatory stakeholders; and industry is
   expanding its involvement with patients and patient groups as part of
   the drug development process and safety monitoring. Additionally, recent
   pharmacovigilance legislation from regulatory authorities in the EU and
   the USA calls for the inclusion of patient-reported information in
   benefit-risk assessment of pharmaceutical products. For patients,
   technological advancements have made it easier to be an active
   participant in one's healthcare. Simplified internet search
   capabilities, electronic and personal health records, digital mobile
   devices, and PRO-enabled patient online communities are just a few
   examples of tools that allow patients to gain increased knowledge about
   conditions, symptoms, treatment options and side effects. Despite these
   changes and increased attention on the perceived value of PROs, their
   full potential has yet to be realised in pharmacovigilance. Current
   safety reporting and risk assessment processes remain heavily dependent
   on healthcare professionals, though there are known limitations such as
   under-reporting and discordant perspectives between patient reports and
   clinician perceptions of adverse outcomes. PROSPER seeks to support the
   wider use of PRO-AEs. The scope of this guidance document, which was
   completed between July 2011 and March 2013, considered a host of domains
   related to PRO-AEs, including definitions and suitable taxonomies, the
   range of datasets that could be used, data collection mechanisms, and
   suitable analytical methodologies. PROSPER offers an innovative
   framework to differentiate patient populations. This framework considers
   populations that are prespecified (such as those in clinical trials,
   prospective observational studies and some registries) and
   non-prespecified populations (such as those in claims databases,
   PRO-enabled online patient networks, and social websites in general).
   While the main focus of this guidance is on post-approval PRO-AEs from
   both prespecified and non-prespecified population groups, PROSPER has
   also considered pre-approval, prespecified populations. The ultimate aim
   of this guidance is to ensure that the patient `voice' and perspective
   feed appropriately into collection of safety data. The guidance also
   covers a minimum core dataset for use by industry or regulators to
   structure PRO-AEs (accessible in the online appendix) and how data, once
   collected, might be evaluated to better inform on the safe and effective
   use of medicinal products. Structured collection of such patient data
   can be considered both a means to an end (improving patient safety) as
   well as an end in itself (expressing the patient viewpoint).
   The members of the PROSPER Consortium therefore direct this PRO-AE
   guidance to multiple stakeholders in drug safety, including industry,
   regulators, prescribers and patients. The use of this document across
   the entirety of the drug development life cycle will help to better
   define the benefit-risk profile of new and existing medicines. Because
   of the clinical relevance of `real-world' data, PROs have the potential
   to contribute important new knowledge about the benefits and risks of
   medicinal products, communicated through the voice of the patient.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology
   aimed at empowering people's capabilities by means of digital
   environments that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human
   needs, habits, gestures, and emotions. This futuristic vision of daily
   environment will enable innovative human-machine interactions
   characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive, and anticipatory
   communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make AmI
   technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life
   solutions, including in the healthcare domain. This survey will discuss
   the emergence of AmI techniques in the healthcare domain, in order to
   provide the research community with the necessary background. We will
   examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the
   vision of AmI, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices.
   We will summarize the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI)
   methodologies used for developing AmI system in the healthcare domain,
   including various learning techniques (for learning from user
   interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and
   intensions), and planning techniques (for planning activities and
   interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology might support
   people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or chronic
   disease. Finally, we will point to some of the successful case studies
   in the area and we will look at the current and future challenges to
   draw upon the possible future research paths.}},

Abstract = {{Human adults' numerical representation is spatially oriented;
   consequently, participants are faster to respond to small/large numerals
   with their left/right hand, respectively, when doing a binary
   classification judgment on numbers, known as the SNARC
   (spatial-numerical association of response codes) effect. Studies on the
   emergence and development of the SNARC effect remain scarce. The current
   study introduces an innovative new paradigm based on a simple color
   judgment of Arabic digits. Using this task, we found a SNARC effect in
   children as young as 5.5 years. In contrast, when preschool children
   needed to perform a magnitude judgment task necessitating exact number
   knowledge, the SNARC effect started to emerge only at 5.8 years.
   Moreover, the emergence of a magnitude SNARC but not a color SNARC was
   linked to proficiency with Arabic digits. Our results suggest that
   access to a spatially oriented approximate magnitude representation from
   symbolic digits emerges early in ontogenetic development. Exact
   magnitude judgments, on the other hand, rely on experience with Arabic
   digits and, thus, necessitate formal or informal schooling to give
   access to a spatially oriented numerical representation. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Spherical fuel elements technology is a main innovation of
   high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), which effectively improves
   the safety of the reactors for higher stability at high temperature, and
   their quality is crucial for the safety and reliability of HTDRs.
   According to a spherical fuel element's structure, the coated fuel
   particles are not permitted to enter the fuel-free zone and the elements
   with escaped fuel particles must be removed during the fuel elements'
   quality control. In this paper, we first introduce a DR imaging system
   for spherical fuel elements testing applied in Chinese 10 MW
   high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTR-10). Then the blind zone where
   escaped particles exist is analyzed under the continuous and concrete
   circular scanning trajectories and the cone-beam imaging geometrical
   configuration. The dominant scanning parameters determining the size of
   the blind zone are the rotation step angle and the distance from X-ray
   source to the tested object. An optimal method of designing the two
   parameters to decrease the size of the blind zone is proposed so as to
   satisfy the testing requirements. Finally, the optimal method is
   verified by computer simulation and some practical identification
   results are presented. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to analyze the extent to which social
   representations associated with three guitars that characterize rock
   history still influence musicians' perceptions. A text analysis of
   opinion forums is conducted. The conceptual framework is built upon
   institutional theory that is increasingly mobilized in order to
   conceptualize firms' strategies as well as consumption phenomena. More
   specifically, the concepts of myths and norms are central to the
   analysis. A netnography analysis shows that significant mythic guitar
   models shape the norms that guide musicians' opinions and perceptions.
   From a managerial standpoint, this implies that guitar-making cannot
   deviate sharply from these norms. Innovation should conform to
   significant myths that is, conform to tradition.}},

Abstract = {{This article draws on the theory of disruption to analyze the impact of
   digital technology on the recorded music industry and to explain the
   delay of dominant firms in reacting to this technological discontinuity.
   The author shows that digitization matches the characteristics of
   disruptive innovation as described in the literature. He explains why
   established firms initially paid little heed to an innovation leading to
   a product (digital music files) that is cheaper and poorer in quality
   than their existing product (CDs) and ill-suited to mainstream
   consumers. The reaction of these firms has been typical of the behaviour
   of companies facing disruptive innovation. Confronted with an innovation
   that they see as more of a threat than an opportunity, incumbent firms
   have found it extremely difficult to accept the need for a radical
   rethinking of their business model.}},

Abstract = {{The digital revolution has led the makers of videogames and animation
   movies to cooperate on both economic and artistic levels to pool their
   knowledge and skills and offer new products and services. This
   phenomenon has led in turn to the emergence of a cross-industry segment,
   which raises strategic questions for innovation. Convergence offers a
   fertile ground for innovation projects but also requires project
   managers to rethink their strategies and the organization of their
   innovation processes. The author uses primary and secondary data
   pertaining to three French innovation projects to explore how changes
   wrought by industry convergence influence the strategic organization of
   innovation. Empirical analyses reveal that certain types of change
   influence strategic organizations and that when traditional models fail,
   project managers find new ways to innovate.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-increasing uses for social media and mobile technologies are
   bringing new opportunities for innovation and participation across
   societies, while challenging and disrupting the status quo.
   Characteristics of the digital age include the proliferation of
   user-driven innovation and the blurring of boundaries and roles, whether
   between the producers and users of news and other products or services,
   or between sectors. The @IndigenousX Twitter account, which has a
   different Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person tweeting each
   week, is an example of user-driven innovation and of how Indigenous
   voices are emerging strongly in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.
   Its founder, Luke Pearson, a teacher and Aboriginal education
   consultant, wanted to share the platform he had established on Twitter
   for storytelling to an engaged audience. The account can thus be seen as
   a form of citizen, participatory, community or alternative journalism.
   This article provides a preliminary analysis of @IndigenousX, and
   suggests that this account and the diversity of Indigenous voices in the
   digital environment offer opportunities for wide-ranging research
   endeavours. Initiatives like @IndigenousX are also a reminder that
   journalism has much to learn from innovation outside the conventional
   realm of journalistic practice.}},

Abstract = {{Digitally enabled social networks, encompassing social media
   applications such as wikis, blogs and social networking sites, have the
   potential to dramatically change organizational culture by building
   communities, promoting information sharing and fostering collaboration.
   Although organizational social media site (hereinafter SMS)
   implementations are proliferating, these technologies often do not
   harmoniously combine with traditional organizational cultures. To shed
   light on social media's impact on organizational life, this paper draws
   on an interpretive case study to investigate a global security company's
   efforts to implement a digitally enabled social network as part of a
   cultural change effort. Conceptually, based on the theory of IT-culture
   conflict, this paper underscores the interplay between organizational
   culture and technology. Our study finds that conflicts can arise between
   employees' workplace values and the values they ascribe to social media.
   This can result in an IT-culture system conflict, which organizations
   can address using policy-based, socialization-based and leadership-based
   mechanisms aimed at bringing cultural values and social media site
   values into alignment.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a newly developed innovative triaxial testing system to
   investigate strength, deformation behavior, and/or permeability of gas
   hydrate bearing-sediments in deep sea is described. Transport of the
   pressure core from the storage chamber to the interior of the sealing
   sleeve of a triaxial cell without depressurization was achieved. An
   image processing technique was used to capture the motion and local
   deformation of a specimen in a transparent acrylic triaxial pressure
   cell and digital photographs were obtained at each strain level during
   the compression test. The material strength was successfully measured
   and the failure mode was evaluated under high confining and pore water
   pressures. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The ubiquitous media landscape today is reshaping what it means to be an
   engaged citizen. Normative metrics for engagementvoting, attending town
   meetings, participation in civic groupsare eroding in the context of
   online advocacy, social protest, liking, sharing, and remixing. These
   new avenues for engagement offer vast opportunities for new and
   innovative approaches to teaching and learning about political
   engagement in the context of new media platforms and technologies. This
   article explores digital media literacy as a core competency for engaged
   citizenship in participatory democracy. It combines new models of
   engaged and citizenship and participatory politics with frameworks for
   digital and media literacy education, to develop a framework for media
   literacy as a core political competency for active, engaged, and
   participatory citizenship.}},

Abstract = {{We study whether a government-sponsored voluntary pollution reduction
   program (VPR) promotes or deters the development of new environmental
   technologies that yield future emission reduction benefits. Using a
   panel of 127 U.S. manufacturing industries defined by 3-digit SIC
   classifications over the 1989-2004 period, we estimate impacts of
   industry-level participation in the 33/50 program, a VPR initiated by
   government regulators in 1991, on industry-level rates of environmental
   patenting. We find that higher rates of 33/50 program participation are
   associated with significant reductions in the number of successful
   environmental patent applications five to nine years after the program
   ended. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging system
   based on compressive sampling scheme and l1 minimization. The
   compressive sampling scheme comprises of randomization and integration
   of radar echoes which slows down the analog-to-digital converters (ADC)
   rate significantly without analiasing in image formation. Numerical
   experiments indicate that the resolution of SAR images retrieved by our
   method outperform that obtained by conventional methods. The results
   also reveal that the new SAR imaging system can still retrieve
   non-ambiguous images even when the data rate is 1/10 of the original
   one. Finally, we applied the new method on raw data of RADARSAT-1 to
   testify its practicability.}},

Abstract = {{Digital audio watermarking is one of the many technologies that evolved
   in response to the recent fast expansion in the area of digital
   information transmission and multimedia. In fact, the possibility to
   robustly hide information in an audio signal has many applications, such
   as protection of intellectual property, broadcast monitoring, and
   metadata transmission. This article presents an innovative method for
   watermark embedding in the time-frequency domain using a sparse
   multicarrier approach. The proposed system involves a watermarked audio
   signal that is played back by a loudspeaker and picked up by a
   microphone mounted on a mobile device. The system is built to be used in
   an enclosed environment such as a room and is therefore designed to be
   robust against various impairments such as reverberation, microphone
   self-noise, and movement. The system robustness is confirmed by
   performance evaluations, whereas its inaudibility is verified by
   subjective listening tests.}},

   are designed with the help of a parametric CAD software, CATIA V5, using
   a top-down modeling approach; kinematic simulations of the remote
   handling system are performed using Digital Mock-Up (DMU) capabilities
   of the software. The evaluation of the concepts is carried out involving

Abstract = {{This paper decomposes the extensive and intensive margins of the 16
   Korean regions' exports over the sample period from 2000 to 2010, using
   regional export data dis-aggregated at the HS 10-digit level. We find
   that there is a large disparity in the extensive and intensive margins
   among Korean regions. Consistent with international trade theories, the
   size of a region's economy (GDP, income, and population) has a
   significant and appropriately signed effect on the extensive and
   intensive margins. However, the effects work dominantly through the
   intensive margin rather than the extensive margin. We also find that
   regional innovation activity only has a positive effect on the extensive
   margin, and regional infrastructure variables are found to have a strong
   effect on the two margins. This paper contributes to the literature
   regarding the extensive and intensive margins of a country's regional
   trade.}},

Abstract = {{To conserve species, we must first identify them. Field researchers,
   land managers, educators, and citizen scientists need up-to-date and
   accessible tools to identify organisms, organize data, and share
   observations. Emerging technologies complement traditional, book-form
   field guides by providing users with a wealth of multimedia data. We
   review technical innovations of next-generation field guides, including
   Web-based and stand-alone applications, interactive multiple-access
   keys, visual-recognition software adapted to identify organisms, species
   checklists that can be customized to particular sites, online
   communities in which people share species observations, and the use of
   crowdsourced data to refine machine-based identification algorithms.
   Next-generation field guides are user friendly; permit quality control
   and the revision of data; are scalable to accommodate burgeoning data;
   protect content and privacy while allowing broad public access; and are
   adaptable to ever-changing platforms and browsers. These tools have
   great potential to engage new audiences while fostering rigorous science
   and an appreciation for nature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new technique to reduce the noise in a reconstructed
   hologram image is proposed. Unlike all the techniques in the literature,
   the proposed approach not only takes into account spatial information
   but also temporal statistics associated with the pixels. This innovative
   solution enables, at first, the automatic detection of the areas of the
   image containing the objects (foreground). This way, all the pixels not
   belonging to any objects are directly cleaned up and the contrast
   between objects and background is consistently increased. The remaining
   pixels are then processed with a spatio-temporal filtering which cancels
   out the effects of speckle noise, while preserving the structural
   details of the objects. The proposed approach has been compared with
   other common speckle denoising techniques and it is found to give better
   both visual and quantitative results.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents a novel fast algorithm derivation and structure
   design of analysis and synthesis quadrature mirror filterbanks (SQMFs)
   on the spectral band replication in Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM). After
   the preprocedure and post-procedure, a Fourier-transform-based
   computational kernel was required to construct two types of fast
   algorithms that offered certain advantages. The Proposed-I method
   employs a modified split-radix fast Fourier transform (FFT) for analysis
   quadrature mirror filterbank (AQMF) to reduce the number of additions at
   the last stage of the butterfly and adopts a split-radix FFT to
   calculate the SQMF coefficients. The Proposed-II method used the compact
   structure of the variable-length recursive DFT to realize the kernel
   procedure for the proposed fast AQMF and SQMF algorithms. In addition, a
   well-known lifting scheme was applied to reduce numerous multiplication
   and addition calculations. Compared with the original calculations for
   the long transform length, all multiplication, addition, and coefficient
   operations for the Proposed-I method (i.e., AQMF + SQMF) had 91.65\%,
   79.81\%, and 97.22\% reductions, respectively. However, for the
   Proposed-II method, the total reductions of multiplication, addition,
   and coefficient operations were 64.16\%, 21.53\%, and 97.12\%,
   respectively. Compared with the fast SQMF algorithm by Huang et al., the
   Proposed-I method for SQMF reduces 58.33\% of the multiplication, 65\%
   of the addition, and 67.19\% of the coefficients. Therefore, the
   proposed fast quadrature mirror filterbank algorithm is a better
   solution than other approaches for future DRM applications.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerating trends in the dynamic digital era (from 2004 onward) has
   resulted in the emergence of novel parametric imaging tools that allow
   easy and accurate extraction of quantitative information from cardiac
   images. This review principally attempts to heighten the awareness of
   newer emerging paradigms that may advance acquisition, visualization and
   interpretation of the large functional data sets obtained during cardiac
   ultrasound imaging. Incorporation of innovative cognitive software that
   allow advanced pattern recognition and disease forecasting will likely
   transform the human-machine interface and interpretation process to
   achieve a more efficient and effective work environment. Novel
   technologies for automation and big data analytics that are already
   active in other fields need to be rapidly adapted to the health care
   environment with new academic-industry collaborations to enrich and
   accelerate the delivery of newer decision making tools for enhancing
   patient care. (C) 2013 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation}},

Abstract = {{People with ID have an increased risk for unhealthy diets, physical
   inactivity and weight disturbances. The aim of the current study was to
   investigate the effectiveness of a novel and complex intervention to
   improve diet and physical activity, targeting both caregivers and
   residents, in community residences for people with ID. A three component
   intervention based on Social Cognitive Theory was developed, including:
   (1) appointment of a health ambassador in each community residence
   attending network meetings, (2) a study circle for caregivers, and (3) a
   health course for the residents. The intervention lasted for 12-16
   months and allowed for some local tailoring. A cluster randomised
   controlled trial, randomised at residence level, was conducted to
   evaluate the effects of the intervention. Thirty community residences
   for people with mild or moderate ID in Stockholm County, Sweden, were
   included. A total of 130 participants, 74 women and 56 men aged 20-66
   years, entered, and 129 participants completed the study. The primary
   outcome was physical activity, measured by pedometry. Secondary outcomes
   were BMI, waist circumference, dietary quality measured by digital
   photography, satisfaction with life assessed with a scale, and work
   routines assessed with a questionnaire. Outcomes were related to
   intervention fidelity. A positive intervention effect was found on
   physical activity, with an average increase of 1608 steps/day among
   participants in the intervention group (P = 0.045). The effect size was
   0.29 (Cohen's d). The type of residence was found to be an effect
   moderator. A positive intervention effect was found as well on work
   routines, with an average increase of 7.1 percentage points on a
   self-assessment scale among residences in the intervention group (P =
   0.016). No significant effects were found on BMI, waist circumference,
   dietary quality, or satisfaction with life. In conclusion, this
   innovative intervention was effective in improving physical activity and
   work routines. It is likely that even greater effects could be achieved
   by improvements in implementation strategies, leading to higher
   fidelity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The authors describe an emerging paradigm of educational research that
   pairs theories of embodied learning with a class of immersive
   technologies referred to as mixed reality (MR). MR environments merge
   the digital with the physical, where, for example, students can use
   their bodies to simulate an orbit around a virtual planet. Recent
   research supports the idea that body activity can be an important
   catalyst for generating learning, and new technologies are being
   developed that use natural human physicality and gesture as input.
   However, existing research on embodied learning technologies has been
   disparate, driven largely by specific technical innovations and
   constraints, and often lacking a clear focus on establishing their
   efficacy in educational contexts. On the basis of the unique
   characteristics of these technologies and on their own experiences
   conducting research in this area, the authors put forth six precepts for
   embodied learning technology researchers that pertain to the rationale,
   design, and execution of empirical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We hypothesized that fluoroscopic imaging creates radiation
   fields that are unevenly scattered throughout the endovascular suite. We
   sought to quantify the radiation dose spectrum at various locations
   during imaging procedures and to represent this in a clinically useful
   manner.
   Methods: Digital subtraction imaging (Innova 4100; GE Healthcare,
   Waukesha, Wisc) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on a cadaver in
   anteroposterior, left lateral, and right anterior oblique 45 degrees
   projections. Radiation exposure was monitored in real time with
   DoseAware dosimeters (Phillips, Houston, Tex) in eight radial
   projections at distances of 2, 4, and 6 ft from the center of the imaged
   field, each at 5-ft heights from the floor. Three to five consecutive
   data points were collected for each location.
   Results: At most positions around the angiographic table, radiation
   exposure decreased as the distance from the source emitter increased;
   however, the intensity of the exposure varied dramatically around the
   axis of imaging. With anteroposterior imaging, the radiation fields have
   symmetric dumbbell shapes, with maximal exposure perpendicular to the
   table at the level of the gantry. Peak levels at 4 and 6 ft from the
   source emitter were 2.4 times and 3.4 times higher, respectively, than
   predicted based on the inverse square law. Maximal radiation exposure
   was measured in the typical operator position 2 ft away and
   perpendicular to the table (4.99 mSv/h). When the gantry was rotated 45
   degrees and 90 degrees, the radiation fields shifted, becoming more
   asymmetric, with increasing radiation doses to 10.9 and 69 mSv/h,
   respectively, on the side of the emitter. Minimal exposure is
   experienced along the axis of the table, decreasing with distance from
   the source (<0.77 mSv/h).
   Conclusions: Quantifiable and reproducible radiation scatter is created
   during interventional procedures. Radiation doses vary widely around the
   perimeter of the angiography table and change according to imaging
   angles. These data are easily visualized using contour plots and scatter
   three-dimensional mesh plots. Rather than the concentric circles
   predicted by the inverse square law, these data more closely resemble a
   ``scatter cloud.{''} Knowledge of the actual exposure levels within the
   endovascular environment may help in mitigating these risks to health
   care providers.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the enormous developments in digital design and fabrication
   methods our thinking in the construction industry is still dominated by
   the standard of industrial production. The profiles and
   semi-manufactured parts made from steel and wood as well as the on the
   market available formwork systems for concrete structures imply the
   simplest possible geometry and addition. Consequently, today's
   load-bearing structures are usually composed of bending stress
   mass-intensive components. Lightweight form-active structures such as
   built in 1972 Lufthansa Maintenance Hall V at Frankfurt airport,
   however, are hard to find. In the future, the efficient use of materials
   and energy will have a crucial importance for the implementation of
   sustainable construction. Instead of avoiding complexity at the cost of
   increased masses, the goal for the future will be to save mass by using
   structural efficiency. The opportunity for this lies in the combination
   of the latest developments in material technology with the digital
   planning and production. The aim for high-tech materials such as ultra
   high performance fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) must be to develop
   material appropriate non-standard joint principles that are produced
   economically despite increased complexity. This is where the present
   contribution starts showing the current research results for innovative
   principles for joining lightweight members from UHPFRC.}},

Abstract = {{Burn wound photography has diverse clinical applications; however,
   inherent technological limitations mitigate its utility. Limitations
   include lack of quality control, serial imaging, complexity, and
   expense. With the performance gap between smart devices and digital
   cameras rapidly narrowing, and computing performance increasing, smart
   devices are poised to uniquely address these limitations and enhance the
   field of wound photography. To this end, we developed a proof-of-concept
   smart device application addressing the limitations of traditional
   photography and meeting the needs of burn clinicians. The result was an
   innovative smart device application providing user-friendly serial
   imaging and informatics capabilities at the patient bedside. The
   application generated images with significantly higher brightness (2.4
   +/- 1.07 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.69, n = 15, p < 0.05) and higher contrast (255
   +/- 0.00 vs. 236.3 +/- 5.64, n = 15, p < 0.0001), more consistent
   positioning (1.22 +/- 0.03 vs. 2.08 +/- 0.61, n = 15, p < 0.0001) and
   zoom (18.14 vs. 14.29, n = 15, p < 0.0001) compared to those taken by a
   basic compact digital-camera using default settings. Surveyed clinician
   end-users reported greater functionality (20 vs. 0, n = 20, p < 0.001),
   and a more intuitive interface (18 vs. 2, n = 20, p < 0.001) with the
   application. We report consistent serial wound imaging and informatics
   are both feasible on a smart device platform. These findings will pave
   the way for new smart device-based clinical applications. (C) 2013

   optical disc formats: Blu-ray and HD-DVD. The companies supporting these
   formats competed for dominance in the marketplace. HD-DVD was first to
   enter the market and had cheaper products, but did not win due to
   strategic manoeuvring of the Blu-ray supporters. Different from previous
   format wars, consumers did not determine the outcome. The competition
   was decided by tipping company support throughout the supply chain and
   using the technology adoption characteristics of the video game console

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative consumption-modeling system applied to
   digital TV, able to infer the user interest regarding the TV contents.
   The user interest inferred is used to feed content recommender systems,
   and it has been tested in real scenarios involving real users. The
   modeling system uses as input the TV consumption data and performs an
   algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model and Bayesian inference
   techniques to infer the said user interest. Real data have been picked
   up in real time to feed our modeling, and the final results have been
   checked comparing with user's tastes, which have been expressed through
   a set of questionnaires and the whole system has been tested in a TV
   broadcasting scenario with real users. Conclusions show that our system
   improves the reliability from classic user interest modeling systems
   (they are mainly based on explicit opinion based methods, which can be
   intrusive for general users and could show certain deceptive results, as
   it is described in this paper).}},

Abstract = {{In a study conducted in 2011, the use of full body digital X-ray images
   (Lodox((R)) Statscan((R))) and drawings were described for surface
   anatomy education during which suggestions were made by students on how
   to improve the method. Educational innovations should continuously be
   adjusted and improved to provide the best possible scenario for student
   learning. This study, therefore, reports on the efficacy of implementing
   some of these suggestions. Suggestions incorporated into the follow-up
   study included: (1) The inclusion of eight strategically placed labeled
   digital X-ray images to the dissection halls, (2) The placement of both
   labeled and unlabeled digital X-ray images online, (3) The inclusion of
   informal oral questions on surface anatomy during dissection, (4) The
   requirement of students to submit individual drawings in addition to
   group drawings into their portfolios, and (5) Integrating information on
   how to recognize anatomical structures on X-rays into gross anatomy
   lectures given prior to dissection. Students were requested to complete
   an anonymous questionnaire. The results of the drawings, tests and
   questionnaires were compared to the results from the 2011 cohort. During
   2012, an increased usage of the digital X-rays and an increase in
   practical test marks in three out of the four modules (statistically
   significant only in the cardiovascular module) were reported. More
   students from the 2012 cohort believed the images enhanced their
   experience of learning surface anatomy and that its use should be
   continued in future. The suggested changes, therefore, had a positive
   effect on surface anatomy education. Anat Sci Educ 6: 433-439. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Adaptive radiations in mammals are sometimes associated with the
   emergence of key dental innovations facilitating food processing and
   masticatory movements. The dietary aspects of such innovations
   constitute an important focus in evolutionary biology. Murine rodents,
   which originated during middle Miocene, currently constitute the largest
   extant mammalian subfamily. Their adaptive radiation combines an
   original chewing motion with a peculiar occlusal pattern. The fossil
   record clearly establishes the timing of acquisitions of those
   innovations, and the aim of our study was to estimate the dietary
   changes associated with each of them. Fossil taxa phylogenetically
   closest to Murinae were investigated through the use of geographic
   information system applied on maps obtained from first upper molars
   digitized by X-ray synchrotron microtomography. This methodology enables
   estimation of quantitative topographic descriptors of the dietary
   specializations of the molar crown. The peculiar forwardly directed
   chewing motion acquired by stem Murinae may have been a key innovation
   allowing the invasion of an insectivorous dietary niche. The further
   radiation of crown Murinae coincides with the return to the
   plant-dominated omnivorous dietary niche of their distant ancestors
   through the acquisition of new morphological traits. The retention of
   the forwardly directed chewing motion by the crown Murinae could have
   become a competitive advantage in the context of a more generalist diet.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript introduces a multidimensional framework for academic
   literacies to help instructors become more aware of different aspects of
   literacies and how they might be used to plan and orchestrate
   meaningful, multifaceted literacy experiences in their classes. More
   specifically, this broad framework for literacy and learning explicitly
   considers the overlapping role of argumentation, digital inquiry,
   collaboration, and innovation as they are applied to continuously
   evolving disciplinary literacy practices. The framework is applied to a
   course designed for pre-service teachers that integrated several aspects
   of academic literacies and offered some pedagogical guidelines to
   support their literacy development. A summary of the different domains
   of academic literacies and research-based pedagogical guidelines is
   provided to assist teachers in various disciplines and educational
   levels in applying the framework in their own instructional contexts.

Abstract = {{BackgroundRecent innovations in gastrointestinal endoscopy have changed
   our traditional approach to diagnosis and therapy in patients with
   inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). While traditionally used dye-based
   chromoendoscopy (DBC) techniques suffer from several limitations that
   reduce their utility in daily routine practice, newer dye-less'
   chromoendoscopy (DLC) techniques offer a great potential to overcome
   most of these limitations.
   AimTo review available optical and digital chromoendoscopy techniques,
   by critically discussing their potential for diagnostic and surveillance
   colonoscopy in patients with IBD.
   MethodsA literature search on the use of dye-less and dye-based
   chromoendoscopy in IBD patients was performed.
   ResultsIn long-standing IBD, DBC improves detection of dysplasia
   (diagnostic odds ratio=17.5, 95\% CI=1.2-247.1) as well as prediction of
   inflammatory disease activity and extent of disease compared with
   standard video-colonoscopy. Narrow band imaging (NBI) shows no
   improvement in dysplasia detection rates compared with white-light
   endoscopy and DBC (P=0.6). Moreover, NBI results in a suboptimal
   differentiation of dysplastic from nondysplastic lesions. No data
   regarding digital DLC techniques (i.e. FICE, i-scan) for dysplasia
   detection in IBD are yet available. Both NBI and i-scan are superior to
   white-light endoscopy in assessing the activity and extent of colorectal
   IBD.
   ConclusionsAlthough the potential benefits of newer optical and digital
   dye-less chromoendoscopy techniques over traditionally used DBC are
   substantial, only DBC can currently be recommended to improve dysplasia
   detection in long-standing IBD. In contrast, DLC has the potential to
   quantify disease activity and mucosal healing in IBD.}},

Abstract = {{Governments around the globe are striving to provide e-government,
   online products and services to all the citizens of their respective
   countries. This has meant that there is a shift in the conventional mode
   of public service delivery from a face-to-face and telephone mode to
   electronic means. However, not all the citizens are making use of these
   changes, and the one demographic group that is currently attracting
   immense interest related to their welfare, health and other such issues
   is the older age group. Using this as a reason, the aim of this
   exploratory and explanatory research was to understand the e-government
   initiatives in the UK, more specifically in London. To conduct this
   research, a mixed qualitative and quantitative research approach was
   pursued. It was concluded that the benefits of the Internet to many of
   the users is relative, depending on the age, perceptions and level of
   innovativeness of the user. It was learnt that in relation to quality,
   the local authority websites do contain useful and relevant information
   for the elderly. However, this information is difficult to access,
   mainly due to the lack of knowledge, skills in the use of computers or
   Internet. From this research, it is expected that a contribution to
   academia will emerge in the form of a better understanding of issues
   related to e-government, the digital divide and older citizens. For
   industry, the contributions of this research are the identification and
   understanding of issues related to online products and services and the
   older citizen. For policy-makers, this research proffers an
   understanding of issues related with demand and supply of online
   products and services that governments are currently providing.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about a digital divide persist and recent calls have been made
   for understanding how lifestyles influence Internet adoption and use.
   Online criminal behaviors have drawn attention from law enforcement, but
   diffusion of innovation theory suggests higher propensities for crime,
   particularly street crime, reduces the likelihood of Internet use.
   Drawing from this theory and research on the role of street criminal
   lifestyles on technology adoption, this study examined patterns of
   Internet use among a sample of 585 individuals at-risk for and involved
   in street crime. Results from our logistic and negative binomial
   regression analyses lead to two general conclusions: (1) compared to
   research on the general population, similar predictors and lower rates
   of Internet participation and usage are observed, and (2) mixed evidence
   suggests participation in criminal lifestyles contributes to digital
   inequality. The results support a theory of technological diffusion to
   marginalized populations. We conclude by discussing the expansion of
   technology, digital inequality, and crime. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Web disclosure is a significant-technological innovation aimed at
   improving organizational transparency. Organizations that voluntarily
   disclose high quality financial and performance information on their
   public websites are viewed as being more open, trustworthy, and
   accountable by the general public. Despite the positive benefit of
   enhanced public trust, many organizations have not implemented the
   recommended web disclosure principles and best practices. Informed by
   the theoretical underpinnings of organizational ecology theory, this
   study develops a theoretical model in order to examine the problem of
   differential implementation of web disclosure in nonprofit settings.
   Empirical evidence reveals that the majority of nonprofit websites lack
   high quality financial and performance information which reflects an
   opaque digital informative strategy. Our results further suggest that
   organizational inertia - particularly resistance to change in
   organizational form - may play an important role in the decision to
   voluntarily adopt and implement innovative web disclosure practices. The
   findings have implications for research and information systems design.

Abstract = {{Internet-based campaigning is regularly questioned or disqualified as
   clicktivism' on the premises that the internet facilitates low input
   action. This article focuses on the distributed campaign of an ad hoc
   coalition of digital rights activists intervening in the European
   Union's Telecoms package Reform from 2007 to 2009. It examines how
   technically skilled actors take advantage of networked collaboration and
   information production, as they discover, learn about and challenge
   European policy-making. Activists question the status quo and advance
   alternatives and models built on innovative distribution systems of
   knowledge goods, such as free software and open access initiatives. The
   analysis is based on empirical evidence collected through in-depth
   interviews with activists and political representatives, document
   analysis and observations. The campaign's effectiveness is then assessed
   through policy-makers perception in the analysis of three interrelated
   questions: (a) Did the campaign generate awareness among
   representatives? (b) Were protest actors perceived as credible and
   legitimate interlocutors? (c) Did the campaign trigger concrete
   political or legal changes? The evaluation of the campaign's
   effectiveness allows for nuanced conclusions as to the concrete impact
   of internet-based campaigning targeting EU institutions. The analysis
   shows that resource-poor actors can use the internet to substantially
   affect policy-making by intervening in the course of parliamentary
   law-making. This article provides an analytical framework to study these
   processes, and carry out a detailed confrontation between oppositional
   strategies and actual legislative and political outputs. The campaign
   was praised as very successful by all interviewees, especially in
   gaining awareness for the issues at stake. However, achieving concrete
   policy changes remains challenging notably due to the EU's particular
   conception of civil society input.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces some of the problems confronting the
   popularization of national, civic and cultural heritage in the era of
   complex digital systems and social networks. Taking contemporary
   knowledge of John Curtin (Australia's wartime PM) as its point of
   departure, the discussion explores some of the broader transformations
   of the conditions of citizenship, communication, heritage and knowledge
   production, and considers their implications for civic education and the
   uses of archives. In a novel thought experiment, the article explores
   some ways in which the figure of John Curtin' may be repurposed and
   reinvented for a new kind of DIY civic education based on user-led

Abstract = {{This study examines the inputs (processes and strategies) and outputs
   (perceptions, skill development, classroom transfer, disciplinary
   integration, social networking, and community development) of a
   yearlong, interdisciplinary teacher learning and development experience.
   Eleven secondary math and science teachers partnered with an
   interdisciplinary team of university engineering mentors in a yearlong
   engineering education and project implementation program. It consisted
   of a 6-week on-site resident professional development and collaboration
   experience, with an ongoing support and follow-up including digital
   systems. Mixed-method, multisource data indicate that teachers engaged
   with motivations combining personal, intrinsic interest and classroom
   integration goals. They formed and sustained an active community of
   learning and practice that supported their success, on-site and through
   classroom integration, thereby promoting innovations. Teachers reported
   positive perceptions throughout the program and demonstrated
   significant, productive trajectories of change-over-time. Teachers
   learned and transferred task-specific engineering and scientific skills,
   as well as more general inquiry-based pedagogical strategies to their
   secondary classrooms.}},

Abstract = {{Archives are an extremely valuable part of our cultural heritage since
   they represent the trace of the activities of a physical or juridical
   person in the course of their business. Despite their importance, the
   models and technologies that have been developed over the past two
   decades in the Digital Library (DL) field have not been specifically
   tailored to archives. This is especially true when it comes to formal
   and foundational frameworks, as the Streams, Structures, Spaces,
   Scenarios, Societies (5S) model is.
   Therefore, we propose an innovative formal model, called NEsted SeTs for
   Object hieRarchies (NESTOR), for archives, explicitly built around the
   concepts of context and hierarchy which play a central role in the
   archival realm. NESTOR is composed of two set-based data models: the
   Nested Sets Model (NS-M) and the Inverse Nested Sets Model (INS-M) that
   express the hierarchical relationships between objects through the
   inclusion property between sets. We formally study the properties of
   these models and prove their equivalence with the notion of hierarchy
   entailed by archives.
   We then use NESTOR to extend the 5S model in order to take into account
   the specific features of archives and to tailor the notion of digital
   library accordingly. This offers the possibility of opening up the full
   wealth of DL methods and technologies to archives. We demonstrate the
   impact of NESTOR on this problem through three example use cases. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper shares outcomes from the evaluation of a community project
   where comedy activities were introduced into a day centre for older
   people with dementia as a result of a partnership between the day
   centre, a local university and a specialist comedy provider. Four
   workshops were provided using improvisatory activities and comedy, as a
   medium to engage older people in reflecting on aspects of their care
   environment. The main output resulted in a 30 minute `mockumentary' of
   the ` Her Majesty the Queen' visiting the day centre, in the form of a
   digital reusable learning object to be used by social work and mental
   health professionals. The evaluation demonstrated some additional
   outcomes for those involved and highlighted the benefits of laughter and
   fun in promoting a positive climate.}},

   multiple-level amputations, prolonged ischemia, and multiple trauma. The
   role of transpositional and ectopic replantation, as well as the
   requirement for secondary procedures in replantation is also discussed.
   Although technically challenging, microsurgical management of complex
   amputations ultimately results in far superior outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Food engineering (FE) was identified as a promising field in the
   mid-20th century. In the succeeding years, demand for food engineers in
   industry has continued unabated, but the field, in an academic sense,
   has not quite lived up to its potential. Yet, the coming challenges of
   the 21st century offer many opportunities for persons with FE training.
   This article is based on a plenary session held during the Conference of
   Food Engineering 2012, in Leesburg, Virginia, USA, and consists of a
   compilation of opinions of the authors. In order to develop further, FE
   needs to shed its historical mindset, and embrace a broader vision of
   its scope to include product, internal human and industrial processes,
   equipment, package and sensor/automation engineering. Training in FE
   could be vital to helping address issues such as water availability and
   quality, health and wellness, food safety, energy and sustainability. A
   number of 21st century developments will drive this change, including
   world population growth and aging; the digital universe, ``big data{''}
   and informatics; personalization, food, health and wellness; food
   security, environment, sustainability and social responsibility; and the
   innovation ecosystem (open innovation and partnerships). Food
   engineering education will also have to change to keep pace with the
   extraordinary expansion of knowledge, the availability of virtual tools,
   diminishing funding and laboratory resources, and the possibility of
   creating partnerships between industry and academia. Studying inner
   transport phenomena, utilization of new techniques, such as micro
   processing for modeling and simulation of the digestion system,
   bioavailability, satiety, DNA predisposition, and nutrigenomics offer
   unique opportunities. The case of FE in UK and Europe are addressed,
   where consortia involving different industries have been able to partner
   to focus on problems with a common scientific theme to leverage their
   efforts. Finally, the experience of one food company in hiring food
   engineers as well as chemical engineers is highlighted, together with
   their interview processes and criteria. While this represents a
   collection of the opinions of the individual authors, it is hoped that
   the discussion stimulates a more wide-ranging conversation about FE to
   enable it to develop further into the 21st century. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{China recently has emerged as a serious player in setting ICT standards,
   as evidenced by its presence in major conferences on standardization
   with the International Telecommunications Union. While the ATSC standard
   contributed to the successful completion of the DTV transition in the
   US, China's home-grown DTV standard bears little, to date, on its
   relative success in converting one third of its cable households to
   digital service. In light of these differing outcomes, this paper
   identifies and compares the strategies behind the quest for national DTV
   standards by retracing the key policy initiatives in China and the US.
   Our analysis suggests that protectionist impulses shaping distinct
   standards for the US (Grand Alliance), China, and other regions dampen
   prospects for a global standard in DTV. However, the US has been more
   successful at maintaining the kind of balance between industry and
   governmental policy that is critical to maintaining technological
   innovation and a competitive marketplace. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{To better understand the biology of extinct animals, experimentation
   with extant animals and innovative numerical approaches have grown in
   recent years. This research project uses principles of soil mechanics
   and a neoichnological field experiment with an African elephant to
   derive a novel concept for calculating the mass (i.e., the weight) of an
   animal from its footprints. We used the elephant's footprint geometry
   (i.e., vertical displacements, diameter) in combination with soil
   mechanical analyses (i.e., soil classification, soil parameter
   determination in the laboratory, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and gait
   analysis) for the back analysis of the elephant's weight from a single
   footprint. In doing so we validated the first component of a methodology
   for calculating the weight of extinct dinosaurs. The field experiment
   was conducted under known boundary conditions at the Zoological Gardens
   Wuppertal with a female African elephant. The weight of the elephant was
   measured and the walking area was prepared with sediment in advance.
   Then the elephant was walked across the test area, leaving a trackway
   behind. Footprint geometry was obtained by laser scanning. To estimate
   the dynamic component involved in footprint formation, the velocity the
   foot reaches when touching the subsoil was determined by the Digital
   Image Correlation (DIC) technique. Soil parameters were identified by
   performing experiments on the soil in the laboratory. FEA was then used

Abstract = {{Mobile `smart' phones have become almost ubiquitous in society and are
   typically equipped with a high-resolution digital camera which can be
   used to produce an image very conveniently. In this study, the built-in
   digital camera of a smart phone (iPhone) was used to capture the results
   from a rapid quantitative colorimetric test for trinitrotoluene (TNT) in
   soil. The results were compared to those from a digital single-lens
   reflex (DSLR) camera. The colored product from the selective test for
   TNT was quantified using an innovative application of photography where
   the relationships between the Red Green Blue (RGB) values and the
   concentrations of colorimetric product were exploited. The iPhone showed
   itself to be capable of being used more conveniently than the DSLR while
   providing similar analytical results with increased sensitivity. The
   wide linear range and low detection limits achieved were comparable with
   those from spectrophotometric quantification methods. Low relative
   errors in the range of 0.4 to 6.3\% were achieved in the analysis of
   control samples and 0.4-6.2\% for spiked soil extracts with good
   precision (2.09-7.43\% RSD) for the analysis over 4 days. The results
   demonstrate that the iPhone provides the potential to be used as an
   ideal novel platform for the development of a rapid on site semi
   quantitative field test for the analysis of explosives. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Recent discussions concerning the continuation of Moore's law have
   focused on announcements by several major corporations to transition
   from traditional 2D planar to new 3D multi-gate field effect transistor
   devices. However, the growth and progression of the semiconductor
   microelectronics industry over the previous 4 decades has been largely
   driven by combined advances in new materials, lithography, and materials
   related process technologies. Looking forward, it is therefore
   anticipated that new materials and materials technologies will continue
   to play a significant role in both the pursuit of Moore's law and the
   evolution of the industry. In this research update, we discuss and
   illustrate some of the required and anticipated materials innovations
   that could potentially lead to the continuation of Moore's law for
   another decade (or more). We focus primarily on the innovations needed
   to achieve single digit nanometer technologies and illustrate how at
   these dimensions not only new materials but new metrologies and
   computational modeling will be needed. (C) 2013 Author(s). All article

Abstract = {{Uneven light distribution problems often arise in poorly scanned text or
   text-photo images and natural images taken by digital camera. An
   innovative image-processing technique for uneven illumination removal
   using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is proposed. The EMD is local,
   adaptive, and useful for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary signals.
   In this method, we decompose images by EMD and get the background level
   locally and adaptively. This algorithm can enhance the local reflectance
   in the image while removing uneven illumination for black/white text
   images, text-photo images, and natural color/gray-level images. The
   proposed technique can be very helpful for image and text recognition.
   The EMD can also be applied to the three color channels (RGB) of color
   images separately to estimate the reflectances of the three color
   channels. After we relight these channels using white light and the
   estimated reflectances, a simple color constancy task can be performed
   to correct certain poorly lighted color images. Our technique is
   compared with recently proposed methods for correcting images with
   uneven illumination and the experimental results demonstrated that the
   proposed approach can effectively enhance natural color/gray-level
   images and make text and text-photo images more readable under uneven
   illumination. (C) 2013 SPIE and IS\&T}},

Abstract = {{Social media in government is becoming one of the major trends in
   Electronic Government (e-government) research and practice worldwide.
   During the last few years, several authors have addressed the potential
   of social media for the innovation of public sector organizations. Most
   of these contributions have focused on the technical dimensions of
   social media, while other aspects have not attracted equal attention. In
   contrast, this introductory article interrogates the role of social
   media in the basic areas of e-government: government information flows
   and the availability of government information; the use of information
   technology to create and provide innovative government services; the
   impact of information technology on the relationships between the
   governed and those governing; and the increasing importance of
   information policies and information technologies for democratic
   practices. Accordingly, the next few pages propose and develop three
   dimensions of social media in government: tools, goals, and topics. We
   think that these dimensions could help to better understand the use of
   social media in government settings. Then, after a brief review of
   current trends in social media and government research, we present the
   articles included in this special issue. Finally, we present some
   practical lessons and suggest ideas for future research. This special
   issue could be seen as a starting point for the development of
   innovation through social media in public administrations around the
   world. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Changing the relationship between citizens and government is often cited
   as a goal for digital government, and new tools such as social media
   have the potential to improve interactions with citizens through
   dialogue. Citizens are most likely to participate at the local level
   (Berry, Portney and Thomson, 1993; Oates, 1972; Oakerson, 1999), and the
   largest cities have traditionally been at the forefront in the adoption
   of e-government innovations (Moon, 2002; Ho, 2002). We examine the use
   of social networks and other interactive tools in the 75 largest U.S.
   cities between 2009 and 2011. During this period, the adoption of
   Facebook skyrocketed from just 13\% of the cities in 2009 to nearly 87\%
   in 2011; similarly, the use of Twitter increased from 25\% to 87\%. We
   further explore three case study cities through analysis of discussion
   on social networks, and interviews, and find that One-way ``push{''}
   strategies (Mergel, 2013a) predominate, although there are some signs of
   greater openness toward dialogue with citizens. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The adoption and diffusion of electronic government is often impeded by
   many social and individual factors relating to citizens. In this
   respect, intermediaries have emerged as a new model for delivering
   e-government services to overcome such obstacles. This study aims to
   examine the role of intermediaries in facilitating e-government adoption
   and diffusion using a survey based empirical study of 502 participants
   in Madinah City in Saudi Arabia. An extended UTAUT model is used as the
   theoretical basis utilizing trust in the Internet and Intermediaries.
   The results of this study show that there are significant relationships
   among the factors that influence intention to use e-government, namely,
   performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and trust of intermediary. In
   addition, the findings show that there is a significant relationship
   between facilitating conditions and usage behavior proving that
   intermediaries can influence adoption of e-government services. (C) 2013

Title = {{Evidence of Effectiveness of Health Care Professionals Using Handheld
   Computers: A Scoping Review of Systematic Reviews}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: Handheld computers and mobile devices provide instant access
   to vast amounts and types of useful information for health care
   professionals. Their reduced size and increased processing speed has led
   to rapid adoption in health care. Thus, it is important to identify
   whether handheld computers are actually effective in clinical practice.
   Objective: A scoping review of systematic reviews was designed to
   provide a quick overview of the documented evidence of effectiveness for
   health care professionals using handheld computers in their clinical
   work.
   Methods: A detailed search, sensitive for systematic reviews was applied
   for Cochrane, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary
   Medicine Database (AMED), Global Health, and Cumulative Index to Nursing
   and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. All outcomes that
   demonstrated effectiveness in clinical practice were included. Classroom
   learning and patient use of handheld computers were excluded. Quality
   was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews
   (AMSTAR) tool. A previously published conceptual framework was used as
   the basis for dual data extraction. Reported outcomes were summarized
   according to the primary function of the handheld computer.
   Results: Five systematic reviews met the inclusion and quality criteria.
   Together, they reviewed 138 unique primary studies. Most reviewed
   descriptive intervention studies, where physicians, pharmacists, or
   medical students used personal digital assistants. Effectiveness was
   demonstrated across four distinct functions of handheld computers:
   patient documentation, patient care, information seeking, and
   professional work patterns. Within each of these functions, a range of
   positive outcomes were reported using both objective and self-report
   measures. The use of handheld computers improved patient documentation
   through more complete recording, fewer documentation errors, and
   increased efficiency. Handheld computers provided easy access to
   clinical decision support systems and patient management systems, which
   improved decision making for patient care. Handheld computers saved time
   and gave earlier access to new information. There were also reports that
   handheld computers enhanced work patterns and efficiency.
   Conclusions: This scoping review summarizes the secondary evidence for
   effectiveness of handheld computers and mhealth. It provides a snapshot
   of effective use by health care professionals across four key functions.
   We identified evidence to suggest that handheld computers provide easy
   and timely access to information and enable accurate and complete
   documentation. Further, they can give health care professionals instant
   access to evidence-based decision support and patient management systems
   to improve clinical decision making. Finally, there is evidence that
   handheld computers allow health professionals to be more efficient in
   their work practices. It is anticipated that this evidence will guide
   clinicians and managers in implementing handheld computers in clinical
   practice and in designing future research.}},

Abstract = {{Digital media offer innovative ways of resolving crises of trust. This
   essay discusses a campaign that aimed to rebuild public trust in banks
   during the financial crisis. The campaign reflected a strategy
   (well-known in conflict resolution) that is best described as an online
   exercise in active listening. The essay discusses the potential of such
   a campaign and argues that in a crisis where rhetorical agency is
   impaired due to declining trust, corporations that engage in public
   listening may communicate acknowledgment and openness to change.
   However, in order to realize this potential, the public must be
   entrusted with a meaningful role as contributor to the campaign in the
   discursive and technical design of the medium of interaction. In the
   case studied, the campaign texts explicitly invited participation, but
   implicitly restrained the rhetorical agency of the public. This
   undermined the initiative's ability to renew the cognitive and emotional
   grounds for trust.}},

Abstract = {{Image and video-based results and process control are essential tools of
   a new teaching concept for conveying surgical skills. The new teaching
   concept integrates approved teaching principles and new media.
   Every performance of exercises is videotaped and the result
   photographically recorded. The quality of the process and result becomes
   accessible for an analysis by the teacher and the student/learner. The
   learner is instructed to perform a criteria-based self-analysis of the
   video and image material by themselves.
   The new learning concept has so far been successfully applied in seven
   rounds within the newly designed modular class ``Intensivkurs
   Chirurgische Techniken{''} (Intensive training of surgical techniques).
   Result documentation and analysis via digital picture was completed by
   almost every student. The quality of the results was high. Interestingly
   the result quality did not correlate with the time needed for the
   exercise. The training success had a lasting effect.
   The new and elaborate concept improves the quality of teaching. In the
   long run resources for patient care should be saved when training
   students according to this concept prior to performing tasks in the
   operating theater. These resources should be allocated for further
   refining innovative teaching concepts.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of hydrological data has been identified as one of the major
   obstacles facing the effective evaluation of hydraulic and hydrological
   interventions in the field. Traditional methods of data collection have
   proven to be generally expensive and particularly risky under high flow
   conditions. A method for quantifying hydrodynamic variables, such as
   surface flow velocity and discharge volume was developed in a laboratory
   setting using video images. This method explores several innovative
   image analysis techniques, specifically the Image Variance (IV) and
   Threshold Segmentation with Path Discretization (TSPD), where the basics
   steps comprise image capture, rectification and data extraction.
   Measurements obtained from conventional instruments and data extracted
   from video images were compared and exhibited less than 2.5\%
   difference. It can be concluded that under laboratory conditions it is
   possible to obtain reliable velocities and discharges from video
   techniques, without being in contact with the flow. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Despite rapid and continued adoption of mobile devices, few learning
   modes integrate with mobile technologies and libraries' environments as
   innovative learning modes that emphasize the key roles of libraries in
   facilitating learning. In addition, some education experts have claimed
   that transmitting knowledge to learners is not the only educational
   goal, as cultivating problem-solving skills is also essential. By
   integrating the problem-based learning (PBL) model with book resources
   in libraries, one can identify the advantages of libraries in supporting
   e-Learning, resulting in innovative and valuable research. Therefore,
   this study presents a novel intelligent mobile location-aware book
   recommendation system (IMLBRS) with map-based guidance to support
   cooperative PBL in a real-library environment. Using map navigation and
   book recommendation functionalities, learners can search for books
   associated with problem-solving with increased ease and efficiency,
   thereby helping learners increase their PBL performance in a library
   environment. Experimental results reveal that learning performance
   during PBL supported by the proposed IMLBRS for book searches is
   superior to learning performance during PBL supported by the online
   public access catalogue (OPAC). Experimental results also show that the
   proposed system facilitates better learning performance for learners
   with a field-dependent learning style than for learners with a
   field-independent learning style. Moreover, the proposed system
   facilitates learner contemplation, cooperative learning, and library
   user education as learners interact with a real-library environment and
   peers during cooperative PBL.}},

Abstract = {{This article elaborates on the competencies, often referred to as 21st
   century competencies, that are needed to be able to live in and
   contribute to our current (and future) society. We begin by describing,
   analysing and reflecting on international frameworks describing 21st
   century competencies, giving special attention to digital literacy as
   one of the core competencies for the 21st century. This is followed by
   an analysis of the learning approaches that are considered appropriate
   for acquiring 21st century competencies, and the specific role of
   technology in these learning processes. Despite some consensus about
   what 21st century competencies are and how they can be acquired, results
   from international studies indicate that teaching strategies for 21st
   century competencies are often not well implemented in actual
   educational practice. The reasons for this include a lack of integration
   of 21st century competencies in curriculum and assessment, insufficient
   preparation of teachers and the absence of any systematic attention for
   strategies to adopt at scale innovative teaching and learning practices.
   The article concludes with a range of specific recommendations for the
   implementation of 21st century competencies.}},

Abstract = {{There have been repeated calls for restructuring of schooling to take
   advantage of information and communication technologies (ICT). This
   article recognizes an increasing range of radical restructuring
   resulting from the co-evolution of education and digital technologies in
   school systems and related activity in the global ecosystem. Research of
   previously innovative schools that did not sustain their innovative
   strategies with ICT has also helped to clarify relevant factors
   including the importance of leadership. Davis' co-evolutionary framework
   is illustrated with case studies of sustained transformation enabled by
   blended and online learning in New Zealand and the USA. Transformations
   include decoupling of the roles of a class teacher, plus decoupling of
   the services provided by a single school into provision by networked
   organizations, including a virtual school and web-based services. The
   diversity of transformed educational ecosystems is linked to local and
   regional variations in culture and conditions. The article concludes
   that teachers in a range of roles will remain the keystone species of
   K-12 education also in the 21st century and recommends that this
   co-evolutionary framework is applied globally to increase equitable
   provision.}},

Abstract = {{One of the definitions of typography is that it is the art of arranging
   typefaces for a specific project and their arrangement in order to
   achieve a more effective communication. In order to choose the
   appropriate typeface, the user should be well-acquainted with visual or
   geometric features of typography, typographic rules and the historical
   development of typography. Additionally, every user is further assisted
   by a good quality and simple typeface classification. There are many
   different classifications of typefaces based on historical or visual
   criteria, as well as their combination. During the last thirty years,
   computers and digital technology have enabled brand new creative
   freedoms. As a result, there are thousands of fonts and dozens of
   applications for digitally creating typefaces. This paper suggests an
   innovative, simpler classification, which should correspond to the
   contemporary development of typography, the production of a vast number
   of new typefaces and the needs of today's users.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution analyzes media literacy development as a component of
   education for democratic citizenship and personal development of
   children and youth. We analyze the features, approaches and innovative
   strategies of integration of media education into the religious
   education curriculum. Media literacy strategies can play a key role in
   helping teachers to fulfil their responsibility for preparing children
   and adolescents to use the interne, television and other media that
   surround them. Our approach reflects the need to educate not only in
   technical aspects of information and communication technologies, but
   also in their responsible and meaningful use. One of the important goals
   of current religious teaching could be to stimulate critical and
   creative thinking and promote digital citizenship and the ethical
   values. This article, showcasing the experience gathered by Slovak
   schools, provides insights on the inclusive and innovative educational
   trends within a media saturated environment of contemporary society.}},

Abstract = {{For all its traditional successes, the current model of medical
   education in the United States and Canada is being challenged on issues
   of quality, throughput, and cost, a process that has exposed numerous
   shortcomings in its efforts to meet the needs of the nations' health
   care systems. A radical change in direction is required because the
   current path will not lead to a solution. The 2010 publication Educating
   Physicians: A Call for Reform of Medical School and Residency identifies
   several goals for improving the medical education system, and proposals
   have been made to reform medical education to meet these goals. Enacting
   these recommendations practically and efficiently, while training more
   health care providers at a lower cost, is challenging. To advance
   solutions, the authors review innovations that are disrupting higher
   education and describe a vision for using these to create a new model
   for competency-based, learner-centered medical education that can better
   meet the needs of the health care system while adhering to the spirit of
   the above proposals. These innovations include collaboration amongst
   medical schools to develop massive open online courses for didactic
   content; faculty working in small groups to leverage this online content
   in a flipped-classroom model; and digital badges for credentialing
   entrustable professional activities over the continuum of learning.}},

Title = {{Changing trends in the use of seizure prophylaxis after traumatic brain
   injury: A shift from phenytoin to levetiracetam}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Current guidelines for traumatic brain injury (TBI) recommend
   antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for 7 days after injury to decrease
   posttraumatic seizure risk. Phenytoin decreases seizure risk 73\% vs
   placebo during this time. Levetiracetam (LEV) is an alternative;
   however, no published data validate comparable efficacy. Our objective
   was to evaluate seizure incidence 7 days after TBI in patients treated
   with phenytoin (PHT) vs LEV and to characterize practice of AED
   selection.
   Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted using a
   Trauma Registry (Collector Trauma Registry; Digital Innovation, Inc,
   Forrest Hill, Md) to evaluate patients with TBI. Patients with an
   initial Head/Neck Abbreviated Injury Scale score of 3 or higher and a
   Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 or less were included.
   Results: Of 109 patients, 89 received PHT, and 20, LEV. Two patients
   experienced posttraumatic seizure, 1 in each group. Sixty-eight patients
   survived to hospital discharge; 65\% received prophylactic AED greater
   than 7 days. Ninety-eight percent of 81 patients admitted between 2000
   and 2007 received PHT, whereas 64\% of 28 patients admitted between 2008
   and 2010 received LEV.
   Conclusion: Only 2 patients experienced posttraumatic seizure after
   receiving AED, indicating low incidence. Most surviving to hospital
   discharge received AED prophylaxis greater than 7 days despite guideline
   recommendations. After approval of intravenous LEV, a trend favoring LEV
   was observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article argues that the future of public services will be shaped
   increasingly by the evolution of global, Internet-enabled, digital
   platforms, with two distinctive technical and commercial features.
   First, use of open standards and architectures that separate standard
   business logic from supporting applications will allow government to
   become technology- and vendor-agnostic, freeing it from its
   overdependence on proprietary systems and suppliers. Second, over time,
   open standards and increased market choice will drive both innovation
   and progressive convergence on cheaper, standard utility public
   services. These two features will combine to create a powerful dynamic
   situation, driving disintegration of traditional black boxed
   technologies and services, traditionally organized around systems
   integrators and departmental structures, and their reaggregation around
   the citizen in the form of services. Such reaggregation is allowing
   progressively sharp distinctions between niche/innovative and
   commodity/standard offerings, supplied by a plural, innovative, and more
   cost-effective marketplace, with unprecedented implications for the way
   in which the state buys and deploys technology. We draw on a range of
   data from across public and private sectors to illustrate our argument
   and identify some key policy and implementation recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty years after Dr. Holonyak's invention, a compact disc (CD) was
   introduced to the market in 1982. A laser diode is always in the heart
   of optical storage systems and a variety of other industrial
   applications. Innovations in laser diode technologies have brought
   optical storage evolutions from CD to digital versatile disc (DVD) and
   then Blu-ray disc (BD) every ten years. Since the most important reason
   for our success in laser development is our choice of metalorganic
   chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) for growing these semiconductor
   alloys, MOCVD equipment, growth conditions, material properties, and
   phenomena associated with MOCVD and various alloy lasers grown by MOCVD
   are described in detail. Reviewing the development history would tell us
   how the laser diode has created a huge market and why recent innovations
   will predict future applications.}},

Abstract = {{In the footsteps of groundbreaking achievements made by biomedical
   research, another scientific revolution is unfolding. Systems biology
   draws from the chaos and complexity theory and applies computational
   models to predict emerging behavior of the interactions between genes,
   gene products, and environmental factors. Adaptation of systems biology
   to translational and clinical sciences has been termed network medicine,
   and is likely to change the way we think about preventing, predicting,
   diagnosing, and treating complex human diseases. Network medicine finds
   gene-disease associations by analyzing the unparalleled digital
   information discovered and created by high-throughput technologies
   (dubbed as ``omics{''} science) and links genetic variance to clinical
   disease phenotypes through intermediate organizational levels of life
   such as the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome.
   Supported by large reference databases, unprecedented data storage
   capacity, and innovative computational analysis, network medicine is
   poised to find links between conditions that were thought to be
   distinct, uncover shared disease mechanisms and key drivers of the
   pathogenesis, predict individual disease outcomes and trajectories,
   identify novel therapeutic applications, and help avoid off-target and
   undesirable drug effects. Recent advances indicate that these
   perspectives are increasingly within our reach for understanding and
   managing complex diseases of the digestive system.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the concept, benefits, and general architecture for
   acquiring, storing, and displaying digital photographs along with
   medical imaging examinations. We also discuss a specific implementation
   built around an Android-based system for simultaneously acquiring
   digital photographs along with portable radiographs. By an innovative
   application of radiofrequency identification technology to radiographic
   cassettes, the system is able to maintain a tight relationship between
   these photographs and the radiographs within the picture archiving and
   communications system (PACS) environment. We provide a cost analysis
   demonstrating the economic feasibility of this technology. Since our
   architecture naturally integrates with patient identification methods,
   we also address patient privacy issues.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the role of place and spatial boundaries for the
   creative industries. Evidence from interviews with 70 workers in the
   advertising industry in London reveals the importance of geographical
   clustering for workers in this sector despite the potential of digital
   technologies. Creative firms are embedded in place, where the importance
   of urban aesthetics and social networks leads to tight geographic
   clustering. The aim of this paper is (i) to explore how and why
   geography matters for workers in the `new' or `changing' economy and
   (ii) how this creates a shared identity between creative workers. The
   article concludes that despite technological breakthroughs that have
   caused the death of distance, it turns out that geography is still
   important. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The study investigates how market imperfections distort the impact of
   trade reform on productivity growth. As the trade expands it influences
   both product and factor prices and if the distortions arise due to these
   market imperfections are not eliminated, the usual estimate of total
   factor productivity growth, using the growth accounting method, would be
   misleading. Theoretically, it shows that the usual estimate tends to be
   overestimated in the export competing sector and underestimated in the
   import competing sector. A modified approach of Olley-Pakes and
   Levinsohn-Petrin methods involving three-digits industries over the
   fifteen major Indian states during the period 1998-2005 has been used to
   deal with the simultaneity issue of factor choice and market distortions
   for the better estimate. A positive and significant impact of openness
   on the productivity growth has been observed only when the market
   imperfections are eliminated. Moreover, the modified productivity
   growth, after controlling market imperfections, has turned out to be
   lower than that of the usual estimate in India.}},

Abstract = {{The term connectivity has emerged as a powerful concept in hydrology and
   geomorphology and is emerging as an innovative component of catchment
   erosion modeling studies. However, considerable confusion remains
   regarding its definition and quantification, especially as it relates to
   fluvial systems. This confusion is exacerbated by a lack of detailed
   case studies and by the tendency to treat water and sediment separately.
   Extreme flood events provide a useful framework to assess variability in
   connectivity, particularly the connection between channels and
   floodplains. The catastrophic flood of January 2011 in the Lockyer
   valley, southeast Queensland, Australia provides an opportunity to
   examine this dimension in some detail and to determine how these
   dynamics operate under high flow regimes. High resolution aerial
   photographs and multi-temporal LiDAR digital elevation models (DEMs),
   coupled with hydrological modeling, are used to assess both the nature
   of hydrologic and sedimentological connectivity and their dominant
   controls. Longitudinal variations in flood inundation extent led to the
   identification of nine reaches which displayed varying
   channel-floodplain connectivity. The major control on connectivity was
   significant non-linear changes in channel capacity due to the presence
   of notable macrochannels which contained a>3000 average recurrence
   interval (ARI) event at mid-catchment locations. The spatial pattern of
   hydrological connectivity was not straight-forward in spite of bankfull
   discharges for selected reaches exceeding 5600m(3) s(-1). Data indicate
   that the main channel boundary was the dominant source of sediment while
   the floodplains, where inundated, were the dominant sinks. Spatial
   variability in channel-floodplain hydrological connectivity leads to
   dis-connectivity in the downstream transfer of sediments between reaches
   and affected sediment storage on adjacent floodplains. Consideration of
   such variability for even the most extreme flood events, highlights the
   need to carefully consider non-linear changes in key variables such as
   channel capacity and flood conveyance in the development of a
   quantitative connectivity index'. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Preventing cell entry of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is of
   interest for the development of innovative therapies. We previously
   reported a specific interaction between HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein 120
   (gp120) and Tat at the cell surface, which enhances virus attachment and
   entry. We also identified a gp120-mimicking peptide, CT319, that
   competes with gp120 for Tat binding, thus inhibiting HIV-1 infection.
   Here we report a molecular dissection of gp120 regions involved in this
   mechanism. Our findings identify the V1/V2 loop of gp120 as involved in
   Tat binding, and define this interaction as functionally relevant for
   HIV-1 entry into host cells.

Abstract = {{Current understanding of the term ``concussion{''} is fraught with
   misconceptions regarding the extent and nature of brain injury. Despite
   increasing attention in popular media and within the context of sports,
   considerable gaps exist in our knowledge of the diagnosis, underlying
   brain pathology, recovery of function, and optimal interventions for
   concussion. In this special interest article, we discuss the definition
   and risk factors associated with concussion, summarize and highlight
   some of the most widely used assessment tools, and critique the evidence
   for current principles of concussion management. Our evaluation has
   identified opportunities for novel neuroimaging techniques to improve
   the understanding of the pathophysiology of concussion and to evaluate
   the changes in the recovering brain in response to rehabilitation. In
   summary, a clear definition of the underlying brain pathology, the
   potential long-term consequences, and the risk factors of injury and
   recovery will help guide future research aiming to minimize the impact
   of injury and develop innovative and successful therapeutic approaches
   aimed at ameliorating the functional impairments associated with
   concussion. Video Abstract available (see Video, Supplemental Digital

Abstract = {{The current literature on digital infrastructure offers powerful lenses
   for conceptualizing the increasingly interconnected information system
   collectives found in contemporary organizations. However, little
   attention has been paid to the generative mechanisms of digital
   infrastructure, that is, the causal powers that explain how and why such
   infrastructure evolves over time. This is unfortunate, since more
   knowledge about what drives digital infrastructures would be highly
   valuable for managers and IT professionals confronted by the complexity
   of managing them. To this end, this paper adopts a critical realist view
   for developing a configurational perspective of infrastructure
   evolution. Our theorizing draws on a multimethod research design
   comprising an in-depth case study and a case survey. The in-depth case
   study, conducted at a Scandinavian airline, distinguishes three key
   mechanisms of digital infrastructure evolution: adoption, innovation,
   and scaling. The case survey research of 41 cases of digital
   infrastructure then identifies and analyzes causal paths through which
   configurations of these mechanisms lead to successful evolution
   outcomes. The study reported in this paper contributes to the
   infrastructure literature in two ways. First, we identify three
   generative mechanisms of digital infrastructure and how they
   contingently lead to evolution outcomes. Second, we use these mechanisms
   as a basis for developing a configurational perspective that advances
   current knowledge about why some digital infrastructures evolve
   successfully while others do not. In addition, the paper demonstrates
   and discusses the efficacy of critical realism as a philosophical
   tradition for developing substantive contributions in the field of
   information systems.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Many archives, libraries and museums have been exploring
   and experimenting with the use of social media. Web 2.0-enabled digital
   cultural heritage has been heralded by some as the face of a near future
   in which digital information services will become increasingly dynamic,
   communicative and participatory. There remains a risk however, that
   without a useful framework to guide the design, management and
   sustaining of an effective participatory platform, the resulting
   situation could be one in which institutions end up providing the
   platform, but not the direction and support needed for it to properly
   flourish. In such cases, the response from users and stakeholders could
   be negligible engagement or contributions of a superficial nature that
   fail to add value to the cultural heritage.
   Method. This research-in-progress starts with the premise that digital
   cultural heritages are situated within socio-technical networks.
   Technologies and stakeholders have degrees of agency in the activities
   that take place. As such, implementation of social media and the
   activities that can potentially result in user-generated innovation is
   an on-going process in the information ecology concerned, where constant
   negotiation is needed to evolve and for them to remain valuable. In this
   paper, firstly, the concepts of social web and socio-technical systems
   are explored in the context of digital cultural heritage 2.0. This is
   followed by a discussion of a meta-design perspective as a useful
   framework to inform the design and management of effective and
   productive culture of participation in digital cultural heritage 2.0.
   Conclusion. We found the key principles of meta-design relevant and from
   the conceptual consideration of a meta-design perspective for digital
   cultural heritage 2.0, a number of aspects which particularly warrant
   further investigation were identified and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Intrathecal drug delivery systems are becoming an increasingly common
   modality used by physicians to treat patients. Specifically, chronic
   spasticity secondary to multiple sclerosis (MS) may be treated with
   intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy when oral antispasmodics do not
   provide adequate relief. ITB therapy is effective, localizes drug
   delivery, and does not have the same degree of intolerable systemic
   effects often seen with oral and parenteral medications. As the use of
   intrathecal drug delivery systems has become more common, so has the
   incidence of adverse events. ITB administration requires the surgical
   implantation of indwelling catheters and a pump reservoir. Although this
   therapy is useful in treating spasticity, risks unique to intrathecal
   drug delivery systems include medication dosing errors, pump
   malfunction, infection, and catheter breakage or dislocation. To our
   knowledge intrathecal pump catheter migration into the spinal cord is a
   very rare complication with only 2 such complications reported. We
   present a case of an intrathecal baclofen pump catheter that was
   initially believed to have migrated into the spinal cord and the
   innovative use of cinefluoroscopy and digital subtraction used to
   identify catheter placement. Moreover, after confirmation of the
   catheter position within the spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) our team elected to perform a laminectomy, which demonstrated that
   the catheter was not in the spinal cord but was surrounded by arachnoid
   adhesions. We hope our efforts will provide the clinician insight into
   the common difficulties that arise and how best to troubleshoot them to
   serve this specific patient population and prevent potentially
   life-threatening complications.}},

Journal = {{RADIO SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{The TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X)
   mission comprises two nearly identical satellites: TerraSAR-X (TSX,
   launched in June 2007), and TanDEM-X (TDX, launched in June 2010), which
   form an innovative and flexible single-pass radar interferometer. The
   primary objective of the mission is to generate a worldwide and
   consistent digital elevation model (DEM) with an unprecedented accuracy.
   After a calibration phase of the TDX satellite, which was performed
   during the first 3 months after its launch, the two satellites were
   brought into close formation to begin the bistatic commissioning phase.
   Then, in December 2010, TanDEM-X started the operational global DEM
   acquisition in bistatic configuration. During the last 2 years,
   dedicated analyses on test acquisitions as well as persistent monitoring
   of the interferometric performance have been carried out, which are the
   subject of this paper. Key quantities in estimating interferometric
   performance such as coherence, relative height error, and
   phase-unwrapping indicators are investigated, showing the outstanding
   capabilities of TanDEM-X. Then, the main focus is shifted to those
   critical areas which, for various reasons, have shown unsatisfactory
   data quality and therefore must be reacquired with optimized imaging
   geometries in order to fulfill the DEM accuracy requirements. Promising
   results have been obtained so far, and future strategies to handle the
   critical data are discussed. This paper will present an overview of the
   interferometric performance of TanDEM-X, based on investigations
   performed in the first 2 years of mission operation, and will include
   results from the bistatic commissioning phase until the end of the first
   global DEM acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates how transdisciplinary approaches to curriculum
   design on a taught masters programme in creative technologies enhance
   digital creativity in students. Drawing on the experience of developing
   and running the Masters in Creative Technologies (MA/MSc) at the
   Institute of Creative Technologies at De Montfort University, Leicester,
   we explore a number of areas relating to transdisciplinary teaching and
   learning in higher education, including: how digital technologies enable
   students to work in a transdisciplinary manner; how working creatively
   with technology enables transdisciplinary modes of working; and the ways
   in which transdisciplinarity, enabled by digital technologies, has
   affected the creative practice of learners. The article discusses how
   the programme has developed a climate for creativity, and outlines how
   the knowledge and skills gained during a creative technologies-related
   transdisciplinary programme meet the needs of a changing workplace.}},

Pages = {{456-458}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents design and parameters of a multifunction ultrasonic
   generator manufactured by Tele and Radio Research Institute. Efficient
   usage of ultrasonic welding and cutting technology depends on the
   ability to precisely control process parameters and tune those
   parameters to suit particular needs. Ultrasonic generator is responsible
   for such control and tuning. Presented design incorporates powerful 32
   bit Cortex M4 microcontroller with floating point unit which allows
   using modern signal processing methods to calculate parameters of
   ultrasonic stack in real time. Calculated parameters, especially
   impedance of the stack are used to estimate load level and identify
   phases of the welding process such as melting of the welded material.
   Precise control of the output signal is possible due to innovative
   design of the direct digital signal synthesis unit implemented in
   programmable logic device (CPLD). Resonant inverter topology of the
   generator front end ensures high electrical efficiency of the device.
   Designed generator is equipped with various communication interfaces
   such as USB host and slave, Ethernet, Bluetooth, CAN and RS485. Multiple
   digital inputs and outputs together with load cell interface, 4-20 mA
   receiver and 0-10 V analog input enable the generator to monitor and
   control entire ultrasonic welding system without the need of a PLC unit.}},

Abstract = {{The Picture Postcard was an extraordinarily popular innovation at the
   beginning of the twentieth century in Europe, enabling writers to send
   brief, multimodal messages through a cheap communications channel, in a
   culture of speed'. With several deliveries a day, this could be
   experienced as closer to the synchronicity of the digital communications
   than vernacular written communications in the intervening period. I
   examine the writing of ten British Edwardian picture postcards from a
   collection of three thousand. Analysis of the writing, writtenness and
   multimodality of the postcards is combined with historical
   investigations of public records. Through this innovative approach to
   the construction of text histories, I demonstrate the value of applying
   the ethnographic sensibility of Literacy Studies to these communications
   that accomplished diverse and rich purposes and explore connections with
   claims made about contemporary digital practices.}},

   endoscopy has evolved rapidly. The developments in the fields of hard-
   and software have been aimed to expand the recording capacity, to

   this method both in physicians and patients. Secondly the expansion of
   indications to all parts of the GI tract is being focused. Innovations
   for the future contain various possibilities of digitally preprocessing
   of capsule films, the development of active locomotion and steering
   mechanisms as well as the integration of various built-in sensors and
   therapeutic implications into the capsule. Apart from that first
   attempts of a ``mouth-to-anus{''}-capsule have been tested to visualize
   the whole GI tract.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative methodology to detect and track cells using microscope
   images enhanced by optical cross-correlation techniques is proposed in
   this paper. In order to increase the tracking sensibility, image
   pre-processing has been implemented as a morphological operator on the
   microscope image. Results show that the pre-processing process allows
   for additional frames of cell tracking, therefore increasing its
   robustness. The proposed methodology can be used in analyzing different
   problems such as mitosis, cell collisions, and cell overlapping,
   ultimately designed to identify and treat illnesses and malignancies.}},

Abstract = {{Public opinion has embraced social media as a vital tool to reach U.S.
   emerging adults, but this generation has not universally adopted social
   media technologies. Using in-depth interviews, this study examined the
   characteristics of 20 emerging adults (18 to 23 years old) who were
   non-adopters of social media. Compared to social media users,
   non-adopters had less economic stability, more fractured educational
   trajectories, and weaker support from parents and friends. Non-adopters
   did not use social media because they lacked access or leisure time,
   were not socialized into their use, lacked skills, or did not want to
   maintain social contacts via social media technologies. If social media
   are increasingly used in attempts to to improve young people's lives,
   practitioners must understand who is left behind in the wake of these
   technologies.}},

   this shortcoming has not dampened the enthusiasm of the research
   community toward graphene electronics. Aside from high mobility,
   graphene offers numerous other amazing electrical, optical, thermal, and

Abstract = {{Communication is part and parcel of every interaction. This raises the
   question of the role of modern media in mental health care. The aim of
   this explorative study was to investigate the use of modern media in the
   clinical practice.
   In an Internet survey 234 psychotherapists from Nordrhein-Westfalen
   (NRW) were surveyed about the extent to which they integrate new media
   in the practice and their opinion about this integration. For this
   purpose a questionnaire was developed based on the questionnaire of
   Wangberg et al. (2007).
   Most of the psychotherapists already use e-mails as well as mobile
   communication to contact their patients. The main reason for choosing
   this modern way of communication is the possibility to simplify the
   management of formal issues. Psychotherapists were indifferent about the
   idea of web-based counseling.
   Forms of digital media are used as an addition to conventional ways of
   therapeutic communication but face-to-face interaction cannot be
   replaced completely which is also indicated by the fact that
   professionals still highly value personal contact.}},

Abstract = {{E-Health alters how health care clinicians, institutions, patients,
   caregivers, families, advocates, and researchers collaborate. Few
   guidelines exist to evaluate the impact of social technologies on
   furthering family health and even less on their capacity to ameliorate
   health disparities. Health social media tools that help develop,
   sustain, and strengthen the collaborative health agenda may prove useful
   to ameliorate health care inequities; the linkage should not, however,
   be taken for granted. In this article we propose a classification of
   emerging social technologies in health care with the purpose of
   developing evaluative criteria that assess their ability to foster
   collaboration and positively impact health care equity. The findings are
   based on systematic Internet ethnographic observations, a qualitative
   analysis of e-health tool exemplars, and a review of the literature. To
   triangulate data collection and analysis, the research team consulted
   with social media health care experts in making recommendations for
   evaluation criteria. Selected cases illustrate the analytical
   conclusions. Lines of research that are needed to accurately rate and
   reliably measure the ability of social media e-health offerings to
   address health disparities are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation drives economic competitiveness and sustained long-term
   economic growth. Especially the emergence and intensive utilization of
   information and communication technologies (ICTs), which spawned the
   beginning of the digital economy two decades ago, heavily affected the
   opportunities and efficiency of how firms produce and provide goods and
   services. We provide an overview of the empirical literature on ICT and
   productivity and highlight the main results and methodological
   differences. The majority of studies indicates that the productivity
   effect of ICT is indeed positive and significant. However,
   methodological approaches of how to appropriately estimate the ICT
   effect matter. While aggregate and sectoral growth accounting exercises
   suggest stronger differences of the ICT effect between US and Europe,
   firm-level analyses suggest no significant country differences.
   Moreover, we shed light on the notion of ICT being a General Propose
   Technology (GPT) enabling further innovations. Most of the GPT evidence
   on ICT is found for the US, while evidence for European countries is
   harder to come by. However, more theoretical and empirical research is
   needed to better understand spillovers and externalities of ICT and how
   these technologies transform our economies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine how and why organizational learning is
   affected by virtualization technologies. The literature on
   organizational learning has identified its many constraints, and the
   influence of information technologies on overcoming these restraints has
   also received attention. Little research, however, has addressed how
   organizational learning is affected by a new type of technology
   associated with ``virtuality{''}: the characterization of people,
   objects, and processes by digital representations, providing enhanced
   opportunities for the interpersonal and organizational interactivity and
   engagement that stimulates organizational learning. We present an
   exploratory case study of the engagement with, and use of, virtual
   worlds at IBM, a leading user of this virtualization technology. Virtual
   worlds are associated with games; we explore their use in the novel
   conduct of social interactions in meetings, rehearsals, and
   brainstorming, and we argue that organizational learning results from
   forms of play. We explain how such a playful, game-like technology came
   to be accepted in a serious for-profit science and engineering
   organization through a process we refer to as convergent recognition. We
   find organizational learning results from the interrelated processes
   behind the adoption of the technology and its application. By reference
   to the distinction between technologies of rationality and foolishness,
   we theorize how their reconciliation occurs through the mutually
   reinforcing ways organizations learn to engage with and use new
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Histology stands as a major discipline in the life science curricula,
   and the practice of teaching it is based on theoretical didactic
   strategies along with practical training. Traditionally, students
   achieve practical competence in this subject by learning optical
   microscopy. Today, students can use newer information and communication
   technologies in the study of digital microscopic images. A virtual
   microscopy program was recently introduced at Ghent University. Since
   little empirical evidence is available concerning the impact of virtual
   microscopy (VM) versus optical microscopy (OM) on the acquisition of
   histology knowledge, this study was set up in the Faculty of Medicine
   and Health Sciences. A pretest-post test and cross-over design was
   adopted. In the first phase, the experiment yielded two groups in a
   total population of 199 students, Group 1 performing the practical
   sessions with OM versus Group 2 performing the same sessions with VM. In
   the second phase, the research subjects switched conditions. The prior
   knowledge level of all research subjects was assessed with a pretest.
   Knowledge acquisition was measured with a post test after each phase (T1
   and T2). Analysis of covariance was carried out to study the
   differential gain in knowledge at T1 and T2, considering the possible
   differences in prior knowledge at the start of the study. The results
   pointed to non-significant differences at T1 and at T2. This supports
   the assumption that the acquisition of the histology knowledge is
   independent of the microscopy representation mode (VM versus OM) of the
   learning material. The conclusion that VM is equivalent to OM offers new
   directions in view of ongoing innovations in medical education
   technology. Anat Sci Educ 6: 307-315. (c) 2013 American Association of

Abstract = {{Electric Network Frequency (ENF) fluctuates slightly over time from its
   nominal value of 50 Hz/60 Hz. The fluctuations in ENF remain consistent
   across the entire power grid including when measured at physically
   distant geographical locations. The light intensity from such indoor
   lighting as fluorescent lamps and incandescent bulbs, which are
   connected to the power mains, varies in accordance with the ENF, and the
   fluctuations can be recorded using visual sensors. In this paper,
   mechanisms using optical sensors and video cameras to record and
   validate the presence of ENF fluctuations in indoor lighting are
   presented. Spectrogram and subspace-based signal processing techniques
   are applied to such recordings to extract the ENF signal by estimating
   its instantaneous frequencies as a function of time. A high correlation
   is observed between the ENF fluctuations obtained from indoor lighting
   and that of the ENF signal captured directly from the power mains
   supply. A similar mechanism is then used to demonstrate the presence of
   ENF signals in video recordings taken in different geographical areas.
   Experimental results show that ENF signals are present in visual
   recordings made in different geographical areas and can be used as a
   natural timestamp for optical sensor recordings and video surveillance
   recordings conducted in indoor lighting environments. Robustness of ENF
   fluctuation traces under strong compression and CMOS rolling shutter
   cameras is discussed. Applications of the ENF signal analysis to
   tampering detection of surveillance video recordings and forensic
   binding of the audio and visual track of a video are also demonstrated.
   An analytical model based on an autoregressive process is also developed
   for ENF signals, and the effectiveness of using innovation sequences
   from the model for timestamp verification is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Universal access (UA) to the Internet and the associated information
   infrastructure has become an important economic and societal goal.
   However, UA initiatives tend to focus on issues such as physical access
   and geographical ubiquity, and they measure adoption through penetration
   rates. In this paper, we apply an interpretive case study approach to
   analyze the Philadelphia wireless initiative to provide insights into
   the nature of UA and extend this concept to also consider universal use
   (UU). UU is important because simply providing access does not guarantee
   use. UU is presented as a conceptual goal that starts with the challenge
   of physical access, but which necessarily also leads to considerations
   of use. The results show that the human and technological elements
   underlying individual access and use are deeply embedded within various
   institutional elements and collectives that enable but also constrain
   meaningful use. We integrate our findings into a multilevel framework
   that shows how access and use are influenced by both micro and macro
   factors. This framework provides new insights into the study of the
   information infrastructure, digital divide, and public policy.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic 3D extraction of building roofs from remotely sensed data is
   important for many applications including city modelling. This paper
   proposes a new method for automatic 3D roof extraction through an
   effective integration of LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data and
   multispectral orthoimagery. Using the ground height from a DEM (Digital
   Elevation Model), the raw LIDAR points are separated into two groups.
   The first group contains the ground points that are exploited to
   constitute a `ground mask'. The second group contains the non-ground
   points which are segmented using an innovative image line guided
   segmentation technique to extract the roof planes. The image lines are
   extracted from the grey-scale version of the orthoimage and then
   classified into several classes such as `ground', `tree', `roof edge'
   and `roof ridge' using the ground mask and colour and texture
   information from the orthoimagery. During segmentation of the non-ground
   LIDAR points, the lines from the latter two classes are used as
   baselines to locate the nearby LIDAR points of the neighbouring planes.
   For each plane a robust seed region is thereby defined using the nearby
   non-ground LIDAR points of a baseline and this region is iteratively
   grown to extract the complete roof plane. Finally, a newly proposed
   rule-based procedure is applied to remove planes constructed on trees.
   Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully
   remove vegetation and so offers high extraction rates. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The use of lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) systems for modelling
   petroleum reservoir analogues has become increasingly popular over the
   past few years, and there has been a proliferation of articles on the
   subject both on techniques and applications. A review of the literature
   of recent years has been conducted focussing on the use of lidar data
   not only in petroleum geology related projects, but also looking to the
   wider field of lidar usage to examine what other approaches may be of
   use to the petroleum geologist. Benefits of digital data acquisition are
   considered, as well as a basic overview of data collection approaches.
   Use of a variety of attributes (intensity, colour, dip, azimuth,
   co-linearity, co-planarity among others) is discussed as an aid to both
   manual and automated interpretation approaches. Integration of lidar
   data with other data types from traditional field data (sedimentary logs
   for example) and other digital data types such as multispectral and
   hyperspectral imagery, and ground penetrating radar are discussed as a
   way of increasing the amount of information in the digital dataset. The
   application of artificial intelligence approaches such as Smart Swarms
   and Neural Networks are considered, as well as current developments in
   both hardware and software. A variety of examples are given where lidar
   has been used in an innovative or interesting way, showing the strength
   of this data acquisition approach when combined with appropriate
   interpretation and modelling techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The interest in brain-like computation has led to the design of a
   plethora of innovative neuromorphic systems. Individually, spiking
   neural networks (SNNs), event-driven simulation and digital hardware
   neuromorphic systems get a lot of attention. Despite the popularity of
   event-driven SNNs in software, very few digital hardware architectures
   are found. This is because existing hardware solutions for event
   management scale badly with the number of events. This paper introduces
   the structured heap queue, a pipelined digital hardware data structure,
   and demonstrates its suitability for event management. The structured
   heap queue scales gracefully with the number of events, allowing the
   efficient implementation of large scale digital hardware event-driven
   SNNs. The scaling is linear for memory, logarithmic for logic resources
   and constant for processing time. The use of the structured heap queue
   is demonstrated on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with an image
   segmentation experiment and a SNN of 65 536 neurons and 513 184
   synapses. Events can be processed at the rate of 1 every 7 clock cycles
   and a 406 x 158 pixel image is segmented in 200 ms. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This essay studies the diffusion/adoption of Web 2.0 technologies in
   small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)' innovation strategies and
   particularly in research, development, design and other innovation
   activities. It looks at the effects of these technologies on the
   evolution and the dynamics of firm's innovation capabilities and the
   implications of entrepreneurial turnover on the adoption of said
   technologies. The study is based on original fieldwork with some 130
   SMEs. The author finds that a consistent share of SMEs is actively
   trying to fill the knowledge gap and integrate Web 2.0 technologies in
   their innovation strategies. SMEs are managing this integration by
   progressively adjusting their behaviour in reaction to the opportunities
   offered by the technology and balancing the dependence of the business
   from the web. Barriers to the adoption of such technologies are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There is a recognised trend of manufacturing companies offering not only
   products, but also services and even complete solutions to business
   problems. Research has highlighted economic, market demand and
   competitiveness factors as responsible for the reshaping of business
   strategies that this has involved. This study analyses the extent to
   which another factor, technology, has been a significant factor in the
   switch from product oriented to service-oriented strategies. A case
   study of the aero engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce is used to analyse the
   impact of technology, which is found to have led manufacturers to
   reshape their business strategies. The study finds that developments in
   one technology in particular, namely digital electronics, have been a
   powerful enabling factor facilitating the implementation of service
   strategies. This provided original equipment manufacturers like
   Rolls-Royce with a competitive advantage relative to conventional
   service providers, by enabling them to acquire new knowledge management

Abstract = {{Using Rogers' diffusion of innovation model as the theoretical
   framework, this study examined the relationships between lifestyle
   orientations and the adoption of nine Internet-related technologies in
   Taiwan including IPTV, digital cable, emails, Internet instant messages,
   Facebook, scanners, notebooks, printers and personal computers. A
   telephone survey was conducted to collect data, and 506 valid
   questionnaires were obtained, representing a response rate of 58.6\%.
   The results showed that lifestyle orientations were a powerful predictor
   for the adoption of information-oriented and entertainment-oriented
   technologies, but not for the adoption of interpersonally oriented
   technologies. Furthermore, this study found that while demographics were
   the most powerful variable that distinguished the adopters from the
   non-adopters, mass media use was not. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A wireless stress mapping system for the development of ``smart
   brackets{''} is presented. The system is designed for monitoring the
   forces and moments applied to individual teeth during orthodontic
   therapy which may contribute to improve treatment effectiveness. It
   comprises a stress mapping chip fabricated in a 0.35-mu m process and a
   micro coil produced by gold electroplating in a photoresist mask.
   Twenty-four transistor-based stress sensors for measuring either
   in-plane shear stress or the difference of in-plane normal stresses are
   strategically distributed over the chip area. The sensor signals are
   processed by a variable-gain differential difference amplifier and
   digitized by a 10-bit SAR ADC, enabling a resolution down to 11 kPa at
   highest gain. A wireless interface conditions the energy received at
   13.56 MHz and transmits the data by load modulation. With dimensions of
   2 x 2.5 x 0.73 mm(3) and a power consumption of 1.75 mW, the system lays
   the foundation for the assembly of smart brackets as innovative tools in
   orthodontic therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The main causes of renal artery stenosis (RAS) are
   atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia. Despite contrast-enhanced
   magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) being a safe and reliable method
   for diagnosis of RAS especially in young individuals, recently it has
   been possible to adopt innovative technologies that do not require
   paramagnetic contrast agents.
   Purpose: To assess the accuracy of steady-state free-precession (SSFP)
   non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (NC-MRA) by using a
   1.5 T MR scanner for the detection of renal artery stenosis, in
   comparison with breath-hold CE-MRA as the reference standard.
   Material and Methods: Sixty-three patients (33 men, 30 women) with
   suspected renovascular hypertension (RVHT) were examined by a 1.5T MR
   scanner; NC-MRA with an electrocardiography (ECG)-gated SSFP sequence
   was performed in 58.7\% (37/63) of patients; in 41.3\% (26/63) of
   patients a respiratory trigger was used in addition to cardiac gating.
   CE-MRA, with a three-dimensional gradient echo (3D-GRE) T1-weighted
   sequence, was performed in all patients within the same session. Maximum
   intensity projection (MIP) image quality, number of renal arteries, and
   the presence of stenosis were assessed by two observers (independently
   for NC-MRA and together for CE-MRA). The agreement between NC-MRA and
   CE-MRA as well as the inter-observer reproducibility were calculated
   with Bland-Altman plots.
   Results: MIP image quality was considered better for NC-MRA. NC-MRA
   identified 143 of 144 (99.3\%) arteries detected by CE-MRA (an accessory
   artery was not identified). Fourteen stenoses were detected by CE-MRA
   (11 atherosclerotic, 3 dysplastic) with four of 14 (28.5\%) significant
   stenosis. Bland-Altman plot demonstrated an excellent concordance
   between NC-MRA and CE-MRA; particularly, the reader A evaluated
   correctly all investigated arteries, while over-estimation of two
   stenoses occurred for reader B. Regarding NC-MRA, inter-observer
   agreement was excellent.
   Conclusion: NC-MRA is a valid alternative to CE-MRA for the assessment
   of renal arteries.}},

Abstract = {{In this 21st century, examining how climate change is described and
   considered, largely through mass media, is as important as formal
   climate governance to the long-term success or failure of efforts to
   confront the challenge. Mass media stitch together formal science and
   policy with the public sphere. And many dynamic, contested factors
   contribute to how media outlets portray climate change. This paper
   addresses contemporary political economicsfrom greater workloads and
   reductions in specialist science journalism to digital innovations and
   new media organizational formsas they relate to media coverage of
   climate change. By way of recent studies and indications of these
   dynamics, we appraise how power flows through culture, politics, and
   society, to construct coverage, public discourses, and knowledge on
   climate change. In so doing, we explore how media representations of
   climate change have changed over time, and particularly how the rise of
   digital media has reshaped climate coverage. Considerations of climate
   change, arguably the most heavily politicized scientific issue at the
   turn of the new millennium, seek to inform and anticipate corollary
   science issues, such as ongoing concerns for genetically modified
   organisms, nanotechnology risks, and increased threats to water quantity
   and quality. The focus on political economythe sinews' of modern lifecan
   also then help to inform perceptions and decision making in associated
   environmental challenges. (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates innovation in how film producers use social
   digital tools to engage consumers, reduce demand uncertainty and respond
   to the challenge of digital disruption that affects the traditional film
   value chain. Through three empirical case studies of film production and
   exploitation, we examine examples of innovation in product, service,
   distribution, marketing and process, each having important implications
   at the organizational level. Our findings show that innovations in one
   area have important implications for other areas, distribution impacting
   on concepts of product and service, for example. We also show that
   internal firm micro-process dynamics impact directly on external
   interactions between the firm, consumers en masse and partner firms. Our
   research thus lies at the nexus of innovation, social media and
   uncertainty management, and questions the boundaries found in innovation
   types' or dominant taxonomies in traditional R\&D frames.}},

Abstract = {{Fetal MRI has an increasing list of indications and is most commonly
   employed when anomalies detected by prenatal ultrasonography require
   further characterization. This may occur when sonography is technically
   challenging or where specific MRI findings will determine pre- and
   postnatal management, including critical in utero and/or peripartum
   interventions. In these circumstances, there are high expectations for
   MRI to sort out complex diagnostic dilemmas through exquisite anatomical
   imaging that fetal surgeons and obstetricians can comprehend and relay
   to their patients. These expectations, in light of evolving clinical
   innovations, continue to drive advances in fetal imaging. Increasing
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is fundamental to improving MR image
   quality, and proper coil selection is a key component of this pursuit.
   Since the introduction of parallel imaging techniques, the numbers of
   elements in phased-array coils have been continuously increased to
   achieve high SNR and shorter scan times. With the invention of a digital
   coil platform, it is now possible to connect combinations of multiple
   coil elements to enhance SNR beyond the capabilities of the adult
   eight-channel torso-coil routinely used in fetal imaging. This paper
   describes the application of multi-element radiofrequency coils on a
   digital broadband imaging platform with unique coil combinations to
   perform dedicated fetal MRI.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines how young peoples' lived experiences with personal
   technologies can be used to teach engineering ethics in a way which
   facilitates greater engagement with the subject. Engineering ethics can
   be challenging to teach: as a form of practical ethics, it is framed
   around future workplace experience in a professional setting which
   students are assumed to have no prior experience of. Yet the current
   generations of engineering students, who have been described as `digital
   natives', do however have immersive personal experience with digital
   technologies; and experiential learning theory describes how students
   learn ethics more successfully when they can draw on personal experience
   which give context and meaning to abstract theories. This paper reviews
   current teaching practices in engineering ethics; and examines young
   people's engagement with technologies including cell phones, social
   networking sites, digital music and computer games to identify social
   and ethical elements of these practices which have relevance for the
   engineering ethics curricula. From this analysis three case studies are
   developed to illustrate how facets of the use of these technologies can
   be drawn on to teach topics including group work and communication; risk
   and safety; and engineering as social experimentation. Means for
   bridging personal experience and professional ethics when teaching these
   cases are discussed. The paper contributes to research and curriculum
   development in engineering ethics education, and to wider education
   research about methods of teaching `the net generation'.}},

Abstract = {{Developments within 3D digital modelling are often heralded as a much
   needed solution to problems of information loss and communication
   difficulties within the building industry. Despite the abundance of
   technical possibilities for innovation, however, there is currently no
   standardized, widely used digital model that solves these problems.
   Rather, actors in the building industry are assembling technological and
   other elements in various ways, trying to configure a stable innovation.
   This article sets out to describe the innovation communication involved
   in different emerging assemblages by focusing on the articulation of
   different expectations to their promises. We identify three different
   sets of expectations, namely visions related to building information
   modelling, Virtual Worlds and interactive simulation platforms. The aim
   of the paper is to demonstrate how visions are a crucial part of the
   communication about innovations in information and communication
   technology (ICT), and to contribute to an understanding of how different
   visions promise particular future configurations of workflows,
   communication processes, politics, economic models and social relations.
   Hereby, the paper adds to the literature on the relationship between
   ICTs and organizing, but with a distinct focus on innovation
   communication and distributed innovation processes taking place before
   ICTs are stabilized, issues which cannot be captured by studies of
   diffusion and adaptation of new ICTs within single organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Prior research on digital ecosystems focuses on the focal firm (e.g., a
   platform owner) and its ecosystem governance. However, there is a dearth
   of literature examining the non-focal actor, that is, an ecosystem
   participant who is at the periphery of a digital ecosystem. This paper
   proposes a theoretical perspective of the non-focal firm's participation
   across digital ecosystems for cultivating its innovation habitat through
   capability search and redeem. Capability search involves the location of
   external capability deemed valuable for extending the firm's innovation
   habitat. Capability redeem refers to the firm's use of external
   capability to develop, distribute, and/or monetize its products and
   services. We generate and sensitize the proposed perspective in the
   context of Sony Ericsson's innovation habitat by interpreting the mobile
   device manufacturer's participation across four digital ecosystems
   (Visual Basic, Java, Digital Music, and Android). Our findings suggest
   that the non-focal actor cannot rely on a single ecosystem for
   addressing all relevant layers of innovation. It benefits from pursuing
   a pluralistic strategy, operating across digital ecosystems to avoid
   investing all efforts in the same ecosystem. The model of ecosystem
   capability search and redeem, which is a result of ideographic research
   explanation, extends current perspectives on digital ecosystems and
   contributes to the emerging literature in the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the internal-frost damage due to
   ice-crystallization pressure in the concrete pore system. The
   methodology integrates thermodynamic analysis and a microdamage model as
   well as a unique time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensor. The
   crystallization pressure in the microscale pore system of concrete at
   subcooling temperatures was calculated based upon thermodynamic
   analysis. An extended finite-element method (XFEM) was applied to
   simulate the fracture development induced by internal frost, with the
   estimated internal crystallization pressure as the input. The XFEM
   fracture simulation was conducted on a digitized concrete sample
   obtained with imaging processing and ellipse-fitting techniques. The
   simulated crack development under the crystallization pressure was found
   to match the observed fracture patterns of the tested single-edge
   notched specimen. The XFEM simulation results were verified by the
   open-mode fracture behavior in both middle-notched single-edge notched
   beam bending test and freezing-damage tests. Furthermore, the
   crystallization-pressure analysis and freezing-damage simulation were
   conducted to demonstrate the freezing-damage process using cement
   samples with idealized pore structures. To provide direct estimation of
   the crystallization pressure, an innovative TDR tube sensor was
   developed to nondestructively monitor the extent of freezing in concrete
   specimens. The results show that this new sensor provides noninvasive
   measurement of freezing degree, which can be used to directly estimate
   the internal crystallization pressure for XFEM analyses. A volume-based
   damage criterion was also proposed based on the new TDR sensor. This
   work established a framework to integrate sensor and simulations to
   holistically predict the internal-frost damage process in concrete
   specimens.}},

Abstract = {{In organizations, the amount of attention that user-generated knowledge
   receives in knowledge management systems (KMSs) may not imply its
   potential for benefiting organizational activities in terms of
   accelerating innovation and product development. To optimize the
   utilization of knowledge in organizations, it is crucial to identify
   factors that influence knowledge popularity. From a network perspective,
   this study proposes a model to evaluate knowledge popularity by
   investigating 2 attributes of contextual information (i.e., authors and
   tags) that are embedded in a heterogeneous knowledge network, and how
   they interact to impact knowledge popularity. Objective data obtained
   through the interaction history of a KMS in a global telecommunication
   company was applied to test the hypotheses. This paper contributes to
   the extant literature on knowledge popularity by identifying contextual
   attributions of knowledge, and empirically tests the impact of their
   interactions on knowledge popularity.}},

Title = {{How behavioral science can advance digital health}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{271-276}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The field of behavioral science has produced myriad data on health
   behavior change strategies and leveraged such data into effective
   human-delivered interventions to improve health. Unfortunately, the
   impact of traditional health behavior change interventions has been
   heavily constrained by patient and provider burden, limited ability to
   measure and intervene upon behavior in real time, variable adherence,
   low rates of implementation, and poor third-party coverage. Digital
   health technologies, including mobile phones, sensors, and online social
   networks, by being available in real time, are being explored as tools
   to increase our understanding of health behavior and to enhance the
   impact of behavioral interventions. The recent explosion of industry
   attention to the development of novel health technologies is exciting
   but has far outpaced research. This Special Section of Translational
   Behavioral Medicine, Smartphones, Sensors, and Social Networks: A New
   Age of Health Behavior Change features a collection of studies that
   leverage health technologies to measure, change, and/or understand
   health behavior. We propose five key areas in which behavioral science
   can improve the impact of digital health technologies on public health.
   First, research is needed to identify which health technologies actually
   impact behavior and health outcomes. Second, we need to understand how
   online social networks can be leveraged to impact health behavior on a
   large scale. Third, a team science approach is needed in the
   developmental process of health technologies. Fourth, behavioral
   scientists should identify how a balance can be struck between the fast
   pace of innovation and the much slower pace of research. Fifth,
   behavioral scientists have an integral role in informing the development
   of health technologies and facilitating the movement of health
   technologies into the healthcare system.}},

Abstract = {{Following the belief that diversity breeds innovation in scientific
   endeavors, there is a national push for more diversity in the science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce in order to
   maintain national economic competitiveness. Currently, STEM-related
   employment is only 28\% non-White; however, greater efforts to recruit
   and retain underrepresented minorities should increase this figure.
   Amidst the attention given to supporting ``leaky pipelines,{''} less
   emphasis has been placed on mitigating challenges associated with
   bringing diverse cultures together. This article presents a framework
   for supporting underrepresented minorities in building STEM-relevant
   skills and enhancing their ability to collaborate with peers different

Abstract = {{Collaboration (GDMC), an informal education program in 3D computer
   modeling and 2D interactive game design serving primarily African
   American youth aged 7 to 19 years in the Washington, D.C. metro area,
   transformed from a program designed and taught by adults to one designed
   and taught by youth. In Year 1, 8\% of youth participants held a
   leadership role; by Year 4, 30\% of youth participants did. Moreover,
   the nature of these roles transformed, with youth increasingly taking on
   responsibilities formerly held by adults. In this qualitative study, the
   authors describe and seek to understand this role shifting. Through the
   extensive collection and analysis of field observations over 4 years,
   the authors describe qualitative shifts in the agency involved in these
   roles-moving from a conception of youth as student to assistant to youth
   as designer and implementer of instruction. The authors analyze changes
   in youth agency that accompanied their implementation of the studio
   mentorship model where classrooms were transformed from traditional
   teacher-led classes to studios with a 1:3 ratio of peer mentors to
   students. The authors describe how, following this shift, youth
   initiated new instructional roles leading to the creation of a
   mentor-instructor pipeline. The authors pose the GDMC program as an
   example to discuss how culturally relevant computing practice emerges
   from a programmatic goal of viewing youth as assets and actively seeking
   ways to support youth's initiatives and agency in digital technology
   education. The authors argue for the value of this asset building in
   technology education as a way to encourage youth from traditionally
   underserved groups to become technology leaders and innovators.}},

Abstract = {{Information systems as an artefact-oriented discipline require a strong
   interaction between researchers, developers and users regarding design
   of, development of, and the study of the use of digital artefacts in
   social settings. During recent years, performing research in a design
   science research spirit has gained increasing interest. In larger scale
   design research endeavours, access to systems development capabilities
   becomes necessary. Such a unit, InnovationLab, was established in 2006
   in a university setting in Sweden. In this paper we are investigating
   the 5 years' experience of running this InnovationLab. Our findings
   point to an innovation lab being valuable for research in general and
   especially for design science research. However, in order to balance the
   business of an innovation lab, it will be necessary to provide services
   for other stakeholders (such as administrative units, teachers, and
   students) as a means for developing systems development capability aimed
   at supporting researchers.}},

Abstract = {{The organization of information production is undergoing a deep
   transformation. Alongside corporations, which have been for long time
   the predominant institutions of information production, new
   organizational forms have emerged, e.g. free software communities,
   open-content on-line wikis, and collective blogs. The paper investigates
   the factors that favoured the emergence of these alternative systems,
   called peer production. Different from the previous literature, the
   paper considers technology as an endogenous variable in the process of
   organizational design. On this basis, the paper argues that the
   diffusion of digital technology is a necessary but not sufficient
   condition to explain the emergence of peer production. A similarly
   important role has been played by the set of ethics that motivated the
   early adherents to the free software movement. Such an ethics indeed
   operated as a `cultural subsidy' that helped to overcome the
   complementarities existing among distinct institutional domains, and let
   a new organizational species to emerge.}},

Abstract = {{Case-based learning is ascribed high potential with respect to the
   education of pre-service teachers as well as the further education of
   experienced in-service teachers, as it can provide opportunities for the
   application of professional knowledge to authentic classroom situations.
   In addition to the application and acquisition of knowledge, the aspect
   of knowledge convergence (i.e., increasing similarity of collaborative
   learners with respect to their knowledge) should be taken into account
   when homogeneous benefits are desired for all participants of a
   case-based training. A field study with 29 pre-service teachers and 24
   in-service teachers from adult education was conducted to examine
   effects of different levels of teaching experience on knowledge
   application, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge convergence in a
   computer-supported collaborative case-based learning environment. An
   innovative approach to measuring knowledge convergence was introduced,
   using the positions of annotations (i.e., flags placed on the timeline
   of the case video) made by learners during their case analyses as an
   indicator of their shared focus of attention. This measure was found to
   positively correlate with the application and acquisition of
   professional knowledge. Teaching experience affected both processes and
   outcomes of case-based learning, suggesting different means of
   instructional support for pre-service and in-service teachers. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Most of the service innovation in e-government initiatives has been
   initially focused on making a digital version of an equivalent physical
   service, followed by creating new services through either adopting new
   business models or overhauling existing infrastructures. The former
   approach uses variants of e-commerce business models to drive service
   innovation whereas the latter entails changes to the backend for driving
   system efficiency and integration, which later serve for reorganising
   and improving service provision. Each approach presents a different way
   of assembling services, infrastructures, people and business models. The
   ramifications of each assemblage to service innovation are less
   understood. This paper seeks to examine the intended and unintended
   consequences of these two contrasting approaches inductively and
   deductively. Our findings show that a frontend approach enables quick
   improvements and enacts a variety of structures, with each structure
   inscribing a set of new path-dependent routines in the infrastructures.
   In the backend approach it took longer to introduce new services. Yet
   the services were of a higher quality and required less modification in
   the long run. Quantitative analyses confirmed these findings. We
   attributed the alignment advantage of backend approach to better
   interdepartmental collaboration organised around a technology platform
   for system and service integration, concentrating resources on a
   coherent rather than a diverse set of business models. This approach
   realigns practices and routines and technology internally, whereas the
   explorative, diverse use of business models in the frontend approach for
   service innovation is less sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{Visual information plays an important role in almost all areas of our
   life. Today, much of this information is represented and processed
   digitally. Digital image processing is any form of signal processing for
   which the input is an image, such as a photograph or video frame; the
   output of image processing may be either an image or a set of
   characteristics or parameters related to the image. In this context,
   implementation and evaluation of image processing algorithms are complex
   tasks that require highly technical and multidisciplinary skills.
   Graduate students are required to develop both practical and theoretical
   exercises to understand how an algorithm works; however, they have to
   learn in an individual manner without adequate support. This article
   presents an innovative Project-Based Learning approach to teach image
   processing algorithms using an FPGA-based tool as the main support.
   Thus, instead of learning heavy programming tasks and mathematical
   functions, students are led step by step through five phases and then
   allowed to experiment with different algorithms. This article evaluates
   the proposed tool and shows results with diverse algorithms. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{In the past few decades, Poland has seen a growing number of attempts to
   reclaim its Jewish past through traditional forms such as
   historiographic revision, heritage preservation, and monument building.
   But a unique new mode of artistic, performative, often participatory
   memory work has been emerging alongside these conventional forms,
   growing in its prevalence and increasingly catching the public eye. This
   new genre of memorial intervention is characterized by its fast-moving,
   youthful, innovative forms and nontraditional venues and its socially
   appealing, dialogic, and digitally networked character as opposed to a
   prior generation of top-down, slow moving, ethnically segregated,
   mono-vocal styles. It also responds to the harsh historical realities
   brought to light by scholars of the Jewish-Polish past with a mandate
   for healing. This article maps the landscape of this new genre of
   commemoration projects, identifying their core features and
   investigating their anatomy via three case studies: Rafa Betlejewski's I
   Miss You Jew!; Public Movement's Spring in Warsaw; and Yael Bartana's
   Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland. Analyzing their temporalities,
   scopes, modalities and ambiences, as well as the new visions for mutual
   identification and affiliation that they offer Poles and Jews, we
   approach these performances not as representations, but rather as
   embodied experiences that stage and invite participation in repertoires
   of cultural memory. Different from simple reenactments, this new
   approach may be thought of as a subjunctive politics of historya what if
   proposition that plays with reimagining and recombining a range of

Abstract = {{As technology continues to advance and new products emerge, the
   interactions between buyers and suppliers have changed. The management
   of buyer-supplier relationships has increasingly become more dependent
   on new technologies, such as Partner Relationship Management (PRM)
   systems and computer-mediated communications (CMC). Furthermore, when
   new technologies emerge, suppliers are expected to educate their buyers
   about the benefits of the technology, train them on how to use it, and
   aid with the integration of the technology into pre-existing work
   processes. Given these issues, this special issue of Industrial
   Marketing Management explores the changing nature of buyer-supplier
   relationships in the Digital Era. This article presents a snapshot of
   the changes in buyer-supplier relationships brought on by new
   technology, provides an overview of the selected articles in this
   special issue, and offers a few directions for future research. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This article analyses a war memorial established on a website by
   Eritreans in diaspora as an example of how diasporas are transforming
   the ways national politics are conducted and understood. Establishing a
   war memorial is normally the prerogative and responsibility of the
   state. In performing this task the Eritrean diaspora makes visible the
   failure of the state to make public important national information and
   to hold itself accountable to the Eritrean people. The establishment of
   the memorial online by the diaspora, furthermore, works to de-centre the
   state, symbolically at least, as the embodiment of the nation and
   creates an opening for alternative visions of the nation and
   state-citizen relations. The Internet is making possible innovative
   forms of diaspora political engagement and activism that challenge
   conventional relations of citizenship and sovereignty.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of wind energy generation particular interest has been
   focused in recent years on distributed generation through small
   wind-turbines (power unit <200 kW) because of their limited size and
   lower environmental impact. The field of small generation was dominated
   by the use of asynchronous generators directly connected to the grid,
   while recently permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) with power
   converter, either partially or fully controlled, became popular. This
   paper reviews the control issues related to these small wind-turbine
   systems: generator torque control, speed/position estimation, pitch
   control, braking chopper control, dc/dc converter control, and grid
   converter control. Specific issues for small wind-turbines arise in the
   wind energy extraction optimization and limitation and in the innovative
   concept of ``universal{''} wind-turbine operation, that leads these
   system to operate grid-connected, standalone or in load supporting mode.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of digit-bearing tetrapods in the Middle to Late Devonian
   (ca. 393-360 Mya) and their subsequent invasion of land represent a
   classic case of a major evolutionary radiation driven by new ecological
   opportunities. In this and other examples, exploration of new eco-space
   is hypothesized to correlate with functional innovation and adaptive
   divergence of phenotypes. Simultaneous changes in all morphofunctional
   systems are rare in major evolutionary transitions and may be
   non-existent. Here, we focus on the mandibles of early tetrapods and
   their kin as a model system to test whether shifts in functional
   innovation were coeval with some major events in tetrapod history. To
   this end, we quantified mechanical variation in the mandibles of
   tetrapodomorphs ranging in age from Early Devonian to earliest Permian.
   Biomechanical disparity is stable from the Devonian to the Early
   Pennsylvanian, even though the origin of weight-bearing, digited limbs,
   and the initial phases of the colonization of land occurred during this
   interval. An appreciable increase in functional variation is detected in
   the latest Pennsylvanian and earliest Permian, when stem and crown
   amniotes began to explore new regions of mechanical morphospace, a
   pattern partly attributable to the origin of herbivory. We find no
   difference in the rate of functional change between tetrapodomorph
   ``fish{''} and early digited tetrapods, although two independent shifts
   are detected among Devonian stem tetrapods more crownward than
   Acanthostega. Instead, the most profound shifts in evolutionary rate are
   nested well within the tetrapod crown and are associated with amniotes
   (particularly diadectomorphs and some synapsids). The substantial
   temporal gap between the origin of postcranial features associated with
   terrestriality, such as limbs with functional elbow/knee and wrist/ankle
   joints capable of weight-bearing, and the onset of divergence in jaw
   biomechanics provides a compelling example of ``functional
   modularity{''} during a major adaptive radiation.}},

Abstract = {{The fossil record is paleontology's great resource, telling us virtually
   everything we know about the past history of life. This record, which
   has been accumulating since the beginning of paleontology as a
   professional discipline in the early nineteenth century, is a collection
   of objects. The fossil record exists literally, in the specimen drawers
   where fossils are kept, and figuratively, in the illustrations and
   records of fossils compiled in paleontological atlases and compendia.
   However, as has become increasingly clear since the later twentieth
   century, the fossil record is also a record of data. Paleontologists now
   routinely abstract information from the physical fossil record to
   construct databases that serve as the basis for quantitative analysis of
   patterns in the history of life. What is the significance of this
   distinction? While it is often assumed that the orientation towards
   treating the fossil record as a record of data is an innovation of the
   computer age, it turns out that nineteenth century paleontology was
   substantially ``data driven.{''} This paper traces the evolution of data
   practices and analyses in paleontology, primarily through examination of
   the compendia in which the fossil record has been recorded over the past
   200 years. I argue that the transition towards conceptualizing the
   fossil record as a record of data began long before the emergence of the
   technologies associated with modern databases (such as digital computers
   and modern statistical methods). I will also argue that this history
   reveals how new forms of visual representation were associated with the
   transition from seeing the fossil record as a record of objects to one
   of data or information, which allowed paleontologists to make new visual
   arguments about their data. While these practices and techniques have
   become increasingly sophisticated in recent decades, I will show that
   their basic methodology was in place over a century ago, and that, in a
   sense, paleontology has always been a ``data driven{''} science.}},

Abstract = {{As a society we have to re-imagine our health and social care models to
   meet the challenge of an ageing population with greater levels of
   chronic disease. The digital revolution offers us the potential to
   leverage technological innovations to develop proactive `connected'
   health and social care models that are built around the patient's needs
   to facilitate efficient management of wellness and health throughout
   their lifespan. However, efforts to utilize technological innovations
   for this purpose have not been universally successful to date,
   indicating that technology itself is only part of the solution. To
   achieve a truly connected, technology enabled, health and social care
   model we need to overcome some key challenges; first, we need to
   optimize the process of sensing data from end users in the home and
   community such that monitoring protocols are built around the person and
   designed with respect to their needs to provide for accurate and
   reliable harvesting of target data. We then need to gather and mine
   large datasets from the home and community to analyse the complex
   relationships between home and community acquired data and health
   status. Only then can we begin to design, implement and evaluate new
   models of care that leverage technology platforms. In meeting this
   challenge we can leverage technology to transform the way in which we
   promote and manage wellness and health throughout the lifespan.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we use data from a survey of 151 French record companies
   to test the ``long-tail{''} hypothesis at the level of the firm. More
   specifically, we test whether, following the ``selling less of more{''}
   principle coined by Anderson (2006), record companies that have adapted
   to digitization (at various levels: artists' scouting, distribution, and
   promotion) release more new albums without having higher overall sales.
   We construct a production function in which the output is produced from
   conventional inputs of labor and capital, as well as inputs that are
   more specific to the recorded music industry. We consider two types of
   output: a commercial output (albums sales) and a creative output (number
   of new albums released). We show that labels that have adapted to
   digitization are more efficient in respect of creative output, but that
   there is no effect of adaptation to digitization on the commercial
   output, which is consistent with the predictions of the long-tail
   hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{A new method to detect and reduce the impulse noise in color images is
   presented in this paper. The method consists of two stages: detection
   and filtering. Since each of the individual channels (components) of the
   color image can be considered as a monochrome image, both stages are
   applied to each channel separately, and then the individual results are
   combined into one output image. The corrupted pixels are detected in the
   first stage based on a proposed innovative switching technique. The
   noise-free pixels are copied to their corresponding locations in the
   output image. In the second stage, average filtering is applied only to
   those pixels which are determined to be noisy in the first stage, and
   only noise-free pixel values are involved in calculating this average.
   The size of the sliding window depends on the estimated noise density
   and is very small even for high noise densities. The proposed method is
   effective in noise reduction while preserving edge details and color
   chromaticity. Simulation results show that the proposed method
   outperforms all the tested existing state-of-the-art methods used in
   digital color image restoration in both standard objective measurements
   and perceived image quality.}},

Abstract = {{TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements) is an
   innovative formation-flying radar mission that opens a new era in
   spaceborne radar remote sensing. The primary objective is the
   acquisition of a global digital elevation model (DEM) with unprecedented
   accuracy (12 m horizontal resolution and 2 m relative height accuracy).
   This goal is achieved by extending the TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) mission by a second, TerraSAR-X like satellite (TDX) flying
   in close formation with TerraSAR-X (TSX). Both satellites form together
   a large single-pass SAR interferometer with the opportunity for flexible
   baseline selection. This enables the acquisition of highly accurate
   cross-track interferograms without the inherent accuracy limitations
   imposed by repeat-pass interferometry due to temporal decorrelation and
   atmospheric disturbances. Besides the primary goal of the mission,
   several secondary mission objectives based on along-track interferometry
   as well as new bistatic and multistatic SAR techniques have been
   defined, representing an important and innovative asset of the TanDEM-X
   mission. TanDEM-X is implemented in the framework of a public private
   partnership between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and EADS Astrium
   GmbH. The TanDEM-X satellite was successfully launched in June 2010 and
   the mission started its operational data acquisition in December 2010.
   This paper provides an overview of the TanDEM-X mission and summarizes
   its actual status and performance. Furthermore, results from several
   scientific radar experiments are presented that show the great potential
   of future formation-flying interferometric SAR missions to serve novel
   remote sensing applications. (c) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Digital political participation is an emerging phenomenon that has
   attracted the attention of a great number of researchers. In most cases,
   digital political participation (DPP) has been treated as an independent
   variable in order to attempt to understand other phenomena such as, for
   instance, changes in offline political participation. However, empirical
   studies have failed to demonstrate this relationship. In this article,
   we try to revert this approach, as we attempt to analyse to what extent
   citizens' political activism can help us explain DPP in Spain. Through a
   factorial analysis, we organize into dimensions the different types of
   offline political practices and we use these dimensions as independent
   variables in a regression model where DPP is the dependent variable. The
   results obtained serve as a basis for discussing the politically
   innovative nature of DPP.}},

Abstract = {{The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Owner/Operator (AECO)
   industry is constantly searching for new methods for increasing
   efficiency and productivity. Facility Managers (FMs), as a part of the
   owner/operator role, work in complex and dynamic environments where
   critical decisions are constantly made. This decision-making process and
   its consequent performance can be improved by enhancing Situation
   Awareness (SA) of the FMs through new digital technologies. In this
   paper, InfoSPOT (Information Surveyed Point for Observation and
   Tracking), is recommended to FMs as a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) tool
   for accessing information about the facilities they maintain. AR has
   been considered as a viable option to reduce inefficiencies of data
   overload by providing FMs with a SA-based tool for visualizing their
   ``real-world{''} environment with added interactive data. A prototype of
   the AR application was developed and a user participation experiment and
   analysis conducted to evaluate the features of InfoSPOT. This innovative
   application of AR has the potential to improve construction practices,
   and in this case, facility management. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The OMEGA microelectronics group has designed a new generation of
   multichannel integrated circuits, the ``ROC{''} family, in
   AustrianMicroSystem (AMS) SiGe 0.35 mu m technology to read out signals
   from various families of photodetectors. The chip named MAROC (standing
   for Multi Anode ReadOut Chip) has been designed to read out MultiAnode
   Photomultipliers (MAPMT), Photomultiplier ARray In SiGe ReadOut Chip
   (PARISROC) to read out Photomultipliers (PMTs) and SiPM Integrated
   ReadOut Chip (SPIROC) to readout Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM)
   detectors and which was the first ASIC to do so.
   The three of them fulfill the stringent requirements of the future
   photodetectors, in particular in terms of low noise, radiation hardness,
   large dynamic range, high density and high speed while keeping low power
   thanks to the SiGe technology.
   These multi-channel ASICs are real System on Chip (SoC) as they provide
   charge, time and photon-counting information which are digitized
   internally. Their complexity and versatility enable innovative frontier
   detectors and also cover spin off of these detectors in adjacent fields
   such as medical or material imaging as well as smart detectors.
   In this presentation, the three ASIC architectures and test results will
   be described to give a general panorama of the ``ROC{''} chips. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper we seek to show how marketing activities inscribe value on
   business model innovation, representative of an act, or sequence of
   socially interconnecting acts. Theoretically we ask two interlinked
   questions: (1) how can value inscriptions contribute to business model
   innovations? (2) how can marketing activities support the inscription of
   value on business model innovations? Semi-structured in-depth interviews
   were conducted with the thirty-seven members from across four industrial
   projects commercializing disruptive digital innovations. Various
   individuals from a diverse range of firms are shown to cast relevant
   components of their agency and knowledge on business model innovations
   through negotiation as an ongoing social process. Value inscription is
   mutually constituted from the marketing activities, interactions and
   negotiations of multiple project members across firms and functions to
   counter destabilizing forces and tensions arising from the
   commercialization of disruptive digital innovations. This contributes to
   recent conceptual thinking in the industrial marketing literature, which
   views business models as situated within dynamic business networks and a
   context-led evolutionary process. A contribution is also made to debate
   in the marketing literature around marketing's boundary-spanning role,
   with marketing activities shown to span and navigate across functions
   and firms in supporting value inscriptions on business model
   innovations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The threat of a global pandemic posed by outbreaks of
   influenza H5N1 (1997) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS,
   2002), both diseases of zoonotic origin, provoked interest in improving
   early warning systems and reinforced the need for combining data from
   different sources. It led to the use of search query data from search
   engines such as Google and Yahoo! as an indicator of when and where
   influenza was occurring. This methodology has subsequently been extended
   to other diseases and has led to experimentation with new types of
   social media for disease surveillance.
   Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to formally assess
   the current state of knowledge regarding the use of search queries and
   social media for disease surveillance in order to inform future work on
   early detection and more effective mitigation of the effects of
   foodborne illness.
   Methods: Structured scoping review methods were used to identify,
   characterize, and evaluate all published primary research, expert
   review, and commentary articles regarding the use of social media in
   surveillance of infectious diseases from 2002-2011.
   Results: Thirty-two primary research articles and 19 reviews and case
   studies were identified as relevant. Most relevant citations were
   peer-reviewed journal articles (29/32, 91\%) published in 2010-11
   (28/32, 88\%) and reported use of a Google program for surveillance of
   influenza. Only four primary research articles investigated social media
   in the context of foodborne disease or gastroenteritis. Most authors
   (21/32 articles, 66\%) reported that social media-based surveillance had
   comparable performance when compared to an existing surveillance
   program. The most commonly reported strengths of social media
   surveillance programs included their effectiveness (21/32, 66\%) and
   rapid detection of disease (21/32, 66\%). The most commonly reported
   weaknesses were the potential for false positive (16/32, 50\%) and false
   negative (11/32, 34\%) results. Most authors (24/32, 75\%) recommended
   that social media programs should primarily be used to support existing
   surveillance programs.
   Conclusions: The use of search queries and social media for disease
   surveillance are relatively recent phenomena (first reported in 2006).
   Both the tools themselves and the methodologies for exploiting them are
   evolving over time. While their accuracy, speed, and cost compare
   favorably with existing surveillance systems, the primary challenge is
   to refine the data signal by reducing surrounding noise. Further
   developments in digital disease surveillance have the potential to
   improve sensitivity and specificity, passively through advances in
   machine learning and actively through engagement of users. Adoption,
   even as supporting systems for existing surveillance, will entail a high
   level of familiarity with the tools and collaboration across
   jurisdictions.}},

Abstract = {{Pyroclastic density current deposits remobilized by water during periods
   of heavy rainfall trigger lahars (volcanic mudflows) that affect
   inhabited areas at considerable distance from volcanoes, even years
   after an eruption. Here we present an innovative approach to detect and
   estimate the thickness and volume of pyroclastic density current (PDC)
   deposits as well as erosional versus depositional environments. We use
   SAR interferometry to compare an airborne digital surface model (DSM)
   acquired in 2004 to a post eruption 2010 DSM created using COSMO-SkyMed
   satellite data to estimate the volume of 2010 Merapi eruption PDC
   deposits along the Gendol river (Kali Gendol, KG). Results show PDC
   thicknesses of up to 75 m in canyons and a volume of about 40 x 10(6)
   m(3), mainly along KG, and at distances of up to 16 km from the volcano
   summit. This volume estimate corresponds mainly to the 2010 pyroclastic
   deposits along the KG - material that is potentially available to
   produce lahars. Our volume estimate is approximately twice that
   estimated by field studies, a difference we consider acceptable given
   the uncertainties involved in both satellite- and field-based methods.
   Our technique can be used to rapidly evaluate volumes of PDC deposits at
   active volcanoes, in remote settings and where continuous activity may
   prevent field observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Transactive memory systems as a collective filter for mitigating

Journal = {{INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{177-197}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing processing power and plummeting costs of information
   and communication technologies, the ability of employees to ubiquitously
   access and disseminate information grows. However, emerging research
   shows that individuals are struggling to process information as fast as
   it arrives. The problem of information overload is a significant one for
   contemporary knowledge-intensive organizations because it can adversely
   affect productivity, decision making, and employee morale. To combat
   this problem, organizations often invest in technical solutions such as
   business intelligence software or semantic technologies. While such
   technical approaches can certainly aid in reducing information overload,
   less attention has been directed at understanding how collective
   behavior, and in particular transactive memory systems, might enhance
   the ability of organizations to cope with information overload. In this
   stud, we ask whether (and, if so, how do) transactive memory systems act
   as a collective filter to enable organizational groups to mitigate the
   potential for information overload. We used social network analysis and
   interview evidence from the R\&D departments of two high-technology
   firms in the life science industry and found that individuals
   spontaneously organized without any centralized control to create a
   collective filter. For example, we found that one set of individuals
   specialized in filtering external information into the group while
   another set specialized in filtering that information for internal use.
   We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of
   our findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new approach to investigate the content and spatial
   distribution of dust in structurally unresolved star-forming galaxies
   from the observed dependence of integrated spectral properties on galaxy
   inclination. Motivated by the observation that different stellar
   populations reside in different spatial components of nearby
   star-forming galaxies, we develop an innovative combination of generic
   models of radiative transfer in dusty media with a prescription for the
   spectral evolution of galaxies, via the association of different
   geometric components of galaxies with stars in different age ranges. We
   start by showing that a wide range of radiative transfer models all
   predict a quasi-universal relation between slope of the attenuation
   curve at any wavelength, from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and
   V-band attenuation optical depth in the diffuse interstellar medium (
   ISM), at all galaxy inclinations. This relation predicts steeper (
   shallower) dust attenuation curves than both the Calzetti and Milky Way
   curves at small ( large) attenuation optical depths, which implies that
   geometry and orientation effects have a stronger influence on the shape
   of the attenuation curve than changes in the optical properties of dust
   grains. We use our new, combined radiative transfer and spectral
   evolution model to interpret the observed dependence of the H alpha/ H
   beta ratio and ugrizYJH attenuation curve on inclination in a sample of
   about 23 000 nearby star-forming galaxies, which we correct for
   systematic biases by developing a general method based on importance
   sampling. From the exploration of the model parameter space by means of
   a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we measure the central
   face-on B-band optical depth of this sample to be tau B perpendicular to
   approximate to 1.8 +/- 0.2 ( corresponding to an angle-averaged \{tau
   (ISM) (V) \}(theta)approximate to 0.3). We also quantify the enhanced
   optical depth towards newly formed stars in their birth clouds, finding
   this to be significantly larger in galaxies with bulges than in
   discdominated galaxies, while tau (B perpendicular to) is roughly
   similar in both cases. This can arise if, for example, galaxies with
   significant bulges have higher central star formation efficiencies than
   their discdominated counterparts at a fixed specific star formation
   rate, and dustier stellar birth clouds because of the higher
   metallicity. We find that over 80 per cent of the attenuation in
   galaxies in our sample is characteristic of that affecting thin-disc
   stars in radiative transfer models. The median unattenuated V-band
   luminosity ratio of thick-disc to thin-disc stars is 0.1-0.2, in good
   agreement with the results from spatially resolved studies of nearby
   edge-on disc galaxies. Finally, we show that neglecting the effect of
   geometry and orientation on attenuation can severely bias the
   interpretation of galaxy spectral energy distributions, as the impact on
   broadband colours can reach up to 0.3-0.4 mag at optical wavelengths and
   0.1 mag at near-infrared ones. This paper also contains an original
   application of Gaussian random processes to extend the wavelength range
   of dust attenuation curves.}},

Abstract = {{For lesser toe deformities, fusion of the proximal interphalangeal joint
   offers good long-term correction and predictability. Digital arthrodesis
   has been described for longer than 100 years in the literature, and
   current techniques closely resemble those described in early accounts.
   However, many implants currently being used take advantage of the latest
   metallurgic and polymeric innovations, with implants being composed of
   nitinol, polylactic or polyglycolic acids, and polydioxanone. Newer
   implants offer easy insertion and good stability, with no percutaneous
   wires. Pin-tract infection rates from exposed Kirschner wires may be as
   high as 18\%, and newer implants help to mitigate this problem.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative inertial vibration sensor based on moire fringe, which was
   generated by the relative movement of a pair of parallel gratings, is
   presented. One of the gratings was mounted on an inertial mass which was
   a part of the spring-mass-damping system, whereas the other was fixed to
   the sensor shell. The relationship between the moire fringe and the
   vibration state of the measur and was discussed in detail. By using the
   signal processing system board, together with a unique algorithm of
   subdivision and direction recognition, the moire fringes were converted
   into the direction and amplitude of the relative displacement with high
   resolution. The maximum amplitude of the relative displacement
   measurement is 2.5 mm with maximum error of 0.056 mu m and the
   measurement resolution can reach to 0.028 mu m. Furthermore, a
   temperature compensation circuit was also designed and tested, which
   indicates temperature immunity when taking photoelectric conversion into
   account. Finally, a digital compensatory filter for broadening the
   dynamic bandwidth with flat frequency response was developed to meet the
   demand in vibration measurement in the low frequency range. As a result,
   a linear response over a broad frequency range from 0.1 to 1000 Hz was
   realized. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{There is an increased requirement in the automotive, food and medical
   equipment industries to weld heat-sensitive materials, such as thin
   sheets, coated thin plates, stainless steel, aluminium and mixed joints.
   Nevertheless, relevant innovations in arc welding are not widely known
   and seldom used to their maximum potential. In the area of gas metal arc
   welding welding processes, digitalisation has allowed integration of
   software into the power source, wire feeder and gas regulation. This
   paper reviews developments in the arc welding process, particularly the
   effect of the set-up of the welding process parameters on waveform
   deposition. It is found that good weldability, good mechanical joint
   properties and acceptable process efficiency can be obtained for thin
   sheets through advanced power source regulation, especially over short
   circuiting, controlled polarity and electrode wire motion. The findings
   presented in this paper are valuable for waveform and deposition
   prediction. The need is furthermore noted for an algorithm that
   integrates gas flow parameters and wire motion control, as well as a
   variable sensor on the tip of the electrode, permitting flexibility of
   control of the current and the voltage waveform.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes how some innovative methodologies have been
   designed and employed to support the restoration of the Madonna of
   Pietranico, a terracotta statue severely damaged in the 2009 earthquake.
   The statue, fragmented in many pieces, has undergone a complex
   restoration performed by a multidisciplinary working group. The
   contribution of digital technologies was planned from the very
   beginning, since the complexity of this restoration originated the
   design of innovative procedures for managing the reassembly and
   restoration process. The Madonna test bed was therefore an example of
   how technology innovation could be pushed by clear application needs. A
   first important contribution was the study of the recombination
   hypothesis of the fragments. This initial phase was performed on
   digitized 3D models of the statue fragments, with the aim of reducing
   fragments manipulation, preventing further damages and increasing the
   capabilities to rehearse and evaluate different reassembly options. The
   accuracy of the 3D scanned models and the new recombination procedure
   introduced in this paper allowed to manage this phase in the digital
   domain with successful results. The digital 3D models were also used to
   design and produce an innovative supporting structure, constructed with
   a rapid prototyping device. Another important contribution concerned the
   study and virtual restoration of the polychrome decoration of the
   statue; our aim was to reproduce and restore in the virtual 3D domain
   the very complex original polychrome decoration, on the base of the
   remaining traces. Consequently, new virtual painting functionalities
   have been designed on the MeshLab platform (an open-source tool for 3D
   models visualization and manipulation) for reproducing pictorial
   decorations over digital 3D models and have been assessed on this
   specific test bed. This allowed us also to investigate the complexity of
   the virtual repainting process and to identify further technology
   enhancements. Finally, computer graphics technologies have been also
   used to produce a video that tells the story of the restoration. (C)

Abstract = {{A growing number of online journals and academic platforms are adopting
   light peer review or `publish then filter' models of scholarly
   communication. These approaches have the advantage of enabling instant
   exchanges of knowledge between academics and are part of a wider search
   for alternatives to traditional peer review and certification processes
   in scholarly publishing. However, establishing credibility and
   identifying the correct balance between communication and scholarly
   rigour remains an important challenge for digital communication
   platforms targeting academic communities. This paper looks at a highly
   influential, government-backed, open publishing platform in China:
   Science Paper Online, which is using transparent post-publication
   peer-review processes to encourage innovation and address systemic
   problems in China's traditional academic publishing system. There can be
   little doubt that the Chinese academic publishing landscape differs in
   important ways from counterparts in the United States and Western
   Europe. However, this article suggests that developments in China also
   provide important lessons about the potential of digital technology and
   government policy to facilitate a large-scale shift towards more open
   and networked models of scholarly communication. (c) Xiang Ren 2013}},

Abstract = {{Technology substitution and innovation adoption are considered within
   the framework of evolutionary economy. The evolution hierarchical
   concepts of change, order, direction, progress and perfectibility are
   invoked to describe technological substitutions as processes that point
   towards the direction the economic system moves into, its rate of change
   giving the speed of change. Knowledge evolution and its appropriation
   into technological innovation are key ingredients in enhancing
   competition among technologies struggling towards capturing the other's
   market shares. We accordingly mathematically translate these
   evolutionary views into practice using Lotka-Volterra prey-predator
   model for competition and single logistic growth for the market
   evolution of the competing innovation. Using this formulation we studied
   the technological substitution of analog by digital imaging process and
   demonstrate how the later has disruptively displaced the former.
   Considering its vital importance to managing market strategies towards
   innovation products adoption, we redefine the takeoff time with a more
   realistic accounting of the innovation product adoption by consumers
   that is easily computed from its launching phase sales data. Our takeoff
   time is found to occur earlier than the one usually adopted. The new
   formulation is successfully tested against the consolidated innovation
   adoption of two economically impacting technological innovations:
   digital cameras and mobile phones. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   The car black box is also combined multiple-user with real-time
   navigation information system. The system is integrated the independent
   real-time traffic information database and Geographical Information
   System (GIS) through data fusion method. We adopted a traffic
   information system offering advanced personalized route planning,
   including added services for traffic jam alerting by means of Short
   Message Service (SMS) in Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication
   network. It is shown small and low-cost GSM modules for data process by
   using the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), Ant colony optimization
   (ACO) algorithm, which developed a real-time software solution to help
   users and evaluation of user preferences for car traffic information
   system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a flexible and portable digital framework for
   Built-in Self-Test (BIST) and calibration of RF/analog circuitry. Novel
   to the proposed testing framework, is a reusable, flexible, drop-in IP
   core, composed of a centralized custom processing engine with data path,
   memory architecture and instruction set optimized for efficient
   execution of compute intensive test and calibration algorithms. The
   innovative BIST engine is complemented with a calibration and test
   sequencing methodology exploiting the embedded test hardware, to
   dynamically correct for transceiver imbalances and non-idealities, as
   well as to estimate performance parameters such as Error Vector
   Magnitude (EVM). The engine has been integrated with a WiFi transceiver
   in a 32 nm SoC test chip to demonstrate the functionality of this
   framework. This implementation covers an area of 0.63 mm(2) and provides
   similar performance (e.g., improvements up to 10 dB in EVM for Rx IQ
   imbalance compensation) to off-chip testing without relying on expensive
   equipment.}},

Title = {{Development of a 3-D urbanization index using digital terrain models for
   surface urban heat island effects}},
Journal = {{ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{1-11}},

Abstract = {{This study assesses surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects during heat
   waves in subtropical areas. Two cities in northern Taiwan, Taipei
   metropolis and its adjacent medium-sized city, Yilan, were selected for
   this empirical study. Daytime and night time surface temperature and
   SUHI intensity of both cities in five heat wave cases were obtained from
   MODIS Land-Surface Temperature (LST) and compared. In order to assess
   SUHI in finer spatial scale, an innovated three-dimensional Urbanization
   Index (3DUI) with a 5-m spatial resolution was developed to quantify
   urbanization from a 3-D perspective using Digital Terrain Models (DTMs).
   The correlation between 3DUI and surface temperatures were also
   assessed. The results obtained showed that the highest SUHI intensity in
   daytime was 10.2 degrees C in Taipei and 7.5 degrees C in Yilan. The
   SUHI intensity was also higher than that in non-heat-wave days (about 5
   degrees C) in Taipei. The difference in SUHI intensity of both cities
   could be as small as only 1.0 degrees C, suggesting that SUHI intensity
   was enhanced in both large and medium-sized cities during heat waves.
   Moreover, the surface temperatures of rural areas in Taipei and Yilan
   were elevated in the intense heat wave cases, suggesting that the SUHI
   may reach a plateau when the heat waves get stronger and last longer. In
   addition, the correlation coefficient between 3DUI and surface
   temperature was greater than 0.6. The innovative 3DUI can be employed to
   assess the spatial variation of temperatures and SUHI intensity in much
   finer spatial resolutions than measurements obtained from remote sensing
   and weather stations. In summary, the empirical results demonstrated
   intensified SUHI in large and medium-sized cities in subtropical areas
   during heat waves which could result in heat stress risks of residents.
   The innovative 3DUI can be employed to identify vulnerable areas in fine
   spatial resolutions for formulation of heat wave adaptation strategies.

Abstract = {{This article examines an innovative experiment in democratizing
   international broadcasting through embracing a participatory model of
   production. In spring 2010, a political debate television series was
   co-created by BBC Arabic and citizen producers, using social media
   tools. Based around interviews with prominent political and
   controversial public figures, the programme (G710) was broadcast weekly
   on satellite TV across the Middle East and the Arabic-speaking world.
   Combining collaborative ethnography with corporate big data' analysis,
   the research team followed the experiment from conception to premature
   closure. The article argues that the kinds of digital tools deployed in
   producing the programme, and used by BBC audience research to monitor
   user practices in real time, have become essential to corporate
   processes of BBC World Service governance and management procedures,
   business strategy, accountability measures, marketing practices and
   editorial decision-making. They act as change agents, presenting
   methodological problems and opportunities for the BBC's audience
   researchers and academic researchers, as well as symbolizing the
   contradictory logic of empowerment and surveillance.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the growth of online mobilizations using data from
   the indignados (outraged) movement in Spain, which emerged under the
   influence of the revolution in Egypt and as a precursor to the global
   Occupy mobilizations. The data track Twitter activity around the
   protests that took place in May 2011, which led to the formation of camp
   sites in dozens of cities all over the country and massive daily
   demonstrations during the week prior to the elections of May 22. We
   reconstruct the network of tens of thousands of users and monitor their
   message activity for a month (April 25, 2011, to May 25, 2011). Using
   both the structure of the network and levels of activity in message
   exchange, we identify four types of users and analyze their role in the
   growth of the protest. Drawing from theories of online activism and
   research on information diffusion in networks, this article centers on
   the following two questions: How does protest information spread in
   online networks? And how do different actors contribute to the growth of
   activity? The article aims to inform the theoretical debate on whether
   digital technologies are changing the logic of collective action and to
   provide evidence of how new media facilitates the emergence of massive
   offline mobilizations.}},

Abstract = {{The popularity of digital media networks for socialising among the youth
   is well documented. Much has been written on the emerging norms of
   textese, the global shorthand for chatting. However, becoming a
   proficient user involves more than simply mastering this code: it
   requires knowing the appropriate genres and registers for chatting. This
   article aims to explore these conventionalised genres and styles from a
   discourse analytical perspective. It analyses data collected by
   first-year students in the Linguistics Department at the University of
   the Western Cape (UWC) who use an application called MXit for chatting
   with their friends. The analysis shows how, despite the seemingly
   unrestrained and non-standard nature of MXit chatting, it is highly
   conventionalised and structured and requires a particular register of
   intimacy' which relies heavily on evaluative language and affective
   markers. However, it is simultaneously fluid and innovative thereby
   enabling users to style' for themselves identities which combine
   elements of global sophistication with local situatedness.}},

Abstract = {{Question Can UAV-based NIR remote sensing support restoration monitoring
   of cut-over bogs by providing valid information on species distribution
   and surface structure? Location Restored polders of the Uchter Moor, a
   bog complex in NW Germany. Methods We used autonomously flying
   quadrocopters, supplied with either a panchromatic or colour infrared
   calibrated small frame digital camera to generate high resolution images
   of the restored bog surface. We performed a two-step classification
   process of automatic image segmentation and object-based classification
   to distinguish between four pre-defined classes (waterlogged bare peat,
   Sphagnum spp., Eriophorum vaginatum and Betula pubescens. An independent
   validation procedure was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the
   classification. Results A set-up composed of decision rules for
   reflectance, geometry and textural features was applied for
   identification of the four classes. The presented classification
   revealed an overall accuracy level of 91\%. Most reliable attribution
   was obtained for waterlogged bare peat and Sphagnum-covered surfaces,
   revealing producer accuracies of 95\% and 91\%, respectively. Lower but
   still feasible accuracy levels were obtained for Eriophorum vaginatum
   and Betula pubescens individuals (89\% and 84\%, respectively).
   Conclusions UAV-based NIR remote sensing is a promising tool for
   monitoring the restoration of cut-over bogs and has the potential to
   significantly reduce laborious field surveys. UAVs may increasingly play
   a significant role in future ecological monitoring studies, since they
   are small in size, highly flexible, easy to handle, non-emissive and
   available at a comparatively low cost.}},

Abstract = {{As the use of networked computers and digital data increase, so have the
   reports of data compromise and malicious cyber-attacks. Increased use
   and reliance on technologies complicate the process of providing
   information security. This expanding complexity in supplying data
   security requirements coupled with the increased recognition of the
   value of information, have led to the need to quickly advance the
   information security area. In this paper, we examine the maturation of
   the information security area by analyzing the innovation activity of
   one of the largest and most ubiquitous information technology companies,
   Microsoft. We conduct a textual analysis of their patent application
   activity in the information security domain since the early 2000's using
   a novel text analysis approach based on concepts from social network
   analysis and algorithmic classification. We map our analysis to focal
   areas in information security and examine it against Microsoft's own
   history, in order to determine the depth and breadth of Microsoft's
   innovations. Our analysis shows the relevance of using a network-based
   text analysis. Specifically, we find that Microsoft has increasingly
   emphasized topics that fall into the identity and access management
   area. We also show that Microsoft's innovations in information security
   showed tremendous growth after their Trustworthy Computing Initiative
   was announced. In addition, we are able to determine areas of focus that
   correspond to Microsoft's major vulnerabilities. These findings indicate
   that while Microsoft is still actively, albeit not always successfully,
   fighting vulnerabilities in their products, they are quite vigorously
   and broadly innovating in the information security area. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Despite steady progress in research in technology-enhanced learning
   (TEL), the translation of research findings and technology into
   educational practices falls short of expectations. We present five Areas
   of Tension which were identified and evaluated in an international
   Delphi study on TEL These tensions might impede a more comprehensive
   inclusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) in
   educational settings. The Delphi study was embedded in the European
   Network of Excellence STELLAR (Sustaining Technology Enhanced Learning
   LArge-scale multidisciplinary Research). Five Delphi rounds were
   conducted to identify Areas of Tension and Core Research Areas in TEL An
   Area of Tension opposes two conflicting views on a certain technological
   development regarding the future of TEL. In the present article we
   describe the design of the Delphi study and report the results regarding
   the Areas of Tension. These areas were identified by collecting
   visionary statements on the future of TEL (Round 1) and by having 230
   international experts evaluate those statements (Round 2). The emerging
   tensions were integrated into five Areas of Tension (Round 3) and
   evaluated by 569 international experts on several dimensions for their
   significance for TEL and TEL research (Round 4). The identified areas
   concern a) data tracking for personalized learning versus data privacy,
   b) the spreading of technology reducing the digital divide versus even
   increasing it, c) ubiquitous learning opportunities versus critical and
   focused processing of information, d) continuous innovation in the
   classroom versus approved practices, and e) individualized versus
   standardized learning paths. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Spatial Covariance between Aesthetic Value \& Other Ecosystem Services}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Mapping the spatial distribution of ecosystem goods and services
   represents a burgeoning field of research, although how different
   services covary with one another remains poorly understood. This is
   particularly true for the covariation of supporting, provisioning and
   regulating services with cultural services (the non-material benefits
   people gain from nature). This is largely because of challenges
   associated with the spatially specific quantification of cultural
   ecosystem services. We propose an innovative approach for evaluating a
   cultural service, the perceived aesthetic value of ecosystems, by
   quantifying geo-tagged digital photographs uploaded to social media
   resources. Our analysis proceeds from the premise that images will be
   captured by greater numbers of people in areas that are more highly
   valued for their aesthetic attributes. This approach was applied in
   Cornwall, UK, to carry out a spatial analysis of the covariation between
   ecosystem services: soil carbon stocks, agricultural production, and
   aesthetic value. Our findings suggest that online geo-tagged images
   provide an effective metric for mapping a key component of cultural
   ecosystem services. They also highlight the non-stationarity in the
   spatial relationships between patterns of ecosystem services.}},

Title = {{Fading vision: knowledge translation in the implementation of a public
   health policy intervention}},
Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: In response to several high profile public health crises,
   public health renewal is underway in Canada. In the province of British
   Columbia, the Ministry of Health initiated a collaborative
   evidence-informed process involving a steering committee of
   representatives from the six health authorities. A Core Functions (CF)
   Framework was developed, identifying 21 core public health programs. For
   each core program, an evidence review was conducted and a model core
   program paper developed. These documents were distributed to health
   authorities to guide development of their own renewed public health
   services. The CF implementation was conceptualized as an embedded
   knowledge translation process. A CF coordinator in each health authority
   was to facilitate a gap analysis and development of a performance
   improvement plan for each core program, and post these publically on the
   health authority website.
   Methods: Interviews (n = 19) and focus groups (n = 8) were conducted
   with a total of 56 managers and front line staff from five health
   authorities working in the Healthy Living and Sexually Transmitted
   Infection Prevention core programs. All interviews and focus groups were
   digitally recorded, transcribed and verified by the project coordinator.
   Five members of the research team used NVivo 9 to manage data and
   conducted a thematic analysis.
   Results: Four main themes emerged concerning implementation of the CF
   Framework generally, and the two programs specifically. The themes were:
   `you've told me what, now tell me how'; `the double bind'; `but we
   already do that'; and the `selling game.' Findings demonstrate the
   original vision of the CF process was lost in the implementation process
   and many participants were unaware of the CF framework or process.
   Conclusions: Results are discussed with respect to a well-known
   framework on the adoption, assimilation, and implementation of
   innovations in health services organizations. Despite attempts of the
   Ministry of Health and the Steering Committee to develop and implement a
   collaborative, evidence-informed policy intervention, there were several
   barriers to the realization of the vision for core public health
   functions implementation, at least in the early stages. In neglecting
   the implementation process, it seems unlikely that the expected benefits
   of the public health renewal process will be realized.}},

Abstract = {{As information technology becomes integral to the products and services
   in a growing range of industries, there has been a corresponding surge
   of interest in understanding how firms can effectively formulate and
   execute digital business strategies. This fusion of IT within the
   business environment gives rise to a strategic tension between investing
   in digital artifacts for long-term value creation and exploiting them
   for short-term value appropriation. Further, relentless innovation and
   competitive pressures dictate that firms continually adapt these
   artifacts to changing market and technological conditions, but sustained
   profitability requires scalable architectures that can serve a large
   customer base and stable interfaces that support integration across a
   diverse ecosystem of complementary offerings. The study of digital
   business strategy needs new concepts and methods to examine how these
   forces are managed in pursuit of competitive advantage. We conceptualize
   the logic of digital business strategy in terms of two constructs:
   design capital (i.e., the cumulative stock of designs owned or
   controlled by a firm) and design moves (i.e., the discrete strategic
   actions that enlarge, reduce, or modify a firm's stock of designs). We
   also identify two salient dimensions of design capital, namely, option
   value and technical debt. Using embedded case studies of four firms, we
   develop a rich conceptual model and testable propositions to lay out a
   design-based logic of digital business strategy. This logic highlights
   the interplay between design moves and design capital in the context of
   digital business strategy and contributes to a growing body of insights
   that link the design of digital artifacts to competitive strategy and
   firm-level performance.}},

Abstract = {{Within changing value networks, the profits and competitive advantages
   of participation reside dynamically at control points that are the
   positions of greatest value and/or power. The enterprises that hold
   these positions have a great deal of control over how the network
   operates, how the benefits are redistributed, and how this influences
   the execution of a digital business strategy. This article is based on a
   field study that provides preliminary, yet promising, empirical evidence
   that sheds light on the dynamic cycle of value creation and value
   capture points in digitally enabled networks in response to triggers
   related to technology and business strategy. The context used is that of
   the European and U. S. broadcasting industry. Specifically, the paper
   illustrates how incremental innovations may shift value networks from
   static, vertically integrated networks to more loosely coupled networks,
   and how cross-boundary industry disruptions may then, in turn, shift
   those to two-sided markets. Based on the analysis, insights and
   implications for digital business strategy research and practice are
   then provided.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. This study examines the antecedents of user acceptance of
   an audio-visual heritage archive for a wider audience (i.e., the general
   public) by extending the technology acceptance model with the concepts
   of perceived enjoyment, nostalgia proneness and personal innovativeness.
   Method. A Web-based survey was used to collect data to test the extended
   technology acceptance model in explaining intention to use. A
   representative sample consisting of 205 respondents was used.
   Analysis. The conceptual model is evaluated using structural equation
   modelling. The evaluation entailed an assessment of the measurement
   model including its reliability, validity and model fit, and an
   examination of the structural model.
   Results. Perceived enjoyment better predicts the users' acceptance than
   perceived usefulness does. Nostalgia has a strong effect on behavioural
   intention to use the service. Moreover, the results show no significant
   result regarding personal innovativeness in information technology.
   Conclusions. The acceptance of an audio-visual heritage archive service
   is mainly determined by its hedonic characteristic (enjoyment) rather
   than its instrumental value (usefulness). This result is intriguing in
   relation to prior archive and digital library research. Additionally,
   nostalgia is successfully introduced within the technology acceptance
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Franco Moretti's notion of ``distant reading{''} as a complementary
   concept to ``close reading,{''} which has emerged alongside
   computer-based analysis and manipulation of texts, finds its mirror
   image in a sort of ``distant{''} production of literary works-of a
   specific kind, of course. The paper considers the field in which
   literature and new media creativity intersect. Is there such a thing as
   literariness in ``new media objects{''} (Manovich)? Next, by focusing on
   the websites that generate texts resembling and referring to sonnet
   form, the article asks a question about the new media sonnet and a more
   general question about new media poetry.,A mere negative answer to the
   two questions seemingly implied by Vuk Cosies projects does not suffice
   because it only postpones the unavoidable answer to the questions posed
   by existing new media artworks and other communication systems. Teo
   Spiller's Spam.sonnets can be viewed as an innovative solution to
   finding a viable balance between the author's control over the text and
   the text's openness to the reader-user's intervention. In conclusion,
   two concrete reconfigurations of the experience of (new media)
   literature-and through it the surrounding world-are considered: the
   experience of time in Spiller's News Sonnets and the spatial dimension
   as implied in his project SMS Sonnets. News Sonnets uses current news
   obtained via RSS feeds from various sources, which makes the
   ``messages{''} contained in the lines of the sonnet a potential stimulus
   for readers' immediate action. SMS Sonnets expands the territory where
   the communication takes place beyond the text-reader confrontation and
   into the community of participants in an interactive (non-artistic)
   communication system..}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the design problem of efficient feedback control
   schemes to enhance the quality of service (QoS) of a web server (WS)
   whose input/output dynamic behavior is modeled by discrete mathematical
   representations. Discrete models allowing the digital simulation of the
   WS responses to different scenarios of client requests are adopted. The
   capabilities to guarantee performing service delays, under dynamic
   workload variations, are the main investigations of this work. To try to
   provide prospective solutions, advanced feedback control strategies are
   proposed. First, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is implemented as a
   regulating solution in a closed-loop control architecture. Then, the
   tabu search (TS) algorithm (TSA) is used to optimize the PLC parameters
   with innovative tuning procedures. The TS optimized PLC (TSOFLC) is also
   implemented and applied to attempt to improve the WS QoS. To demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the adopted closed-loop intelligent control
   strategies, digital simulation experiments are carried out and examined.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Digital TV (MDTV), the hybrid of Digital Television (DTV) and
   mobile devices (such as mobile phones), has introduced a new way for
   people to watch DTV and has brought new opportunities for development in
   the DTV industry. Nowadays, the development of the next generation MDTV
   service has progressed in terms of both hardware layers and software,
   with interactive services becoming one of the future trends. However,
   current MDTV interactive service generation process relies too much on
   commercial solutions, resulting in most parts of the process being
   proprietary. In addition, this has increased the technical demands for
   developers and the cost of producing and maintaining MDTV services. In
   light of the aforementioned situation, this paper proposes an innovative
   MDTV service generation solution, which introduces a semiautomatic
   creation mechanism to facilitate a less technical and more efficient
   interactive service creation process. By employing open-standard
   technologies including XHTML and Java ME for the service presentation
   the proposed work benefits are twofold. Firstly it helps in reducing the
   technical demands of MDTV service production for service creators.
   Secondly it improves the inter-compatibility of the created service
   application amongst different MDTV standards. Initial test results
   indicate that the proposed solution allows for a faster and more
   effective MDTV interactive service generation.}},

Abstract = {{An intrinsic notion of quality floors present in typical digital signal
   processing circuits can be used to strategically accept some runtime
   errors in exchange for a reduction in energy consumption. Conventional
   very large scale integration design strategies do not exploit this
   degree of error tolerance and aim to guarantee timing correctness,
   thereby sacrificing energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose
   techniques for timing error acceptance to improve the quality-energy
   tradeoff in image and video processing systems under scaled V-DD. The
   basic philosophy is to prevent signal quality from severe degradation,
   on average, by using data statistics. The introduced innovations include
   techniques for carefully controlling possible errors and exploiting the
   specifics of error patterns for low-cost postprocessing to minimize
   quality degradation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   techniques on a 2-D inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) and a 2-D
   DCT design. The designs were synthesized using a 45-nm standard cell
   library, with energy and delay evaluated using NanoSim and VCS.
   Experiments show that direct applications of controlled error-acceptance
   techniques allow up to 59\% and 71\% energy savings by permitting fewer
   than 1-dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) decrease for the 2-D IDCT
   and DCT designs, respectively. The resulting PSNR remains above 30 dB,
   which is a commonly accepted value for lossy image and video
   compression. Achieving such energy savings by direct V-DD scaling
   without the proposed transformations results in a 12-dB PSNR loss. The
   area overhead for the needed control logic is about 4.8\% of the
   original design. To further minimize quality degradation caused by
   accepted errors in the IDCT, we introduce postfiltering on the output
   image. The significant improvement of the perceived image quality allows
   further voltage scaling leading to overall energy savings of 70\% for
   the 2-D IDCT, while costing an additional 1.1\% in area.}},

   of digital technologies: to evaluate their potential for careers work in
   challenging settings. Given the rapidity of developments, technologies

   Virtual worlds offer potential for careers and guidance work, and the
   therapeutic domain. To illustrate this, we present examples in which
   young people explore their feelings and ideas, plans and difficulties,
   while preparing for film-making. During this they develop important life
   transition skills. We argue that the power of virtual worlds - to
   support emotional and cognitive engagement - could be utilised in
   practice settings. We conclude that they are serious candidates as
   digital tools in the careers and guidance domain.}},

Abstract = {{The Digital Hydraulic Power Management System (DHPMS) is an innovation
   that is claimed to significantly improve the energy efficiency of
   hydraulic systems. It is based on digital pump-motor technology but has
   multiple independent outlets; hence, the transformer function can be
   realized as well. A new idea is to connect the outlets of the DHPMS
   directly into the cylinder chambers without any throttling valves in
   order to minimize hydraulic losses and to enable energy recovery. This
   article introduces the first experimental results of using this direct
   connection approach. Firstly, the system under study is presented and
   then a method for the displacement control is proposed. Open-loop
   position tracking responses with different loadings are presented, as is
   an analysis of the accuracy of steady-state velocity tracking. In
   addition, energy losses in the system are studied. The results show that
   the technique is valid. Moreover, the open-loop positioning error is
   under one percent in the measured trajectories, even though the DHPMS
   used has only six pistons. However, more pistons will be needed to
   improve the control of low velocities and to reduce the pressure ripple.
   On/off valve technology is a challenge, and compact, fast and leak-free
   valves with high flow capacity are required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to investigate if the industry context
   matters for whether Gibrat's law is rejected or not using a dataset that
   consists of all limited firms in five-digit NACE-industries in Sweden
   during 1998-2004. The results reject Gibrat's law on an aggregate level,
   since small firms grow faster than large firms. However, Gibrat's law is
   confirmed about as often as it is rejected when industry-specific
   regressions are estimated. It is also found that the industry
   context-e.g., minimum efficient scale, market concentration rate, and
   number of young firms in the industry-matters for whether Gibrat's law
   is rejected or not.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We examine ownership differences in the use of technology in
   long-term care facilities. Method: We analyze two nationally
   representative surveys of administrators collected by the Centers for
   Disease Control (CDC): the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey and the
   2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities. Results: We find
   that nonprofit nursing homes are more likely to use some computerized
   administrative functions and digital laboratory reports, and report use
   rates similar to for-profit organizations in other areas of health IT.
   Nonprofit residential care facilities are more likely to use electronic
   medical records and information exchange systems than their for-profit
   counterparts. In addition, nonprofit residential care facilities are
   more likely than for-profit facilities to digitize more types of
   information and use larger health information exchange networks.
   Discussion: The reasons for which nonprofit long-term care organizations
   report higher levels of some types of technology utilization are
   explored, and future research is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Student interest in botany and enrolment in plant sciences courses tends
   to be low compared to that in other biological disciplines. One
   potential way of increasing student interest in botany is to focus on
   course material designed to raise student enthusiasm and satisfaction.
   Here, we introduce and evaluate virtual microscopy in botany teaching.
   Virtual microscopy uses high-resolution digital virtual slides' that
   allow students to explore microscope sections without the advanced
   skills required to prepare glass slides. Questionnaire feedback from
   students indicated that students found the virtual slides an effective
   learning tool. Further, we found that student performance in assessments
   was significantly higher when using virtual slides than when using
   traditional glass slides. We suggest that virtual slides are an
   effective tool for increasing student satisfaction in introductory
   botany courses, and have the potential for increasing student enrolment
   in higher-level courses (honours) and research degrees.}},

Abstract = {{The author reasons that libraries need to expand their traditional
   services in the Post-Web Era. A library's core values are reflected in
   the convenience it brings to users for quick access and consumption of
   content. The traditional value chain of libraries (acquisitions -
   catalog - discovery and access-based services) significantly lags behind
   the current times, and thus can no longer effectively serve the
   library's core values. It is critical for libraries to amend the value
   chain at the point of content use (acquisitions - catalog -discovery and
   access-based services - use). The new value chain incorporates
   co-curation services between library staff and users and among users
   themselves. Not only does the author discuss the significance for such
   an extension, but he also demonstrates possible new roles for libraries
   in content utilization through an innovative project of the Emory
   University Libraries, Readux (Read Edit Annotation Digital User
   Experience). By enabling co-curation (read, annotate, describe,
   collaborate, share, import, export, and publish), libraries will create
   new opportunities to support users and themselves in the digital media
   context.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{348-364}},

Abstract = {{As firms collect greater amounts of data about their customers from an
   ever broader set of ``touchpoints,{''} a new set of methodological
   challenges arises. Companies often collect data from these various
   platforms at differing levels of aggregation, and it is not clear how to
   merge these data sources to draw meaningful inferences about
   customer-level behavior patterns. In this article, the authors provide a
   method that firms can use, based on readily available data, to gauge and
   monitor multiplatform media usage. The key innovation in the method is a
   Bayesian data-fusion approach that enables researchers to combine
   individual-level usage data (readily available for most digital
   platforms) with aggregated data on usage over time (typically available
   for traditional platforms). This method enables the authors to
   disentangle the intraday correlations between platforms (i.e., the usage
   of one platform vs. another on a given day) from longer-term
   correlations across users (i.e., heavy/light usage of multiple platforms
   over time). The authors conclude with a discussion of how this method
   can be used in a variety of marketing contexts for which data have
   become readily available, such as gauging the interplay between online
   and brick-and-mortar purchasing behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Modern field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) offer built in support for
   efficient implementation of signal processing algorithms in the form of
   specialized embedded blocks such as high speed carry chains, specialized
   shift registers, adders, multiply accumulators (MAC) and block memories.
   These dedicated elements provide increased computational power and are
   used for efficient implementation of computationally extensive
   algorithms. This paper proposes a novel algorithm and architecture for
   the design and implementation of high performance intermediate frequency
   (IF) filters on FPGAs. In this research, we have proposed innovative
   design methodologies for generation of optimal feed forward and
   recursive architectures to be mapped on a family of FPGAs. Keeping in
   perspective the limited number of registers within the embedded blocks,
   the new methodology applies transformations to achieve higher throughput
   by applying various optimizations to the design algorithm.
   Implementation options include systolic MAC, transpose direct form MAC,
   canonic signed digit and distributed arithmetic based filters to suite
   the most economical FPGA implementation. The paper demonstrates the
   methodology and shows its applicability by synthesizing the designs and
   comparing the results to a number of traditional architectures and
   intellectual property cores. Using Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA, our results
   show a throughput improvement between 7\% and 30\% with an average
   improvement of 16\% over traditional implementations of these designs.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is an innovative and non-invasive method
   that uses radar to penetrate the ground and develop three-dimensional
   digital images of the top several meters of the earth.
   Ground-penetrating radar has been used extensively in the fields of
   engineering, military science, forensic science, archaeology, and
   environmental remediation, but has received little attention by wildlife
   professionals. We demonstrated a possible application of GPR for
   wildlife studies for mapping burrow systems using maritime pocket
   gophers (Geomys personatus maritimus), a subspecies of concern as listed
   by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Ground-penetrating radar surveys
   were conducted at Naval Air Station-Corpus Christi on five 15-m x 15-m
   areas with > 200 above-ground gopher mounds/ha during July 2007. Survey
   areas were scanned with a Geophysical Survey Systems Inc. SIR-3000, GPR
   digital control unit and a 900-MHz ground-coupled antenna. Within the 5
   areas, we located 8 gophers and mapped 267 m of tunnels that had an
   average depth of 0.6 m. We were able to differentiate deteriorating or
   abandoned tunnels from active tunnels, detect an underground pipeline,
   and distinguish changes in soil texture using GPR. Ground-penetrating
   radar is a non-destructive and non-invasive method to gain knowledge of
   fossorial animal movements and potential destabilization of soil
   integrity. (C) 2013 The Wildlife Society.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{26-36}},

Abstract = {{Trajectory simulation codes are widely used for assessing and zoning
   rockfall hazards in view of land use planning. Theses tools may also be
   used to estimate the benefit in terms of risk reduction derived from the
   construction of protection structures such as embankments. This paper
   investigates the relevance of currently used trajectory analysis tools
   for this purpose through a real case study. The trajectory analysis is
   first used to assess the hazard and define the embankment geometry. In a
   second time, it is used to assess the embankment protection efficiency
   after its insertion in the digital terrain model. Results reveal
   abnormal trajectories in the vicinity of the embankment suggesting
   limitations related to both the spatial resolution of the terrain model
   and to the rebound models. To cope with these limitations, an innovative
   approach is proposed and evaluated for improving the ability of the
   simulation code in assessing the residual hazard down the embankment.

   and colour-enhanced stereo imaging techniques}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{177-183}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{An innovative 3D flame visualisation and digital reconstruction
   technique was developed on the basis of digital flame colour enhancement
   and conventional stereo reconstruction methods. This combined
   methodology, together with Schlieren visualisation technique, was
   utilized to investigate the ignition process of propane impinging
   diffusion flame. Through the application of flame colour analysis, it
   was shown that majority of the flame feature observed during the initial
   stage of the ignition process resembles a bluish colouration similar to
   the colouration induced by visible chemiluminescence observed from lean
   premixed hydrocarbon flames. Digital flame colour analysis principle was
   applied to identify and enhance the weak chemiluminescence signals from
   the raw image data. The colour-enhanced images were able to clearly
   depict the details of local flame structures and allow the application
   of 3D stereo reconstruction on these flame features. The results from 3D
   reconstruction and direct high speed imaging showed that the initial
   flame kernel, which led to the eventual flame establishment, was very
   sensitive to the ignition location. Furthermore, this flame feature
   expands outward with time. The combined colour-enhanced stereo technique
   has the advantage over traditional stereo method in enabling the
   visualisation and reconstruction of a wider range of flame structures
   and shows great potential for application in future combustion research.

Abstract = {{The research studies the relation of the learner's knowledge searching
   depth to his/her creativity when learner comes into contact with
   constructed knowledge. The digitized constructed knowledge environment
   has changed the way that knowledge has been presented through the books.
   By using information technology, learners now obtain knowledge rapidly
   in a computer-learning environment. When a learner facing a project, the
   way he/she searches information to build up his/her knowledge becomes a
   subject which is well worthy a discussion. This research first recorded
   each student viewing the mission-related instructional materials on
   computer pages in limited time. Followed by analyzing the route of
   subject's cognitive processes to study the relation of students who with
   different creativity performances to their knowledge searching depth.
   The participants are vocational high school students from the innovated
   project design class and their projects in this experiment are creative
   poster design. Researchers recorded and analyzed participants' viewing
   routes among supplied poster-design instructional materials. Researchers
   expect to find out the relation by discussing the knowledge searching
   process between different creativity performers. (c) 2010 Wiley

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to review the major limitations in current
   mammography and to describe how these may be addressed by digital breast
   tomosynthesis (DBT). DBT is a novel imaging technology in which an x-ray
   fan beam sweeps in an arc across the breast, producing tomographic
   images and enabling the production of volumetric, three-dimensional (3D)
   data. It can reduce tissue overlap encountered in conventional
   two-dimensional (2D) mammography, and thus has the potential to improve
   detection of breast cancer, reduce the suspicious presentations of
   normal tissues, and facilitate accurate differentiation of lesion types.
   This paper reviews the latest studies of this new technology. Issues
   including diagnostic efficacy, reading time, radiation dose, and level
   of compression; cost and new innovations are considered. (C) 2013 The

   This paper is focused on recent developments from science to
   applications analyzing the past fifteen years of history of the
   proceedings of the German annual meeting on medical image processing
   (BVM). Furthermore, some members of the program committee present their
   personal points of views: (i) multi-modality for imaging and diagnosis,
   (ii) analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging, (iii) model-based image
   analysis, (iv) registration of section images, (v) from images to
   information in digital endoscopy, and (vi) virtual reality and robotics.
   Medical imaging and medical image computing is seen as field of rapid
   development with clear trends to integrated applications in diagnostics,

Abstract = {{This article aims to understand the adoption of e-books by academic
   historians for the purpose of teaching and research. This includes an
   investigation into their knowledge about and perceived characteristics
   of this evolving research tool. The study relied on Rogers's model of
   the innovation-decision process to guide the development of an interview
   guide. Ten semistructured interviews were conducted with history faculty
   between October 2010 and December 2011. A grounded theory approach was
   employed to code and analyze the data. Findings about tradition, cost,
   teaching innovations, and the historical research process provide the
   background for designing learning opportunities for the professional
   development of historians and the academic librarians who work with
   them. While historians are open to experimenting with e-books, they are
   also concerned about the loss of serendipity in digital environments,
   the lack of availability of key resources, and the need for
   technological transparency. The findings show that Rogers's knowledge
   and persuasion stages are cyclical in nature, with scholars moving back
   and forth between these two stages. Participants interviewed were
   already weighing the five characteristics of the persuasion stage
   without having much knowledge about e-books. The study findings have
   implications for our understanding of the diffusion of innovations in
   academia: both print and digital collections are being used in parallel
   without one replacing the other.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Internet applications and service innovations are changing
   people's way of life. At the same time, they are also changing the way
   that people communicate and access information. People who visited
   libraries to find specific information in the past are now able to find
   the same information online. As the spectrum of human need grows, the
   opportunities for librarians to meet these needs are also growing.
   Libraries will need to be designed to accommodate the changing needs of
   their users. Mobile library services can meet users' information needs
   in a fast-paced society. In this investigation we identified 39
   university libraries supported by the Ministry of Education's ``Project
   985{''} and evaluated their status as mobile library service providers.

Abstract = {{Since its launch several years ago, Europeana has continued to improve
   the quantity and quality of its content, attempting to offer new
   services and differentiate itself from the more popular search engines.
   The Assets project has contributed to this goal by developing innovative
   content-based search technologies and services, improving existing
   functionality, and designing more user-friendly interfaces. This paper
   describes in detail some of the new services that were implemented in a
   replica of the Europeana website. A user evaluation process was
   conducted in several European countries, with a total of 51 usability
   tests performed. The results reveal the benefits and drawbacks of the
   portal. The identified problems were systematically prioritized. In the
   final phase of the project, a redesign resolved 74\% of all usability
   incidents. The result is a number of features that enhance the original
   Europeana portal, giving the user more and better search tools.}},

Abstract = {{Libraries, archives and museums are increasingly committed to making
   their resources available through online digital repositories. However,
   progress in this area has been stalled for years, both in the functional
   design arena and in the relevant technology. Now, a group of
   universities with a long tradition in this area has created the Hydra
   Project: a framework that allows each institution to create their own
   repository and provides all needed utilities. This article describes the
   experience of the Documentation Centre and Museum of the Performing
   Arts, one of the first European partners to opt for this new generation
   of repositories, when faced with this challenge. It aims to explain what
   was done and how, the problems encountered, the mistakes and successes,
   and finally, the conclusions that can be drawn from the whole process.}},

Abstract = {{The Resource-Based Relative Value Scale is widely used to measure
   healthcare provider productivity and to set payment standards. The
   scale, however, is limited in its assessment of pre- and postservice
   work and other potentially non-revenue-generating healthcare services,
   what we have termed service-valued activity (SVA). In an attempt to
   quantify SVA, we conducted a time and motion study of providers to
   assess their productivity in inpatient and outpatient settings.
   Using the Standard Time and Motion Procedures checklist as a
   methodological guide, we provided personal digital assistants (PDAs)
   that were prepopulated with 2010 Current Procedural Terminology codes to
   19 advanced practice providers (APPs). The APPs were instructed to
   identify their location and activity each time the PDA randomly alarmed.
   The providers collected data for 3 to 5 workdays, and those data were
   separated into revenue-generating services (RGSs) and SVAs. Multiple
   inpatient and outpatient departments were assessed. The inpatient APPs
   spent 61.6 percent of their time on RGSs and 35.1 percent on SVAs.
   Providers in the outpatient settings spent 59.0 percent of their time on
   RGSs and 38.2 percent on SVAs.
   This time and motion study demonstrated an innovative method and tool
   for the quantification and analysis of time spent on revenue- and
   non-revenue-generating services provided by healthcare professionals.
   The new information derived from this study can be used to accurately
   document productivity, determine clinical practice patterns, and improve
   deployment strategies of healthcare providers.}},

   conducted to understand barriers and limitations of graduate
   contributions to such activities. The attributes and skills of graduates
   from the university and Vocational Education and Training sectors were
   the subject of the study. Two focus groups, one with the education
   sectors and the other with representatives from design firms, government
   institutions and design associations were held. Though each group of
   graduates was praised for having certain skill sets graduates from both
   sectors were found to be lacking in three key areas: problem solving,
   communication skills and commercial knowledge. A range of suggestions
   for systemic improvement were proposed as a result of the study.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is known by different names, the qualitative quantitative
   divide is a common enough description for battles between the general
   and the unique in the social sciences. Whatever value such an academic
   discussion might have for the pursuit of theory, the goal of applied
   social science is different. It is, more generally, to solve particular
   human problems, not to produce universal or law-like understanding.
   Insofar as applied geography endeavors to link general processes to
   specific cases, qualitative approaches are uniquely positioned to make
   meaning in place, impact policy, and transform everyday life. In this
   article, we discuss three areas in which qualitative methods connect the
   spectrum of applied geospatial research: Creation, Confirmation, and
   Connectivity. We show how the union of qualitative methods and a focus
   on the specific with different geospatial technologies has led to
   innovative and exciting ways of understanding and visualizing the
   multifaceted relationships between spatial phenomena. Indeed, through
   the thoughtful use of qualitative methods, applied geographers can truly
   begin to understand the complex interactions occurring all around us
   between society, environment, and place. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Next-generation radio arrays, including the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)
   and its pathfinders, will open up new avenues for exciting transient
   science at radio wavelengths. Their innovative designs, comprising a
   large number of small elements, pose several challenges in digital
   processing and optimal observing strategies. The Giant Metre-wave Radio
   Telescope (GMRT) presents an excellent test-bed for developing and
   validating suitable observing modes and strategies for transient
   experiments with future arrays. Here we describe the first phase of the
   ongoing development of a transient detection system for GMRT that is
   planned to eventually function in a commensal mode with other observing
   programs. It capitalizes on the GMRT's interferometric and sub-array
   capabilities, and the versatility of a new software backend. We outline
   considerations in the plan and design of transient exploration programs
   with interferometric arrays, and describe a pilot survey that was
   undertaken to aid in the development of algorithms and associated
   analysis software. This survey was conducted at 325 and 610 MHz, and
   covered 360 deg(2) of the sky with short dwell times. It provides large
   volumes of real data that can be used to test the efficacies of various
   algorithms and observing strategies applicable for transient detection.
   We present examples that illustrate the methodologies of detecting
   short-duration transients, including the use of sub-arrays for higher
   resilience to spurious events of terrestrial origin, localization of
   candidate events via imaging, and the use of a phased array for improved
   signal detection and confirmation. In addition to demonstrating
   applications of interferometric arrays for fast transient exploration,
   our efforts mark important steps in the roadmap toward SKA-era science.}},

Abstract = {{In an experimental study we investigated how collaboration settings for
   the synchronous versus asynchronous manipulation of a 2D-object
   influenced the quality of distributed design collaborations across three
   phases: problem description, idea generation, and decision making. We
   assessed collaboration quality in terms of process and outcomes, as well
   as user satisfaction and the perceived usefulness of the two settings
   for supporting distributed collaborations. We further investigated
   changes in the usage of the shared object across design phases. Our
   findings provided clear indications of phase-specific usage of the
   shared object in the synchronous setting. The two settings also showed
   varying usefulness depending on design stage indicating the disparate
   impact of synchronous and asynchronous settings on collaboration quality
   in disparate design phases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Today in the hospital setting, several functions of the
   radiology information system (RIS), including order entry, patient
   registration, report repository, and the physician directory, have moved
   to enterprise electronic medical records. Some observers might conclude
   that the RIS is going away. In this article, we contend that because of
   the maturity of the RIS market compared with other areas of the health
   care enterprise, radiology has a unique opportunity to innovate.
   CONCLUSION. While most of the hospital enterprise spends the next
   several years going through the digital transformation converting from
   paper to a digital format, radiology can leap ahead in its use of
   analytics and information technology. This article presents a summary of
   new RIS functions still maturing and open to innovation in the RIS
   market.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel approach to studying a ballistic bomb deposit.
   Favorable circumstances, a unique dispersal axis, an operational thermal
   video camera, and application of an innovative methodology allowed
   estimates of volume and mass erupted, and definition of mass
   partitioning between bombs of various sizes. This allowed the creation
   of a multidisciplinary database for a single major explosion at
   Stromboli volcano (Italy), the type locality of Strombolian eruptions.
   The dispersion and direction of the deposit were consistent with a major
   explosion on 21 January 2010. Field data comprised 780 mapped bomb
   locations and sizes, and were organized into a GIS with a lidar-derived
   digital elevation model as its base. This allowed us to define the
   landing distribution and flight parameters for erupted bombs. The data
   defined discontinuous deposition to build a cluster-dominated bomb
   field, with a total deposit volume of similar to 10 m(3), a mass of
   similar to 2 x 10(4) kg, and a grain size dominated by large bombs (1 m
   in diameter). The parameters defined here for a major eruption at
   Stromboli show that the Strombolian style of volcanism, and its
   deposits, need to be treated carefully, and a different approach is
   needed in the future to truly characterize and classify such small (but
   globally common) explosive eruptions. The recognition that sedimentation
   from such eruptions will be uneven leads to the important conclusion
   that isopachs and isopleths cannot be used to estimate eruption volumes
   for such explosions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a CMOS monolithic digitized light transducer with a
   calibration technique for ambient light sensor applications is newly
   proposed. The output signal of the proposed light transducer is a pulse
   stream that it could be easily sent over a wide range of transmission
   media, such as package switch network, radio, optical, infra red,
   ultrasonic, etc. Another innovation is that the proposed calibration
   technique enhances and calibrates the linear error among light sensor
   arrays over a wide dynamic frequency range. The output frequency of the
   proposed chip ranges from 7.5 to 1.873 MHz and the dynamic range is 108
   dB. Before performing the proposed calibration technique, the maximum
   linear errors of one photodiode versus 5 and 25 photodiodes are 17.38\%
   and 56\%, respectively. But, after calibrating, the maximum linear
   errors are reduced to 4.97\% and 4.94\%, respectively. All the functions
   and performance of the proposed CMOS monolithic digitized light
   transducer with the calibration technique for ambient light sensor
   applications are successfully tested and proven through measurements.
   The proposed chip is suitable for lighting instruments and ambient light
   sensor devices.}},

Abstract = {{The arterio-venous anastomoses (AVA) play a major role in the blood
   circulation in the peripheral body parts. In this work, the segmental
   bioheat model of Salloum et al. {[}1] is improved to accurately predict
   skin blood flow rate in the hands and fingers, and the local and overall
   human thermal responses in transient environments. The improvements in
   the model include: 1) extending the artery tree to include the arterial
   branching to the five fingers; 2) modeling and distribution of the blood
   flow between the deep and superficial veins in the peripherals; 3)
   adjusting arteries' radii during dilation and constriction; 4)
   innovative modeling of AVA of the fingers. The model focus is on the
   accurate blood flow calculation to the different body segments proposing
   a better blood control mechanism through relating the arterial tree
   radii as well as the AVA control mechanism to cardiac output. The skin
   blood flow and digits' dynamic thermal response predicted by the model
   were compared with published experimental values on body core and skin
   temperatures and local skin temperatures of fingers. Good agreement was
   obtained with experimentally reported values on average skin, core, and
   finger skin temperature response of subjects exposed to gradual decrease
   in air temperature from 32.3 degrees C to 13 degrees C. The new
   integrated AVA model of the fingers with the bioheat model is capable of
   predicting digits' dynamics thermal response with better accuracy than
   some previous models while also incorporating the complex central and
   local thermoregulatory functions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present an acquisition system featuring a
   very wide gain range and experimental measurements of a new
   micromachined thermal conductivity detector (mu TCD), applied downstream
   of a gas-chromatography (GC) system. We describe a simple and innovative
   electronics for mu TCD control and data acquisition, outlining its
   resistance control, native imbalance compensation, and automatic gain
   control (AGC) algorithm. The acquisition electronics features two
   parallel amplification stages with programmable gain: a high-gain stage
   (gain: 70-1280) and a low-gain or attenuating stage (gain: 0.6-30). The
   resulting detection range turns out to be very wide, with full scales
   ranging between 3.9 mV and 6.5 V while voltage is acquired with a
   10-b-resolution analog-to-digital converter. Measurements and
   sensitivity tests have been carried out by connecting our mu TCD and
   acquisition system downstream of the microfluidic section and GC column
   of a commercial GC system. Sensitivity measurements on several toluene
   masses gave very good results, having observed a system sensitivity of
   15.2 +/- 0.6 mu Vs/ng. This high sensitivity will enable the mu TCD to
   be used in many portable applications like in-line quality control, and
   industrial security and safety. We also show the good operation of the
   AGC algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{It is significant to investigate the depth-dependent mechanical
   behaviors of articular cartilage under rolling load since considerable
   rolling occurs for cartilage joint in activities of daily living. In
   this study, the rolling experiments of articular cartilage were
   conducted by applying an optimized digital image correlation (DIC)
   technique for the first time and the depth-dependent normal strain and
   shear strain of cartilage were analyzed. It is found that the normal
   strain and shear strain values of different layers increase firstly and
   then decrease with rolling time, and they increase with increasing
   compressive strains. The normal strain and shear strain values decrease
   along cartilage depth with constant compressive strain. The normal
   strain values of different normalized depth decrease with increasing
   rolling rates. The shear strain values of superficial layer and middle
   layer decrease; however there are no major changes for the shear strain
   values of deep layer with increasing rolling rates. The normal strain
   values with different rolling time increase with increasing rolling
   numbers and the 30.6\% increase in initial normal strain is observed
   from 1st to 99th cycle. The fitting relationship of the normal strain
   and normalized depth was obtained considering the effects of compressive
   strain and rolling rate and the fitting curves agree with the
   experimental results for cartilage very well. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper examines how the digitisation of the social network, and the
   resulting interplay between its online and offline components, has
   impacted the role of the technological gatekeeper in research and
   development (R\&D) settings. Previous studies have firmly established
   the technological gatekeeper to be a key node in the innovation process
   acquiring, translating and disseminating novel information throughout
   the R\&D social network. Drawing on social network analysis and
   interview evidence from a software R\&D group, we find that the
   gatekeeper role has undergone a division of labour. Theoretically, we
   contribute to the body of knowledge by developing an updated
   technological gatekeeper conceptual framework. For practitioners, we
   identify the competencies exhibited by the small number of communication
   specialists who are largely responsible for diffusing novel information.
   We then advise practitioners how to maximise the contribution of these
   stars' to the information flow network.}},

Abstract = {{The social shaping of technology (SST) has become a broad umbrella term
   to cover a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives in the
   social sciences. It has also defined a set of funded projects in the UK
   focused on a particular technical initiative around e-social science
   digital social research. It is increasingly understood that social
   science research and work on the SST, in particular, should be applied
   to the study of innovations in digital research and their implications
   for the sciences and humanities. This overview is designed to help
   introduce the diversity of perspectives that the social sciences can
   bring to bear, such as under the social shaping umbrella and explain why
   this set of perspectives is of value to policy and practice in this
   field. The continuing advance and diffusion of digital research make it
   ever more important to strengthen the role of the social sciences in
   this area of multi-disciplinary research, policy, and practice.}},

   into today's society. However, the tools and methods required to conduct
   such analysis are often isolated and/or proprietary. The Cardiff Online
   Social Media Observatory (COSMOS) provides an integrated virtual
   research environment for supporting the collection, analysis, and
   visualization of social media data, providing researchers with an
   innovative facility on which to conduct hypothetical experiments that
   lead to defensible results. This study presents a methodology for
   Digital Social Research and explains how the features of COSMOS aim to
   underpin it.}},

Abstract = {{Technological innovation in digital communications, epitomised in the
   shift from the informational web (Web1.0) to the interactional web
   (Web2.0), provokes new opportunities and challenges for social research.
   Web2.0 technologies, particularly the new social media (e.g. social
   networking, blogging and micro-blogging) as well as the increased
   accessibility of the World Wide Web through highly portable and
   prevalent devices like smart phones, tablets and netbooks generates new
   forms of data which are of significance for social research as well as
   new methods and techniques for analysing this kind of data. Even though
   we are in the midst of this rapid innovation, it is nonetheless possible
   to distinguish three basic lines of argument about its current and
   prospective impact on social research. Some commentators suggest this
   innovation generates methods and data that can act as a surrogate for
   more traditional quantitative and qualitative research designs such as
   experiments, sample surveys and in-depth interviews. Others argue that
   digital communication technologies re-orientate social research around
   new objects, populations and techniques of analysis. It can also be
   argued that digital social research augments, but needs to be used in
   conjunction with, more traditional methods. C. WrightMills' classic
   statement of The Sociological Imagination is used to clarify the
   distinctive contribution of digital social research; what can it do that
   traditional methods cannot in understanding how social relations are
   constituted, how they can change and how they generate social
   identities. It is argued that digital social research, particularly the
   analysis of new social media, is distinctive in capturing naturally
   occurring or user-generated' data at the level of populations in real or
   near-real-time. Consequently, it offers the hitherto unrealisable
   possibility of studying social processes as they unfold at the level of
   populations as contrasted with their official construction through the
   use of terrestrial' research instruments and curated data-sets.
   Realising this research potential entails the development of digital
   observatories' such as the Cardiff Online Social Media ObServatory. The
   paper concludes with a discussion of the political and ethical, as well
   as the technological, implications of observatories, focusing in
   particular on tensions between the panoptic' and synoptic' powers of
   digital observatories and the allied possibilities of a signature
   science'.}},

Abstract = {{Antitrust agencies around the world are increasingly focusing on digital
   industries. Critics have justifiably questioned the ability of
   competition agencies to make beneficial enforcement decisions given the
   complexity and rapid pace of change in online markets. This Article
   discusses those criticisms and addresses the argument that, because the
   error costs of overenforcement of antitrust laws in digital markets
   would be much higher than the error costs of underenforcement, courts
   and antitrust agencies should presume against antitrust intervention in
   digital industries. While acknowledging that there is often good reason
   for such modesty in enforcement, this Article discusses several ways in
   which competition policy can adjust to better account for potential
   costs and benefits of enforcement in digital platform markets. It argues
   that nonprice effects related to information and innovation are
   particularly important to the performance of online platforms, and may
   hold the key to a better understanding of the costs of antitrust
   underenforcement and the assessment of the competitive effects of
   conduct and transactions in digital industries.}},

Abstract = {{The charge stored in series-connected lithium batteries needs to be well
   equalized between the elements of the series. We present here an
   innovative lithium-battery cell-to-cell active equalizer capable of
   moving charge between series-connected cells using a super-capacitor as
   an energy tank. The system temporarily stores the charge drawn from a
   cell in the super-capacitor, then the charge is moved into another cell
   without wasting energy as it happens in passive equalization. The
   architecture of the system which employs a digitally-controlled
   switching converter is compared with the state of the art, then fully
   investigated, together with the methodology used in its design. The
   performance of the system is described by presenting and discussing the
   experimental results of laboratory tests. The most innovative and
   attractive aspect of the proposed system is its very high efficiency,
   which is over 90\%.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of genes that control root system architecture in crop
   plants requires innovations that enable high-throughput and accurate
   measurements of root system architecture through time. We demonstrate
   the ability of a semiautomated 3D in vivo imaging and digital
   phenotyping pipeline to interrogate the quantitative genetic basis of
   root system growth in a rice biparental mapping population, Bala x
   Azucena. We phenotyped >1,400 3D root models and >57,000 2D images for a
   suite of 25 traits that quantified the distribution, shape, extent of
   exploration, and the intrinsic size of root networks at days 12, 14, and
   16 of growth in a gellan gum medium. From these data we identified 89
   quantitative trait loci, some of which correspond to those found
   previously in soil-grown plants, and provide evidence for genetic
   tradeoffs in root growth allocations, such as between the extent and
   thoroughness of exploration. We also developed a multivariate method for
   generating and mapping central root architecture phenotypes and used it
   to identify five major quantitative trait loci (r(2) = 24-37\%), two of
   which were not identified by our univariate analysis. Our imaging and
   analytical platform provides a means to identify genes with high
   potential for improving root traits and agronomic qualities of crops.}},

Abstract = {{Modern miniaturization and the digitalization of characterization
   instruments greatly facilitate the diffusion of technological advances
   in new fields and generate innovative applications. The concept of a
   portable, inexpensive and semi-automated biosensing platform, or
   lab-on-a-chip, is a vision shared by many researchers and venture
   industries. Under this scope, we present a semiconductor monolithic
   integration approach to conduct surface plasmon resonance studies. This
   technology is already commonly used for biochemical characterization in
   pharmaceutical industries, but we have reduced the technological
   platform to a few nanometers in scale on a semiconductor chip. We
   evaluate the signal quality of this nanophotonic device using
   hyperspectral-imaging technology, and we compare its performance with
   that of a standard prism-based commercial system. Two standard
   biochemical agents are employed for this characterization study: bovine
   serum albumin and inactivated influenza A virus. Time resolutions of
   data acquisition varying between 360 and 2.2 s are presented, yielding
   2.7x10(-5)-1.5x10(-6) RIU resolutions, respectively.}},

Title = {{Implementing a Swedish regionalized medical program supported by digital
   technologies: possibilities and challenges from a management perspective}},
Journal = {{RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In 2011, Umea University in Sweden was facing its first
   attempt to transform the existing medical program into a regionalized
   medical program (RMP), supported by the use of digital technologies. The
   Swedish RMP means that students are distributed in geographically
   separated groups while doing their five clinical clerkship semesters. To
   provide medical students with ways of undertaking their theoretical
   studies when geographically distributed, digital technologies are used
   for educational and administrative purposes. In this article, the
   Swedish RMP will be described and related to previous international
   research on educating medical students in rural settings. The aim of
   this article was, from a management perspective, to understand if and
   how contradictions arise during the implementation process of the
   Swedish RMP, supported by digital technologies. Based on this analysis,
   a further aim was to discuss, from a management perspective, the
   possibilities and challenges for improvement of this medical educational
   practice, as well as to provide implications for other similar changes
   in medical programs internationally.
   Method: To identify possible contradictions during the implementation
   process, ethnographically inspired observations were made during
   management work meetings, before and during the first regionalized
   semester. In addition, in-depth follow-up interviews were held in May
   and June 2011 with six management executives of the Swedish RMP,
   concerning their expectations and experiences of the implementation
   process. The qualitative and activity theory (AT)-inspired analysis
   resulted in the emergence of two main themes and seven sub-themes.
   Results: The analysis suggests that a number of contradictions arose
   during the implementation process of the Swedish RMP. For instance, a
   contradiction constituted as a conflict between the university
   management and some teachers concerning how digital technologies and
   technology enhanced learning (TEL) could and should be used when
   educating medical students. In addition, due to the use of digital
   technologies the implementation process helped to reveal existing
   problems and tensions in educational practice, not previously visible to
   management. These included contradictions such as a lack of alignment in
   how course goals, teaching practices, and examinations should be carried
   out. Further, obsolete course content and overlap between courses and
   subjects were identified, leading to an overhaul of all semesters, not
   only those regionalized.
   Conclusion: This study showed how contradictions in educational practice
   arose when the Swedish RMP, supported by digital technologies, was
   implemented. These contradictions involve both possibilities and
   challenges for management to improve how and with what quality the
   Swedish RMP is conducted. A challenge for management is to find the most
   effective way to enhance up-take and use of the more interactive and
   innovative TEL-solutions. However, a possibility is that the
   regionalization process and implemented improvements may also influence
   non-regionalized semesters, with the potential to eventually increase
   the quality of the entire program.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the architecture, design and test results of an ASIC
   specifically designed for the readout of gaseous detectors. The primary
   application is the readout of the Linear Collider Time Projection
   Chamber. The small area available mm channel requires an innovative
   design, where sensitive analog components and massive digital
   functionalities are integrated on the same chip. Moreover, shut down
   (power pulsing) features are necessary in order to reduce the power
   consumption. The Super-Altro is a 16-channel demonstrator ASIC involving
   analog and digital signal processing. Each channel contains a low noise
   Pre-Amplifier and Shaping Amplifier (PASA), a pipeline ADC, and a
   Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The PASA is programmable in terms of
   gain and shaping time and can operate with both positive and negative
   polarities of input charge. The 10-bit ADC samples the output of the
   PASA at a frequency up to 40 MHz before providing the digitized signal
   to the DSP which performs baseline subtraction, signal conditioning,
   drift correction and zero suppression. The chip has been fabricated in a
   130 nm CMOS technology. Test measurements show correct functionality of
   the full system, and demonstrate that, using appropriate design
   techniques, the extensive digital circuitries produce little or no
   degradation of analog performance (particularly noise).}},

Abstract = {{BCH codes are adopted in many systems, such as flash memory, optical
   communications, and digital video broadcasting. By trying 2(eta) test
   vectors, the soft-decision Chase decoding algorithm of BCH codes can
   achieve significant coding gain over hard-decision decoding. Previous
   one-pass Chase schemes find the error locators based on the Berlekamp's
   algorithm and need hardware-demanding selection methods to decide which
   locator corresponds to the correct code word. In this brief, a novel
   interpolation-based one-pass Chase decoder is proposed for BCH codes. By
   making use of the binary property of BCH codes, an innovative yet
   low-complexity method is developed to select the interpolation output
   leading to successful decoding without bringing any performance loss.
   The code word recovery step is also significantly simplified through
   nontrivial mathematical derivations. From architectural analysis, the
   proposed decoder with eta = 4for a (4200, 4096) BCH code has 2.3 times
   higher efficiency in terms of throughput-over-area ratio than the prior
   one-pass Chase decoder based on the Berlekamp's algorithm, while
   achieving the same error-correcting performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper poses the question of whether innovation policies are
   customized to meet the varying needs of different regions and
   industries. The research questions are: (a) are the investigated
   innovation initiatives context sensitive and customized to the
   prevailing innovation problems and, hence, to what extent do they focus
   on overcoming specific bottlenecks in the particular regional innovation
   system and address system failures hampering innovation; (b) have
   innovation policies aiming to support specific industries recognized the
   differences and, if yes, have they been customized accordingly? The
   paper discusses emerging forms of local/regional innovation policy
   using, as cases in point, Finland and especially two different
   industries (intelligent machinery and digital content services) in three
   different kinds of regional innovation system. The empirical research is
   based on data gathered (a) through 40 interviews with Finnish innovation
   policy makers and (b) through 91 structured interviews with firm
   representatives; (c) in addition, interview data from another study with
   53 national-level innovation policy makers are exploited. The empirical
   analysis shows that, in spite of a shared understanding about the
   generic principles of the innovation policy and the investigated
   local/regional policy, initiatives are clearly customized to serve the
   current challenges of the specific regions and industries.}},

Title = {{Crowd-Funded Micro-Grants for Genomics and ``Big Data{''}: An Actionable

Abstract = {{Biomedical science in the 21st century is embedded in, and draws from, a
   digital commons and ``Big Data{''} created by high-throughput Omics
   technologies such as genomics. Classic Edisonian metaphors of science
   and scientists (i.e., ``the lone genius{''} or other narrow definitions
   of expertise) are ill equipped to harness the vast promises of the 21st
   century digital commons. Moreover, in medicine and life sciences,
   experts often under-appreciate the important contributions made by
   citizen scholars and lead users of innovations to design innovative
   products and co-create new knowledge. We believe there are a large
   number of users waiting to be mobilized so as to engage with Big Data as
   citizen scientists-only if some funding were available. Yet many of
   these scholars may not meet the meta-criteria used to judge expertise,
   such as a track record in obtaining large research grants or a
   traditional academic curriculum vitae. This innovation research article
   describes a novel idea and action framework: micro-grants, each worth
   \$1000, for genomics and Big Data. Though a relatively small amount at
   first glance, this far exceeds the annual income of the ``bottom one
   billion{''}-the 1.4 billion people living below the extreme poverty
   level defined by the World Bank (\$1.25/day). We describe two types of
   micro-grants. Type 1 micro-grants can be awarded through established
   funding agencies and philanthropies that create micro-granting programs
   to fund a broad and highly diverse array of small artisan labs and
   citizen scholars to connect genomics and Big Data with new models of
   discovery such as open user innovation. Type 2 micro-grants can be
   funded by existing or new science observatories and citizen think tanks
   through crowd-funding mechanisms described herein. Type 2 micro-grants
   would also facilitate global health diplomacy by co-creating
   crowd-funded micro-granting programs across nation-states in regions
   facing political and financial instability, while sharing similar
   disease burdens, therapeutics, and diagnostic needs. We report the
   creation of ten Type 2 micro-grants for citizen science and artisan labs
   to be administered by the nonprofit Data-Enabled Life Sciences Alliance
   International (DELSA Global, Seattle). Our hope is that these
   micro-grants will spur novel forms of disruptive innovation and genomics
   translation by artisan scientists and citizen scholars alike. We
   conclude with a neglected voice from the global health frontlines, the
   American University of Iraq in Sulaimani, and suggest that many similar
   global regions are now poised for micro-grant enabled collective
   innovation to harness the 21st century digital commons.}},

Abstract = {{In any country the health sector is important in terms of human
   wellbeing and large in terms of economics. The health sector might
   therefore be expected to be a finely tuned enterprise, utilising
   corporate knowledge in a constant process of critically reviewing and
   improving its activities and processes. However, this is seldom the
   case. Health systems and practice are highly variable and lag behind
   research discovery. This contrasts strongly with commercial bodies, and
   particularly service industries, where the concept of the learning
   organisation is strongly seen as the key to optimisation. A learning
   organisation accesses for analytic purposes operational data, which
   though captured and recorded for day-to-day transactions at the customer
   level, become also the basis of understanding changes in both demand and
   delivery process.
   In health care, the concept of the learning organisation is well
   grounded ethically. Anything which can improve health, including
   understanding of optimal care delivery processes and how to improve
   longer term outcomes, should be seized upon to drive service improvement
   - but currently this occurs haphazardly. The limitations of paper-based
   systems, priority given to digitalization of financial transactions,
   concerns about electronic data insecurity, and other factors have
   inhibited progress towards organisational learning at a national scale.
   But in recent years, new means of capturing, managing, and exchanging
   data have created new opportunities, while ever increasing pressures on
   health systems have produced strengthened incentive.
   In the United States, the current policy and investment impetus to
   electronic health records and concomitantly their `meaningful use'
   create opportunities to build the foundations for data re-use for
   corporate learning - and thus for societal gain. In Europe and other
   settings there are islands of innovation, but not yet a coherent culture
   or impetus to build foundations for a learning health system. This paper
   considers how to move forward, in the light of the urgent need for
   smarter health systems where experience becomes the fuel for rapid
   improvement, and best practices are routinely identified and applied.

Abstract = {{Ginga is the middleware of the Japanese-Brazilian terrestrial digital TV
   (DTV) system, ISDB-T B, and also the ITU Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation for Internet Protocol
   television services. Ginga supports NCL (Nested Context Language)
   applications in its declarative environment (Ginga-NCL) for which we
   devise an architecture for plug-in integration. This paper focuses on
   this plug-in architecture and its innovative solutions, detailing the
   plug-in API, life-cycle and control model, besides discussing how the
   architecture can be extended to other software systems, in particular to
   other DTV middleware systems. In the paper, we show how Ginga-NCL can
   embed other declarative language engines. On the other hand, we also
   extend an HTML browser to allow it to embed Ginga-NCL. This proof-of-
   concept is important because NCL and HTML players are not only the most
   common players found in DTV middleware systems but also because they are
   ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector Recommendations for
   terrestrial and Internet Protocol television services (NCL and Broadcast
   Markup Language (BML)/Lightweight Interactive Multimedia Environment
   (LIME)). Therefore, this proof-of-concept also provides a contribution
   to DTV middleware interoperability. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{What is the contribution of innovation brokers in leveraging research
   and development (R\&D) investment to enhance industry-wide capabilities?
   The case of the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Construction
   Innovation (CRC CI) is considered in the context of motivating supply
   chain firms to improve their organizational capabilities in order to
   acquire, assimilate, transfer and exploit R\&D outcomes to their
   advantage, and to create broader industry and national benefits. A
   previous audit and analysis has shown an increase in business R\&D
   investment since 2001. The role of the CRC CI in contributing to growth
   in the absorptive capacity of the Australian construction industry as a
   whole is illustrated through two programmes: digital modelling/building
   information modelling (BIM) and construction site safety. Numerous
   positive outcomes in productivity, quality, improved safety and
   competitiveness were achieved between 2001 and 2009.}},

Abstract = {{CLSR welcomes occasional comment pieces on issues of current importance
   in the law and technology field. The current debate on the Commission's
   proposal for a new data protection framework includes a plethora of very
   specific issues. As important as these may be, it should not be
   overlooked that the very principles of data protection are at stake at
   the moment. Given the lobby efforts to exclude large parts of today's
   data processing from the ambit of the proposed Regulation, to weaken the
   principle of informed consent, and to broaden the exceptions for
   ``legitimate interests{''}, we want to stress that data protection in
   Europe needs to be strengthened, and that this can be achieved without
   threatening innovation and legitimate business models. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Regulating former telecommunications monopolies has often been legally
   and technically complex. Among other options, incumbent operators were
   mandated to share, sell or split their infrastructure thus encouraging
   market entry. Given the importance of broadband technologies,
   competitive access has become a policy priority. We use data from 167
   broadband markets over a period of 11 years. Firm and intra-platform
   competition on the incumbent's legacy network (Digital Subscriber Line)
   accelerate adoption of broadband, whereas competition over different
   access technologies does not. The duration of the different regulatory
   effects shows that simpler network changes have a long-lasting yet
   delayed effect compared to technically demanding ones.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports on an innovative approach toward sensing reactive
   gases in air. The approach is bio-inspired in the sense in that it
   combines the process of gas detection with the natural process of
   breathing. In our approach, a sensor substrate with inter-digital
   electrodes on top is operated at a temperature T-sub while it is exposed
   to alternating flows of warm, humid and cold, dry air. The temperatures
   of both air flows are T-source and T-amb, respectively, and satisfy the
   condition T-source > T-sub > T-amb. With both source and substrate
   temperatures staying close to the ambient temperature T-amb, the method
   allows sequences of thin water layers to be condensed on the sensor
   substrate and to be evaporated again within a time scale of seconds. The
   thin water layers, in turn, can perform as single-use sensors for the
   reactive gas concentration in the ambient air by undergoing acid-base
   reactions with these analytes. The ensuing enhanced electrolytic
   conductivity then provides a measure for the momentary reactive gas
   concentration in the ambient air. The fast time response and the
   insignificant sensor drift of this method are due to the rapidity of the
   condensation/re-evaporation process, which continually deposits one-time
   sensors for the reactive gas concentration and which disposes the
   analyte-loaded sensor layers after each measurement has been taken. We
   demonstrate the validity of this approach through a gas detection
   experiment, which shows that NH3 can be detected at room temperature
   with response and recovery times in the order of seconds without showing
   any sign of sensor drift. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances on the Web have generated unprecedented opportunities
   for individuals around the world to assemble into teams. And yet,
   because of the Web, the nature of teams and how they are assembled has
   changed radically. Today, many teams are ad hoc, agile, distributed,
   transient entities that are assembled from a larger primordial network
   of relationships within virtual communities. These assemblages possess
   the potential to unleash the high levels of creativity and innovation
   necessary for productively addressing many of the daunting challenges
   confronting contemporary society. This article argues that Web science
   is particularly well suited to help us realize this potential by making
   a substantial interdisciplinary intellectual investment in (i) advancing
   theories that explain our socio-technical motivations to form teams,
   (ii) the development of new analytic methods and models to untangle the
   unique influences of these motivations on team assembly, (iii)
   harvesting, curating and leveraging the digital trace data offered by
   the Web to test our models, and (iv) implementing recommender systems
   that use insights gleaned from our richer theoretical understanding of
   the motivations that lead to effective team assembly.}},

Abstract = {{A novel phasor estimation algorithm is proposed, by means of an
   innovative modification of the traditional full cycle discrete Fourier
   transformer (FCDFT) algorithm. The main idea is to combine the FCDFT
   outputs for even and odd sample-setsobtained for one cycle data window
   decimated by two and by four. Its performance was compared with the ones
   of other full cycle algorithms reported in the late literature on the
   subject. The obtained results reveal the proposed algorithm leads to the
   best performance, even considering both the decaying DC component of the
   fault current and the one caused by the current transformer secondary
   circuit.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the relative value of open innovation principles
   for digital media, exemplified by the emergence of Open Application
   Programming Interfaces (Open APIs) at four news organizations: The New
   York Times, The Guardian, USA Today and NPR. The use of Open APIs
   represents a shift toward an open innovation paradigm that may help
   address twin challenges facing the news industry: the need for improved
   R\&D and the need for new revenue streams. This paper extends the
   interdisciplinary study of open innovation to digital communication.
   Findings indicate that the use of Open APIs has accelerated R\&D through
   knowledge-sharing with web developers; generated new means of
   commercializing content by extending a firm's product portfolio; and
   forged innovation networks that function as external R\&D departments.
   The article discusses the constant negotiation between openness and
   control, and open and closed paradigms in journalism.}},

Abstract = {{Financial markets have undergone a remarkable transformation over the
   past two decades due to advances in technology. These advances include
   faster and cheaper computers, greater connectivity among market
   participants, and perhaps most important of all, more sophisticated
   trading algorithms. The benefits of such financial technology are
   evident: lower transactions costs, faster executions, and greater volume
   of trades. However, like any technology, trading technology has
   unintended consequences. In this paper, we review key innovations in
   trading technology starting with portfolio optimization in the 1950s and
   ending with high-frequency trading in the late 2000s, as well as
   opportunities, challenges, and economic incentives that accompanied
   these developments. We also discuss potential threats to financial
   stability created or facilitated by algorithmic trading and propose
   ``Financial Regulation 2.0,{''} a set of design principles for bringing
   the current financial regulatory framework into the Digital Age.}},

   Commodity Radios: Design and Proof of Concept}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{We describe a fully-wireless prototype of distributed transmit
   beamforming on a software-defined radio platform. Distributed
   beamforming is a cooperative transmission technique that can achieve
   orders of magnitude increases in range or energy efficiency of wireless
   communication systems. However, this technique requires precise
   synchronization of the radio frequency signal from each transmitter. The
   significance of our prototype is in demonstrating that this requirement
   can be satisfied using digital signal processing methods on commodity
   hardware with low-quality oscillators. Our synchronization approach
   scales to large numbers of transmitters: each transmitter runs
   independent algorithms based on periodically transmitted feedback
   packets from the receiver. A key simplification is the decoupling of the
   algorithms for frequency locking and beamsteering at each transmitter,
   even though both processes use the same feedback packets. Frequency
   locking employs an Extended Kalman filter to track the local oscillator
   offset between a transmitter and the receiver, using frequency offset
   measurements based on the feedback packet waveform, while the phase
   adjustments for beamsteering are determined using a one-bit feedback
   algorithm based on the feedback packet payload. Our prototype
   demonstrates that distributed transmit beamforming can be incorporated
   into wireless networks without requiring hardware innovations, and
   provides open-source building blocks for future research and
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Demands on publicly funded ophthalmic services worldwide
   continue to increase with new treatments, waiting time targets, working
   time limits, and restricted budgets. These highlight the necessity to
   develop innovative ways of utilising existing capacity more effectively.
   Method A new regional, fully electronic ophthalmic-referral service with
   digital imaging was trialled using existing information-technology (IT)
   infrastructure. Following successful pilot study, the service was rolled
   out regionally. Service delivery data was prospectively collated for all
   the attendances in the year prior to (2006) and the year following
   (2008) introduction.
   Results Comparing 2006 against 2008, median waiting times reduced (14 vs
   4 weeks), and fewer new patients were observed (8714 vs 7462 P<0.0001),
   with 1359 referrals receiving electronic diagnosis (e-diagnosis). New
   patient did not arrive (635 vs 503 P<0.0001) and emergencies also
   reduced (2671 v 1984 P<0.0001).
   Discussion Novel use of existing IT infrastructure improves
   communication between primary and secondary care. This promotes more
   effective use of limited outpatient capacity by retaining patients with
   non-progressive, asymptomatic pathology in the community, whilst
   fast-tracking patients with sight-threatening disease. Resultant
   significant, sustained improvements in regional service delivery point
   to a simple model that could easily be adopted by other providers of
   universal healthcare globally. Eye (2013) 27, 392-397;

Abstract = {{Nikhil Bilwakesh, ``Emerson's Decomposition: Parnassus{''} (pp. 520-545)
   This essay offers a new reading of Emerson's late redactorial and
   critical work that evinces a correspondence between bodily and literary
   decomposition. I argue that the critical value of Parnassus (1874) lies
   precisely in its demonstration of Emerson's principles of composition,
   in particular a late compositional style that I define as Emerson's
   ``decomposition.{''} The very difficulty in ``authorizing{''} such a
   text makes us attend to the role of citation and quotation in Emerson's
   work, in larger proprietary questions of nineteenth-century authorship,
   in the twentieth-century discourse of the ``death and rebirth{''} of the
   author, and in a current age when digital dissemination threatens
   copyright value and challenges writers to reconfigure conceptions of
   creative composition in formally innovative works. A revised formal
   appraisal of Parnassus, in its classificatory, literary, and biological
   contexts, is not only instrumental for Emerson scholars, but can also
   help bridge the ample body of theoretical work on the question of the
   author with the undertheorized critical study of the anthology as a
   genre.}},

Abstract = {{Trends in online piracy have reached record levels and threaten
   traditional industry supply chains. Music, motion pictures, print media,
   and software are some of the most vulnerable content pirated online.
   Recent increases in piracy can be historically traced to the digital
   revolution, introduction of the World Wide Web, and growth of broadband
   technologies, rather than a sudden shift in consumer behavior. The
   digital and Internet paradigm shifts have fundamentally changed supply
   chain ecosystems, as well as opened the door to greater acts of piracy.
   Under these new ecosystems, digital rights management (DRM) has proven
   ineffective at stopping piracy. Furthermore, DRM systems have been shown
   to discourage legitimate buyers. A new approach to piracy is needed to
   account for recent changes in supply chain ecosystems. Several industry
   leaders demonstrate effective solutions combining technology and
   innovative business models that encourage consumers toward legitimate
   consumption while leveraging piracy. Given these examples, industries
   can address online piracy by combining appropriate technology,
   innovative business models, and piracy analytics in the evolving supply
   chain ecosystems. (C) 2012 Kelley School of Business, Indiana

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{An innovative aerial survey method called the Landscape Assessment
   System (LAS) was used to assess mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus
   ponderosae)-caused mortality of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) across
   the species distribution in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE; 894
   774 ha). This large-scale implementation of the LAS method consisted of
   8673 km of flight lines, along which 4653 geo-tagged, oblique aerial
   photos were captured at the catchment level (a subset of 12-digit USGS
   hydrologic units) and geographic information system (GIS) processed. The
   Mountain Pine Beetle-caused Mortality Rating System, a landscape-scale
   classification system designed specifically to measure the cumulative
   effects of recent and older MPB attacks on whitebark pine, was used to
   classify mortality with a rating from 0 to 6 based on the amount of red
   (recent attack) and gray (old attack) trees visible. The approach
   achieved a photo inventory of 79\% of the GYE whitebark pine
   distribution. For the remaining 21\%, mortality levels were estimated
   based on an interpolated surface. Results that combine the
   photo-inventoried and interpolated mortality indicate that nearly half
   (46\%) of the GYE whitebark pine distribution showed severe mortality
   (3-4 or 5.3-5.4 rating), 36\% showed moderate mortality (2-2.9 rating),
   13\% showed low mortality (1-1.9 rating), and 5\% showed trace levels of
   mortality (0-0.9). These results reveal that the proliferation of MPB in
   the subalpine zone of the GYE due to climate warming has led to
   whitebark pine mortality that is more severe and widespread than
   indicated from either previous modeling research or USDA Forest Service
   Aerial Detection surveys. Sixteen of the 22 major mountain ranges of the
   GYE have experienced widespread moderate-to-severe mortality. The
   majority of catchments in the other six mountain ranges show
   low-to-moderate mortality. Refugia from MPB outbreaks, at least for now,
   also exist and correspond to locations that have colder microclimates.
   The spatially explicit mortality information produced by this project
   has helped forest managers develop and implement conservation strategies
   that include both preservation and restoration efforts. Future research
   aimed at documenting and quantifying the ecological impacts of
   widespread decline and collapse of this foundation and keystone species
   is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Ownership of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones by
   health professionals is increasingly common. Providing the best
   available evidence at the point of care is important for time-poor
   clinical staff and may lead to benefits in the processes and outcomes of
   clinical care. This review was performed to investigate the usefulness
   of PDAs in the clinical setting. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 2000
   to March 2010. Randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects
   on the processes or outcomes of clinical care of using PDAs compared
   with not using a PDA were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed
   citations and abstracts, assessed full text articles and abstracted data
   from the studies. Seven trials met the review inclusion criteria, of
   which only three were of satisfactory quality. Studies investigated the
   use of PDAs either in recording patient information or in decision
   support for diagnoses or treatment. An increase in data collection
   quality was reported, and the appropriateness of diagnosis and treatment
   decisions was improved. PDAs appear to have potential in improving some
   processes and outcomes of clinical care, but the evidence is limited and
   reliable conclusions on whether they help, in what circumstances and how
   they should be used are not possible. Further research is required to
   assess their value and ensure full benefits from their widespread use,
   but the pace of technological development creates problems for the
   timely evaluation of these devices and their applications.}},

Abstract = {{In emerging cognitive radio, spectrum sensing with good quality is
   important. Pilot tone detection method is one of the most effective
   spectrum sensing methods. In DTV (Digital TV) pilot detection, total
   energy can be calculated using only the pilot signal amplitudes in the
   frequency domain, instead of total energy of the 6 MHz DTV channel.
   Therefore, significant energy saving can be achieved. However, if the
   pilot signal suffers from deep fading, detection may not even be
   possible at all. In this study, with an innovative approach, improvement
   in spectrum sensing quality besides the energy efficiency is shown by
   detailed simulations by taking advantage of the cooperative structure
   and the Goertzel algorithm in the case of pilot signal narrow band
   energy detection and very low probability of deep fading of the pilot
   signal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a pair of compact CW/FM airborne SAR systems for
   small UAV-based operation (wingspan of 3.5 m) for low-cost testing of
   innovative SAR concepts. Two different SAR instruments, using the C and
   X bands, have been developed in the context of the ARBRES project, each
   of them achieving a payload weight below 5 Kg and a volume of 13.5 dm(3)
   (sensor and controller). Every system has a dual receiving channel which
   allows operation in interferometric or polarimetric modes. Planar
   printed array antennas are used in both sensors for easy system
   integration and better isolation between transmitter and receiver
   subsystems. First experimental tests on board a 3.2 m wingspan
   commercial radio-controlled aircraft are presented. The SAR images of a
   field close to an urban area have been focused using a back-projection
   algorithm. Using the dual channel capability, a single pass
   interferogram and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) has been obtained which
   agrees with the scene topography. A simple Motion Compensation (MoCo)
   module, based on the information from an Inertial+GPS unit, has been
   included to compensate platform motion errors with respect to the
   nominal straight trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{Taiwan is a personal computer (PC) manufacturing powerhouse, producing
   desktop (DT) computers, notebooks (NB), and netbooks (NetB). However,
   the emergence of tablets such as Apple's iPad, has threatened the PC
   market's prospects and significantly affected Taiwan's PC ecosystem.
   This study proposes a modified Delphi with end-user participation to
   provide strategic foresight for firms in Taiwan's PC ecosystem. The
   results show that these firms can adopt the following three strategies
   in response to the impact of tablets: (1) brand and service innovation,
   (2) focus on cloud technology and marketing products to China, and (3)
   cooperating with digital leisure and entertainment industry. We believe
   that this modified Delphi with end-user-participation model is a
   valuable foresight tool for products with a short life cycle, such as
   consumer electronics and fashion products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{With the growing sophistication and use of information technology, the
   past decade has witnessed a major growth in financial cybercrime. This
   paper focuses specifically on credit card fraud and identity theft,
   examining the globalisation of these activities within a `digital
   ecosystem' conceptual framework. The relevance of concepts and
   analytical tools typically used to study legitimate businesses, such as
   value chains, dynamic capabilities and business models, is explored and
   tested for their relevance in understanding the scale and nature of
   illegal activities which are dependant upon innovation and the
   collective activities of global participants. It is argued that
   developing a better understanding of how such illegal activities are
   organised and operate will assist policy makers, law enforcement
   agencies and security firms to identify trends and concentrate limited
   resources in a most effective manner. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Future spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions shall benefit
   from digital beamforming (DBF) techniques with the goal of generating
   high-resolution wide-swath imagery. The basic idea is to replace parts
   of the analog receiver hardware by digital components, increasing the
   flexibility of such systems. The limited transmit power rises the need
   of large antennas capable of electronically steering the antenna beam
   over a large angular domain. An innovative concept is the usage of large
   unfoldable mesh-reflector antennas in combination with digital feed
   arrays. An inherent problem of such systems is, that every feed element
   illuminates, after reflection from the main reflector, an essentially
   non-overlapping angular domain in the far field. In case of an element
   failure the radar system would be `blind' in the specific direction. To
   circumvent costly redundant receiver hardware a new approach to increase
   the reliability of such systems has been studied. The approach is based
   on a so called defocused reflector which grants visibility of the
   complete angular domain under failure conditions. This article presents
   the electromagnetic considerations leading to the defocused reflector
   concept. The performance of the defocused reflector system is evaluated
   in comparison to a conventional parabolic reflector system, utilizing
   digital beamforming techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Fourcy, D. and Lorvelec, O., 2013. A new digital map of limits of oceans
   and seas consistent with high-resolution global shorelines. Journal of
   Coastal Research, 29(2), 471-477. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN
   0749-0208.
   We present a vector map of the limits of oceans and seas intended to be
   integrated into a geographic information system (GIS). This map is based
   on the document S-23 titled ``Limits of Oceans and Seas{''} and
   published by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). The
   third edition of this document, published in 1953, still serves as an
   official reference. The realization of this map from a text containing
   numerous ambiguities, disused place-names, or imprecise coordinates
   required important documentary investigations. This was made possible
   through the use of online resources such as map libraries, satellite
   imageries, geographic names databases, and institutional geoportals. The
   main innovations of our map are its accuracy, its precision of about 10
   s of meridian arc, and its consistency with the Global, Self-consistent,
   Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline database and with satellite
   images such as Land Satellite and moderate-resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer. All remaining uncertainties for the drawing of limits
   are presented in the results. Although based on an IHO document, our map
   does not possess any official status. Nevertheless, we hope that our map
   will facilitate and encourage more detailed spatial analyses related to
   oceans and seas. This map is freely available for noncommercial use.}},

Abstract = {{Within six months of the discovery of X-ray in 1895, the technology was
   used to scan the interior of the human body, paving the way for many
   innovations in the field of medicine, including an ultrasound device in
   1950, a CT scanner in 1972, and MRI in 1980. More recent decades have
   witnessed developments such as digital imaging using a picture archiving
   and communication system, computer-aided detection/diagnosis,
   organ-specific workstations, and molecular, functional, and quantitative
   imaging. One of the latest technical breakthrough in the field of
   radiology has been imaging genomics and robotic interventions for biopsy
   and theragnosis. This review provides an engineering perspective on
   these developments and several other megatrends in radiology.}},

Abstract = {{The Ricatti stochastic digital filter as an estimator is based on a
   first differences order model with uncorrelated innovation properties
   bounding the spatial operation region with two auxiliary equations. This
   permits optimal results having the traditional inversion instead of the
   pseudo-inverse strategy. The stationary conditions and uncorrelated
   trajectories were the tools applied in adaptive estimation and
   identification integrated form. In spite of the black-box form observing
   the output system, the parametre and identification simulation achieved
   a great convergence rate in agreement with functional error. It was
   built considering the identification second probability moment defined
   as the difference between the desired signal and the output filter
   response. The parametres estimated were inside the unit circle and had a
   great advantage because the primitive solution depends on their values.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing technology has great potential for measuring lake
   inundation areas and lake levels, and providing important lake water
   quantity and quality information which can be used for improving our
   understanding of climate change impacts on the global water cycle, and
   assessing the influence of the projected future climate change on the
   global water resources. One remote sensing approach is to estimate lake
   level from satellite measured inundation area based on the inundation
   area lake level rating (IALLR) curves. However, this approach is not
   easy to implement because of a lack of data for constructing the IALLR
   curves. In this study, an innovative and robust approach to construct
   the IALLR curves from the digital elevation model (DEM) data collected
   during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was developed and
   tested. It was shown that the IALLR curves derived from the SRTM DEM
   data could be used to retrieve lake level from satellite measured
   inundation area. Applying the constructed IALLR curve to the estimated
   inundation areas from 16 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, 16 lake
   levels of Lake Champlain in Vermont were obtained. The root mean square
   error (RMSE) of the estimated lake levels compared to the observed water
   levels at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauging station (04294500)
   at Burlington, Vermont is about 0.12 m. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study examined the construct of community and its development in
   online spaces through a qualitative analysis of middle school students'
   participation in a private social network. Drawing on notions of
   community inspired by philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, we found that
   students, despite not knowing one another previously, were willing both
   to encounter and come to know each other, using the resources of the
   network to build the trust that became foundational to their online
   social relationships. They did so primarily through two kinds of
   interactional effort that we call ``public work{''} and ``proximity
   work{''}. Negotiating their positions relative to one another (proximity
   work) and across public/private spaces (public work), youth used a
   variety of semiotic tools to establish relationships and address the
   considerable challenges of digitally mediated communication with unknown
   others. This study suggests that educationally focused social networks
   can be designed for, or their uses primed toward, communicative purposes
   and activities foregrounding reciprocal exchange that is ethically alert
   and socially aware, and that schools and other educational institutions,
   though historically resistant to technological innovation, have an
   important role to play in this process.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents in summary a selection of the work conducted by
   OECD in the field of technology and education, which has been an
   on-going focus of OECD work since the 1980s. Recently, much of this has
   been under the heading of New Millennium Learners', but it has also
   included the widening of student achievement surveys towards digital
   literacy; reviews of e-learning in higher education, surveys on Open
   Education Resources (OER); technology as a source of innovation; and
   analyses of the digital resources market and educational technology
   patents. The article proposes the more holistic focus on learning
   environments' through which to analyse the very diverse ways in which
   technology can be integrated into education and as a design framework.
   This is drawn from a report of the OECD Innovative Learning Environments
   (ILE) project to be published in 2013, itself based on 40 case studies
   from different countries and regions. It suggests that contemporary
   learning environments should be: i) Innovating the pedagogical core';
   ii) Engaging the Design/Redesign Leadership Circle'; iii) Widening
   connections and capacity through partnerships; and iv) Promoting 21st
   century effectiveness (based on the principles derived from the 2010 ILE
   learning research review). The article then applies this framework to
   show how technology shapes learning environments in many different ways.
   The article questions over-reliance on individuals navigating
   successfully to access non-formal learning opportunities and rejects the
   argument that learning institutions should simply adapt more adequately
   to available technologies. Instead, technology should be fully exploited
   in well-designed learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{The ever accelerating state of technology has powered an increasing
   interest in heat transfer solutions and process engineering innovations
   in the microfluidics domain. In order to carry out such developments,
   reliable heat transfer diagnostic techniques are necessary.
   Thermo-liquid crystal (TLC) thermography, in combination with particle
   image velocimetry, has been a widely accepted and commonly used
   technique for the simultaneous measurement and characterization of
   temperature and velocity fields in macroscopic fluid flows for several
   decades. However, low seeding density, volume illumination, and low TLC
   particle image quality at high magnifications present unsurpassed
   challenges to its application to three-dimensional flows with
   microscopic dimensions. In this work, a measurement technique to
   evaluate the color response of individual non-encapsulated TLC particles
   is presented. A Shirasu porous glass membrane emulsification approach
   was used to produce the non-encapsulated TLC particles with a narrow
   size distribution and a multi-variable calibration procedure, making use
   of all three RGB and HSI color components, as well as the proper
   orthogonally decomposed RGB components, was used to achieve
   unprecedented low uncertainty levels in the temperature estimation of
   individual particles, opening the door to simultaneous temperature and
   velocity tracking using 3D velocimetry techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation explores the effectiveness of a teacher preparation
   program aligned with situated learning theory on preservice science
   teachers' use of technology during their student teaching experiences.
   Participants included 26 preservice science teachers enrolled in a
   2-year Master of Teaching program. A specific program goal was to
   prepare teachers to use technology to support reform-based science
   instruction. To this end, the program integrated technology instruction
   across five courses and situated this instruction within the context of
   learning and teaching science. A variety of data sources were used to
   characterize the participants' intentions and instructional practices,
   including classroom observations, lesson plans, interviews, and written
   reflections. Data analysis followed a constant comparative process with
   the goal of describing if, how, and why the participants integrated
   technology into their instruction and the extent to which they applied,
   adapted, and innovated upon what they learned in the science teacher
   preparation program. Results indicate that all participants used
   technology throughout their student teaching for reform-based science
   instruction. Additionally, they used digital images, videos, animations,
   and simulations to teach process skills, support inquiry instruction,
   and to enhance student engagement in ways that represented application,
   adaptation, and innovation upon what they learned in the science
   teaching methods program. Participants cited several features of the
   science teacher preparation program that helped them to effectively
   integrate technology into their instruction. These included
   participating in science lessons in which technology was modeled in the
   context of specific instructional approaches, collaborating with peers,
   and opportunities for feedback and reflection after teaching lessons.
   The findings of this study suggest that situated learning theory may
   provide an effective structure for preparing preservice teachers to
   integrate technology in ways that support reform-based instruction. (c)

Abstract = {{Practical training is what brings imagination and creativity to
   fruition, which relies significantly on the relevant technical skills
   needed. Thus, the current study has placed its emphasis on strengthening
   the learning of technical skills with emerging innovations in
   technology, while studying the effects of employing such technologies at
   the same time. As for the students who participated in the study,
   technical skills had been cultivated in the five dimensions of
   knowledge, comprehension, simulation, application, and creativity, in
   accordance to the set teaching objectives and the taxonomy for students
   learning outcome, while the virtual reality learning environment (VRLE)
   has also been developed to meet different goals as the various technical
   skills were being examined. In terms of the nature of technology,
   operation of machines, selection of process parameters, and process
   planning in technical skills, VRLE has also designed the six modules of
   ``learning resource{''}, ``digital content{''}, ``collaborative
   learning{''}, ``formative evaluation{''}, ``simulation of manufacturing
   process{''}, and ``practical exercise{''} in particular for providing
   students with assistance in the development on their technical skills on
   a specific, gradual basis. After assessing the technical skills that
   have been developed for the time period of one semester, the students
   have reported finding VRLE to be a significantly effective method when
   considering the three dimensions of ``operation of machines{''},
   ``selection of process parameter{''}, and ``process planning{''}, though
   not so much so when it came to the dimension of ``nature of
   technology{''}. Among the six modules, ``simulation of manufacturing
   process{''} and ``practical exercise{''} were the two that were most
   preferred by students for the three dimensions considered. Crown

Abstract = {{Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been widely used for Earth remote
   sensing for more than 30 years. It provides high-resolution,
   day-and-night and weather-independent images for a multitude of
   applications ranging from geoscience and climate change research,
   environmental and Earth system monitoring, 2-D and 3-D mapping, change
   detection, 4-D mapping (space and time), security-related applications
   up to planetary exploration. With the advances in radar technology and
   geo/bio-physical parameter inversion modeling in the 90s, using data
   from several airborne and spaceborne systems, a paradigm shift occurred
   from the development driven by the technology push to the user demand
   pull. Today, more than 15 spaceborne SAR systems are being operated for
   innumerous applications. This paper provides first a tutorial about the
   SAR principles and theory, followed by an overview of established
   techniques like polarimetry, interferometry and differential
   interferometry as well as of emerging techniques (e.g., polarimetric SAR
   interferometry, tomography and holographic tomography). Several
   application examples including the associated parameter inversion
   modeling are provided for each case. The paper also describes innovative
   technologies and concepts like digital beamforming, Multiple-Input
   Multiple-Output (MIMO) and bi- and multi-static configurations which are
   suitable means to fulfill the increasing user requirements. The paper
   concludes with a vision for SAR remote sensing.}},

Abstract = {{The oscillator or waveform generator is at the heart of the musical
   sound synthesizers technology. A digital oscillator is the discrete time
   counterpart of the analog voltage control oscillator. A band-limited
   oscillator (BLO) is a digital oscillator that explicitly limits the
   power of the aliasing artifacts. It aims at reproducing on a Digital
   Signal Processor (DSP) the popular waveforms such as pulse-width
   modulated (PWM) square, sawtooth or triangle waveforms. The generation
   of a band-limited impulse train (BLIT) is central to most BLO
   algorithms. Most BLIT algorithms are based on finite impulse response
   (FIR) filters. The paper presents an innovative scheme for constructing
   a BLIT based on infinite impulse response (IIR) filters which have
   better stopband rejection performances. The BLIT is actually obtained by
   emulating the sampling at an arbitrary sampling rate of an impulse train
   filtered by an analog IIR filter. The method is flexible because, at the
   end, it relies on the classical design of an analog low-pass filter.
   Furthermore the complexity of the method is not impacted by the length
   of the impulse response. Finally, as for most BLIT based methods, the
   power of the aliasing artifacts is reduced even in case of frequency or
   pulse width modulation in the audio range.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a framework that enables Internet service
   providers (ISPs) to provide multimedia content to generic devices
   located inside the domestic networks of their customers (such as PCs and
   generic media players) in a seamless manner. In order to achieve this
   transparent integration between ISP-provided multimedia content and
   generic consumer media players, the domestic gateway becomes a managed
   UPnP AV/DLNA (Universal Plug and Play/Digital Living Network Alliance)
   media server, which can be dynamically updated by the broadband operator
   using Broadband Forum's CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) WAN Management
   Protocol (CWMP) extensions specifically designed for this purpose. This
   framework enables the domestic gateway to become a mediator for both
   operator-provided and Internet media content, provided through UPnP
   services visible inside the domestic LAN. The adoption of a neutral
   UPnP/DLNA architecture that uses plugins to abstract each service allows
   it to become independent of the domestic gateway platform, allowing ISPs
   to easily add support for new media services while better coping with

Title = {{From perceptual supplementation to the accessibility of digital spaces:
   The case of free exploration of city maps for blind persons}},
Journal = {{IRBM}},

Abstract = {{Accessibility of urban and digital spaces is still a challenge for the
   blind or visually impaired people. Information and communication
   technologies open new opportunities to design innovative solutions for
   the sake of accessibility for all. For this concern, the development of
   perceptual supplementation systems is a promising solution. In the
   framework of the Tactile interactions for orientation, information and
   presence (ITOIP) project, we aim at developing the use of the Tactos
   technology which enables blind users to access digital shapes through
   the sense of touch. Within this project, we designed new applications
   for Tactos with the partnership of a blind and visually impaired persons
   local association. Our research is grounded on sensory motor theories of
   perception. We illustrate our approach with the case of Tactos map: an
   application that enables street maps free exploration with no need of
   sight. During the design of Tactos map, we were confronted with the
   problem of enabling users to access content beyond the screen viewport.
   This problem and the proposed solution highlights the dialog between
   theoretical and design perspectives at the heart of our approach. The
   performances and remarks from the first Tactos map users let us envision
   several issues to address in our future work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson

   behavior of welded sheet joints}},
Journal = {{METALLURGIA ITALIANA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{41-47}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The existence of a welded zone generally influences the local strain and
   stress distribution especially in case of welding defects. A method able
   to measure the local deformability can hence give many important
   information about the real stress and strain fields useful to improve
   the welded structure design. In this experimental work, some new
   generation automotive steels have been considered, because of the well
   known welding problems due to their unstable microstructural condition.
   Such materials, known as Q\&P steels and available only as thin sheets,
   require a suitable quenching process able to give high mechanical
   resistance and satisfying deformability. Some sheet samples were welded
   by electron beam technique, because it is able to reduce the width of
   the heat affected zone where the main microstructural changes are
   concentrated. From such samples, tensile specimens were machined. During
   the tensile tests, the deformations were measured both by a traditional
   extensometer and by a 3D Digital Image Correlation (3D DIC) technique. A
   preliminary investigation of the melted and the heat affected zones
   resulted in small dimensions (about 10 mm) and hence the measuring setup
   has been optimized in order maximize the achievable measuring resolution
   minimizing the resulting uncertainty. This result can be achieved by a
   pattern generated by a suitable software and by an accurate preparation
   of the surface where the pattern will be deposited on.}},

Abstract = {{Physical cardiovascular examination, particularly cardiac auscultation,
   is one of the most difficult clinical skills for students during their
   medical training. Studies suggest that the use of technologies such as
   digital stethoscope increase the accuracy of clinical examination,
   however, its impact on the teaching of cardiac auscultation for
   undergraduate students of medicine is not known.
   The objective is to demonstrate the usefulness of the digital
   stethoscope compared to traditional methods as a tool in the teaching of
   auscultatory skills.
   nterventional, longitudinal, controlled, unicenter and randomized study.
   Thirty-eight medicine students were enrolled for a cardiovascular
   semiology course lasting eight weeks. The course program included
   lectures and bedside practice in Cardiology wards. In the practical
   lessons, the students were randomized into two groups: 1) (n = 21)
   digital stethoscope (Littmann (R) Model 3200, 3M); and 2) (n = 17)
   conventional stethoscopes. A pre-training evaluation was conducted
   through a test using the software Heart Sounds (R), which was repeated
   after the course. The average scores were compared by paired T test and
   unpaired T test.
   It is observed that, at the end of the course, there was a significantly
   greater improvement in the group that used the digital stethoscope
   (51.9\%) compared to the group using the conventional stethoscope
   (29.5\%).
   Short-term interventions for cardiac semiology teaching are able to
   contribute significantly to improving proficiency in the identification
   of heart sounds. The use of digital stethoscope proved to be a positive
   factor in teaching these skills.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative X-ray imaging sensor based on Chromatic Photon Counting
   technology with intrinsic digital characteristics is presented. The
   system counts individually the incident X-ray photons and selects them
   according to their energy to produce two color images per exposure. The
   energy selection occurs in real time and at radiographic imaging speed
   (GHz global counting rate). Photon counting, color mode and a very fine
   spatial resolution (more than 10 LP/mm at MTF50) allow to obtain a high
   ratio between image quality and absorbed dose. The individual building
   block of the imaging system is a two-side buttable semiconductor
   radiation detector made of a thin pixellated CdTe crystal coupled to a
   large area VLSI CMOS pixel ASIC. Modules with 1, 2, 4, and 8 block units
   have been built. The largest module has 25 x 2.5 cm(2) sensitive area.

Abstract = {{In many research fields as high energy physics (HEP), astrophysics,
   nuclear medicine or space engineering with harsh operating conditions,
   the use of fast and flexible digital communication protocols is becoming
   more and more important. The possibility to have a smart and tested
   top-down design flow for the design of a new protocol for
   control/readout of front-end electronics is very useful. To this aim,
   and to reduce development time, costs and risks, this paper describes an
   innovative design/verification flow applied as example case study to a
   new communication protocol called FF-LYNX. After the description of the
   main FF-LYNX features, the paper presents: the definition of a
   parametric SystemC-based Integrated Simulation Environment (ISE) for
   high-level protocol definition and validation; the set up of figure of
   merits to drive the design space exploration; the use of ISE for early
   analysis of the achievable performances when adopting the new
   communication protocol and its interfaces for a new (or upgraded)
   physics experiment; the design of VHDL IP cores for the TX and RX
   protocol interfaces; their implementation on a FPGA-based emulator for
   functional verification and finally the modification of the FPGA-based
   emulator for testing the ASIC chipset which implements the rad-tolerant
   protocol interfaces. For every step, significant results will be shown
   to underline the usefulness of this design and verification approach
   that can be applied to any new digital protocol development for smart
   detectors in physics experiments.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND The iScreen and Medical Technology and Innovations, Inc,
   (MTI) photoscreeners objectively screen for amblyopia risk factors in
   children. The MTI photoscreener has been extensively validated as a
   device that objectively screens for amblyopia risk factors in children,
   but limited availability of the instant film it uses may soon render it
   obsolete. More recently the iScreen photoscreener has been introduced.
   This device captures images digitally and transmits them electronically
   to be interpreted. We compared the newer iScreen's ability to detect
   amblyopia risk factors in children with the established MTI
   photoscreener.
   METHODS The medical records of consecutive subjects screened by both the
   iScreen and MTI photoscreeners on the same day were retrospectively
   reviewed. The iScreen images were analyzed by the device's central
   interpretation center; MTI images were analyzed by an expert masked
   examiner using the delta crescent method. Referrals by both instruments
   were compared to the results of cycloplegic examination as per the
   American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus 2003
   referral criteria.
   RESULTS A total of 169 children were included in the study. Of these,
   107 (63\%) were found to have amblyopia risk factors. The iScreen was
   found to have an accuracy rate of 81\%, sensitivity of 87\%, and
   specificity of 76\%. The MTI was found to have an accuracy rate of 81\%,
   sensitivity of 81\%, and specificity of 81\%.
   CONCLUSIONS The iScreen and MTI performed similarly in detecting
   amblyopia risk factors when compared to a comprehensive pediatric
   ophthalmology examination. (J AAPOS 2013; 17:34-37)}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{This article discusses two matters that are becoming increasingly
   important in debates about local government: place-based leadership and
   public service innovation. The troubling international economic outlook
   means that many local authorities are focusing on efficiency savings'
   and the prevailing mantra in public policy circles is do more with
   less'. This article questions this approach. It aims to contribute to
   what one chief executive described to us as more with more' thinking.
   This approach strives to release the community and business energies of
   a locality. If this can be achieved the total resources available to
   improve the local quality of life can be increased, even if state
   spending is shrinking. A conceptual framework for studying place-based
   leadership is presented. This distinguishes three, overlapping realms of
   leadership in any given locality political leadership,
   managerial/professional leadership, and community and business
   leadership. It is argued that the areas of overlap between these realms
   can be viewed as innovation zones spaces in which established approaches
   can be questioned and new trajectories developed. These zones can,
   however, also become conflict zones with little learning and exchange
   taking place. Place-based leadership can influence whether such
   political spaces are used to promote creative problem solving or whether
   they become arenas for dispute and friction between sectional
   perspectives. By drawing on a study of the current Digital+Green
   initiative in Bristol, UK, the article suggests that an imaginative
   approach to place-based leadership one that accepts intelligent risk
   taking offers potential for improving the local quality of life as well
   as strengthening local democracy.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation in information and communication technologies resulted in the
   digital revolution. This kind of revolution is changing the way people
   work, learn, communicate and manage their businesses. Due to the need to
   achieve the competitive advantage and to meet the business requirements,
   we are witnessing an increasing shift from business to e-business and
   mobile business. In this kind of world solutions like Supply Chain
   Management (SCM) are increasingly appearing.
   The business success depends on how effective the information system
   works. Any interruption of the information system will inevitably lead
   to business loss. To ensure the successful implementation of a SCM
   project it is necessary to study even from the early stages which are
   the possible actions / risks / obstacles which might damage in one way
   or another the execution of the project.
   The role of the literature and case studies review in the field of
   interest is undeniable because it provides us with access to the
   so-called lessons-learned. By using this approach, in this paper, we
   present the most common risks and risk sources encountered in the
   implementation projects of SCM type information systems. We also propose
   a risk identification framework that can be used in the early stages of

Abstract = {{A growing interest has recently been observed in high flux X-ray imaging
   detectors with energy discrimination or spectroscopy capabilities. In
   this study we evaluate the performances of energy sensitive CdTe and
   CdZnTe detectors for X-ray imaging at fluxes of up to 2 x 10(7)
   x/mm(2)/s in the 20-150 keV energy range.
   Linear array detectors made from 3 mm thick single CdTe or CdZnTe
   crystals have 16 pixels with an 800 mu m pitch. These detectors were
   coupled to an innovative custom-designed 16-channel fast spectroscopy
   front-end electronic circuit. For each channel, the signal is
   continuously digitized and a FPGA controls acquisition and reconstructs
   the energy spectra on 256 bins for each channel. The detector was tested
   under X-rays for fluxes in the 10(5) to 2 x 10(7) x/mm(2)/s range. The
   main problem encountered at such high fluxes is the multiplication of
   pile-up events that reduces count rate and degrades energy resolution.
   When a very short shaping time was used, dead time was lower than 50 ns,
   and an energy resolution of 11 keV full width at half maximum (FWHM) at
   2 x 10(6) x/mm(2)/s and 20 keV (FWHM) at 10(7) x/mm(2)/s was achieved.
   We also show imaging results that illustrate the interest of the
   spectral information provided by each pixel.}},

Abstract = {{For realizing non-contact steering swimming of a capsule robot in curved
   environment filled with viscous liquid, based on spatial orthogonal
   superposition theorem of alternating magnetic vectors, an innovative
   physical method is proposed, which employs three-axis orthogonal square
   Helmholtz coils fed with three phase sine currents to create a universal
   uniform magnetic spin vector as energy source. According to the
   antiphase sine current superposition theorem generalized in this paper,
   an effective control method for successively adjusting the orientation
   and the rotating direction of the universal magnetic spin vector is
   proposed. For validating its feasibility and controllability, three-axis
   Helmholtz coils, power source and an innovative capsule robot prototype
   were manufactured, experiments were conducted in both spiral pipe and
   animal intestine. It was demonstrated that the orientation and the
   rotational direction of the universal uniform-magnetic spin vector can
   be adjusted successively through digital control and steering swimming
   of the capsule robot in spiral intestine can be achieved successfully.
   The breakthrough of the universal rotating uniform-magnetic vector will
   push forward the development of modern physics and biomedical
   engineering}},

Abstract = {{Materials integration in semiconductors, wafer fabrication process
   development, and device packaging have seemingly evolved at an
   exponential pace over the last decade. While microprocessor and memory
   chip manufacturers are the leading drivers of innovation, several other
   technology sectors benefit from the technologies that enable Moore's law
   scaling. Image sensor manufacturers, in particular, have realized many
   advancements from the selective use of advanced wafer fabrication and
   packaging developments. The motivations for the imaging industry to
   pursue advanced technology generation scaling are comparable to that of
   the broader semiconductor industry. In addition, image sensor companies
   seek a reduction of the camera module form factor, an increase in camera
   resolution, and an increase in pixel array performance. The pixel size
   of recent camera phone sensors has shrunk to 1.12 mu m. This is about
   half the pixel size of leading edge devices of six years prior, and yet
   mobile imaging sensors have dramatically increased in performance.
   Design innovation continues to have an increasing contribution to the
   performance of leading edge pixels; however, to date, it has been
   fabrication process development that has substantially enabled the
   continuous breakthroughs in digital imaging. Current image sensor
   fabrication process flows mark a significant departure from conventional
   CMOS logic processes. Beyond silicon foundry processes, digital imaging
   companies must also concern themselves with the optical systems,
   packaging solutions, and image processing chips required to integrate
   their silicon devices with the consumer electronics supply chain.
   Chipworks, as a supplier of competitive intelligence to the
   semiconductor and electronics industries, monitors the evolution of
   image sensor technologies as they come into production. Chipworks has
   obtained charge-coupled devices and CMOS image sensor chips from leading
   manufacturers and performed structural, compositional, and design
   analyses to benchmark the successful technologies employed by the market
   leaders.}},

   transportation occurred in the root canal, and alteration of working
   length (WL) was assessed by using a modified double-digital radiographic
   technique. The data were compared by the post hoc Tukey honestly
   significant difference test. Results: NiTi rotary systems caused less
   canal transportation and alteration of WL than K-Flexofile instruments
   (P < .05). There was no significant difference between NiTi rotary
   system groups at any levels (P > .05) except 2:5 mm from the WL. At this
   level ProTaper Universal system caused significant canal transportation
   (P < .05). Conclusions: GI Series X and Twisted File rotary systems
   produced with innovative process were concluded to shape the curved
   canals to result in minimal canal transportation, similar to Revo-S,
   RaCe, Mtwo, and ProTaper Universal rotary systems manufactured by
   traditional methods. (J Endod 2013;39:278-282)}},

Abstract = {{Aim and background: Inadequate fruit and vegetable intake is linked to
   leading causes of global mortality and rise in obesity. Measuring fruit
   and vegetable intake is problematic. Advances in cell phone technologies
   may improve the accuracy and ease of recording diet. This study tested
   the effectiveness of using cell phones with digital pictures to prompt
   memory and mypyramidtracker.gov to estimate self-reported fruit and
   vegetable intake in 69 college students.
   Methods: A repeated measures design was used. Focus groups provided
   feedback on the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of cell phones
   for diet recording in this population.
   Results: A statistically significant difference in fruit and vegetable
   scores, F(1, 58) = 4.64,p = .04, was supported between cell phone use
   for short-term memory prompt and mypyramidtracker.gov alone.
   Conclusions: Cell phone pictures improved memory and accuracy of recall
   when using an online self-reported interactive diet record and was
   considered an easy, relevant, and accessible way to record diet. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper uses a multifaceted remote sensing and morphometric approach
   to investigate if the surface of subcatchments in the Parana Valles area
   of Mars (20-30 degrees S, 0-20 degrees W) is reflective of hydrology and
   sediment transport by water. Using digital elevation model (DEM) data
   obtained from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), three nested
   subcatchments were examined using a suite of terrestrial geomorphic and
   hydrologic statistics to determine if their shape and form lies within
   the known range of fluvial catchment properties on Earth. Further, an
   examination of statistical accuracy via an innovative pixel-by-pixel
   solution of two statistics established that despite mineralogical
   homogeneity confirmed by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer
   for Mars (CRISM) spectral survey, erosion processes were likely to be
   variable across the study site. The DEM-based methods outlined here can
   be employed at other sites to investigate geomorphic properties and
   attributes of the Martian surface. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{Cogent sensors, defined as sensors that are capable of performing the
   transformation of raw data into information, are shown to be of the
   essence for realization of the long sought-after autonomous robots for
   space applications. A strongly miniaturized integration of sensing and
   information processing systems is needed for cogent sensors designed for
   autonomous sensing-information processing (IP)-actuating behavior. It is
   shown that the recently developed field of quantum holography (QH),
   stemming from geometric quantization of any holographic processes
   through the Heisenberg Group (G) and deeply different, as stressed in
   detail, from other meanings of ``quantum holography{''} in the
   literature, supplies the nanophotonic tools for designing and assembling
   an associative memory (AM) as the brain implementing such strong
   cogency. An AM is designed through a free-space interconnected large
   planar multilayer architecture of quantum well-based two-port neurons
   implementing a shift register on the manifold of C. and whose input
   consists of photonic holograms from high frequency pulsed microlasers in
   the infrared band of em or em-transduced outside signals. The
   optoelectronics as relative, integrated into a hybrid chip involving
   photonic detectors, microlasers and electronic components for the clock
   control system, would allow cycle times as short as 30 ns with the large
   spatial bandwidth available in photonics. IP through QH concerns the
   encoding and decoding of holographic interference patterns, not of mere
   binary digital logical (syntactic) information. Accordingly, QH defines
   on the G's manifold an IP paradigm where information as experimental
   knowledge is processed; i.e., IP concerns both syntax and semantics. It
   is shown that such QH-neural brain would cogently deal with spurious
   signals as random noise that would be caused to die out on the way to
   the intended target through parallel massive and real-time IP. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Human land-use strategies involving the management of rainfall and
   runoff to promote crop production are found throughout the world. This
   paper presents a functional assessment using hydrological modeling with
   modern high-resolution LiDAR datasets and contextual archaeological site
   data to study prehistoric agriculture. The focus is on rock alignments
   created by the Hohokam culture in the semi-arid environment of the US
   Southwest. By incorporating a multi-scalar GIS study for terrain
   analysis at a regional, community, and site scale, the complex
   interactions between the prehistoric sites, features and the environment
   are revealed. The results of these analyses on digital elevation models
   (DEMs) gave insight to the past functionality of such agricultural
   features within the cultivated landscapes. The results included:
   1) The agricultural features were suitably placed for the collection of
   rainfall and runoff.
   2) The features were reducing the volume of water flowing through the
   area to prevent flooding and crop destruction and promoting soil
   infiltration.
   This shows the complexity and innovation of prehistoric societies living
   in marginal environments and how their adaptation to such environments
   was necessary to sustain their populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Aims: The sources of cytosolic superoxide in skeletal muscle have not
   been defined. This study examined the subcellular sites that contribute
   to cytosolic superoxide in mature single muscle fibers at rest and
   during contractile activity. Results: Isolated fibers from mouse flexor
   digitorum brevis loaded with superoxide and nitricoxide-sensitive
   fluorescent probes, specific pathway inhibitors and immunolocalization
   techniques were used to identify subcellular sites contributing to
   cytosolic superoxide. Treatment with the electron transport chain
   complex III inhibitor, antimycin A, but not the complex I inhibitor,
   rotenone, caused increased cytosolic superoxide through release from the
   mitochondrial intermembrane space via voltage-dependent anion or Bax
   channels, but inhibition of these channels did not affect
   contraction-induced increases in cytosolic superoxide. Nicotinamide
   adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitors decreased
   cytosolic superoxide at rest and following contractions. Protein and
   mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase subunits was demonstrated in single
   fibers. NOX2, NOX4, and p22(phox) subunits localized to the sarcolemma
   and transverse tubules; NOX4 was additionally expressed in mitochondria.
   Regulatory p40(phox) and p67(phox) proteins were found in the cytoplasm
   of resting fibers, but following contractions, p40(phox) appeared to
   translocate to the sarcolemma. Innovation: Superoxide and other reactive
   oxygen species generated by skeletal muscle are important regulators of
   muscle force production and adaptations to contractions. This study has
   defined the relative contribution of mitochondrial and cytosolic sources
   of superoxide within the cytosol of single muscle fibers at rest and
   during contractions. Conclusion: Muscle mitochondria do not modulate
   cytosolic superoxide in skeletal muscle but NADPH oxidase is a major
   contributor both at rest and during contractions. Antioxid. Redox
   Signal. 18, 603-621.}},

Abstract = {{The use of digital technologies is now widespread and increasing, but is
   not always optimized for effective learning. Teachers in higher
   education have little time or support to work on innovation and
   improvement of their teaching, which often means they simply replicate
   their current practice in a digital medium. This paper makes the case
   for a learning design support environment to support and scaffold
   teachers' engagement with and development of technology-enhanced
   learning, based on user requirements and on pedagogic theory. To be able
   to adopt, adapt, and experiment with learning designs, teachers need a
   theory-informed way of representing the critical characteristics of good
   pedagogy as they discover how to optimize learning technologies. This
   paper explains the design approach of the Learning Design Support
   Environment project, and how it aims to support teachers in achieving
   this goal.}},

   schooling with the extensive aid of computers. Yet, classroom use of
   information and communication technology (ICT) is now ubiquitous in much
   of the world. Today's pre-service teachers are the cusp generation who,
   at a unique moment in history, straddle the two worlds of the ballpoint
   pen and the computer mouse. This study examined pre-service teachers'
   beliefs about their stakeholder role in terms of influencing ICT
   innovation and adoption. The pre-service teachers expected their future
   pupils to learn with computers much more extensively than they had;
   however, their beliefs about the transformative use of ICT in schooling
   were divergent. To address these findings, a teaching intervention was
   designed, which enabled pre-service teachers to envision their practice
   in the digital classroom of the future. This involved the generation of
   new learning outcomes only achievable using ICT in pedagogy and
   assessment, and unfettered by the confines of the traditional
   pre-digital curriculum. Ninety-five per cent of the cohort was assessed
   as completing the intervention successfully. This paper finishes by
   discussing methods of equipping the cusp generation to negotiate the
   tensions inherent between current classroom practice and the rapid
   emergence of digital technologies in schools.}},

   in doctoral dissertations of Library and Information Science in China.
   By use of Co-word analysis, including cluster analysis, strategic
   diagram and social network analysis, we studied the internal and
   external structure and relationship of research fields in doctoral
   dissertations of Library and Information Science in China. Data was
   collected, during the period of 1994-2011, from six public dissertation
   databases and ten degree databases provided by the
   universities/institutes which have been authorized to grant doctoral
   degrees of Library and Information Science in China. The results show
   that Wuhan University is the most important institution of doctoral
   education in LIS in China. The focuses of researches, including
   information resource, ontology, semantic web, semantic search,
   electronic government, information resource management, knowledge
   management, knowledge innovation, knowledge sharing, knowledge
   organization, network, information service, information need and digital
   library. The research fields of LIS doctoral dissertations in China are
   varied. Many of these research fields are still immature; accordingly,
   the well-developed and core research fields are fewer.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Vitiligo is a cutaneous pigmentary disorder characterized by
   depigmented macules and patches that result from loss of epidermal
   melanocytes. Physician evaluates the efficacy of treatment by comparing
   the extent of vitiligo lesions before and after treatment based on the
   overall visual impression of the treatment response. This method is
   called the physician's global assessment (PGA) which is subjective. In
   this article, we present an innovative digital image processing method
   to determine vitiligo lesion area in an objective manner.
   Method: The digital method uses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to
   generate melanin-based images representing skin areas due to melanin
   followed by Region Growing process to segment vitiligo lesion from
   normal skin.
   Results: Based on 41 digital images of vitiligo lesions taken from 18
   patients, the proposed method achieved sensitivities of 0.9105 +/-
   0.0161, specificities of 0.9973 +/- 0.0009 and accuracies of 0.9901 +/-
   0.0028 at 95\% confidence level.
   Conclusion: With the proposed method, physicians are able to assess
   vitiligo treatment efficacies objectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the effect of EU harmonisation of food regulations on
   time-varying, firm-heterogeneous mark-ups using data on Dutch
   food-processing firms during 19922005. EU product standard harmonisation
   is measured using data at the 8-digit combined nomenclature product
   level. EU harmonisation generates short- and long-run pro-competitive
   effects: on average, an increase of 50 per cent in the sales-weighted
   coverage ratio of EU harmonisation leads to a decrease in mark-ups of 7
   per cent after 1 year and by 11.5 per cent in the long-run. By taking
   account of firm heterogeneity, I show that this pro-competitive effect
   is more pronounced for (i) small firms, (ii) more concentrated firms,
   (iii) single-product firms, (iv) firms belonging to food sub-sectors
   which are less affected by EU harmonisation and (v) during the first
   half of the sample period.}},

Abstract = {{Industry insiders and media academics often voice unease about the
   transformations taking place in the global news industry. Despite its
   usefulness in drawing attention to the twists and turns of
   organizational change and innovation in news production, much of the
   research on this topic shows less interest in journalists' situated
   experience than is helpful. This article suggests that academic
   attention might be usefully refocused to the changing nature and
   experiences of journalists as they encounter the changes taking place in
   their industry. Such a focus can be justified on theoretical grounds:
   the implications of change in the news industry for its traditional
   democratic role cannot be understood without understanding in detail
   what journalists do and how they do it. While acknowledging that news
   production takes place in the context of competitive commercial
   enterprise, the authors argue that fruitful avenues for empirical
   enquiry can be opened up by adopting amore practice-centred analysis.
   The article concludes by introducing recent research that joins this
   pursuit.}},

Abstract = {{The move to a networked media environment presents a range of challenges
   for journalistic roles, norms and daily practices. This article employs
   actor network theory to investigate how different actors negotiate and
   ultimately shape the manner in which the internet and related digital
   technologies are embedded in the newsroom. Findings suggest that
   professional culture -articulated in skills, ideas and practices - acts
   as a network that weakens the potential impact of technology towards
   innovation and audience-oriented models of journalism. The results point
   to the conclusion that the internet and related tools are seen as
   empowering journalists to do their (traditional) jobs better instead of
   moving on to the next stage built around a stronger commitment to
   capitalize on the growing sociotechnical potential.}},

Abstract = {{Fieldwork in a major construction programme is used to examine what is
   meant by professionalism where large integrated digital systems are used
   to design, deliver, and maintain buildings and infrastructure. The
   increasing professionalization of the client is found to change other
   professional roles and interactions in project delivery. New
   technologies for approvals and workflow monitoring are associated with
   new occupational groups; new kinds of professional accountability; and a
   greater integration across professional roles. Further conflicts also
   arise, where occupational groups have different understandings of
   project deliverables and how they are competently achieved. The
   preliminary findings are important for an increasing policy focus on
   shareable data, in order for building owners and operators to improve
   the cost, value, handover and operation of complex buildings. However,
   it will also have an impact on wider public decision-making processes,
   professional autonomy, expertise and interdependence. These findings are
   considered in relation to extant literatures, which problematize the
   idea of professionalism; and the shift from drawings to shareable data
   as deliverables. The implications for ethics in established professions
   and other occupational groups are discussed; directions are suggested
   for further scholarship on professionalism in digitally mediated project
   work to improve practices which will better serve society.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the use of voice coil actuators to enhance the
   performance of shift-by-wire systems. This innovative purely electric
   actuation approach was implemented and applied to a Formula SAE race
   car. The result was more compact and faster than conventional solutions,
   which usually employ pneumatic actuators. The designed shift-by-wire
   system incorporates a control unit based on a digital signal processor,
   which runs the control algorithms developed for both gear shifting and
   launching the car. The system was successfully validated through
   laboratory and on-track tests. In addition, a comparative test with an
   equivalent pneumatic counterpart was carried out. This showed that an
   effective use of voice coil actuators enabled the upshift time to be
   almost halved, thus proving that these actuators are a viable solution
   to improving shift-by-wire system performance.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of surface defects on the residual stress local distribution
   in thin coatings has been investigated by an innovative high resolution
   methodology, which mainly consists of incremental focused ion beam (FIB)
   micron-scale ring-core milling (I mu RCM), combined with high-resolution
   in situ SEM-FEG imaging of the relaxing surface and in-plane strain
   analysis by digital image correlation (DIC). The depth profile of the
   residual stress can be obtained from the experimentally measured surface
   strain with sub-micron spatial resolution (both lateral and in-depth) by
   using a finite element modeling (FEM) reverse calculation procedure. A
   chromium nitride (CrN) coatings was produced by Cathodic Arc Evaporation
   Physical Vapor Deposition (CAE-PVD) on AISI 316L steel substrate.
   Preliminary characterization of coatings consisted of nanoindentation
   testing, FIB cross section microstructural analysis and XRD (sin(2)psi)
   average residual stress measurement. Local residual stress was measured
   nearby to surface micro-droplets, with the main aim of investigating the
   effect of such defects on the residual stress in-depth distribution. A
   series of stress measurements were also performed on the homogeneous
   defect-free coating. Significant differences were found in terms of
   residual stress and stress gradient in proximity of surface defects, in
   comparison with the residual stress measured on the defect-free areas.
   In case of micro-droplets, such differences were attributed to
   significant modification of growth mechanisms and microstructure of the
   coating, that lead to a different competitive mechanism of residual
   stress build-up. This assumption was supported by the microstructural
   FIB-SEM observation, which showed anomalous grain growth and changes in
   crystal orientation in correspondence of a droplet. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Comparative pelvic development of the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) and
   the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri): conservation and
   innovation across the fish-tetrapod transition}},
Journal = {{EVODEVO}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The fish-tetrapod transition was one of the major events in
   vertebrate evolution and was enabled by many morphological changes.
   Although the transformation of paired fish fins into tetrapod limbs has
   been a major topic of study in recent years, both from paleontological
   and comparative developmental perspectives, the interest has focused
   almost exclusively on the distal part of the appendage and in particular
   the origin of digits. Relatively little attention has been paid to the
   transformation of the pelvic girdle from a small unipartite structure to
   a large tripartite weight-bearing structure, allowing tetrapods to rely
   mostly on their hindlimbs for locomotion. In order to understand how the
   ischium and the ilium evolved and how the acetabulum was reoriented
   during this transition, growth series of the Australian lungfish
   Neoceratodus forsteri and the Mexican axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum were
   cleared and stained for cartilage and bone and immunostained for
   skeletal muscles. In order to understand the myological developmental
   data, hypotheses about the homologies of pelvic muscles in adults of
   Latimeria, Neoceratodus and Necturus were formulated based on
   descriptions from the literature of the coelacanth (Latimeria), the
   Australian Lungfish (Neoceratodus) and a salamander (Necturus).
   Results: In the axolotl and the lungfish, the chondrification of the
   pelvic girdle starts at the acetabula and progresses anteriorly in the
   lungfish and anteriorly and posteriorly in the salamander. The ilium
   develops by extending dorsally to meet and connect to the sacral rib in
   the axolotl. Homologous muscles develop in the same order with the
   hypaxial musculature developing first, followed by the deep, then the
   superficial pelvic musculature.
   Conclusions: Development of the pelvic endoskeleton and musculature is
   very similar in Neoceratodus and Ambystoma. If the acetabulum is seen as
   being a fixed landmark, the evolution of the ischium only required pubic
   pre-chondrogenic cells to migrate posteriorly. It is hypothesized that
   the iliac process or ridge present in most tetrapodomorph fish is the
   precursor to the tetrapod ilium and that its evolution mimicked its
   development in modern salamanders.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a formalization of the Data, Information, Tacit
   and Explicit Knowledge process (DITEK) empirical model. This
   formalization reduces the gap between empirical and formal worlds, what
   led us to consider it as an opportunity to enhance the communication
   between users and designers of digital information systems. Notably, the
   designer will be aware of the role of the user as a component of the
   Enterprise's Information and Knowledge System (EIKS), defined in this
   paper.
   We highlight how having two models, empirical and formal, for the same
   concept can constitute an outline in order (i) to enhance the
   communication between users and designers of digital information
   systems, (ii) to regard users as components of the EIKS, and (iii) to
   promote information systems' innovative design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative technique to recognize Handwritten
   Articles. Proposed system is called ``Panhinda{''}. The target user
   group for this application would be the people who are involved with a
   lot of paper work on a daily basis. The proposed Character Recognition
   system was implemented with the capability of extracting the content of
   an image where the mentioned content is a hand written set of words or
   characters. The conversion process runs as a background process without
   any involvement of the user. Once the conversion is completed, User gets
   the capability of editing the converted text as he prefers with the aid
   of the Panhinda editor. This document describes the techniques for
   enhancing the quality of the image, character segmentation, character
   recognition and digital dictionaries. Noise removal, angle effects and
   lighting conditions are done at the pre-processing phase. After getting
   a quality binarized image, character segmentation will be done using
   Horizontal and Vertical Projection Profile method. The Support Vector
   Machine technique will be used to recognize the characters. Digital
   Dictionary will be used to capture the conflicts of the output. Error
   correction will be done by using a combined model of noisy channel model
   and natural language model. By walking through above mentioned processes
   handwritten article image will be converted into an editable text file.
   Experimenting with a set of 200 sample images, scanned through the
   Scanner, we have achieved a maximum recognition accuracy of 99.5\% with
   manual error correction. Compared to existing commercial OCR systems,
   present recognition accuracy is worth contributing. Moreover, the
   developed technique is computationally efficient and consumes low
   memory.}},

Abstract = {{The paper aims to discover the most promising digital networking
   business opportunities in today's Chinese market, and how those new
   opportunities relate to the collective social networking culture rooted
   in Chinese consumers and businesses. The paper analyzes the enormous
   digital business environment in China for e-commerce, digital marketing,
   consumer behavior, IT outsourcing, software development and innovation.
   The analysis discovers huge opportunities in China's digital social
   business that leverage the collaboration culture for both consumer and
   business audience. A classification to China's digital audience and
   current key global and domestic players in the digital market are
   provided. The market is still far from maturity with an enormous growth
   rate. Although local players dominate the market, new market entry
   depends primarily on new digital product features that leverage social
   interaction and networking. Current key players copy Western social
   networking business model style without taking advantage of China's
   collective culture. The market size is huge, however, concentrated in
   urban areas and for specific income levels. The research finds
   opportunities in consumer digital social shopping, mobile social
   shopping and professional digital networking. The paper provides
   implications and recommendations for international and domestic
   investors that include ideas for new digital products and market
   penetration strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing use of computers daily at school has lead to numerous
   investigations studying how multimedia educational games are being
   viewed and used by teachers and students. This work is part of the
   project Manual Digital II (MD II). The project is financed by Quadro de
   Referencia Estrategico Nacional (QREN), with contract number 2010/013
   657, developed under Sistema de Incentivos a Investigacao e
   Desenvolvimento Tecnologico (SI\&DT). It develops in the context of a
   joint venture between the company Lusoinfo Multimedia and Instituto de
   Educacao da Universidade do Minho. Its main recipients are educators and
   teachers of primary schools, children and parents. The project aims to
   produce digital educational contents, based on innovative processes of
   designing, production and application. In this article, we had the
   objective to contribute to the knowledge of the reality of the use of
   MDII in the formal context of a classroom, to recognize teaching
   strategies adopted by a teacher and to identify major barriers to the
   effective use of these contents. The present study, in the form of a
   case study, took place during the months of April, May and June 2012
   about a fourth grade class of an elementary school. Results show that
   the educational games in the classroom can be, in fact, features drivers
   of new strategies for teaching and learning. However, their use alone
   does not determine a most successful learning process, so it is
   important to understand the limitations on the effective use of these
   digital means. We identified one of these limitations: teacher training
   in the area of Information Technology and Communication (ICT) for
   development of digital skills, methodological and educative. We
   understand that this is a crucial factor that can make a difference
   later to a more effective use of these new educational resources.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of the modern information technology, the new media
   has been widely infiltrated into all aspects of the university life,
   which has a profound impact on the students' thinking, learning and
   communication. Based on the new media technology as the carrier, this
   article studies the college students' outlook on life. On the basis of
   the brief understanding of the situation of college students' use of the
   new media, the author further strengthens the concept of life education
   of college students in the use of new media technologies, and the
   innovation of the concept of life education, to realize the network
   education and modernization of university students' view of life, and to
   enhance the effectiveness of life education of college students.
   Marx said, ``The first premise of all human history is without doubt the
   existence of the individual{''}. But now many students lack correctly
   understanding and grasping of life. They go the Dutch act, and they are
   violent. Such events disregarding life emerge in an endless stream,
   which brings the negative influence on students' personal, families,
   schools, and the society. At present, the development of the new media
   technology has profoundly changed the social environment of the
   ideological and political education of college students. The new media
   with the Internet, mobile phones, and the digital TV as the
   representatives have changed the mode of information dissemination
   fundamentally, which has exerted a far-reaching influence on the
   communication of cultural information. College students have become the
   most active groups who most widely use the new media technologies.
   Therefore, in the information age, with the new media technology as the
   carrier, to strengthen college students to understand life, cherish
   life, and respect life can effectively prevent the campus malignant
   events. At the same time, through effective means of education,
   providing the ultimate life care for the college students will
   contribute to the perfection of college students' personality and the
   establishment of a correct outlook on life and values, so as to cope
   with the challenges of the modern society, and enhance the realm of
   life.}},

Abstract = {{For PFC working under discontinues conduction or critical conduction
   modes, input current sensing is not required when constant on time
   control is applied. However, this approach cannot be extended to PFC
   working under continues conduction mode. In this paper, a innovative
   input current sensor-less control scheme has been proposed for PFC
   working under continuous conduction mode. Its value in digitally
   controlled PFC is great since high resolution and high bandwidth current
   sampling A/D can be eliminated. The non-ideal effects in input current
   sensor-less control have also been analyzed in this paper. The proposed
   PFC control has been verified by our experimental prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Effective applied research is based on close collaboration between
   research and industry, which, taking the findings of basic research on
   customer demands as its starting point, creates new means to develop and
   market innovative products. What is more, growing demands for innovative
   and sustainable results of research and development are prompting the
   examination of global trends such as demographic change, growing
   megacities, rising energy consumption and increasing traffic and the
   resultant social challenges. These trends and increasing traffic in
   particular are giving rise to new fields of work, especially for digital
   technologies, as a social responsibility, e.g. on driver assistance and
   traffic control systems that increase safety. The social challenges are
   increasingly affecting markets and requiring new innovative products,
   efficient production processes and integrative forms of human resource
   development and training and qualification. The virtualization and
   digitization of objects and processes is becoming an enabler of the
   development of new strategies and concepts such as smart cities, green
   energy, electric vehicle networks, smart manufacturing and smart
   logistics. This paper examines means by which digital engineering and
   virtual and augmented reality technologies can support the creation of
   sustainable smart manufacturing and smart logistics processes as well as

   the fast growth of the Future Internet (FI) in the context of ICT,
   mainly within urban environments where a multiplicity of digital-based

   entities. In particular, we focus upon the concept of actual European
   Living Labs that can be identified as real ``enablers{''} for the fast
   growth and the proper adoption and/or implementation of modern FI-based
   facilities and of related services-products in a variety of domains as
   well as for a diversity of applications, also covering many innovative

Abstract = {{Sales cannibalization - i.e., intra-organizational sales diversion bears
   a prominent role in the competitive upheavals within Information
   Technology markets. However, detection and measurement thereof have only
   raised lukewarm interest among Information Systems scholars so far. To
   their defense, relevant methodological contributions are scattered
   across several disciplines, base themselves on equivocal definitions of
   cannibalization, present an overwhelming range of model specifications,
   and overlap with research on product and technology substitution.
   Therefore, we provide an interdisciplinary review of the literature on
   cannibalization, formulate a novel, clear-cut definition of the
   phenomenon, and clarify its relationship with substitution. Our other
   contributions are an exhaustive list of the modeling requirements
   necessary to describe the phenomenon, a compendium of cannibalization
   measurement models, and a summary of the findings with regard to
   Information Technology artifacts. This work should provide an adequate
   foundation and identify promising topics of study for further research
   endeavors in this domain.}},

Abstract = {{Bandwidth demanding P2P (Peer-to-Peer) overlay communications strongly
   require scalable and differentiated provisioning of network resources
   (e.g., bandwidth, communication paths) to enable a seamless convergence
   over the Internet. Recent research efforts claimed that efficient
   resource over-provisioning (booking more resources in advance) allows
   differentiation of control with reduced signalling overhead and
   increased resources utilisation. We believe that, this approach deserves
   attention in innovative networking designs to improve performance. The
   European Union (EU) funded project called ROMEO is focusing on a joint
   use of DVB-T2 (Digital Video Broadcasting 2nd Generation Terrestrial)
   and P2P overlay networks for live multimedia content sharing and
   collaboration among multiple users ubiquitously. A major challenge in
   such systems is to assure a proper synchronisation, at end-users, of the
   content received through both the DVB-T2 and the P2P while the Internet,
   on which relies P2P system, only provides best-effort service. Hence,
   this paper proposes a cross-layer control architecture to take advantage
   of the Internet resource over-provisioning techniques to alleviate the
   requirements of buffers and the complexity of adaptation on end-users'
   devices for synchronization, thus allowing for cost-effective and rapid
   development of attractive services in similar hybrid networks.}},

Abstract = {{Ancient manuscripts constitute a primary carrier of cultural heritage
   globally, and they are currently being intensively digitized all over
   the world to ensure their preservation, and, ultimately, the wide
   accessibility of their content. Critical to this research process are
   the legibility of the documents in image form, and access to live texts.
   Several state-of-the-art methods and approaches have been proposed and
   developed to address the challenges associated with processing these
   manuscripts. However, there is a huge amount of data involved, and also
   the high cost and scarcity of human expert feedback and reference data
   call for the development of fundamental approaches that encompass all
   these aspects in an objective and tractable manner. In this paper, we
   propose one such approach, which is a novel framework for the
   computational pattern analysis of ancient manuscripts that is
   data-driven, multilevel, self-sustaining, and learning-based, and takes
   advantage of the large quantities of unprocessed data available. Unlike
   many approaches, which fast-forward to the processing and analysis of
   feature vectors, our innovative framework represents a new perspective
   on the task, which starts from ground zero of the problem, which is the
   definition of objects. In addition, it leverages the datadriven mining
   of relations among objects to discover hidden but persistent links
   between them. The problem is addressed at three main levels. At the
   lowest level, that of images, it tackles automatic, data-driven
   enhancement and restoration of document images using spatial, spectral,
   sparse, and graph-based representations of visual objects. At the second
   level, which is transliteration, directed graphical models, HMMs,
   Undirected Random Fields, and spatial relations models are used to
   extract the live text of manuscript images, which reduces dependency on
   human experts. Finally, at the highest level, that of network analysis
   of the relations among objects (from patches and words to manuscripts
   and writers) involves the search for `social networks' linking
   manuscripts. Considering this approach under the umbrella of Visual
   Language Processing (VLP), we hope that it will be further enriched by
   the research community, in the form of new insights and approaches
   contributed at the various levels.}},

Abstract = {{Technology stewards are individuals who assume responsibility for the
   development and maintenance of online digital habitats suited to a
   community of practice or affinity group. Though guidelines for effective
   stewardship exist, most focus on serving the needs off offline
   organizations and individuals through now canonical online resources
   such as forums, blogs and text-based chat; they may not be applicable to
   emergent online groups in which the dialectic of negotiation plays a
   much stronger role. As part of a larger ethnographic study, this paper
   introduces Cypris Chat, a language learning community in the online
   virtual world of Second Life. Through examination of its design
   evolution from 2008-2012, Cypris proves itself an exemplar of digital
   habitat design negotiation in entirely virtual communities, as well as
   opens up new possibilities for both independent language learners and
   instructors interested in innovative and cost-free learning
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Digital games are more popular than ever among children and young adults
   (Prensky 2001; Gee 2003; Fromme 2003; Oblinger 2004). Recent reviews
   show that children spend hours playing video games either on their
   console or digitally online. Educators started to see the power of this
   new medium and explore ways to use digital games to support learning
   within schools. Incorporating digital games into classrooms, however,
   has been a challenging task for many reasons; According to Jessel (2012)
   ``Innovation arising from new technologies makes a variety of demands
   upon the role of the teacher{''}. The question is; are the teachers
   ready for these demands, as the new technologies transform their role
   continually? This study aims to give a comparative account of teachers'
   views of their role when teaching using digital games in primary
   classrooms. Additionally it investigated the interrelation between game
   based learning, curriculum, pedagogy and practice. This study presents
   the views of teachers from Turkey, Italy and the UK. In-depth interviews
   and an online survey were used to find out the teachers perceptions of
   game based learning and how this impacts on their roles as a teacher.
   The research also analyzed the interview findings to understand the
   dynamics between curriculum design, learning culture and practice when
   implementing game based learning. The research found that there is a
   strong link between how learning is designed to incorporate digital
   games, the theories and strategies that have been used to deliver the
   curriculum and how this manifests itself in practice within the
   classroom. The research also showed that teachers are aware that their
   roles when using new technologies in education has changed, however,
   because of the lack of necessary training they are not clear on how to
   adopt these changes. In some countries the curriculum was flexible
   enough to accommodate game based learning, however, in some without a
   radical reform this would not be possible. The mass difference between
   country specific curriculum, pedagogy and practice highlights the need
   for a flexible model or approach of embedding digital games into primary
   classrooms.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past years, we have been researching various approaches to
   digital game-based learning in the field of change and innovation
   management. Broadening the range of possible applications while
   consolidating methodical underpinnings, we have subsequently narrowed
   down our findings into the description of three specific treatments.
   This paper focusses on one of the applied treatments, namely to make
   participants go through a game sequence or interact with a digitally
   enhanced setup (e.g. play-acting with motion capturing and real-time
   rendering of a virtual character) to engage learners in embodied and
   experience driven learning. We present our experience starting with
   commercial of the shelf physically interactive digital games, followed
   by two examples of self-made stand-alone Kinect games that have been
   developed for use in team and leadership trainings. The latter will be
   introduced describing their goals, the resulting game design as well as
   lessons learned. Starting from the experience with such settings in
   project ``HELD{''} as well as applications of embodied digital learning
   and physically interactive game-based learning by others led us to the
   belief that there is a need for a framework that enables educational
   game and interaction designers to develop digital embodied settings
   without the need of (re)coding the Kinect management code as well as a
   number of other features relevant for education and training settings
   (e.g. control app, QR player identification and performance tracking).
   To further foster the easy development of physically interactive digital
   games and simulations, or digital aesthetic performances the framework
   integrates with the Unity game engine, thus enabling both rapid
   prototyping and quality games. First tests seem very promising with
   playable game prototypes developed in less than three days. To gather
   more feedback on real-life applications using digital embodied learning
   we plan to offer the introduced framework free of charge for non-profit
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to address the difficulty to integrate Game-Based Learning
   (GBL) in the teaching practices, this paper proposes a model for the
   process of teachers' adoption of games, based on a first research work
   which led to a structured question matrix designed to foster teacher
   reflection on key issues that arise during this process. We focus on
   formal education and consider not only digital (educational) games but
   also other game-like activities such as role-plays and simulations. In
   tackling the matter of adoption, this paper addresses a key issue: How
   does the adoption process unfold when teachers introduce games in their
   classes for the first time? To answer this question, Roger's ``Diffusion
   of Innovations{''} theory was used as the conceptual framework for
   analysing a case study. The case study took place in France with a group
   of six high school teachers who introduced three different games, in
   teams of two. We also provide different tools to support the adoption
   process: resources, activities, questionnaires, pedagogical scenario,
   patterns of activities and scenarios. Our efforts to support teachers'
   adoption and use of GBL are not designed to offer a one-size-fits-all
   solution. Rather, they are aimed at providing tools to foster reflection
   and facilitate the adoption process. It is hoped that this work will
   help overcome some teachers' resistance to GBL, and this will be the
   subject of further verification.}},

Abstract = {{Game-based learning may present a way of creating immersion and
   engagement for the learner through simulated experiences in a narrative
   environment, and may support the development of 21st. century skills of
   communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking. Role
   playing games have had a long history of usage in language learning and
   as a multidisciplinary activity in schools during theme weeks. Through
   the concept of serious digital games, which offers learning through
   digital simulations and immersion in virtual worlds, game-based learning
   has been deployed increasingly in education where games have been used
   for specific subjects. The use of live role-game playing in schools
   offers novel and innovative ways to work with the game genre, with the
   teachers contributing as game authors and game masters. A current
   project on live action role-game playing looks at how role-game playing
   can be used to present an entire curriculum within a narrative framework
   in order to enhance the learners' motivation and zest for learning while
   developing 21st century learning skills. The exploration of how live
   action role-game playing can function as an overarching framework for
   learning may offer fresh insights into game-based learning in terms of
   multimodality, flexibility in the design of games and the role and
   interactivity of the learner and teacher. A unique residential school
   dedicated to teaching all subjects in grades 9-10 through live role-game
   play was studied for a year. The study employed qualitative and
   processual methodologies in order to capture the interactions between
   students' learning experiences and the role-game based learning designs
   as well as the way they constitute a creative and collaborative learning
   environment. This paper presents the preliminary results of the project
   and discusses its implications for design and redesign of learning
   environments in the schools along with the roles of learners and
   teachers in the development of game-based learning as a framework for
   creative, inclusive and collaborative learning.}},

Abstract = {{A group of first-semester engineering students participated in a game
   design course. The overall goal was to learn about game design and
   programming while they were creating their own games. Additionally we
   wanted the students to transform some of their game experiences into
   active knowledge on designing games. It was the intension to give the
   students a more critical reflective view on video games and game design.
   The students in this study had all played various video games since they
   were 5-6 years old, and were therefore regarded as native consumers in
   the game world. They grew up playing video and computer games as a
   natural part of their everyday lives. Some of them had played intensely,
   while others had played more sporadically. In order to make the
   transformation they developed their own digital prototypes. And they
   participated in reflective discussions on what games are: what makes
   them interesting and how they are constructed. The students used the
   tool GameMaker, which can be used without having any prior knowledge of
   programming. The tool gave an easy access to develop running game
   prototypes in 2D. The didactic approach was based on constructionistic
   and reflective learning philosophies. The constructionistic learning
   promotes a creative and innovative learning. But it doesn't promote
   articulating and analysing competences. Besides the constructionistic
   learning process we wanted to promote our students analytic competences.
   We wanted the students to reflect on games in order to promote explicit
   knowledge. We believe the dialog based on the academic theory and their
   programming experiences reinforced the learning process. The
   constructionistic approach supported exploring and optimising ways of
   learning. The students used experimentation and exploration as part of
   the design process. As part of the exploration process they also
   optimised and balanced e. g. the gameplay. The constructionistic
   approach also supported creativity and innovative designs. The students
   turned their own ideas into interactive games. They used innovative
   design methods and used their creativity. They also developed an
   understanding of innovative design methods. Additionally this approach
   stimulated the double perspective - playing and learning at the same
   time. The students played games while they were developing games. The
   reflection on games supported insights into others' gaming experiences.
   In the user test the students got other e. g. children's perspective on
   the games they developed. The reflective approach also created thoughts
   on tomorrow's teaching methods. The students evolved their own thoughts
   on how to use games in teaching and learning processes. In summary, we
   discussed the students' first voyages from natives in the game world to
   reflective designers. During the journey, they developed a reflective
   practice and an understanding of the profession they were entering. The
   article also shows a very dynamic and fruitful relationship between
   playing games and designing games.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-service early childhood educators are in a position where they will
   be expected to help and support infant pupils to use computer and
   computer games. Unless teachers believe that the role of computer games
   with educational features is essential neither to their own nor to their
   students' needs, they will be unable to introduce Games Based Learning
   (GBL) methods into their teaching. Therefore, it is important to gather
   information about which factors may influence Early Childhood Education
   (ECE) students' attitudes toward using digital games in nursery school.
   The purpose of this study was to investigate ECE students' attitudes
   toward educational computer games in Kindergarten. The data were
   collected from 200 freshmen and senior students attending a Bachelor in
   Education degree at the department of ECE, University of Athens, Greece.
   Questionnaires were given to the participants at the end of a 13-week
   Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) course. The results of
   the study revealed that the majority of the ECE students had very
   positive attitudes toward using educational digital games in their
   future teaching and expressed great willingness to use GBL to benefit
   children in learning environments. They also appeared to have high
   levels of self-efficacy in the ability of using computer games, which is
   linked to their behavioral intensions about integrating such innovative
   instructional methods into a kindergarten classroom. There are
   considerable parameters which affect pre-service Early Childhood
   teachers' attitudes towards digital games: year of study, frequency of
   computer usage per day, previous experience in playing computer games,
   experience in a pre-school classroom, previous computer use in any
   environment and previous courses about the use/integration of ICT in
   early childhood classroom. The findings of the research suggested that
   attitudes were significantly affected by all the above variables. Given
   that computer games, when appropriately designed, can enhance young
   children's learning and cognitive development and at the same time ECE
   teachers' role is crucial, more research should be conducted in order to
   predict ECE students' preparedness to successfully implement games based
   learning methods in their classroom, as future teachers.}},

Abstract = {{Computer programming is a core subject in most Computer science
   programmes at university level but many students have difficulties with
   both the understanding of theoretical concepts and with the learning of
   practical programming skills. Several studies have pointed out that
   there exist pedagogical and motivational problems resulting in high
   drop-out rates and low learning outcomes. On the other hand today's
   students have grown up in a digital and internet connected world where
   playing computer games is a common and appreciated spare time activity.
   It has been discussed during many years amongst teachers and researchers
   which important features a programming language should have to support
   learning and which the appropriate programming paradigms are for
   introductory programming courses. Less has been discussed and written
   about modifying the actual course content and use the recognised
   attraction and catalytic effect of computer games. The aim of this case
   study is to describe, analyze and discuss the concept of learning to
   program by game construction. In this case study two course analyses
   have been combined with a literature review on pedagogy for Game Based
   Learning (GBL Findings from the literature review show that the idea of
   students constructing knowledge in their interactions with their
   environment is not a new one and that games have been used in
   educational contexts long before the introduction of computers. The idea
   of Game based learning has support in the constructivist learning theory
   concept that was introduced theoretically at university level in the
   1970s by Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky. Results from the study also
   indicate that the practical application of the game construction concept
   has been successful in the two investigated programming courses both
   when it comes to student motivation and learning outcomes. Furthermore,
   this game based pedagogy can motivate students not only to develop
   themselves as future programmers but also to become more innovative and
   entrepreneurial by improving the quality and performance of the games in
   order to deploy, promote and sell them.}},

Abstract = {{Using scientific evaluation criteria, the current study investigates
   Steve Jobs' personality profile, whose innovations in the field of
   technology are accepted as milestones in our daily and digital lives.
   Jobs is a world-famous figure who still acts as a role model for
   entrepreneurial success. Based on the attitudinal, emotional and
   behavioral aspects of his narratives, we intend making an exhaustive
   illustration of his personality characteristics which brought him
   success in business. Entrepreneurs are actively involved in business
   creation and development. Thus, they have become the focus of
   personality research in the field of psychology. Predefined dimensions,
   such as the Big Five, have been used to explain their personality
   profiles (Ciavarella et al, 2004; Zhao and Seibert, 2006; Antoncic,
   2009). Proactivity, need for achievement, tolerance for ambiguity,
   affiliation need, locus of control, self-efficacy are some other factors
   referred in the literature, for describing entrepreneurial
   characteristics. In order to assess entrepreneurial potential, to make
   an effective selection of corporate entrepreneurs who will lead
   innovations and to predict the future success of entrepreneurial
   activities, we have attempted to consistently integrate earlier academic
   findings. Consequently, a tool has been developed based on the shorter
   version of Measure of Entrepreneurial Tendencies and Abilities, and
   Entrepreneurial Outcomes questionnaire (Ahmetoglu and Chamorro-Premuzic,
   2010; Ahmetoglu, Leutner and Chamorro-Premuzic, 2011). It conceptualizes
   entrepreneurial profile by a six-dimensional personality structure.
   These are entrepreneurial awareness, opportunism and risk-taking
   propensity, entrepreneurial creativity, need for progress,
   entrepreneurial outcomes and entrepreneurial leaders. Case-based
   methodology and narrative analysis technique are used in the current
   study. The data comes from three sources: Steve Jobs' biography written
   by Walter Isaacson (2011), the book of his quotations called ``I, Steve:
   Steve Jobs In His Own Words{''}, edited by George Beahm (2011) and his
   Stanford commencement speech publically available on You Tube (Jobs,
   2005).}},

Abstract = {{Development of higher education in Kazakhstan follows the general trends
   of global education system. In 2011, Kazakhstan has launched the project
   of the Ministry of Education of Science ``E-Learning System{''}.
   The most content-rich, attractive structure of information delivery for
   organization teaching process are the websites of some higher schools,
   but by the start of 2012-2013 academic year, there are available higher
   schools which do not have own websites, or access to their websites is
   limited, or some websites are being reconstructed. Higher schools of the
   Republic which do not have their own libraries are connected to the
   Republican Inter-University E-Library (RIEL), and also they offer access
   to other electronic libraries presented in the Internet.
   In recent years Kazakhstan is conducting works on implementation of
   technologies of electronic, virtual education. If in 2009 over 28
   universities offered distance learning technology, then by September
   2012 the distance learning is being offered on websites of about 50
   higher schools of Kazakhstan. Today there is a need for collaboration of
   IT specialists and experts in developing virtual research laboratories
   at universities. Electronic (virtual) research laboratories contribute
   to the formation of innovative research and education environment in
   higher schools. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Designing across cultures requires considerable attention to
   interrelational design methods that facilitate mutual exploration,
   learning and trust. Many Western design practices have been borne of a
   different model, utilizing approaches for the design team to rapidly
   gain insight into ``users{''} in order to deliver concepts and
   prototypes, with little attention paid to different cultural
   understandings about being, knowledge, participation and life beyond the
   design project. This paper describes a project that intends to create
   and grow a sustainable set of technology assisted communication
   practices for the Warnindilyakwa people of Groote Eylandt in the form of
   digital noticeboards. Rather than academic practices of workshops,
   interviews, probes or theoretical discourses that emphasize an
   outside-in perspective, we emphasize building upon the local designs and
   practices. Our team combines bilingual members from the local Land
   Council in collaboration with academics from a remote urban university
   two thousand kilometers away. We contribute an approach of growing
   existing local practices and materials digitally in order to explore
   viable, innovative and sustainable technical solutions from this
   perspective.}},

Abstract = {{We present CapTUI, an innovative drawing tool that detects tangible
   drawing instruments on a capacitive multi-touch tablet. There are three
   core components to the system: the tangible hardware, the recognizer
   used to identify the tangibles and the drawing software that works in
   tandem with the tangibles to provide intelligent visual drawing guides.
   Our recognizable tangible drawing instruments are a ruler, protractor
   and set square. Users employ these familiar physical instruments to
   construct digital ink drawings on a tablet in an intuitive and engaging
   manner. The visual drawing guides enhance the experience by offering the
   user helpful cues and functionalities to assist them to draw more
   accurately. A user evaluation comparing CapTUI to an application with
   passive tools showed that users significantly preferred CapTUI and found
   that the visual guides provide greater accuracy when drawing.}},

Abstract = {{Crowd accessibility services for people with disabilities, driven by
   crowd-sourcing methods, are gaining traction as a viable means of
   realizing innovative services by leveraging both human and machine
   intelligence. As the approach matures, researchers and practitioners are
   seeking to build various types of services. However, many of them
   encounter similar challenges, such as variations in quality and
   sustaining contributor participation for durable services. There are
   growing needs to share tangible knowledge about the best practices to
   help build and maintain successful services. Towards this end, we are
   sharing our experiences with crowd accessibility services that we have
   deployed and studied. Initially, we developed a method to analyze the
   dynamics of contributor participation. We then analyzed the actual data
   from three service deployments spanning several years. The service types
   included Web accessibility improvement, text digitization, and video
   captioning. We then summarize the lessons learned and future research
   directions for sustainable services.}},

Abstract = {{The article addresses a relatively new and complex problem in social
   sciences. The term smart development has been transferred from
   technological to social sciences several years ago. Researchers have
   been analysing the fragmented aspects of the problem, however, systemic
   research in the field is hard to find. A theoretically sound concept of
   smart development is yet to be created. In social sciences, the
   substance of smart is quite different and more complex, compared to
   technological sciences. This is due to the nature of social systems
   because it is widely acknowledged that biological and social systems are
   among the most complex ones. This is why the scientific analysis of
   smartness in social systems and the substance of smart development of
   social systems is an important and challenging scientific endeavour per
   se. Another aspect of the theoretical problem is the positioning of the
   smartness category in social sciences among other related categories,
   such as knowledge, knowing, innovativeness, and intelligence. Some
   researchers regard smart development as the integration of ICT into
   everyday life and state functions (Komninos, 2011; Bailey and Ngwenyama,
   2011), while others highlight the importance of knowledge management
   (Garcia, 2007; Yigitcanlar, 2010). Still others emphasize the coherence
   of infrastructure with objectives, the importance of learning,
   innovation, and networks (Allwinkle and Cruickshank, 2011; Kuk and
   Janssen, 2011), or stress the importance of business systems being a
   critical element of any competitive economy (Whitley, 1992). The idea of
   smart specialization which has been proposed by a group of researchers
   back in 2008 has been spreading fast in practice and has successfully
   become a platform for economic and social development. However, we still
   see a lack of a more detailed scientific interpretation and
   conceptualization of this phenomenon. Not clearly understanding what
   those categories really mean, what criteria should be used in assessing
   the smartness in strategic documents, many costly mistakes are likely to
   be made.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to examine the specific techniques and
   teaching methodologies that enabled the authors to create authentic
   online learning experiences in undergraduate and graduate courses. Using
   both synchronous and asynchronous methodologies, the authors examined
   the highs and lows of translating meaningful face to face practice to
   the online environment. The paper examines teaching strategies used in a
   six week online graduate course using Adobe connect, Blackboard LMS and
   synchronous weekly meetings. While the digital world speaks in a
   language of one or zero, pedagogy cannot be reduced to such simple
   terms. It is a complex, dynamic, and creative process. This paper
   discusses how the richness of human connections traditionally
   experienced in face-to-face learning environments can be easily
   transmuted to an online class. Through the use of unique strategies such
   as ``digital moments{''} and embracing creative thought, an authentic,
   constructivist community was created. The authors' journey to developing
   this authenticity, their online pedagogical style and an innovative,
   safe learning community has been chronicled using narrative qualitative
   inquiry in this paper. The writers' use of digital moments empowers
   students to create and have ownership of their own online community.
   While it is important to note that there as many differences in online
   courses as there are in f2f environments, it is clear that the human
   aspects of fundamentally good teaching remain untouched. For both the
   authors and their students, previous experiences with distance education
   had been impersonal and disengaging. That alternative, a group of
   utterly disengaged and inexorably bored students was unacceptable. The
   old style of traditional distance learning held no particular draw from
   a humanistic perspective. The authors discovered that there are ways to
   embrace creativity, and develop the kind of collaborative learning
   environment that they designed in their face-to-face classrooms. This
   paper articulates their journey into the abyss of digitizing themselves
   as teachers; it examines the specific techniques used for best practice
   in online learning, while simultaneously celebrating the splash of
   colour that is essential to brighten digital learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{The ``innovative{''} nature of e-learning experiences presumes that
   teachers are facilitators. The techniques and strategies needed for
   teaching in a digital age (Anderson 2004, Starkey 2011) generally, and
   more specifically in electronic environments (Bender 2003, Conrad \&
   Donaldson 2004), necessitate a shift from transactional to more
   participatory, communication-rich modes of teaching. Teaching in the
   digital age (e-teaching) has specific elements (Anderson 2004, Palloff
   \& Pratt 2003, Palloff \& Pratt 2007). The author reviews literature
   which proposes guidelines and ``best practices{''} in e-teacher
   mediation and explores strategies recommended to build online
   communities of practice (COPs). The challenges teachers face are
   discussed with reference to accounts of personal experiences, guidelines
   and models of ``best practices{''} in e-teacher mediation. The author
   synthesizes the ideas associated with the ``teacher as facilitator{''}
   ideal to argue that they in fact resemble ideas advanced in the 1960s
   and 70s by advocates of the humanistic approach to language teaching
   (Nunan 1998), and therefore, teachers can, with appropriate support,
   step into the dynamic, multimodal, and complex technology-mediated
   teaching/learning environments and thrive as facilitators of learning.
   The paper concludes with recommendations for educators to incorporate
   humanistic teaching and community building theories into their courses
   as they ``reconfigure{''} their roles to match the demands of the task
   of online teaching.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the journey that has been taken in developing the
   ``Gathering the Voices Project{''}. We first discuss the rationale for
   the Project, the partners we are working with and the expected outcomes.
   The project is using informal learning approaches to engage with the
   general population. Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) is working in
   partnership with the Gathering the Voices Association (a voluntary
   group) with the purpose of collecting and digitising oral testimonies of
   Holocaust survivors who came to live in Scotland. We have completed the
   pilot phase of the Project and are now in the second phase which is
   collecting and digitising the testimonies and investigating new
   innovative ways to deliver the objectives of the project. We want to
   record their description of their lives and that of their families in
   Nazi dominated Europe and, especially, their experiences once they
   gained sanctuary in Scotland for educational and public engagement
   purposes. Throughout our project, we are seeking the participation of
   the community in the creation of our educational and public engagement
   outputs. Our key outputs are involving students in the creation and
   development of multimedia learning approaches for schools and a
   travelling exhibition that will take our materials out into the
   community, as well as providing resources for future educational and
   Holocaust related events. We have also been fortunate in receiving
   funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Sense Over Sectarianism
   (Scottish Government), the Federal Republic of Germany, and local
   community trusts in Scotland. The anticipated learning outcomes use a
   variety of pedagogical and blended learning approaches, including:
   collecting and digitising the oral testimonies of Holocaust survivors in
   Scotland; creating an informative and easy to navigate website including
   extracts from interviews and photographs of personal artefacts, and
   hosting a Game/App Jam at GCU. The strategic overall aim of this project
   is to ensure that resources developed during the project are widely
   disseminated to a broadly diverse user base. We also intend for the
   resources to be available for future National Holocaust Day events in
   Scotland. The British Library has also confirmed that they including our
   website as part of their Curators' Choice UK Archive.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some of the challenges ahead of us even after 75
   years of the discovery of the fission process and large progress made
   since then. The focus is on application orientation, which requires
   improved measurements on fission cross-sections and neutron and
   gamma-ray multiplicities. Experimental possibilities have vastly
   improved the past decade leading to developments of highly sophisticated
   detector systems and the use of digital data acquisition and signal
   processing. The development of innovative fast nuclear reactor
   technology needs improved respective nuclear data. Advancements in
   theoretical modelling also require better experimental data. Theory has
   made progress in calculating fission fragment distributions (i.e. GEF
   code) as well as prompt neutron and gamma-ray emission to catch up with
   the improved experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Cochlear implants (CIs) have been used for many years to restore hearing
   for deaf patients. Unfortunately, today's CIs are still bulky devices
   and uncomfortable to wear. In this paper we present three innovations
   that ultimately should pave the way to a fully implantable bionic ear.
   First a microfabrication process used to fabricate the polymer metal
   microelectrode array for auditory nerve stimulation is discussed.
   Subsequently, a compact biphasic programmable stimulator chip to be used
   along with this electrode array is presented. By using a double loop
   feedback circuit topology, the circuit provides a precise stimulation
   current while requiring only little voltage headroom. The resulting low
   power consumption and reduced chip area allow for integration of the
   electronic circuitry onto the electrode array. Finally, as reliability
   and data transmission rate are two of the most critical issues in CI
   devices, we propose a software method to improve both data rate and
   reliability of transmitting digital data from the external part of the
   CI to the internal part with negligible power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{The explosion of digital data and the dependence on data-intensive
   services have been recognized as the most significant characteristics of
   IT trends in the current decade. Designing workflow of data-intensive
   services requires data analysis from multiple sources to get required
   composite services. Composing such services requires effective transfer
   of large data. Thus many new challenges are posed to control the cost
   and revenue of the whole composition. This paper addresses the
   data-intensive service composition and presents an innovative
   data-intensive service selection algorithm based on a modified genetic
   algorithm. The performance of this new algorithm is also tested by
   simulations and compared against other traditional approaches, such as
   mix integer programming. The contributions of this paper are three
   folds: 1) An economical model for data-intensive service provision is
   proposed; 2) An extensible QoS model is also proposed to calculate the
   QoS values of data-intensive services; 3) Finally, a modified genetic
   algorithm-based approach is introduced to compose data-intensive
   services. A local selection method with modifications of crossover and
   mutation operators is adopted for this algorithm. The results of
   experiments will demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our
   proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper revisits sampling-filters for signals having a finite rate of
   innovations. Such filters arise in many applications including digital
   communications and compressive sensing, and mulitchannel versions of
   these systems have been considered in the past. The main focus of this
   paper is on sampling-filters that result in perfect reconstruction (PR),
   or zero-forcing (ZF). Conditions for existence of these filters are
   expressed both in terms of bandwidth requirement and in the framework of
   Riesz basis. Many practical advantages induced by the Riesz basis
   property are also pointed out. When the sampling filters for PR exist,
   they are in general not unique. Optimum filters that minimize the effect
   of noise are discussed and compared with energy compaction filters,
   which are suboptimal.(1)}},

Abstract = {{Digital government is both a research domain and a field of practice. As
   such, it needs both new knowledge and research-based problem solving and
   innovation. To achieve both ends, researchers need to bring their full
   array of theories, standards and methodologies to the actual needs of
   government, while practitioners' deep knowledge of policy domains, and
   organizational and political environments can challenge and enrich how
   researchers frame questions, explore explanations, and convey results.
   Deeply-rooted differences in these two professional cultures make this
   kind of engagement difficult and prone to failure, but improvement is
   both needed and possible. This essay reflects on twenty years of
   experience with research-practice partnerships and offers strategies
   that individual researchers can use-to make-it more feasible and
   strccessful. The strategies address relationship building, choice of
   research methods, research management techniques, the timing of
   research, and realistic appreciation for costs, benefits and risks.}},

Abstract = {{In our modern era of Internet, mobile and digital information
   technology, adoption of innovative education strategies to the needs of
   the time is quite important particularly at private educational
   institutions which cater to economically affluent students who are
   becoming picky and often more interested in their distractions than in
   their studies. This is particularly true in Japan where students are
   becoming highly valuable commodity due its economic slowdown, decline in
   youth population and existence of more educational institutions than the
   true demand. This paper attempts to explain how the Ritsumeikan Asia
   Pacific University (APU) which was established in the year 2000 with an
   aim of becoming a hub for shaping the future of Asia-Pacific region by
   creating world class leaders tries to assure quality of their graduates
   despite the abovementioned problems through blended learning, peer
   knowledge sharing, adaptation of Blackboard, portfolio, active learning,
   student support, academic advising, and by providing of a natural
   learning environment.}},
