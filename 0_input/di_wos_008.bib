Abstract = {{This contribution focuses on applying Google Maps in educating pupils
   with mild intellectual disability. To achieve this, we design and submit
   an evaluation tool for measuring the pupils' skills in the Google Maps
   environment, inspired by Bloom digital taxonomy. We also assess the
   level of achieved skills of pupils with mild intellectual disability by
   comparing mapping with other variables in the geographic competences
   area. The study focuses on the result of research carried out within the
   VEGA no. 1/0789/14 project. The study also identifies the positive
   effect of a geographical information system (GIS) on the learning of
   intact pupils. To the surprise of the authors, the portal of Google Maps
   appealed to these participants to the extent that they continued to use
   it for self-study at their homes.}},

Abstract = {{Business ecosystems enabled by the increasing use and improvement of
   communication networks, offer nowadays a powerful competitive advantage
   to business players and entrepreneurs. They form a collaborative new
   mean of economic and social value creation, addressing customers' needs,
   overcoming constraints of individual firms, increasing capabilities for
   new business opportunities, and accelerating learning and innovation.
   This paper proposes a set of performance indicators to measure some of
   these collaboration benefits, therefore motivating the sustainability
   and resilience of the business ecosystem. The presented results are
   based on simulation models, which intend to characterize the roles and
   interactions of a real life collaborative business ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary schools have not changed significantly since the 19th
   century. From primary level (elementary schools) to tertiary level of
   education (colleges and universities), the predominant approach to
   teaching is ex-cathedra teaching with assessment system based on grades.
   What has changed over the years are teaching and learning tools, but the
   methods have remained the same. In this context, information and
   communication technology is viewed as a tool supporting the traditional
   education systems.
   The new, hyper-digital era is based on ubiquitous computing that is
   radically transforming the way we live and work, and consequently, the
   way we teach and learn. Contemporary technologies lead to disruptive
   innovations in all sectors. As such, traditional education system fails
   to perceive the necessity to rethink the fundamental paradigms of
   education based on institutional framework (schools). This paper
   examines the evolution of education in the context of information and
   communication technologies and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of
   traditional, school-based education, as opposed to ubiquitous education
   based on information and communication technology, which has not been
   formally acknowledged within education systems, but which depends on
   effort invested by individuals instead. It also examines disruptive
   innovations in education systems that have a potential to transform
   formal education processes dramatically.}},

Abstract = {{Forced to adapt to new realities, the human mind has evolved in a
   qualitatively superior way from a historical stage to another. This
   principle is affirmed and demonstrated in several studies known as The
   Flynn Phenomenon. As a response to these principles, The Non-Flynn
   Phenomenon claims that in our modern heavily digitized society, IQ has
   decreased due to the minimal contribution of the human mind in dealing
   with the new existential problems of humanity. The current trend of
   substitution of specific human elements by gadgets, software tools or
   created digital spaces is increasingly obvious. Between The Flynn and
   non-Flynn Phenomenon, education plays an important role. Education aims
   efficient use innovative technical means. And this trend may be the
   solution for the continuous development of IQ. The new technology
   involves increasing interest, maintaining motivation, widening of the
   informational horizon, if used properly, without excesses, in
   combination with other methods and modern and applied educational
   resources. (C) 2016 Published by Future Academy}},

Abstract = {{We present the key scientific questions that can be addressed by GMOX, a
   Multi-Object Spectrograph selected for feasibility study as a 4th
   generation instrument for the Gemini telescopes. Using commercial
   digital micro mirror devices (DMDs) as slit selection mechanisms, GMOX
   can observe hundred of sources at R 5000 between the U and K band
   simultaneously. Exploiting the narrow PSF delivered by the Gemini South
   GeMS MCAO module, GMOX can synthesize slits as small as 40mas reaching
   extremely faint magnitude limits, and thus enabling a plethora of
   applications and innovative science. Our main scientific driver in
   developing GMOX has been Resolving galaxies through cosmic time: GMOX
   40mas slit (at GeMS) corresponds to 300 pc at z similar to 1.5, where
   the angular diameter distance reaches its maximum, and therefore to even
   smaller linear scales at any other redshift. This means tha GMOX can
   take spectra of regions smaller than 300 pc in the whole observable
   Universe, allowing to probe the growth and evolution of galaxies with
   unprecedented detail. GMOXs multi-object capability and high angular
   resolution enable efficient studies of crowded fields, such as globular
   clusters, the Milky Way bulge, the Magellanic Clouds, Local Group
   galaxies and galaxy clusters. The wide-band simultaneous coverage and
   the very fast slit configuration mechanisms also make GMOX ideal for
   followup of LSST transients.}},

Abstract = {{The proposed research focuses on energy progressive upgrades of the
   existing building stock and the connection with the smart city through
   the Building Information Modeling (BIM) process as a fundamental key
   factor for the implementation of a connected built environment.
   Nowadays, this core topic fits into the discussion of the Digital
   Transition, both about infrastructure (innovative schools), both in the
   educational services and learning methods (National Plan for Digital
   Schools Methodologies). Two main points compose the presented research:
   as first the processes of collecting information and retrofit options
   (energy retrofit and space use) assessment achieved by a performance
   based approach for the energy segment and according to a behavioral
   mindset (behavioral design) for the functional and spatial
   reorganization and definition. The second part of the project, related
   to the smart cities, concerns the connection of the buildings between
   them and with the cultural environment and communities included in the
   city. The outcomes of the research are intended in presenting a
   multidisciplinary methodology able to reconnect a broad public building
   stock to the development of urban and social regeneration policies
   strongly needed at national and international level.}},

Abstract = {{Cities provide an excellent platform for gathering and detection of
   massive amount of data from cities and citizens. Emergence of new
   digital technologies inspires not only city governments but also city
   residents, researchers, companies and other stakeholders in discovering
   and creating new innovative solutions to solve urban challenges and
   improve peoples' everyday life. Developing novel Internet of Things
   (IoT) solutions for cities and citizens requires facilities where IoT
   applications and services can be tested and experimented. The challenge
   for many smart-city test and experimentation platforms (TEPs), like
   living labs, has been the lack of sustainable value creation model. This
   has caused many experimentation platforms to perish after the ending of
   external funding. A vision about how to construct a robust and
   continuous IoT test and experimentation platform, as well as instruments
   for it, is required. The IoT service experimentation platform (IoT SEP)
   framework presented in this paper provides guidelines for this effort.
   IoT SEP consist of ten dimensions relevant for establishing a
   sustainable IoT SEP in smart cities.}},

   The list of open questions is almost daily getting longer, as technology
   is moving on, and awareness about the problems inherent with these
   platforms is rising. Multi-sided platforms will change the way we think
   about our lives, how work will be, how we buy and use goods and
   services, how corporations re-design their strategies, what shapes
   strategic decisions in general. Last but not least the question of
   government regulation needs to be answered, who is accountable for the
   transaction taking place on the platforms and in the end who will pay

Abstract = {{Electronic services are shaping a new trend around the world. The
   development of information technology and widespread use of the Internet
   makes it easier to perform any work anywhere. New service trends are
   emerging. Bangladesh, as a developing economy is also working to build a
   Digital Bangladesh. Automation systems are taking central roles in all
   sorts of work, from government to private. One of the newest of these
   trends is the introduction of e-ticketing and home delivery. In 2014, a
   joint collaboration between Bangladeshi and European investors
   constructed the idea of shohoz. com, the first ever online ticket
   booking and home delivery system. During the busy times of the year,
   especially during the festivals like Eid, Puja and other holidays,
   people rush to their homes in villages by water, road and train. The
   struggle to get a single ticket has prompted t his initiative. In this
   study, a qualitative analysis has been made on shohoz. com. The process
   of its operations, marketing and sales has been analyzed. Words of
   satisfied customers are taken by conducting a small survey on selected
   customers who have received the service of shohoz. com. The only thing
   that makes it unique is the introduction of delivering ticket in homes.
   Having an intention to make people easily get tickets, shohoz. com has
   created a new type of service in Bangladesh. Successfully identifying
   the niche in the market, it is one of the e-service innovations of the
   21st century. Service innovations like this will encourage the research
   and entrepreneurship opportunities that this symposium aims to achieve:

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the usability and
   user perceptions of the display technology in the library to evaluate
   the utility of the Liquid Galaxy (LG) technology and how it was deployed
   in a library setting.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the results of a mixed
   method (survey and interview) qualitative study of users of the LG
   Google Earth/Google Street View immersive display in the Research Hub of
   Davis Library of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill conducted
   in April 2015. In total, 25 users of the LG responded to survey or
   interview questions about their user experience and their emotional
   response to the LG.
   Findings - Users found the LG easy to use and they had many reasons for
   using the LG including: research, education, entertainment, trip
   planning and nostalgic virtual travel.
   Originality/value - There are few studies on users' experience of
   innovative non-way finding display technology in library settings and
   this study then adds to the literature on this subject. These results
   may assist organizations evaluating incorporating an immersive display
   such as the LG into their offerings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the evaluation of automated image based techniques
   which are used lately in order to produce three dimensional digital
   models of cultural heritage objects. This implies a doubt as to how
   accurate and reliable are the products of these automated algorithms and
   how efficient they are for providing the necessary 3D material for the
   virtual environments. The implementation of this innovative approach has
   gradually become very popular in the field of Cultural Heritage during
   the last five years. Non-specialists found a way to easily produce 3D
   reconstructions just by taking a few images and using
   Structure-from-Motion and Multiview Stereo algorithms implemented by
   commercial or open source software. However, this fact led to debatable
   results, as a lot of ambiguities are lurking hidden in the
   ``happiness{''} of automation. In order to assess the metric performance
   of these algorithms an innovative metric evaluation strategy has been
   designed. A very accurately measured test field, set up mainly for
   calibrating digital cameras, was used as an object of well-known ground
   truth. It was established that the accuracy of the resulting 3D
   reconstruction depends on the spatial analysis and the general quality
   of the original digital images, on the careful selection of the
   parameters provided by the software, the properties of the object itself
   and the computing power available.}},

Abstract = {{Education and technological advances have enabled digital learning
   technologies to become a key pillar holding up one of the main United
   Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Quality Education.
   Technology-enhanced learning strategies have led to innovative ICT
   applications for the development of new improved learning and teaching
   practices aiding to guarantee inclusive and equitable quality education
   and promote opportunities for all. Nonetheless, there is still a big
   challenge to get hold of all the capabilities of these
   technology-enhanced learning strategies: improving the learner quality
   of experience (QoE). This paper presents an innovative technology
   enhanced learning initiative that aims to attract students to,STEM
   education and improve access for students with disabilities through the
   analysis of the learner QoE. Moreover, in this paper some of the
   required standards and specifications to be used for developing this
   initiative are identified. Another key contribution of the paper is that
   it explores the necessity of new related standards and introduces some
   novel proposals for standardization in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Africa has experienced an explosive growth of smartphones-particularly
   sub-Saharan Africa where growth rates are more than twice the global
   average. Such mobile devices provide new ways for technologies to help
   people discover and interact with their physical worlds. In particular,
   harnessing the power of digital mobile maps in Africa has the
   opportunity to transform lives by providing greater access to
   information, goods, and services that exist in people's physical worlds.
   Despite this potential, there are a number of challenges and
   opportunities to doing so that are unique to Africa's culture,
   infrastructure, and physical landscape. The goal of this workshop is to
   engage in creative ideation around this topic in order to create a
   series of innovative designs and to build out a research agenda that
   would push forward the design and development of such technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The fundraising campaigns realised through popular online crowdfunding
   platforms seem to be exhibiting unstoppable expansion, with the
   phenomenon reaching an increasing number of people and doubling its
   turnover year after year. Crowdfunding is one of the most dynamically
   growing segments of fintech but at the same time, the academic world is
   voicing justified scepticism in respect of the sustainability and
   operating background of the original model. For the time being, the
   position of banks is protected by the legislative and regulatory
   background, but digitally advanced users are seeking out wallet-friendly
   and convenient solutions for the administration of their financial
   affairs as well. According to certain estimates, bank revenues could
   drop by as much as 20\% by 2023 due to the rise of the fintech sector,
   and one third of bank employees could lose their jobs in ten years.
   Equity-based crowdfunding has the potential to become an alternative to
   traditional corporate and project-financing techniques. The
   community-forming power of online fundraising platforms is strong, and
   certain campaigns may also serve market communication purposes.(1)}},

   gave rise to it. Also, a qualitative research evaluates how the media
   literacy variable has emerged as an essential curricular symptom, and
   its impact on the new characteristics of citizens. Results and
   Discussion: One of the primary skills required in a communication
   researcher is the efficient management of technology and innovation.
   This has required the incorporation of media literacy as content in
   seminars, as a transversal object in the education of researchers, as
   well as in the production of new scientific advances in communication.}},

Abstract = {{The latest technologies, together with the fast growing access to
   Internet and the constant innovation in this field (mobile applications,
   wearable gadgets, sensor technology) are transforming the economy and
   the society per se on a scale never seen before, offering opportunities
   for new forms of social interaction and innovative personalized
   services. For marketers, this means that tools and strategies that were
   considered as cutting-edge, are quickly becoming obsolete, requiring an
   equally fast adoption and adaptation to the new tech environment. The
   present paper is an exploratory intercession in the way marketers can
   extract intelligence from big data and small data in order to better map
   their strategy, predict future outcomes, map in a more accurate manner
   the persons with the highest propensity to become your customers, highly
   personalize messages and complement the bigger picture analysis of the
   role of different media. From this point of view, the authors focus
   shifts towards the way predictive marketing is gaining momentum and has
   an impact in the way marketers and new business owners can identify what
   values and goals guide their brand strategy, what drives performance for
   their business and what structures, tools, and working methods will
   enhance a purposeful positioning of their brand.}},

Abstract = {{The paper focuses on the concept of `towards sustainable public
   organizations. It will take a definitive holistic view of public
   organizations, role and functions of public organizations, status or
   characteristics of the public organization and the brief schools of
   thought or model of public organization; assess the challenges and
   proffer possible suggestions towards their resolution. Public
   organizations are beginning to face more operational challenges such as
   competition locally and internationally, competition occasioned by
   digital commercial enterprises - online super business, security threats
   including online threats by hackers, higher operational cost,
   technological innovations and improvised alternatives. There is also the
   issue of impacts occasioned by globalization, global terrorist
   activities, climate change effects, continuous increase in the
   demography of the world, etc. Such challenges as above had made it
   extremely vital for public organizations to take inventory of strategies
   for sustainability and efficiency, just as combating these kinds of
   challenges task public organizations more not only in the discharge of
   their roles and functions but in also keeping the establishment from
   external threats. The research approach or methodology, making use of
   secondary data, would do a holistic assessment of such concepts as
   public organizations, sustainable public organizations, identify what
   the traditional and contemporary challenges of the public organizations
   are, assess the impacts of the challenges of public organizations with a
   view to drawing suggestions and recommendations towards their resolution
   from experiences and practices that are widely applicable in various
   climes of the world. The research would clearly look at the following;
   definitive holistic view of public organizations, concepts as public
   organizations; what is sustainable public organization; role and
   functions of public organizations; status of public organizations; brief
   school of thought on public organizations; identify traditional
   challenges of public organizations; identify contemporary challenges of
   public organizations; assess the challenges public organizations;
   suggestions towards their resolution of challenges of Public
   organizations; operational challenges such as competition locally and
   internationally; competition occasioned by digital commercial
   enterprises such as online super business, security threats including
   online threats by hackers, higher operational cost, technological

   population are still lacking resources to own basic information and
   communication technologies such as computer and internet. This suggests
   that majority of the citizens from developing countries (e.g. India) are
   also not able to access and use emerging electronic government
   applications and services. This is leading to a further and bigger
   digital divide gap that already exists between rural and urban as well
   as economically less and more able population. To reduce the widening
   digital divide, India has innovated Common Services Centres (CSCs) as
   means to deliver public services electronically to citizens at the
   village level. This viewpoint paper aims to discuss some of the
   challenges and obstacles of such CSCs and to offer some recommendations
   for their effective implementations and sustainable operations.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a viewpoint paper that is based on
   authors' awareness of the context as well as knowledge and issues
   relevant to the research topic. Anumber of appropriate and current
   citations have been utilised to illustrate the current state on the
   topic as well as to support authors' arguments presented in this paper.
   Findings - The paper identified a number of key issues relevant for
   effective implementation and sustainable operation of CSCs. The authors
   present their views and recommendations related to the following key
   issues: connectivity problems, lack of or delayed rollout of government
   to citizen (G2C) services, demotivated village-level entrepreneurs due
   to lack of G2C services, low computer literacy, lack of awareness about
   services and facilities, lack of adequate training and support, poor
   provisioning of an effective infrastructure, lack of support from the
   concerned government officials, inaccessible locations, burden of high
   investment, corruption at the government level, lack of skilled manpower
   to run the CSCs, lack of power supply, language barrier, lack of space,
   problem with maintenance and management of connectivity network and
   problem caused by the Naxalite and anarchist activity.
   Originality/value - The discussion and recommendations presented in this
   paper would be valuable to various agencies (both from public and
   private sectors) as well as policymakers for effective implementation
   and long-term sustainability of CSCs. The approach discussed in this
   paper offers an effective way to diffuse e-government applications and
   services in other developing countries (particularly
   resource-constrained nations from African, Asian and Latin American
   regions).}},

Abstract = {{The sector of telecommunications is one of the flagships of engineering
   from the time that has been invented, as it was enabling communication
   that is a major need of humans. In the decades of `90s and early 2000
   the rapid development of telecommunications with the parallel evolution
   of Internet, have significantly influenced people, communities and
   growth worldwide. During this time, Internet evolution created lots of
   opportunities, but many of those were not sound and that led us to the
   dot-com bubble. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the
   Western world experienced a deep recession and so did the sector of
   telecommunications. On the same time Internet started to recover from
   the dot-com-bubble period and became the perfect medium for startups. In
   that period, the evolution of Internet has `commoditized'
   telecommunications that served mainly as a medium and not as an
   innovation vehicle. Nowadays there is a stabilization of dynamics in the
   ICT world and telecommunications sector is seeking its role and position
   in contribution to disruptive concepts of the New Digital Era. This
   positioning and role will be the early definition of its strategy Beyond
   2050.}},

Abstract = {{College English teaching is facing many difficulties in the information
   age. As a kind of new teaching mode, the flipped classroom shows its
   unique advantages compared with the traditional teaching mode. On this
   basis, this paper makes a research on the teaching mode of college
   English flipped classroom based on APP and designs a feasible teaching
   plan of flipped classroom. Moreover, it analyzes the matters that should
   be concerned in program implementation and puts forward its own
   viewpoint for college English teaching reform.
   With the development of information technology, college English
   education is faced with a series of challenges. The contradiction
   between traditional education method, learning style and the increasing
   personalized and diversified learning needs is further intensified. In
   2012, the ministry of education issued The ten-year development plan of
   Education Informatization (2011-2020) {[}1], which clearly put forward:
   we should speed up the digital transformation of courses and majors,
   innovate information-based teaching and learning method, promote the
   level of personalized interactive teaching, create personnel training
   mode and improve the quality of personnel training. It is to promote the
   widely application of tools and platforms of subject and to cultivate
   the awareness and ability of students' self-learning that provide policy
   guidance and direction navigation for the teaching reform of college
   English in the information age. The flipped classroom teaching mode
   based on APP takes informationalized reform and innovation on the
   traditional college English teaching mode, which provides a good
   platform to liberate college English teaching from traditional classroom
   teaching.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the current situations of the researches on the library and
   information services that the theory is divorced with the practice and
   the theoretical researchers are separated from the practical workers,
   the author of this paper points out that it is necessary to introduce
   this new research method of the action research. That is, we should
   carry out the action research of the library and information services,
   which can stimulate the subjectivity and the spirit of innovation of the
   library and information professionals, promote the combination of the
   theoretical researches and the practical work, improve the actual effect
   of the work, and optimize the service functions, which is an important
   way of the professional development of the modem library and information
   professionals. In this paper, the innovative transformation and reform
   of the library and information services under the background of the
   digital information is studied. From the challenges and the impact of
   the revolution of modem information on the library and information
   service, we can realize the innovative reform of the library and
   information service from the three aspects of the improvement of the
   information literacy of the library and information personnel, the
   reconstruction and innovation of the library and information management
   services, and the mining and integration of the digital library
   information resources.
   The history of the mankind is a history of the information revolution.
   The information not only promotes the development of the human society,
   but also undertakes the process of the history of the human development.
   The invention and production of the language, texts, paper and printing
   have made the development of the human information technology have the
   leap for the first time. The messages, telephones, televisions and other
   radio technologies have made the texts, sounds, images and other
   information break the limitations of the time and the space, and have
   achieved the long-distance information exchange and sharing. Nowadays,
   the popularity of the Internet technology can make the information
   communication achieve the two-way interaction, and break the limitations
   of the time and the space and the information carrying capacity. The
   computer network technology will link up the libraries, research
   institutes and schools of the whole nation together and the information
   of books have the digital information platform. This is the greatest
   liberation of the human information communication, and also the new
   definition of the library and information services.}},

   that work systems and their environments are designed in a
   learning-enhancing way. This is regarded as a prerequisite for the

   become smarter cities, the unique intersection between ICT and
   development road map is inspiring new innovative applications. While
   this quest for smart city continues, the transformation of street
   lighting has become a topical issue. As part of ongoing investigation in
   Triangulum smart city project, this paper presents some simulation
   results on the use of narrowband powerline communication (NPLC) for
   street lights monitoring and control. The results show that, with low
   power, NPLC can support a 3.5km network of street lights without using a
   relay. It is also shown that, when the data packet size quadruples,
   latency degrades by up to 22.63\% (242.03ms) in the worst case.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the error performance of digital storage and communication
   systems, forward error correcting (FEC) codes and interleaver play a
   significant role by counteracting random and burst errors, respectively.
   In most of the applications, accurate information about the type of FEC
   codes, coding and interleaving parameters are known at the receiver in
   order to successfully decode and de-interleave the message bits,
   respectively. However, in certain applications such as spectrum
   surveillance, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC)-based communication
   systems, cognitive radio, etc., all the coding and interleaving
   parameters need not be known at the receiver and blind/semi-blind
   recognition of the same is mandatory. Therefore, in this paper,
   innovative algorithms for automatic recognition of type of FEC codes
   along with the parameter estimation of helical scan interleaver are
   proposed considering both erroneous and non-erroneous scenarios without
   any prior knowledge about the encoding scheme used in the transmitter.
   Note that the proposed algorithms will classify among block coded,
   convolutional coded, and uncoded data streams.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, virtual museums emerged, becoming a continuous trend
   for museums that want to innovate, renew and involve their visitors. The
   European Network of Virtual Museums (V-MUST.NET) in its four years
   analysis (2011-2014) indicated and tested potentially interesting
   digital applications, for the future of museums. How these involving
   narrative applications should be treated and how they should be
   communicated? From the report recently presented by Civita about museum
   and social media, emerged that 9 million of people in Italy use social
   networks to get informed about art and culture. Therefore it seems an
   important direction to follow for public institutions and museums, to
   inform people about their activities. What museums and other
   institutions are currently doing in this direction? How can they fully
   benefit from social media? Virtual museums can be considered as museums
   and use the same strategies? In order to answer to those questions, we
   have started to analyse the interaction between Virtual Museums and
   institutions, starting with those institutions that participated to the
   Museum Week (\#MuseumWeek). We have, at the same time, promoted a
   Virtual Museum (The Virtual Museum of the Tiber Valley) during the
   Museum Week 2016. The results of these activities and tests are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Superconductor electronics holds records for clock frequency and energy
   efficiency at the chip level, and is also projected to large systems
   that can absorb the cooling overhead. These advantages have nevertheless
   only managed to give this technology a back seat to CMOS digital
   circuits, which offer orders of magnitude more complexity. Furthermore,
   pursuing the CMOS paradigm with superconductor circuits would bring
   their clock frequency down to that of CMOS circuits. This makes
   superconductor technology much more open to risky innovations and even
   for paradigm changes. In the paper we point out that both (speed and
   energy efficiency) advantages of superconductor electronics could be
   preserved due to a unique composition of memory and logic functions of
   RSFQ cells. We propose to reorganize the original RSFQ cells into a new
   family of Memory And loGIC (MAGIC) gate/register objects that run
   arithmetic calculations as well as store results. The new MAGIC objects
   eliminate the time and energy overheads associated with the conventional
   transfer of computed data to memory by essentially reducing the transfer
   distance to zero. The new objects could serve as building blocks for
   distributed MAGIC-compatible architectures, differing from CMOS-like
   register files by processing as well as storing data. A simple Logic
   Unit (LU) would be sufficient to control the MAGIC registers, because
   the registers would provide most of the arithmetic functions and
   separate ALUs would not be needed. The reduction of the data exchange
   between logic and memory units leads to additional energy saving.
   Factorization of large integers is presented as an example illustrating
   the speed and density advantages of the new approach. The end result
   will be a superior technology which offers a combination of performance
   and energy efficiency unattainable by existing technologies or their
   possible extensions.}},

Abstract = {{Busbar protection grids are always important, but high-speed regimes are
   now needed more than ever because many power systems operating in
   microgrid should achieve safe and stabile operation. For this purpose,
   protection concepts that require time coordination such as overcurrent
   relays and distance protection are no longer acceptable. Digital
   differential protection uses innovative algorithms to comply with the
   protection requirements busbar with fast times switching for all faults.
   The proposed scheme provides protection for any fault in the Busbar of
   the microgrid and isolates the smallest part possible, to allow the rest
   of the system to continue operating. The main difficulty in busbar
   protection using current transformer (CT) may appear during saturation.
   Therefore, with the use of the Rogowski coil current sensors (RC) can
   overcome the saturation in CT; in addition, it has many unique features.
   The protection system consists of a unique combination using
   differential protection using RC and an intelligent tool to achieve
   reliable busbar protection with a minimum of delay for evolving faults.
   Performance has been verified for a variety of operating conditions. The
   results have confirmed the superior performance of the protection
   solution. In general, Rogowski coils have performance characteristics
   that are favorable compared to conventional CTs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative approach to apply wide-area control
   actions in real-time and prevent emerging instability. A software
   platform has been further developed, which utilizes Real Time Digital
   Simulator (RTDS) technology to prevent scenarios leading to power system
   instability. The software platform receives phasor measurement unit
   (PMU) data at a high repetition rate for full system observability. The
   PMU data serves as input for methods capable of analyzing the steady
   state torque balance for each individual generator and to determine
   available power reserves and possible remedial actions. The capabilities
   of the software platform were demonstrated by testing the methods on the
   Nordic32 test system and the results show that the methods can determine
   an active power re-dispatch and apply the countermeasures in real-time
   and prevent aperiodic rotor angle instability.}},

   One of the evolutionary technique Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

   Microwind3.1 VLSI CAD Tool. Using the tool the parameters like Area,
   Power, Delay and Maximum and Average drain current are determined with
   90nm, 65nm and 45nm technologies using BSIM4 Model. The results shown in

Abstract = {{Multipliers are the most important block in any arithmetic and logic
   unit, accumulators and Digital signal processors. Due to the increasing
   constraints on delay, design of faster multipliers is emphasized. Among
   several multipliers, Vedic multipliers are preferred for their speed of
   operation. Among the sixteen sutras in Vedic multiplication techniques
   our proposed ``URDHVA TIRYAKBHYAM `` a most efficient technique interms
   of speed. In this project we aim at developing a multiplier using
   modified Adder which implements the `` URDHVA TIRYAKBHYAM{''} sutra with
   improved speed of operation. Adders are vastly implemented in the
   critical path of many blocks of microprocessor chips. Our proposed adder
   is not only used for arithmetic logic units (ALUs). This adders are used
   in other parts of processor where they are used to calculate indices of
   table, corresponding condition and addresses. The efficiency of the
   digital system is greatly influenced by the performance of these adders.
   In this paper we proposed new innovative modified carry select adder
   with performance improvement in delay and area used. The most important
   parameters to be noted to measure the performance of adder designs are
   computation time and area. To compare results we have simulated types of
   adders in existing by using Xilinx tool and the results are compared.}},

Abstract = {{A great proportion of human population suffers from hearing loss.
   Hearing loss is a measure of shift in auditory system compared to that
   of a normal ear for detection of a pure tone. But with the availability
   of modern day technologies and the recent developments in signal
   processing area, sophisticated artificial hearing aid systems can be
   designed that relax the job of damaged auditory systems to a great
   extent and make much of the sound available to the hearing impaired. In
   this project, the simulation of the simple digital hearing aid was
   developed using MATLAB programming language. The implementation of this
   configurable digital hearing aid (DHA) system includes noise reduction
   filter, frequency-dependent amplification and amplitude compression. We
   tested our filters on a mock patient and successfully reduced white
   Gaussian noise, increased the gain for frequencies which were difficult
   to hear, and shaped the amplitude to prevent any of the frequencies from
   becoming too loud. Finally, future trends and expected innovations in
   the hearing aid industry are discussed.}},

   and especially the gate count required to design the digital
   combinational circuits. The paper shows that PSO based algorithm
   converges faster than other algorithms such as genetic algorithm and
   also reduces the computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Software defined networking promises network operators to dramatically
   simplify network management. It provides flexibility and innovation
   through network programmability. With SDN, network management moves from
   codifying functionality in terms of low-level device configuration to
   building software that facilitates network management and
   debugging{[}1]. SDN provides new techniques to solve long-standing
   problems in networking like routing by separating the complexity of
   state distribution from network specification. Despite all the hype
   surrounding SDNs, exploiting its full potential is demanding. Security
   is still the major issue and a striking challenge that reduces the
   growth of SDNs. Moreover the introduction of various architectural
   components and up cycling of novel entities of SDN poses new security
   issues and threats. SDN is considered as major target for digital
   threats and cyber-attacks{[}2] and have more devastating effects than
   simple networks. Initial SDN design doesn't considered security as its
   part; therefore, it must be raised on the agenda. This article discusses
   the security solutions proposed to secure SDNs. We categorize the
   security solutions in the article by presenting a thematic taxonomy
   based on SDN architectural layers/interfaces{[}3], security measures and
   goals, simulation framework. Moreover, the literature also points out
   the possible attacks{[}2] targeting different layers/ interfaces of
   SDNs. For securing SDNs, the potential requirements and their key
   enablers are also identified and presented. Also, the articles sketch
   the design of secure and dependable SDNs. At last, we discuss open
   issues and challenges of SDN security that may be rated appropriate to
   be handled by professionals and researchers in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate young people's experiences of persistent
   musculoskeletal pain, including care needs and current service gaps as
   well as perceptions about the role of digital technologies to support
   their co-care.
   Methods: A qualitative study employing two independent data collection
   modes: in-depth individual semistructured interviews and focus groups.
   Setting: Community settings throughout Australia.
   Participants: Participants were included if they had experienced
   persistent musculoskeletal pain of >3 month duration with an average of
   >= 3 on the visual analogue scale over the preceding 3 months, including
   non-specific conditions (eg, low back pain) and specific conditions (eg,
   juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other systemic arthritides),
   with/without pre-existing or current diagnosed mental health conditions.
   23 young people (87.0\% women; mean (SD) age: 20.8 (2.4) years) from
   across 6 Australian jurisdictions participated. Almost two-thirds of
   participants with persistent musculoskeletal pain reported comorbid
   mental health conditions.
   Main outcome measures: Inductive and deductive approaches to analyse and
   derive key themes from verbatim transcripts.
   Results: Participants described their daily experiences of living with
   persistent musculoskeletal pain, their fears and the challenges imposed
   by the invisibility of pain, and the two-way relationship between their
   pain and mental well-being. A lack of relevant and accessible
   information and resources tailored to young people's unique needs,
   integrated and youth-relevant healthcare services and adequately skilled
   healthcare practitioners were identified as key care gaps. Participants
   strongly advocated for the use of digital technologies to improve access
   to age-appropriate resources and support for co-care.
   Conclusions: Young people living with persistent musculoskeletal pain
   described the absence of age-appropriate pain services and clearly
   articulated their perceptions on the role of, and opportunities provided
   by, digital technologies to connect with and support improved pain
   healthcare. Innovative and digitally-enabled models of pain care are
   likely to be helpful for this group.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary curriculums of different level of education put emphasis in
   their output. In this context, the basal aim of the geographical
   education is considering the development of geographical literacy, and
   the development of geographical thinking. The features of geographically
   literate man are geographical knowledge, geographical skills,
   geographical attitudes, and specific geographical thinking. For
   fulfilling of this aim has also required the changes of pre-gradual
   training of future geography teachers. The main attention is dedicated
   to the subject-didactic competencies from the complex competencies that
   are developed through study. We consider, that important part of
   contemporary study is theoretical and practical acquiring of innovative
   methods. This innovative methods in the teaching will not only develop
   the theoretical knowledge, but they will also develop critical thinking,
   digital competencies, and the ability to deal with problems,
   communication and cooperation. In contribution, we deal with problematic
   visualisation of geographical objects. This implement is one of the most
   effective tools of the geographical thinking's development. We point out
   the importance and the differences of achieving the educational effect
   thankful to production and the usage of traditional manual constructed
   geographical models and digital models. We also emphasize the need of
   implementation, usage of models into the university studies for future
   geography teacher in the University of Pregov in Pregov.}},

Title = {{Brickbats and bouquets for marketing}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1906-1923}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the development and
   application of marketing theory and practice over time and its current
   status. The terms ``brickbats{''} and ``bouquets{''} are used as
   metaphors to extend praise or criticism for marketing. In doing so, the
   authors draw upon the views of leading theorists over time and apply
   these in the current environmental context.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach adopted is discursive,
   critical and conceptual.
   Findings - Following literature review, and drawing upon current
   examples, marketing as a discipline is subject to both kudos and
   criticisms. Nonetheless, it is concluded optimistically in that
   marketing can be an even greater source for societal good. That
   ``goodness{''} is partly based upon the added impetus of social media
   adoption and use by consumers, the need for growth and accelerative
   innovation in the digital age coupled with the democratisation of
   consumption. Nonetheless, the authors offer the caveat that free
   competitive markets lead to market failures, and the need for market
   regulation by governments is becoming more evident.
   Research limitations/implications - The implications of the paper are
   profound. Academics should be concerned in and involved with marketing
   theory. Questions need to be raised concerning non-robust definitions of
   marketing and its application. The authors wait for a consumer-led
   approach to marketing to add depth to the marketing theory.
   Practical implications - Marketers need to be made more accountable for
   their actions. Consumers need to become part of the marketing process.
   Marketing claims need to be verified by delivered benefits. Companies
   need to take steps to ensure that the marketing process does not end at
   purchase. Satisfaction needs to be made manifest. Likewise,
   dissatisfactions need to be managed well as part of the marketing
   process.
   Social implications - Too much marketing currently is relatively
   unregulated in the sense that there are so few opportunities to evade
   its myriad reach and - despite social media - little chance of changing
   marketing practice for the good of societies. Many criticisms of
   marketing practice are not being addressed in the literature.
   Originality/value - Marketing is a vibrant force in all nations and
   markets. It is deeply rooted in business practice. It is contemporaneous
   and relevant. It is global and national. But, it is not entirely all
   good news. There are caveats and criticisms as well as kudos and praise.
   While both are addressed here, the topic needs to be considered for
   marketing and its accompanying theory and practice to change.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, computers and the Internet have led to a new era -the
   digital one. Along with this period, a transition process has also
   occurred, therefore the industrial society of yesterday has become the
   information society of today. In this context, Romanian public
   authorities should be able to keep up with the rapid manner in which
   modern society develops itself and also to meet the challenges that it
   raises. The purpose of this article is to present the specific framework
   in which the relationship between the Romanian information society and
   the public sector's authorities takes place, a relationship that surely
   leads to social innovation, beneficial for both citizens and the state
   as a whole. The methodology that we considered for achieving our goal is
   based both on a bibliographical research on the most representative
   scientific papers written on social innovation, and on an analysis at
   the level of all 320 Romanian city halls -analysis that targeted the
   measurement of the city halls' interest in developing communication with
   citizens through specific tools of IT\&C. In our article, social
   innovation in the public sector must be understood, on one hand, as an
   instrument that can be used by local communities in order for them to
   meet current measures of austerity and, on the other hand, on the
   long-term, as a tool necessary for a sustainable development, based on
   achieving the public administration's general objective, which is to
   satisfy the citizens' needs and requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Consumptions and lifestyles have been radically revolutionized by
   digital society advent. This process has also engulfed tourism industry,
   traditionally open to innovative topics and sensitive to unusual

   as a multiplier of these ferments, offering unimaginable opportunities
   if referred to a relatively recent past and making obsolete traditional

   it is needed a strong innovation ability, and, above all, timely
   decisions.

   human-human interaction.
   Findings - Despite its potential, technology for autism is regarded by
   many with some caution: technology per se cannot provide solutions to
   key issues in the field. However, by looking in more depth at the
   features of new technologies and the interactions that take place with
   and around them, we can begin to build up a picture of best practice
   around technology for autism.
   Originality/value - This paper offers up-to-date insights from leading
   academics on the benefits and challenges of innovative technologies in
   the field of autism research and practice. Specifically, it highlights
   the importance of including a breadth of expertise in the design of such
   tools, and the need to consider technology as a means to an end, rather
   than an end in itself.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper presents an analysis of the impact of current
   technologies on customer experiences in upscale hotels and assesses the
   potential of the latest technologies for enhancing customers' stay.
   Design/methodology/approach - A two-step approach was applied in this
   study. The qualitative phase included an examination of upscale hotel
   websites, interviews with hotel managers and an internet search
   regarding the latest technological innovations in hotels. In the
   quantitative stage, a questionnaire was developed for hotel guests,
   generating a sample of 310 valid completed questionnaires.
   Findings - The results reveal that hotel guests value digital
   involvement in their hotel experience. Moreover, business travellers and
   younger generations give greater importance to latest technologies.
   Originality/value - This study analyses the most innovative
   technologies, providing guidance for hoteliers wishing to upgrade or
   implement new technologies. Based on the findings, hoteliers can achieve
   greater differentiation by offering the most important and latest
   technology to guests, enhancing their experience and attracting new
   customers, which can potentially lead to increased revenues. The study's
   results are also important because they include the perceptions of both
   managers and customers.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED CARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{237-248}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a
   digital tool in an English county striving towards a vision of
   integrated information that is used to underpin an increasingly
   integrated future of health and social care delivery.
   Design/methodology/approach - It discusses the policy context
   nationally, the origins and implementation of the initiative, the
   authors' experiences and viewpoint highlighting key challenges and
   learning, as well as examples of new work undertaken.
   Findings - In all, 12 health and care organisations have participated in
   this project. The ability for local commissioners and providers of
   services to now understand ``flow{''} both between and within services
   at a granular level is unique. Costs are modest, and the opportunities
   for refining and better targeting as well as validating services are
   significant, thus demonstrating a return on investment. Key learning
   includes how organisational development was equally as important as the
   implementation of innovative new software, that change management from
   grass roots to strategic leaders is vital, and that the whole system is
   greater than the sum of its otherwise in-silo parts.
   Practical implications - Data linkage initiatives, whether local,
   regional or national in scale, need to be programme managed. A robust
   governance and accountability framework must be in place to realise the
   benefits of such as a solution, and IT infrastructure is paramount.
   Social implications - Organisational development, collaborative as well
   as distributed leadership, and managing a change in culture towards
   health and care information is critical in order to create a supportive
   environment that fosters learning across organisational boundaries.
   Originality/value - This paper draws on the recent experience of
   achieving large-scale data integration across the boundaries of health
   and social care, to help plan and commission services more effectively.
   This rich, multi-agency intelligence has already begun to change the way
   in which the system considers service planning, and learning from this
   county's approach may assist others considering similar initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{The ubiquity of the internet and communication technologies has shifted
   the landscape of education. The above have also transformed the
   contemporary learner into a digital learner. Consequently, institutions
   are under immense pressure to respond to the digital lifestyles by
   transitioning to the modern education in an innovative way. This
   innovation boosts learner motivation, promotes learner engagement and
   enhances the learning experiences of the digital learner population.
   Academics usually engage with learners with varying aptitudes,
   backgrounds, and disabilities. Terms such as social justice, equity,
   equal opportunity, human rights, diversity in education, and social
   inclusion are used with varying conceptions in the education fraternity.
   The populist of the terms include `addressing student needs' and
   `addressing different learning styles' focusing on development of
   accessible teaching and learning resources. However, the sustainability
   of social justice in Higher Education requires a holistic implementation
   from the start to the end of the learning programme. It is therefore,
   the aim of this study to assess the extent to which e-learning is used
   in Higher Education Systems to achieve social justice. A qualitative
   research approach with semi structured interviewing as the major method
   of inquiry was followed. The study focused on the voices of teachers in
   higher education only. Audios were used in capturing the data. The
   presentation of the results included the identification of trends of
   responses. Direct quotes of the responses were included forming the
   major structure of result presentations. The findings are aimed at
   influencing the policy makers, government and industry to come up with
   e-learning policies which provide for and cement social justice in
   Higher Education Institutions. As a consequence of this paper an
   individualized educational package is recommended for social justice
   sustainability in Higher Education.}},

Abstract = {{This article will describe the implementation of a system for privacy
   and confidentiality for files and messages using Identity based
   cryptography in conjunction with Electronic Identity Cards that have as
   a common characteristic strong government backed authentication
   mechanisms. The system enables the files to be encrypted for multiple
   identities, or recipients, and enables privacy and security policies to
   be associated to the file. These policies are structured Extensible
   Markup Language files and permit a range of policies based on a users
   role or access level, device and network information and even time
   intervals. No prior knowledge or sharing of the recipients public key is
   necessary as the encryption key is based on the identity of the user
   derived from the users electronic Identity Card. Electronic Identity
   cards are becoming standard in many European countries and can be used
   for proving the holders identity, physically and electronically, and
   even for creating digital signatures, however standard encryption
   services are not usually included. In the system proposed here the
   creation and distribution of private keys is the role of a trusted third
   party, which the user can delegate to any organization of their choice.
   Authentication at this key centre is crucial for the security of the
   system and relies on the strong two-factor authentication of electronic
   identity cards. The article will describe the algorithms used for
   encrypting files and messages for multiple users the overall
   cryptographic system and the formats used for the encrypted files that
   incorporates a cryptographic hash as well as the XML file policy. The
   final system is implemented as a C\# library for the various algorithms
   and methods which contains a wrapper for a well-known pairing based
   library written in standard C. Our library can be used as a plugin for
   any number of applications; in particular the applications implemented
   and described in this article are namely a small tool for creating
   policies, a standard Desktop application and also a Cloud service for
   cloud storage system that can enable the enforcing of the file policies.
   The proposed systems as well as being innovative provides a secure
   system for file confidentiality and privacy as well as being transparent
   and easy to use by the end users of the system.}},

Abstract = {{The technological innovations in information and communications
   technology have hastened the arrival and reality of digital data and
   picture transmission. They have made us dependent on media. The digital
   signal is a transmission technology that carries more information than
   the previous analogue network. In addition, the digital signal has the
   capacity to transmit bulk information and a constant signal strength,
   irrespective of the distance from the transmitter within a given
   coverage area (New Zealand Ministry of Culture and Heritage, 2010).
   Therefore, all countries are urged to migrate from analogue to digital
   broadcasting. The lack of research on the effects of digital migration
   on the socio-economic contingencies led to this study, the aim of which
   was to establish the impact of digital migration on socio-economic
   factors in Namibia. A questionnaire and interview survey instrument was
   distributed to retailers and viewers of the Namibian Broadcasting
   Corporation (NBC). An analysis of the data collected reveals that the
   majority of the respondents used decoders from Digital Satellite
   Television (DStv) and GoTV. However, some elements of the findings show
   that some viewers could be adversely affected by the costs involved in
   digital migration. The findings show that more is required from the NBC
   to ensure that the population experiences minimum negative impact of
   digital migration. Digital migration is presumed to result in
   socioeconomic benefits to viewers, coupled with additional investment in
   broadcasting media as well as the production of local content. The
   current increase in local content popularity gives confidence to local
   producers, writers and workers in the broadcasting industry. The
   research recommends, for the purposes of maintaining good socio-economic
   standards, that the NBC use both the analogue and digital systems
   concurrently.}},

Abstract = {{The evolving nature of government operations and the evolution of new
   technology bring alternative ways for government to serve its citizens.
   Many government organizations are in a transition state of changing
   human based services into electronic services. The electronic services
   are referred to as e-Government. E-Government is the use of Information
   and Communication Technology (ICT) in a government to improve
   information flow and service reliability. The emerging technology of ICT
   leads to a dramatic evolution in economic, health, education, and
   agricultural applications. Consequently, government administration
   improves its performance when using electronic tools. E-Government has
   been well established in developed countries. However, its
   implementation in low infrastructure countries is still suffering
   resistance to achieve its full deployment in the government
   organization. Despite government efforts to emphasize the use of ICT to
   its offices, sustainability of e-Government projects is facing daunting
   challenges. This is especially the case in low infrastructure countries.
   This situation negatively influences the maturity of e-Government, which
   is lagging far behind the maturity of developed countries. Frameworks,
   models, and processes have been developed specifically to ensure
   successful e-Government implementation. Furthermore, researchers have
   identified e-Government failures to multiple viewpoints such as user
   satisfaction, cultural differences, digital divide, and government
   policy problems. E-Government component relationships form a dependent
   bond in the e-Government implementation context. However the importance
   of this fact is not always recognized by researchers. This study
   proposes a conceptual framework for e-Government implementation in a low
   infrastructure situation. The framework integrates its constructs from
   the DPSIR model (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, and Response), the
   e-Government maturity model, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and
   the SERVQUAL model to obtain a sustainable e-Government implementation.
   Furthermore, the framework identifies five critical success factors
   (infrastructure, service, deployment, citizen, and government) in
   e-Government implementation. Mapping the DPSIR concepts to the critical
   success factors for implementation leads to the proposed framework,
   having infrastructure as driving force, service as pressure, deployment
   as state, citizen as impact, and government as response. The framework
   can be used as a basis for e-Government implementation. However, the
   internal organization of the implementation process at the
   administrative level should be well organized to engage both government
   officers and the citizen as end-user. This paper suggests that using the
   Round Table process can increase the user engagement and successful
   usage of e-Government application.}},

Abstract = {{The balance between randomization and regularization is a key and
   contradictory issue in the development of automatic composing.
   Randomized algorithm focuses on creating innovative and novel melodies
   but will generate unpleasant result. Regularized algorithm uses the
   existed music and rules to compose pleasant music piece, but the results
   are similar to the pieces in the training set. In this paper, we set up
   a new automatic composition model by detecting the pitch of Chinese
   poetry recitation. First, we utilize the Simplified Inverse Filter
   Tracking (SIFT) to detect the pitch of the acoustic input signal.
   Variety of the intonations of the texts of Chinese poetry ensures the
   innovativeness and randomness of the pitch change. Meanwhile, the
   congruence between melody and tones makes the change of pitch musically.
   In order to make the rhythm musical as well, we introduce the database
   of music scores (in the form of MusicXML) and apply a matching algorithm
   to determine the duration of each note. The experiment shows that the
   melody generated by our system is both innovative and in agreement with
   the musicology in pitch and rhythm.}},

Abstract = {{News media face many serious concerns as their distribution channels are
   gradually being taken over by third parties (e.g., people sharing news
   on Twitter and Facebook, and GoogleNews acting as a news aggregator). If
   traditional media is to survive at all, it needs to develop innovative
   strategies around these channels, to maximize audience engagement with
   the news they provide. In this paper, we focus on the issue of
   developing one such strategy for spreading news on Twitter. Using a
   corpus of 1M tweets from 200 journalist Twitter accounts and audience
   responses to these tweets, we develop predictive models to identify the
   features of both journalists and news tweets that impact audience
   attention. These analyses reveal that different combinations of features
   influence audience engagement differentially from one news category to
   the next (e.g., sport versus business). From these findings, we propose
   a set of guidelines for journalists, designed to maximize engagement
   with the news they tweet. Finally, we discuss how such analyses can
   inform innovative dissemination strategies in digital media.}},

Abstract = {{This conceptual paper addresses the question: how do firms convert IT
   resources into IT capabilities and IT dynamic capabilities for
   innovation? The extant literature on IT capabilities has few studies
   that attempt to explain ``how{''} IT resources are acquired, exploited,
   or manipulated in order to support IT capabilities and IT dynamic
   capabilities. Using a comprehensive literature review, and the
   theoretical lens of Resource Orchestration Theory, this paper addresses
   this gap. We demonstrate that firms use the processes of bundling,
   structuring, and leveraging to convert IT resources into IT
   capabilities, and IT capabilities into IT dynamic capabilities. We show
   how firms are able to ``orchestrate{''} IT resources and IT capabilities
   to innovate and create competitive advantages, even in the face of
   environmental turbulence which introduces uncertainties that affect the
   orchestration process. The paper has value for academics and
   practitioners. For academics, it opens up the black box of the
   relationships among IT resources, IT capabilities, and IT-enabled
   dynamic capabilities using Resource Orchestration Theory. It identifies
   new opportunities to apply this theory and to conduct further research.
   For practitioners, the paper provides insights regarding the use of IT
   resources and the development of IT capabilities to enhance innovation
   and firm performance.}},

Abstract = {{The global market for e-learning is projected to reach \$255 billion by
   2017 with a compound growth average of 23 per cent since 2012 (GSV
   Advisors, 2012). The shift towards digital learning has attracted a wave
   of digital entrepreneurs who are creating e-learning content, learning
   platforms, educational apps and online marketplaces. Nowhere is this
   more evident than in the online `K-12' market (50 per cent share of the
   global e-learning market). The term K-12 refers to 12 years of formal
   primary and secondary education from kindergarten (K) or
   nursery-essentially pre-university level education. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate the motivations and processes underpinning the
   launch of online ventures by enterprising teachers in the K-12 industry.
   Teacherpreneurship (teacher-driven entrepreneurship) is yet to attract
   significant academic interest and this exploratory study hopes to
   contribute to knowledge in this emerging field by considering the
   knowledge from a value creation and capture perspective. The research
   utilises a multiple case studies approach (Yin, 2014) to try and
   identify patterns that underlie the practice of teacherpreneurship. The
   importance of studying this phenomenon lies in the pursuit of solutions
   to problems of access to K-12 education for children in developing and
   developed worlds. It also comes at a critical time when internet and
   communication (Digital) technologies are irreversibly disrupting the
   traditional education landscape for good. Simply put, learning is
   increasingly moving online and teacherpreneurs-with their knowledge and
   experience of curriculum development, learning/teaching methodologies,
   assessment strategies and learning outcomes-are seen as important
   conduits of innovation in this new education landscape. The study finds
   that intrinsic motivation is a major influence on teacherpreneurial
   behavior. Push factors such as dissatisfaction with the state of the
   traditional education industry are found to be a contributing influence
   but not a dominant one. In terms of the entrepreneurial process then,
   the cross-case analysis also finds that the discovery of opportunities
   is in all cases fortuitous and that the opportunity is exploited using
   an effectual approach. Finally, the research offers pragmatic guidance
   for nascent teacherpreneurs contemplating a start-up venture in the
   e-learning market space.}},

Abstract = {{The notion of an e-entrepreneur has recently gained recognition amongst
   both academics and practitioners. Recently, the e-entrepreneurship and
   e-innovation demonstrate the key success of e-business in the virtual
   world The constant development of information and technology in the
   virtual world has had a significant influence on various possibilities
   for developing innovative business concepts based on electronic
   information and virtual communication networks and has led to the
   realization of these concepts by establishing e-entrepreneurship through
   the e-entrepreneur. Since the e-entrepreneur plays a serious role, the
   main objective of this study is to examine the identified success
   factors for e-entrepreneurship. The lack of a commonly accepted theory
   of e-entrepreneurship leaves enough room open for the introduction of
   critical success factors especially for an entrepreneur to enter into
   the digital world and act as an eentrepreneur. We offer critical success
   factors of entrepreneurs in the virtual world that describe the main
   attributes that enable them to create their own e-business. Factors
   associated with IT business founders that operate mostly in the telecom
   value added services and e-commerce, i. e. online shopping, are
   investigated with the following parameters: Achievement orientation,
   Risk taking propensity, Social e-networking, Technology awareness,
   E-creativity, e-innovation, Experience in the sector of e-business,
   building virtual social networks, Ability to exhibit e-leadership, Being
   part of an entrepreneurial family, Age, gender, and educational level
   Using a simple random sampling technique, several entrepreneurs with at
   least three to four years of e-business operations in Iran were selected
   as our respondents. Data was gathered through a survey in the forum of a
   questionnaire. Multiple regression analyses was used to test the
   relationship between the e-entrepreneurial factors and
   e-entrepreneurship success with the proposed model that evaluates the
   e-entrepreneur demographically, characteristically, and objectively in
   the virtual world. In conclusion, this study confirmed that some of the
   proposed success factors such as technology awareness, achievement
   orientation, and e-innovation are significantly related to the success
   of an e-entrepreneur in the virtual world.}},

Abstract = {{Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are often described as the
   `backbone' of a country's economy that should be recognised as a major
   source of prosperity and employment. In Australia, SMEs constitute
   95.9\% of businesses and they therefore play a significant role in the
   economy and society. SMEs are especially critical to the resilience of
   rural and remote communities. The ability to innovate is considered to
   be one of the most important strategic capabilities of manufacturing
   SMEs. The new economy is earmarked by relationships, networks, knowledge
   and information. Qualitative case study research was conducted through
   personal interviews with managers of manufacturing SMEs in regional
   Australia, to identify the challenges they face to innovate and survive
   in a digitally connected business environment. The research revealed
   that the SMEs face external challenges such as the downturn in the
   Australian manufacturing sector, geographic- and social isolation,
   limited access to capable staff and technical infrastructure
   limitations. It was also found that the mindset of regional SMEs result
   in behaviours that limit their innovative capability. They are often
   competitive instead of collaborative, they focus on operational issues
   rather than having a strategic outlook, they lack technology skills and
   prefer face-to-face networking instead of using social media to connect

Abstract = {{This paper examines the discourses around emerging Internet connectivity
   solutions for rural and resource-constrained populations in the
   developing world. It draws primarily on interviews undertaken with 26
   experts within the Information and Communications Technologies for
   Development (ICTD) field, as well as on institutional explanatory and
   publicity materials put forward by several industry actors. We identify
   a sustained disconnect between different conceptions of how technology
   alters or bridges space-spatial imaginaries. Institutions use narratives
   that assume technologies eradicate or collapse distance, and thus drive
   transformative socioeconomic change. By contrast, expert accounts
   underscore the socially embedded nature of technologically mediated
   relations and non-infrastructural barriers to connectivity. The paper
   draws attention to the ways that these spatial ideas are used to justify
   the development of new infrastructures to extend Internet access in the
   developing world. The paper identifies a need for continued attention to
   spatial imaginaries in ICTD, not only as a guiding frame for critical
   research, but also as a means to improve collaboration between research
   and industrial practice.}},

   improvement, innovation and adoption of new practices that support
   learning at scale. In this context, educators must learn how to apply

   study examines how higher education professionals adapted their practice
   to enable more open and flexible work processes. A case study carried
   out using Activity Theory showed that teams involved in the development
   of a module all need access to a range of expertise both practical and
   academic. At each stage, they need to be clear about the learning
   outcomes of the module, the responsibilities of each team and its
   constraints. Teams need to be willing to agree ways to shift those
   constraints in order to develop a module effectively.}},

   Supported Collaborative Learning Environments}},
Journal = {{THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the use of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning
   Environments (CSCLE) as multimodal spaces for promoting critical
   thinking for English as Second Language Learning (L2) education from
   multiple perspectives (Technology, Thinking Skills and Interaction). The
   exploration focuses on the use of a multitouch tabletop, and an
   accompanying application called Digital Mysteries, as affordances in
   CSCLE's for making reasoning skill-based thinking visible for L2
   learning in Higher Education.
   Despite the worldwide promotion of teaching thinking in L2 education, it
   is not always easy for teachers to identify the types of thinking skills
   being targeted in L2 pedagogical tasks. To the authors' knowledge,
   little empirical interactional evidence is available to demonstrate
   critical thinking in L2 learner talk during group work. This paper
   examines interactions among three groups of Chinese English Language
   learners at a higher education institution in a CSCLE. Video data were
   collected of students' thinking-in-action whilst engaging in multimodal
   interactions in the environment. Results show that new technologies can
   provide innovative and empirically driven ways in which L2 learners'
   thinking is externalised and how critical reasoning can be tracked,
   promoted, evaluated and self regulated. The findings suggest that
   collaborations in a CSCLE can support the completion of tasks embedding
   high levels of cognitive complexity by L2 learners with effective use of
   limited cognitive resources. This leads to a number of recommendations
   about integrating the teaching of critical thinking skills into the L2
   classroom using CSCLE technologies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The new tools invading our digital world, such as tablets, smart phones
   are connected to the data centers through the internet and allows the
   introduction of new pedagogical tools. Among them, the Massive Open
   Online Courses (MOOCs), available on internet sites, is inducing
   worldwide changes in the educative strategies. These tools are
   particularly well-suited to learn a good background, which is mainly
   theoretical in this case. However, the training of engineers and doctors
   in electrical engineering requires practices and know-how that are
   mandatory for designing new and innovative objects that are today highly
   complex, covering several domains of expertise, and also very frequently
   connected. The main challenge is to give to our future engineers both
   methodology and know-how that cannot be provided by the online lectures.
   New pedagogical approaches, such as flipped classrooms, project-based
   learning, labworks and internships, must be setup in order to prepare
   the graduates to the new industrial environment and to the evolution of
   our technological society.}},

Abstract = {{The use of information and communication technologies brings many
   opportunities to innovate educational process. In the case of education
   of potential future entrepreneurs, it might be suitable for them to try

   virtual companies is supported by ICT means. The aim of this paper is to
   present how virtual companies serve for educational purposes at our
   faculty. At our faculty, we have started several years ago with such a
   subject of study that allows students to experience setting up and
   running their own small virtual business in the first period of its
   existence. Students set up small trade firms in form of limited
   liability companies, which operate e-shops. Virtual bank of our faculty
   provides services of electronic payments in e-shops. Also electronic
   communication with different virtual institutions supported by use of
   digital signature is used. Our results show virtual firms as very good
   mean to allow students to gather experience with the establishing and
   operating firms and develop practical entrepreneurial skills.}},

Abstract = {{The project ``Creative Classroom{''} was launched in September 2014 with
   the main goal of assisting Estonian schools in their digital turn. The
   project is co-financed by the Erasmus+ program and will continue until
   the end of August 2016. Partners from Estonia, Finland, Slovenia and
   Croatia work together to design and deliver innovative training for
   Estonian teachers in order to enable them to use tools and methods for
   e-learning. Under the guidance of European educational technology
   experts, the group of Estonian teachers participate in four workshops on
   topics concerning ICT and teaching methodologies such as trialogical
   learning, flipped classroom, project-based learning, game-based
   learning, problem-based learning, and inquiry-based learning. They are
   expected to develop innovative lesson scenarios which are going to be
   published as an electronic lesson guide book and shared with other
   teachers in Estonia and across Europe. This paper describes experiences
   in delivering the workshop about inquiry-based learning (IBL) and
   e-tivites. The IBL is introduced as question-driven or problem-driven
   approach to learning based on seeking new knowledge and understanding.
   It involves students investigating complex, ill-structured problems. As
   an example of an IBL problem, teachers perform a WebQuest e-tivity using
   Web 2.0 tools.}},

Abstract = {{Beichen district of Tianjin, located in the important node of
   Beijing-Tianjin golden corridor and high-tech industry area of
   Jingjintang region, has strong industrial foundations, while it is still
   faced with the problems that traditional industries account for high
   proportion of the industrial structure, inefficient use of industrial
   land, lack of enterprise innovation ability and shortage of resources,
   etc. With increasingly competitive between cities and regions, upgrading
   of an industrial structure and spatial distribution optimization become
   the inevitable trend, which will become a really hotspot issue that
   attracted widespread attention from domestic and international experts
   and scholars who engaged in the field of economics, geography, science
   and ecology planning, and so on. Therefore, this paper, taking
   perspectives from industrial land structure and distribution security,
   employing some quantitative analysis methods such as GIS spatial
   analysis, mathematical model and statistic analysis, combining with the
   present industrial development of Beichen district, drawing lessons from
   the study on the evaluation of land intensive use and land suitability
   evaluation by other scholars, builds an index system of industrial land
   safety diagnosis from the five aspects of natural location, economic
   foundation, social coordination, ecological security and policy support,
   which have more important effects on the distribution of industrial
   land, and it comes up with the multi-source data multistage evaluation
   framework with the idea of ``red line controlling for first
   screening-single factor evaluation-spatial association analysis{''} in
   order to conduct diagnostic evaluation of industrial land security
   distribution, drawing the classification map about each factor which
   influenced industrial safety layout on Beichen district. Finally, we get
   the space safety layout area of Beichen district industry by using the
   evaluation result to do overlay analysis when the land use control chart
   and the red line control zones were digitized by ArcGIS, and achieve
   security hierarchy industrial land layout of Beichen district. The
   results show that safety degree of Beichen district industrial land
   layout is just at an ordinary level, even some industrial points are
   still within the scope of red line control area. It is necessary to
   optimize the spatial layout of the industrial land in consideration of
   reasonable industrial land scale in Beichen district, and to realize
   coordinated development between industrial land, regional society,
   economy and environment. Besides, the result could provide a basic
   reference for Tianjin land bureau and related planning department to
   make an objective evaluation on land resources and make an effective use
   of the land.}},

Abstract = {{Wide-band digital drivers are indispensable for SMPAs (Switched Mode
   Power Amplifiers) in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) and PPM (Pulse
   Position Modulation) applications. This paper presents the design of a
   wideband RF pre-amplifying buffer, innovated for very low dropout and
   low power complementary operation in heterojunction technologies
   affording only depletion type devices. A simple, passive bias level
   shifting technique is also incorporated to facilitate interfacing the
   digital modulator in silicon substrate with the PA in III-V wafer. In
   order to experimentally validate the concepts, the proposed driver is
   employed for driving an S-band single-ended class-E PA as well as for
   its differential version, modified to switch over S and C bands, in 130
   nm GaAs pHEMT technology. The output powers of the differential
   amplifier are combined using on-chip transformer balun. Test results of
   both chips demonstrate that the implemented drivers consume less than
   4\% of the overall PA efficiencies, wherein the buffer responds linearly
   to the wideband input pulses when tested alone.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) service architecture has
   been analyzed in Electronic Commerce (ecommerce). Typically, the
   traditional problems of ecommerce such as inventory, logistics, and
   payments are considered when implying IoT services. IoT and ecommerce
   are now embarking on a common expedition where every connected object
   becomes a potential ecommerce asset. However, ecommerce is one of the
   most important applications on the Internet. It is impacted by the
   evolution in digital technologies (DTs) and new dimensions are
   introduced to execute ecommerce marketplace. The emphasis of current
   research is to attune ecommerce offerings based on the IoT services.
   Instead, the innovation of IoT and respective services needs to be
   driven by the impact of digital technologies in the businesses that are
   dependent on the ecommerce competitiveness. In this paper, we introduced
   the concept of fragmented architecture (FA) of IoT services.
   Essentially, it is envision as ubiquitous structural characteristic of
   IoT services. Different types of fragmentation are identified when
   correlating ecommerce dimensions (EDs) with IoT service architecture. We
   have conceptualized the degrees of fragmentation, subsequently, we have
   illustrated the concepts in an empirical case study. Potential
   consequences of different degrees of fragmentation when establishing
   correlations between IoT services and EDs are quantified.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the Digital Public Service Innovation Framework that
   extends the ``standard{''} provision of digital public services
   according to the emerging, enhanced, transactional and connected stages
   underpinning the United Nations Global eGovernment Survey, with seven
   example ``innovations{''} in digital public service delivery -
   transparent, participatory, anticipatory, personalized, co-created,
   context-aware and context-smart. Unlike the `` standard{''} provisions,
   innovations in digital public service delivery are open-ended - new
   forms may continuously emerge in response to new policy demands and
   technological progress, and are non-linear - one innovation may or may
   not depend on others. The framework builds on the foundations of public
   sector innovation and Digital Government Evolution model. In line with
   the latter, the paper equips each innovation with sharp logical
   characterization, body of research literature and real-life cases from
   around the world to simultaneously serve the illustration and validation
   goals. The paper also identifies some policy implications of the
   framework, covering a broad range of issues from infrastructure,
   capacity, eco-system and partnerships, to inclusion, value, channels,
   security, privacy and authentication.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed the advances of e-money systems such as
   Bitcoin, PayPal and various forms of stored-value cards. This paper
   adopts a mechanism design approach to identify some essential features
   of different payment systems that implement and improve the constrained
   optimal resource allocation in Germany. Bitcoin is a digital,
   decentralized, partially anonymous currency, not backed by German or any
   government or other legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or other
   commodity. Bitcoin relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to
   maintain its integrity. Compared to most currencies or online payment
   services, such as PayPal, bitcoins are highly liquid, have low
   transaction costs, and can be used to make micropayments in Germany.
   Although the Bitcoin economy is flourishing, Bitcoin users are anxious
   about Bitcoin's legal status. This paper examines a few relevant legal
   issues. The research question is to investigate how supplementary
   digital terminating currency Bitcoin can provide a superior fallback
   position as e-gold standard in Germany and worldwide. Digital
   self-liquidating e-Gold ounce could be distributed immediately to voters
   by using swipe cards used by some governments for transit facilities.
   Bitcoins as e-Gold ounce do not provide a viable medium of exchange
   because of the cost of their purchase, creation and/or exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years, vision-based fruit grading system is gaining importance in
   fruit classification process. In developing the fruit grading system,
   image segmentation is required for analyzing the fruit objects
   automatically. Image segmentation is a process that divides a digital
   image into separate regions with the aim to obtain only the interest
   objects and remove the background. Currently, there are several
   segmentation techniques which have been used in object identification
   such as thresholding and clustering techniques. However, the
   conventional techniques have difficulties in segmenting fruit images
   which captured under natural illumination due to the existence of
   non-uniform illumination on the object surface. The presence of
   different illuminations influences the appearance of the interest
   objects and thus misleads the object analysis. Therefore, this research
   has produced an innovative segmentation algorithm for fruit images which
   is able to increase the segmentation accuracy. The developed algorithm
   is an integration of modified thresholding and adaptive K-means method.
   The integration of both methods is required to increase the segmentation
   accuracy for fruits images with different surface colour. The results
   showed that the innovative method is able to segment the fruits images
   with high accuracy value,}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the article. The aim of the article is to analyze factors
   contribute to the transformation of economic systems in conditions of
   the Third industrial revolution.
   The result of the analysis. The definition of the third industrial
   revolution (T.i.r.) as the multidimensional complex phenomenon is given.
   Its key features are characterized. They are: the transition to
   renewable energy sources and raw materials, mass introduction of
   additive technologies and network manufacturing systems, digital base of
   fixing and transmission of information, the formation of the horizontal
   production and consumption patterns, solidary forms of economic
   relations. The reality of perspectives of renewable energy sources
   introduction are confirmed with the facts of their development dynamics.
   Since 2000, the volume of alternative power has doubled: on the sun 7
   times, and on the wind 4 times. Under each doubling of energy production
   its costs is reduced on the sun by 24\%, and on the wind 17\%. It is
   shown the functional possibilities of additive technologies: unlimited
   design versions; free provision of complexity; free provision of
   variability, minimal waste; production for individual demand; exclusion
   assembly step; direct materialization of information. Basic groups of
   the T.i.r. innovations in energy, raw material, technological,
   organizational and economic sections are characterized.
   Conclusions. The Third industrial revolution allows to transit to
   renewable resources and additive technologies. It creates the foundation
   for a significant reduction in specific resource consumption for
   conventional unit of human vital functions. The conditions for
   horizontal production-consumption structures and solidary forms of
   economic relations are created as well.}},

Abstract = {{The banking institutions perceive the impact of the New Information and
   Communication Technology (NICT) differently, yet most of them view it as
   deep and fast, so that 2/3 of them believe that NICT solutions can
   contribute to a better rationalization of the logistics operations and
   even a considerable simplification of the chain supply management. 70\%
   of the companies indicated the capacity of NICT of contributing to a
   profound change in the duties undertaken, which led to an acute need of
   training their employees in this area. The consumer's involvement level
   (high/medium/low) differs depending on how the product meets his
   specific needs. The transition from conventional to electronic payments
   system was favoured primarily by the significant increase in the
   activities developed by the payment systems and then by the need to
   fluidize cashless payments and meet the demands of consumers who ask for
   payments from sister institutions, at efficient and low costs.
   Nowadays, a credit card is a payment instrument applied universally,
   accepted in all countries to provide a wide variety of transactions such
   as purchases of goods and services sold by licensed traders or obtaining
   cash. In Romania, the public can choose between several types of cards
   offered by banks or specialized groups and, furthermore, the current
   trend is to offer financial products by customer classes (based on
   revenue) and/or facilities.
   This report aims an analysis of the development of the Romanian card
   market, especially after the last financial crisis and the banking
   digital instruments proposed by the banks of Romania to attract the
   potential customers. Our work aims also the marketing strategies
   implemented by the Romanian banks focus to growth of digital banking on
   the Romanian market because cash remains still the main payment method
   in Romania.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of personal characteristics of
   community within the vicinity of rural telecentres on the relationship
   between adoption of ICT and value creation. The aim was to identify
   characteristics of members of the community that have positive or
   negative influence on the adoption of the telecentre in order to gain
   socio-economic impact. A survey was conducted among the community within
   the vicinity of the telecentres where data was gathered on respondents'
   demography, their perceptions on availability of ICT facilities at the
   telecentre, and the benefits gained from using the ICT facilities. The
   Diffusion of Innovation theory was used to guide the research and
   moderating analysis was used as data analysis. Results show that age,
   gender, marital status and PC ownership as significant moderators that
   affect the relationship between telecentre adoption and value creation.}},

Abstract = {{Tech startups are seen as a new economic growth engine in Thailand which
   will help the country step up and produce more sophisticated high valued
   products and services. However, the shortage of skilled labor with
   innovation in knowledge-based economy has trapped Thailand in
   inconvenient position and losing its competitive edge. Hence in this
   research, the study on the competitive competencies for the tech
   startups were addressed by conducting in-depth interview and focus group
   discussion with the key stakeholders responsible for the development on
   the tech startups ecosystem in Thailand. The study revealed the top 5
   competitive competencies classified by 1) Innovation, 2) Business Acumen
   and Aspiration, 3) Analytical Thinking, 4) Interpersonal Effectiveness
   and 5) Leadership and Result Orientation are needed most for the tech
   startup workforce and recommended strategy for the tech startup
   ecosystem in Thailand. The results of this research will help prepare
   ICT workforce in a larger scope to drive Thailand to be competitive in
   the Digital Economy and the ASEAN Community.}},

   creativity, opens the process of IT-Security strategy development and
   despite being designed for training purposes - opens the process to
   explore innovative attack vectors.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion of the digital era is perceived as a key driver of
   innovation and growth. Globalization and access to information have
   changed the way entrepreneurship is implemented. Such a digital driven
   society is implicitly drastically changing the way businesses interact
   with their customers and this aspect provides a key competitive
   advantage for entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, since DSMM practices are
   still in their infancy stage for entrepreneurs, there are various
   obstacles and acceptance issues (Royle and Laing, 2014; Beier and
   Wagner, 2014). One confirmed way of overcoming such obstacles is to
   identify the technology acceptance level of the targeted population and
   to suggest mitigating strategies For this purpose, one of the most
   utilized models for testing technology acceptance is the Unified Theory
   of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. This paper binds
   together marketing studies, technology/digitalization and behavioural
   sciences in order to firstly understand how digital trends can boost
   entrepreneurs' brand image and potential for innovation and co-creation
   with their customers. Secondly, apply the UTAUT model on a sample of
   entrepreneurs in order to identify their acceptance levels of DSMM
   practices and assess the actual impact of DSMM practices on brand image
   and innovation. Finally, based on the survey findings, propose
   recommendations for improved implementation of DSMM practices. The
   results show a strong interest and perceived benefit of DSMM practices
   by entrepreneurs, however there is a general skill-gap and absence of
   information on this recent topic which needs to be properly addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technology for 3D survey and virtual modeling of historical
   buildings has been largely improved in the last years. However, virtual
   reconstructions of lost buildings still offer hermetic interpretations,
   so that it is almost impossible to understand them critically. Such
   models usually avoid the diachronic perspective that is closely related
   to the evolutionary and complex essence of historical constructions. The
   present paper addresses the innovative case study of the Early Medieval
   monastic church of San Cebrian de Mazote (Valladolid, Spain), which has
   been analised to know the original building and its later additions and
   restorations. Besides that, this paper proposes theoretical guidelines
   to develop current digital 3D models of historical buildings into
   advanced ones by means of implementing their transformation sequence and
   complex essence (metadata), as well as the interpretation process that
   has been taken during the research (paradata).}},

Abstract = {{The increasing use of information and communication technologies in

   inseparable from both social and spatial relationships. This paper
   contributes to understanding of how such technologies redefine our
   spatial experience, articulating the collective imaginary of space from
   a multi-disciplinary perspective. We define this imaginary as how people
   perceive, experience, and give meaning to the space of architecture, and
   we discuss distinct moments in history when this imaginary was affected
   by technological developments. Finally, we introduce the concept of
   `imaginal space', defined by the fusion of the architectural and the
   digital spaces combined by its images and narratives, into physical,
   technical, and symbolic dimensions and whose relevance is to give
   cohesion to contemporary social groupings.}},

Abstract = {{Today, the use of information and communication technologies and
   equipment is for teaching necessity. This fact is mainly due to the time
   in which we live and the progress that cannot be stopped. Therefore,
   teachers must lead students to use information and communication
   technologies and their correct use in life. We can say, that the
   innovations for schools are tablets. The article analyzes the current
   state of digitization of primary and secondary schools in the Slovak
   Republic. It deals with the national project: Digitization of the
   educational system of regional schools, running in 2013-2015, and with
   the introduction of electronic services in education in the educational
   process. It acquaints readers with the tasks and aims of digitization,
   it refers to the issue of interrelated projects: Planet of knowledge,
   Digtal school, School on touch.
   At the end there is demonstration some suitable applications for
   teaching physics using various sensors supplied tablets with Android
   operating system and other applications suitable for teaching on tablets}},

Abstract = {{The world of health care is changing dramatically, as reflected in the
   number, magnitude, and scope of innovative new approaches-to how illness
   is treated and how better health is promoted-that are being implemented
   around the globe. The changes triggered by these initiatives affect both
   how care is organized, managed, and paid for and the kinds of approaches
   that are being developed to keep people healthy. Underlying these
   changes is a more fundamental paradigm shift, a shift in the priority
   given to ``value{''} in the formulation of policy and management
   practice. This brief essay highlights five trends that are central in
   this shift: increasing emphasis on health promotion, movement toward
   value-based payment, advances in digital/mobile technology, exploitation
   of big data, and changes in support for biomedical research. Each of
   these has its own value controversies, and the individual impact of each
   is impossible to predict. Collectively, however, their impact is likely
   to be significant.}},

Journal = {{BALKAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{165-174}},
Abstract = {{The main aim of this article is to analyse the relationship between two
   innovative concepts-the technoself and process identity-from a
   perspective inspired by process ontology. The working hypothesis is that
   industrialized and mass societies entered into a post-industrial or
   informational sphere of capitalism, becoming networking societies-also
   known as knowledge-based societies which closely followed their role in
   approaching the plural identity of the digital Subject and the
   surveillance practices exercised in its governance as correspondent
   models for the changes of the current reality. The first section of the
   article is devoted to research on the technoself, a concept recently
   introduced by Luppicini in 2013. Criticizing the technoself in terms of
   process ontology and as a result of digitalization, subjectivity, and
   technical rationality, I will argue that the constitution of digital
   subjects, as well as their interactions, should be defined in terms of
   processes. Therefore, I introduce the concept of process identity-which
   includes the technoself-and explain how this approach contributes to the
   development of different research fields (such as speculative realism
   and object-oriented ontology) and how it affects Floridi's distinction
   between digital ontology and informational ontology. The second section
   focuses on the effects of the digital environment on self-constitution
   practices and techniques, virtual worlds experiencing what Foucault
   recognizes as the aesthetics of existence. In the final part, I confront
   Bentham's and Foucault's panopticism, arguing that based on what is
   accomplished by process identities, networking societies represent
   societies of control, not disciplinary ones, and consequently this
   distinction should be applied in governing virtual communities. In the
   end, I will explain why notions such as digital personae or databased
   selves are insufficient, and should be replaced by the concepts of
   process identity and technoself, respectively, in order to improve the
   models of governing networking societies.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-modal education systems are an effective answer to the educational
   needs of people who take part in learning processes in
   technology-enriched environments, where the Internet is an essential
   service. However, institutionalizing these systems in universities
   implies a number of organizational challenges. The Transversalization
   methodology of educational innovation is useful to cause structural
   transformations favoring the institutionalization of multi-modal
   systems, since it influences vertically (at all the decision-making
   levels) and horizontally (at all the vital processes of multi-modal
   education), thus provoking innovating products and services. The
   implementation of a Multimodal system of Education in the Autonomous
   University of Queretaro, Mexico, has been conducted with such
   methodology and the results foreseen have been achieved. Nevertheless,
   in daily operation a number of unforeseen challenges are arising. It has
   been necessary to analyze two crucial issues: a) certain procedural
   stress is being produced in the digital materials production team due to
   a high demand; and b) had the presence of staff from the regulatory,
   financial, administrative and educational technology environments been
   guaranteed in horizontal transversalization (at all vital multi-modal
   education processes), such procedures would be more harmonic at present.}},

   performance after incorporating mobile devices to develop a teaching
   unit, supported by teachers and family. The results are analyzed from a
   graph view, and indicate that students 4 or 5 years old can also use
   mobile digital devices in the process of teaching and learning with some
   autonomy. The fact involve families fosters the children's education
   throughout the day, spatially relocating the training area, giving an

Abstract = {{This work shows the potentiality of the radio and the radiophonic
   dramatization of contents as an educative and methodological resource
   from the perspective of the students, future teachers, trying the learn
   its strengths and weakness. In order to do that, we have conducted a
   research based on a mixed methodology, including quantitative and
   qualitative approaches, taking as a central axis a case study. All the
   students enrolled in the subject ``New musical techniques and
   tendencies{''}, taught in the Education Faculty of Albacete, Castile -
   La Mancha University. These students developed a radio digital broadcast
   on the contents of the subjetc, among other activities. The general
   perception of the students has been very positive. In particular, the
   utilization of the radio as an educational resource has been one of the
   most valued proposals. The results we have obtained agree with other
   researches in which the positive perception of the students of Education
   on the use of the ICT is confirmed, although the same students presents
   lack of capability in the aforementioned ICT.}},

Abstract = {{Embedding a hidden stream of bits in a cover file to prevent illegal use
   is called digital watermarking. The cover file could be a text, image,
   video, or audio. In this study, we propose invisible watermarking based
   on the text included in a webpage. Watermarks are based on predefined
   structural and syntactic rules, which are encrypted and then converted
   into zero-width control characters using binary model classification
   before embedding into a webpage. This concept means that HTML (Hyper
   Text Markup Language) is used as a cover file to embed the hashed and
   transparent zero-width watermarks. We have implemented the proposed
   invisible watermarking against various attacks to reach optimum
   robustness.}},

Abstract = {{This survey focused on the analysis of opinions and attitudes expressed
   by Geography teachers participating in the national project called
   ``Modernization of the Educational Process in Elementary and Secondary
   School{''}, in selected training centres in Slovakia during 2008 - 2013.
   The main objective of the course was innovation and modernization of
   teaching procedures, methods, and forms of teaching Geography with the
   assistance of digital technologies. 6,527 qualified teachers of
   elementary and secondary schools completed the course, 353 of them
   specialized in Geography. The course (100 - 106 lessons) consisted of
   three modules, partially in the form of distance education.
   The introduction describes the course and the individual modules. First
   two modules were focused on the development and acquisition of general
   technical skills and common educational software (e.g. Interactive
   Whiteboard). The key role in the methodical preparation of teachers was
   in the 3rd module. It aimed to create and demonstrate an efficient
   application of digital technologies, particularly for the current
   educational contents of Geography. The core of the study evaluates the
   overall satisfaction of course participants with the level of expertise,
   difficulty level, and content, as well as their own assessment of the
   acquired skills and knowledge. We also analysed teachers attitudes
   towards the real usability of the available model methods, their
   opinions on the quality of the created teaching aids and digital
   technologies incorporated in the education process.
   Finally, we present suggestions to improve the quality of Geography
   teaching in schools, in order to reflect the real needs of people's
   lives in a scientific society.}},

Abstract = {{The agricultural sector is characterized by increasing complexity and
   several factors could have a negative impact on agricultural small and
   medium-sized enterprises' (SMESs) competitiveness. There are two way to
   improve farms competitiveness: dimensional growth, achievable through
   the horizontal aggregation of producers (POs), and innovation,
   achievable through Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).
   Although several studies have pointed out the positive influence of ICT
   tools on SMEs performances growth, there is a lack of works concerning
   the way POs use ICTs web based in order to improve innovativeness and
   competitiveness of their small farmers. After a preliminary literature
   review regarding the main drivers for the adoption of ICT and
   technological innovations in agriculture, an exploratory analysis was
   performed through a set of in depth interviews to opinion leaders in
   associated farms of a PO. This qualitative methodological approach aims
   to investigate the POs contribution in enhancing process or product
   innovation, improving competitiveness and transferring knowledge, among
   the associated farms through the use of ICT tools. Findings confirm the
   main hypothesis on which this study is based upon and are supported by
   theoretical implications shown in the literature review.}},

Abstract = {{Industry 4.0 and smart factory are the terms frequently used for next
   generation production systems. Advancement of Information technologies
   paved the way for evolution of production systems. To remain competitive
   in the market, enterprises want to utilize these technological
   advancements in order to solve current challenges and serve customers in
   new ways which were not imagined before. In order to provide new
   services quickly, new methods and technologies have to be introduced at
   manufacturing level. The paper briefly discusses industry 4.0 and
   settings (arrangements) for co-innovation. This paper also describes
   what are the current challenges faced by companies with the help of a
   survey. The paper proposes an approach from strategical to operational
   level for the implementation of industry 4.0. In this paper, we also
   provide new opportunities, scenarios, and applications enabled by
   introducing new tools and technologies for industry 4.0. At the end, the
   paper provides summary and glimpse of the future work.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF URBAN DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{638-660}},
Abstract = {{The innovations of the twenty-first century in digital technology and
   media have had major influences in the way young urbanites and future
   city designers think as well as experience places. In embracing this
   conceptual shift of how new communication technologies are changing
   people's perceptions, experiences and ways of knowing the city, Oxford
   Brookes University continues to develop pedagogical methods which use
   new media in the teaching, learning and production of contemporary urban
   design. These methods are examined in this paper in the context of three
   undergraduate modules:
   Taking the urban design learning experience out of the classroom and
   into the field using mobile lectures;
   Using digital media in research and engaging with oral, visual and
   sensory experiences;
   Developing design communication skills using video, animation,
   interactive PDFs and website design;
   Bringing new perspectives to classic theoretical concepts by engaging
   with different media: Cullen's Townscape from serial experiences in
   drawing to animated photographs and videos.
   These pedagogical innovations in experiencing, researching, designing
   and analyzing cityscapes have had a dramatic effect on the ability of
   students to transform themselves into design-aware and creative emerging
   practitioners. These are assessed for understanding the way students
   learn and the relevance of these skills for future practice.}},

Abstract = {{Technological innovation, coupled with the affordability of digital
   systems, has revolutionised the industrial age of electronics. A growing
   number of electronic systems today typically integrate multiple
   interconnected cores with various other peripherals depending on the
   applications. Over the years, the dimensionality of these applications
   and their underlying hardware platforms have been increasing
   expansively. The applications are becoming more far-reaching, connected,
   pervasive and compute-intensive. The hardware platform design is also
   increasingly becoming more challenging due to their conflicting design
   trade-offs between power, performance and reliability. This is further
   exacerbated by additional maintainability and sustainability
   requirements, often with a short time-to-market needs. Such
   proliferation of applications and hardware systems design challenges are
   likely to affect and potentially define how we do research and impart
   education to current and future generations of electronic engineers.
   This paper highlights these key research and education challenges
   relevant in the era of heterogeneous many-core applications.}},

Abstract = {{Under the background of the Digital Age, This article proposes
   suggestions on the training mode of the innovative professional
   photography personnel. We should rest on the good foundations of the
   demand pattern of `Double art talent' and take advantage of the advanced
   special services of Art Design. We should persist in the principle of
   Artistic Innovation first. We should establish an optimal training
   scheme of `photography creative talents'. A highly innovative
   photography subject system will train talents for `Design of
   photography'. We should change our opinions on traditional teaching, and
   to suggest improvements or comment on the practicability of the
   innovation and reform of Professional photography.}},

Abstract = {{DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance), as the most popular scheme in
   achieving devices interoperation in home network, is designed to
   implement the seamless sharing of media resources among devices. UPnP
   (Universal Plug and Play) protocol and UPnP A / V architecture, known as
   the core of the DLNA, are also the basis of this paper. At first, this
   paper implements the classical DLNA framework by designing the three
   basic logic devices on Android platform, which are digital media server,
   digital media render and digital media controller respectively, and the
   interoperability among these three basic entities. In addition, this
   paper has come up with and completed an online video searching module by
   utilizing the Youku APIs: searching for videos according to the
   keywords, parsing JSON data to fetch video ``metadata{''} and source
   address, and then pushing the resources to DMR to playback. Combining
   the DLNA with online videos searching is not only an extension in
   functionality, but also an impressive innovation in technology, which
   has great market potential.}},

Abstract = {{As in many other areas, air traffic control has faced challenges in the
   reality of digitalization and automation. Despite the introduction of
   new technology, runway incursions are a persisting problem at airports.
   A runway incursion that develops into an incident or accident is the No
   1 risk for the Air Navigation Service Providers. World-wide ATM tower
   work relies on variations of a generic design and tool set with a high
   degree of similarities, but with varying degrees of digitalization. Our
   study investigates the roles of ATM systems in the development of runway
   incursions, and on the potential to address them through further
   digitalization. This case study is based on the digitalized tower
   environment of Arlanda airport, and has a special focus on the
   electronic flight strips. Six episodes from a human-in-the loop
   simulation of Arlanda tower are described in detail, based on
   audio/video and eye gaze recordings. Four of the episodes contained
   irregularities of which two were runway incursions. Results showed that
   the e-strip system conceptually still very much plays the same role as
   the old paper strips it replaced, not taking full advantage of the
   possibilities of a digitalized system. It also showed that the systems
   in the tower environment are often not sharing information and that the
   human operator is very much left alone to gather and interpret the
   information from the different systems. The conclusion is that there are
   some significant design challenges ahead for to create the ATM system
   for the future with maintained or increased safety and performance with
   improved human-automation collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Industry 4.0 is characterized by smart manufacturing, implementation of
   Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) for production, i.e., embedded actuators
   and sensors, networks of microcomputers, and linking the machines to the
   value chain. It further considers the digital enhancement and
   reengineering of products. It is also characterized by highly
   differentiated customized products, and well-coordinated combination of
   products and services, and also the value added services with the actual
   product or service, and efficient supply chain. All these challenges
   require continuous innovation and learning, which is dependent on people
   and enterprise's capabilities. Appropriate management approaches can
   play a vital role in the development of dynamic capabilities, and
   effective learning and innovation climate. This paper aims at offering a
   viewpoint on best suitable management practices which can promote the
   climate of innovation and learning in the organization, and hence
   facilitate the business to match the pace of industry 4.0. This paper is
   one of the initial attempts to draw the attention towards the important
   role of management practices in industry 4.0, as most of the recent
   studies are discussing the technological aspect. This paper also
   suggests empirical and quantitative investigation on these management
   approaches in the context of industry 4.0.}},

Abstract = {{The current state-of-art video coding standard, the High Efficiency
   Video Coding (HEVC), brings many innovations as a way to improve the
   coding performance. However, the improvement on performance also brought
   higher computational effort and energy consumption. Since most of
   devices that handle digital videos are battery powered, the energy
   consumption became an important issue that demands efficient solutions.
   This way, controlling energy consumption is strongly desirable to adapt
   the encoding process to the energy availability. This goal is a hard
   task due the heterogeneous dynamic behavior of HEVC encoder. This work
   presents the development of a Pareto-based dynamic energy controller for
   the HEVC encoder, reaching up to 70\% energy saving with small losses on
   coding efficiency for most of the cases.}},

   Southern Brazil. The goal is to discuss the cultural, educational and
   wine tourism potential of the IVV, in a context of innovation, including
   learning in the areas Enology, Gastronomy and History of Italian
   immigration. The conception and development methodology were inspired by
   the concept of Living Lab (William J. Mitchell) and the cartographic
   method of intervention-research (Virginia Kastrup) As instruments were
   used participant observation, photographic records, audio, text, digital
   video and interviews. The data produced were analyzed and interpreted
   from the Actor-Network Theory (Bruno Latour). The results point to the
   innovation initiatives such as the IVV might contribute in the field of
   culture, education and wine tourism, articulated through a narrative
   able to engage tourists in experiences of knowledge, mixing geographical
   and digital spaces, valuing local culture.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented reality and robotics are valuable emerging technologies to
   respond from an innovative perspective to the new learning styles of
   primary and secondary students in the new digital age. In line with the
   latest editions of the NMC Horizon Report (2015, 2016), the
   implementation in the classroom of technologies based on robotics, 3D
   modelling, 3D printing and augmented reality will be an opportunity to
   reshape the teaching practice from a didactic, methodological,
   organizational, curricular, training, spatial and temporal point of
   view.
   This work offers a conceptual review and an analysis of robot models and
   applications based on augmented reality and 3D modelling. By means of
   these technologies we intend to create situations in the classroom
   involving material design and programming tasks to learn varied didactic
   contents in different education areas and stages, following a
   collaborative, inclusive and connectionist approach to develop the
   multiple intelligences and digital competences in the learner, according
   to what the knowledge and information society demands.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of small scale manufacturing technologies associated with the
   ``maker movement{''} has captured the attention of artists, innovators,
   educators, and policy makers. This paper critically examines how one
   core technology of the maker movement, a 3D printer, materializes
   assumptions about makers and their preferred ways of working with
   machines and materials. We describe how existing designs can be seen as
   anthropocentric, framing the human maker as visionary and commander of
   passive machines and materials. We then present an alternative system
   for 3D printing, called Redeform, which explores how a
   post-anthropocentric framing of makers as collaborators with machines
   and materials changes the design of 3D printers. We place our system
   within a lineage of perfounances that have explored relationships
   between humans and nonhumans since the 1950s. In doing so, we explore
   and speculate on the opportunities for operationalizing
   post-anthropocentric theories within the specific context of the maker
   movement.}},

Abstract = {{At the contemporary stage of higher education system's development in
   Ukraine, plenty of ideas in education drift along, find purchase with
   the right crowd, and as long as they present a more engaging method of
   learning than traditional schooling, are hailed as innovative. This is a
   fallacy that stands directly in the way of true innovation in edtech.
   And another sad fact is that educational products are judged against
   criteria that are much harder to pin down, so they can often get away
   with just being different. Teaching practice however shows efficient
   ed-techs that augment our natural ability to learn and improve students'
   results. Nowadays blended learning, instructional Internet resources,
   BYOD (bring your own device) policies etc. are being implemented into
   the process of the prospective specialists' professionally oriented
   competence development. These trends are significantly affecting higher
   education and show the need for technology that improves the quality of
   teaching via digital and online media. From short-term to long-term, in
   more and more Ukrainian higher educational establishments a number of
   different technologies, students will benefit from, are put into
   practice. And the aim of the given paper is to explore them and
   highlight all the benefits. Institutions implement different ed-tech,
   but the purpose is to open up the world as one big global arena. That is
   why it is of a crucial importance to define the impact of technology on
   learning process and on quality of higher education in general. In order
   to find out the efficiency of innovative technologies in educational
   process, the pilot training was held, the results of which are depicted
   in the article. As a result, the implementation of instructional
   internet resources proved its paramount efficiency and flexibility for
   both teaching and learning.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last years an increasing number of information technology tools
   have been successfully adopted and implemented in education. Many of
   these technologies are oriented to cover basic didactic needs like
   course description, teaching materials, learning activities, evaluation
   tasks, recommendations and utility resources and so on, mainly
   demonstrated to be efficient and helpful for students. Here I discuss
   about a plain and easy to learn technology that became more accessible
   due to growing number of sites, namely wiki. In my opinion wiki is a
   good and great tool created to highlight the potential of the web 2.0
   services and offered to give teachers and students a place to organize a
   collaborative and constructive learning environment. The most important
   feature of a wiki is its possibility of group collaboration. Cooperation
   within a learning group' members is asynchronous and everyone of this
   group can contribute to develop their wiki-space. A wiki should be used
   in education in different ways, but the emphasis has to be put on class
   projects (writings, presentations, distance learning, researches,
   debates, discussions etc.). In such way teachers will encourage
   collaboration and cooperation between students, develop active learning,
   produce attitude, skill, self-respect and motivated learning. In our
   digital times, every teacher might choose to use a wiki (or another
   innovative technology) in its course, because the impact of technology
   on students is obvious and observable and most of them are using social
   networking applications to create groups and enhance their process of
   learning.
   The article draws on the study and experience about the possibilities of
   Wiki as a Web 2.0 tool that could be used in content creation, as
   teaching methods and learning collaboration in school communities,
   performed at the course, Servicii Web 2.0{''} (Web 2.0 Services) at

Abstract = {{Knowledge, skills and information are becoming more important to our
   lives economically, socially and as citizens. Libraries have a central
   role to play in ensuring everyone has access to the resources,
   information and knowledge they need. for the future. Equality of access
   to information and to learning is vital if everyone is to have the
   opportunity to achieve their full potential. As we move towards a more
   knowledge-based society driven by digital technologies, the need to
   ensure access to information for everyone adds a new dimension.
   In order to play their role, public libraries must offer new and
   innovative services and activities that empower citizens and helping to
   increase the number of qualified, skilled and fulfilled people of any
   age, class or gender, including those enrolled in recognized courses and
   those simply wanting to improve their skills at any time of their life,
   for any reason.
   The use of IST tools for lifelong learning provides new opportunities
   but also increases the risk of social exclusion and the digital division
   of society. Public libraries have a key role to play in ensuring that
   citizens will not be divided into the digitally literate and illiterate
   by offering access to technology and particularly the Internet,
   especially for those people who do not have a personal computer at home
   or at work.
   Public libraries are major knowledge and learning resource centres. They
   should be the local learning place and champion of the independent
   learner. The development of their services requires the establishment
   and maintenance of strong partnerships with other organisations.
   There is also a requirement to provide access to and to package
   effectively a greater variety of good quality, relevant and attractive
   learning content of local relevance to use within new IST-based learning
   environments. One important source of this content is material held by
   libraries, museums and archives at local level.
   As new technologies develop at an ever more rapid pace, it is likely
   initial support in their use will still be needed and that librarians
   will continue to play a key role in IST training for citizens. The
   services in public libraires has to be innovative and inspirative. Key
   partners in this changing role has to be LLP organisation at local and
   national level.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The paper aims to analyse the challenges of emerging Digital
   Ecosystems. The principal goal of this work is to enrich previous
   studies on the topic of Digital Ecosystem with possible contributions
   derived from the studies on Smart Communities.
   Findings: The reflections herein support the overcoming of traditional
   managerial perspective no more longer able to support decision makers in
   defining effective and sustainable managerial models. The adopted lens
   build on the interpretative contributions offered by studies on Digital
   Ecosystems and on Smart Communities in attempt to define a possible
   multi-and trans-disciplinary framework for the management of networked
   systems in the light of value co-creation perspective. The main finding
   is the identification of possible advancements in the management of
   Digital Ecosystems using the evidence offered by the evolution of Smart
   Communities.
   Methodology: The work proposes an analysis of the domain of Smart
   Communities with the aim to identify possible advancements in the ways
   to face the challenges of Digital Ecosystems in the emerging knowledge
   and digital society. The proposed ideas support the emergence of a
   stronger conceptual framework direct to enrich previous contributions
   both in the domain of Digital Ecosystems and Smart Communities.
   Research implications/limitations: Reflections, ideas and observations
   herein represent a first step along the pathways to define a more
   holistic approach in the management of networked systems. In this
   directions, the proposed suggestions should be verified through a wider
   empirical study.
   Originality/Value: The paper offers a multidisciplinary approach useful
   to support decision makers in better understanding the opportunities

Abstract = {{The goal of the paper is to investigate if and how new technologies and
   digitalization foster the cooperation in business. To achieve that goal
   the authors first highlight the significance of the Internet for the
   growing presence of the cooperative process in the economy, then the
   concept of the sharing economy is explained and the main manifestations
   of the sharing economy new business models, new models of economic
   organization, are characterized. The paper is more conceptual than
   empirical in nature. Nevertheless the authors combined the conceptual
   approach with the case study approach. The second was used to exemplify
   the new processes in business. It turns out that the new trends are
   accelerated by digitalization and new technologies and manifest
   themselves in the prevalence of cooperative elements in business. The
   business processes presented suggest interesting managerial implications
   for companies: innovative business models should be based on sharing,
   openness, transparency and crowdsourcing. Breakthrough technologies
   enrich and diversify opportunities for value creation by new forms of
   collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Leveraging on the keep-going growth of the use of social media networks
   within organizational environments, the relationship of these digital
   tools with the open innovation (OI) model was quantitatively explored in
   order to bridge the current gap in the literature review. Regardless of
   research on OI model refers to manufactory industry, just few scholars
   have relied this approach on the service industry but nobody has linked
   this to the social media networks. Therefore, this research seeks to
   evaluate the OI model through the use of SMNs by 374 small medium
   enterprises operating in the service industry in UK. This open approach
   involves the concept of online customers co-creation which called for
   user-generated ideas. Empirically, the relationships among
   user-generated ideas, the use of social media networks, the adoption of
   OI model, SMEs' innovation performance are estimated by the structural
   equation modelling (SEM). Findings and discussion are argued based on
   the lens of OI model. Finally, academic and managerial implications were
   provided along limits and further research.}},

Abstract = {{By clicks, likes, tweets, photos, blog posts, online transactions, we
   (people and businesses) allow to create Big Data. Our digital traces
   tell the story about our professions, preferences, choices,
   transactions, traveling, habits etc. They permit to get information
   about who we are and what we do as individuals and organisations. This
   process is associated with a threat but also an opportunity for the
   social and economic development. The key question is how to ensure that
   the data we create continue to improve our lives, innovation and
   sustainable development. A majority of Big Data is no longer housed in
   statistical agencies, but housed by businesses including Online Services
   Providers (OSP). We state that regulators should consider this data as a
   public good and build the platforms for public and private partnerships
   to ensure advantage of digital technology, improved connectivity and
   data revolution.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a personal viewpoint
   on the development of document supply in the context of the recent
   European Union (EU) decisions on open science.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides some elements to the
   usual questions of service development, about business, customers, added
   value, environment and objectives.
   Findings - The EU goal for open science is 100 per cent available
   research results in 2020. To meet the challenge, document supply must
   change, include more and other content, serve different targets groups,
   apply innovative technology and provide knowledge. If not, document
   supply will become a marginalized library service.
   Originality/value - Basically, open science is not library-friendly, and
   it does not offer a solution for the actual problems of document supply.
   But it may provide an opportunity for document supply to become a modern
   service able to deal with new forms of unequal access and digital
   divide.}},

Abstract = {{Our world is getting smaller all the time. Connectivity and
   accessibility in space have improved to an unprecedented degree compared
   to past centuries, thanks to the enhanced design and effective
   implementation of transport infrastructure networks and increasingly
   also as a result of advance cyber infrastructure networks. Our connected
   and accessible world has indeed become ``a small world{''}.
   Technological innovation has become a buzzword in the past decades. The
   design, implementation and adoption of digital technology, in
   particular, have prompted entirely new forms of spatial interaction and
   communication, with a significant and unprecedented impact on transport,
   trade, tourism, migration, and social contact networks. In today's
   increasingly innovation-driven society, almost every activity, action,
   task, communication, interaction, movement and decision is supported by
   new technological artifacts and inventions. This paper introduces the
   notion of ``super-proximity{''} to highlight the force field of physical
   and virtual infrastructures at various geographical scale and time
   levels, and to sketch the spatial-economic implications of this
   universal mega-trend towards zero distance-frictions. The paper will be
   concluded with some prospective observations on the future spatial
   implications of the e-society and their analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Educational institutions are evolving away from the
   one-application-fits- all learning management system to a loosely
   connected digital learning ecosystem comprising diverse services that
   increasingly leverage data analytics to drive pedagogical innovation.
   Yet an ecosystem rich in services but lacking a common approach to
   measuring learning activity will find data collection, aggregation and
   analysis time-consuming and costly. The IMS Caliper Analytics (TM)
   specification addresses the need for data and semantic interoperability
   by providing an extensible information model, controlled vocabularies
   and an API for instrumenting learning applications and systems that log
   learning events. However, many learning activities have yet to be
   modeled by the Caliper working group. Engaging the SoLAR community
   directly in this effort will help ensure that the needs of researchers
   and other consumers of learning analytics data will inform future
   versions of the specification. The LAK16 Caliper workshop is being
   offered with this goal in mind. The half-day session, facilitated by
   members of Team Caliper, will provide LAK16 participants with an
   opportunity to extend the Caliper specification by modeling new learning
   activity profiles. New profiles, new connections and new friendships are
   expected outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal precision glass molding of imaging optics is the key
   technology for mass production of precise optical elements. Especially
   for numerous consumer applications (e.g. digital cameras, smart phones,
   ...), high precision glass molding is applied for the manufacturing of
   aspherical lenses.
   The usage of diffractive optical elements (DOEs) can help to further
   reduce the number of lenses in the optical systems which will lead to a
   reduced weight of hand-held optical devices. But today the application
   of molded glass DOEs is limited due to the technological challenges in
   structuring the mold surfaces. Depending on the application
   sub-micrometer structures are required on the mold surface. Furthermore
   these structures have to be replicated very precisely to the glass lens
   surface. Especially the micro structuring of hard and brittle mold
   materials such as Tungsten Carbide is very difficult and not
   established. Thus a multitude of innovative approaches using diffractive
   optical elements cannot be realized.
   Aixtooling has investigated in different mold materials and different
   suitable machining technologies for the micro-and sub-micrometer
   structuring of mold surfaces. The focus of the work lays on
   ultra-precision grinding to generate the diffractive pattern on the mold
   surfaces. This paper presents the latest achievements in diffractive
   structuring of Tungsten Carbide mold surfaces by ultra-precision
   grinding.}},

Abstract = {{On the verge of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), companies will need,
   sooner or later, to adapt their systems in order to follow the emergent
   visions of Industrie 4.0 and Industrial Internet demanding the
   digitalization of their processes, preventing the losing of their
   competiveness levels. The engineering of such innovative manufacturing
   control systems assumes a crucial challenge without which becomes hard
   to convince researchers and, primarily, practitioners of the proposed
   architecture potentials. This paper describes the engineering aspects of
   deploying an ADACOR (ADAptive holonic COntrol aRchitecture for
   distributed manufacturing systems) based CPS for a real small-scale
   production system. Since the solution is using agent technology, a
   special attention is devoted to the interface from the agent control
   layer to the physical resources using the industrially adopted OPC-UA
   (OPC Unified Architecture). At the end, some lessons learned in
   engineering this CPS are drawn.}},

Abstract = {{Audio-visual language is a core curriculum of digital media technology
   major. It is not a genuine language since it is composed of lights and
   sounds, namely audio-visual images instead of words or symbols. But the
   practice of this course is lack. The traditional theory way of teaching,
   has been far from meeting the needs of the whole teaching system. In our
   paper, we propose a new innovation of audio-visual language course which
   teach the students to grasp the theory knowledge and practice, more
   direct combination of theory and practice, finally master the
   audio-visual language of curriculum knowledge. The result showed that
   the using of new teaching method and curriculum are effective in
   audio-visual language teaching.}},

Abstract = {{Designers are used to produce a variety of physical and digital
   representations at different stages of the design process. These
   intermediary objects (IOs) do support the externalization of ideas and
   the mediation with the different stakeholders. In the same manner, sound
   designers deliver several intermediate sounds to their clients, through
   iteration and refinement. In fact, these preliminary sounds are sound
   sketches representing the intermediate steps of an evolving creation. In
   this paper we reflect on the method of sketching sounds through
   vocalizations and gestures, and how a technological support, grounded in
   the understanding of the design practice, can foster transparency and
   mediation in sound design-thinking. Three tools, under development in
   the scope of the EU project SkAT-VG (Sketching Audio Technologies using
   Vocalizations and Gestures) are introduced and discussed, based on the
   preliminary observations collected during a workshop involving
   professional sound designers.}},

Abstract = {{This novel research presents the results of an ethnographic study, which
   focused upon the production of an EP created by an amateur and a
   pro-amateur producer. The research presents their production practices
   across the production workflow, from inception and ideation through to
   completion. The paper describes the distinct processes that occur when
   collaborating on the production of the EP. The exploration here
   discusses the use of software systems to facilitate production of a
   series of music tracks. We further explicate the use of technologies in
   the production settings, and these range from mobile devices
   (smartphones) through to digital audio workstations. Further to this, we
   start to map out how the technology used affords and supports
   collaboration and communication across a distributed context. We respond
   to our findings by presenting a series of design implications that
   address the research.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we start to explore and unpack the work of Grime music
   producers and performers with a focus on their attitudes, working
   practices and use of social media. We explore the origins of grime and
   describe a complex set of interactions between people and technology in
   order to facilitate the production and dissemination of audio content in
   an evolving digital climate. We explore how individuals in this space
   curate and collect content, with a view to reuse in the future. We also
   explore how grime is evolving and ways in which technology might be able
   to facilitate many of these processes more effectively. Finally, we
   explore technological issues that pertain to music production and
   dissemination in its current state and implications for design for
   future applications and contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid and quick growth of smart mobile devices has caused users to
   demand pervasive mobile broadband services comparable to the fixed
   broadband Internet. In this direction, the research initiatives on 5G
   networks have gained accelerating momentum globally. 5G Networks will
   act as a nervous system of the digital society, economy, and everyday
   peoples life and will enable new future Internet of Services paradigms
   such as Anything as a Service, where devices, terminals, machines, also
   smart things and robots will become innovative tools that will produce
   and will use applications, services and data. However, future Internet
   will exacerbate the need for improved QoS/QoE, supported by services
   that are orchestrated on-demand and that are capable of adapt at
   runtime, depending on the contextual conditions, to allow reduced
   latency, high mobility, high scalability, and real time execution. A new
   paradigm called Fog Computing, or briefly Fog has emerged to meet these
   requirements. Fog Computing extends Cloud Computing to the edge of the
   network, reduces service latency, and improves QoS/QoE, resulting in
   superior user-experience. This paper provides a survey of 5G and Fog
   Computing technologies and their research directions, that will lead to
   Beyond-5G Network in the Fog.}},

Abstract = {{As the development of people's living standard and science and
   technology, it is becoming more and more universal that people use
   mobile devices to take shopping, listen to music and study. Due to
   mobile learning's more convenient, simple and timely characteristics,
   the mobile micro learning is coming into more and more people's life,
   study and work in formal and informal ways. But for modern universities'
   students, it naturally becomes one of popular learning means, besides,
   it also provides new means and approaches for university students'
   English learning, which can make the university English courses get
   better and more effective completion. Through the combination of
   computer and the classroom teaching mode, we can implement the mobile
   micro teaching reform, and provide students with liberalization and
   individuation learning environment so as to cultivate talents with
   comprehensive quality. However, due to the lack of effective mobile
   micro learning theory and learning theory under that guidance for
   current English education of the domestic university. Directing at this
   phenomenon, by studying its theoretical basis and combining theory and
   practice, this paper will carry on systematical discussion on that. On
   the other hand, according to the advanced study theory to find the
   teaching reform and provide solid scientific basis for mobile micro
   learning theory. In this paper, through the study, we get that mobile
   micro learning make the combination of traditional English teaching and
   modern science and technology and we can get the realization of digital
   teaching mode of English teaching and make the undergraduate learning is
   no longer limited by classroom with the help of WeChat, websites,
   internet etc. media,. Besides, these media can also let the
   undergraduates be more closer to life and have chance to participate
   life so as to create a new era of university English teaching under the
   guidance of mobile micro learning.}},

Abstract = {{Big data streaming analysis nowadays has become one of the most
   important topic in the list of data analysts since enormous amount of
   data are produced daily by the numerous smart devices. The analysis of
   such data is very important and the detection of frequent or even
   non-frequent patterns can be critical for many aspects of our lives. In
   the current paper, we propose a new methodology based on our previous
   work regarding the detection of all repeated patterns in a string in
   order to analyze a very big data stream with 1 Trillion digits, composed
   from 1 thousand subsequences of 1 billion digits each one. More
   specifically, using the novel data structure, LERP Reduced Suffix Array,
   and the innovative ARPaD algorithm which allows the detection of all
   repeated patterns in a string we managed to analyze each one of the 1
   billion data points, using 10 computers with standard hardware
   configuration, in 33 minutes which outperforms to the best of our
   knowledge any other existing methodology, which is equivalent to data
   point generation every 2 microseconds.}},

Abstract = {{The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched new research
   aiming at realizing low resource and frequent space science mission. We
   report the development activity for realizing miniaturization of onboard
   equipment using SpaceWire. The technology development target is the
   miniaturization of onboard units, which are small enough for deploying
   interplanetary mission with small rockets as Epsilon Launch Vehicles.
   Since SpaceWire interface consists of full digital circuitries and its
   communication protocol enables hardware implementation, Large Scale
   Integration (LSI) technology, surface mounting technology (SMT), and
   ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) packages are exploited for the
   miniaturization of onboard equipment with communication interfaces. The
   preliminary result shows that one half and/or one third in scale and
   mass can be realized.}},

Title = {{Assisting the appraisal of e-mail records with automatic classification}},
Journal = {{RECORDS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{293-313}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to investigate how automatic classification
   can assist employees and records managers with the appraisal of e-mails
   as records of value for the organization.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study performed a qualitative analysis
   of the appraisal behaviours of eight records management experts to train
   a series of support vector machine classifiers to replicate the decision
   process for identifying e-mails of business value. Automatic
   classification experiments were performed on a corpus of 846 e-mails
   from two of these experts' mailboxes.
   Findings - Despite the highly contextual nature of record value, these
   experiments show that classifiers have a high degree of accuracy. Unlike
   existing manual practices in corporate e-mail archiving, machine
   classification models are not highly dependent on features such as the
   identity of the sender and receiver or on threading, forwarding or
   importance flags. Rather, the dominant discriminating features are
   textual features from the e-mail body and subject field.
   Research limitations/implications - The need to automatically classify
   corporate e-mails is growing in importance, as e-mail remains one of the
   prevalent recordkeeping challenges.
   Practical implications - Automated methods for identifying e-mail
   records promise to be of significant benefit to organizations that need
   to appraise e-mail for long-term preservation and access on demand.
   Social implications - The research adopts an innovative approach to
   assist employees and records managers with the appraisal of digital
   records. By doing so, the research fosters new insights on the adoption
   of technological strategies to automate recordkeeping tasks, an
   important research gap.
   Originality/value - Our experiment show that a SVM classifier can be
   trained to replicate an expert's decision process for identifying
   e-mails of business value with a reasonably high degree of accuracy. In
   principle, such a classifier could be integrated into a corporate
   Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS) to improve the
   quality of e-mail records appraisal.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of the innovative techniques for generating high
   temporal and spatial resolution terrain models from Unmanned Aerial
   Systems (UAS) imagery, it has become possible to precisely map overland
   flow patterns. Furthermore, the process has become more affordable and
   efficient through the coupling of small UAS (sUAS) that are easily
   deployed with Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms that can
   efficiently derive 3D data from RGB imagery captured with consumer grade
   cameras. We propose applying the robust overland flow algorithm based on
   the path sampling technique for mapping flow paths in the arable land on
   a small test site in Raleigh, North Carolina. By comparing a time series
   of five flights in 2015 with the results of a simulation based on the
   most recent lidar derived DEM (2013), we show that the sUAS based data
   is suitable for overland flow predictions and has several advantages
   over the lidar data. The sUAS based data captures preferential flow
   along tillage and more accurately represents gullies. Furthermore the
   simulated water flow patterns over the sUAS based terrain models are
   consistent throughout the year. When terrain models are reconstructed
   only from sUAS captured RGB imagery, however, water flow modeling is
   only appropriate in areas with sparse or no vegetation cover.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional `Digital Communication Principles' experiment platform
   consists of discrete components, which are lack of extensibility and
   flexibility. Meanwhile, software platform exhibits waveforms and
   functions of different communication modules. However, Due to the
   absence of practical coherent signals, the software platform cannot
   satisfy the future practical needs of profound ``digital communication
   principle{''} related courses. Hence, a novel ``digital communication
   experiment{''} platform bearing high expansibility and flexibility
   compared with traditional hardware and software experiment platform is
   proposed, which is useful for both experimental teaching and stimulating
   students' interests and awareness toward digital communication.
   Moreover, the extended platform allows students to design extra
   components, which will further improve their abilities of manipulation
   and innovation.}},

Abstract = {{According to statistics, the number of elementary schools containing
   less than 200 pupils reached 1,264 in 2015. Assessment results presented
   by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
   suggested an uneven distribution of learning resources between urban and
   rural areas, underscoring the difficulties of increasing technology
   literacy in rural areas as well as the importance of the digital divide
   existing between rural and urban areas. Hence, this study developed an
   innovative, interactive distance learning model for resolving the
   effects associated with limited investments in education as well as
   limitations inherent in school management, bridging the major digital
   divide between urban and rural areas, and ensuring the even distribution
   of teaching resources in Taiwan. This model approaching that students
   exhibited an overall satisfaction level of 90\% and increased technology
   literacy and competitiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The use of digital solutions is rapidly expanding, including for the
   prospect of reducing social inequalities and geographical disparities as
   respect to access to health care and therapeutic education. Here, we
   question the transformations caused by the switching from therapeutic
   patient education sessions conducted face to face to the use of virtual
   digital applications developed on smartphones. From the perspective of
   developing health literacy, we analyse three complementary corpus: 9 in
   situ observations of educative sessions involving 34 patients, 27
   observations of users of tablets with interactive application and 12
   semi-structured interviews conducted with adults at home. Switching from
   face to face education sessions to education proposed on available
   smartphone application questions the changes of the trainers' and
   carers' roles and postures, the activities of the learners, the
   continuity of the educational process, and the contexts in which chronic
   illness is updated. The results obtained here question the development
   of digital education, while pinpointing numerous precautions to be taken
   for this development and the practical use of digital technology. Our
   analysis invite to continue innovations but suggests to accompany the
   advent of digital technology in the field of health and patient
   education by well-documented and grounded scientific work.}},

Abstract = {{In large apartment complexes, fraternities, or even for an owner having
   many keys for each and every apartment, car, or gate he owns,
   maintaining entry to authorized personnel only is a problem. Besides the
   costs involved in fabrication, duplication, and distribution of keys,
   there are security problems in case of lost keys. In this paper an
   innovative lock system prototype using today's technologies will be
   presented. The novelty of this prototype relies on the fact that using
   new technologies along with old ones will result in a smart and more
   efficient. We propose a smart digital door lock system for any lock
   system. A digital door lock system is any equipment that uses the
   digital information such as a secret code instead of the legacy key
   system. In our proposed system, a Central Control module is embedded in
   the door itself, this is required to prevent additional complications
   and more robust mechanism for the door as a whole. Technically, this
   system embeds itself in the Local Area Network of the house. This adds
   extra security layers and prevents access to the system only through the
   network. Furthermore, the biggest advantage of the proposed system over
   existing ones is that it can be easily installed with minimal
   requirement of infrastructures and planning.}},

Abstract = {{While most health systems serve the majority of their citizens well,
   each has its challenges and gaps that lead to inadvertent
   marginalization of certain populations. The engagement of traditional
   stakeholders in health - policy makers, patients, health professionals,
   health administrators - to address these issues are necessary but
   insufficient if unconventional solutions are to be discovered. Use of
   modem technologies to enable innovative approaches will require
   meaningful engagement of professional disciplines with technological
   expertise such as engineering, computer science, and health information
   science. Their involvement contributes unique and important perspectives
   in order to generate novel solutions to address health service quality,
   access, cost effectiveness, and innovation. This paper discusses the
   principles behind ideal collaboration between health professionals,
   engineers, computer scientists, and health informaticians to co-create
   health solutions, and cite literature based examples and case studies in
   British Columbia, Canada to illustrate the opportunities and challenges
   inherent in animating this collaboration between health professionals
   and technology experts. This paper will conclude with recommendations to
   stimulate and nurture interprofessional synergy towards success.}},

Abstract = {{Holoscopic 3D imaging (also known as Integral imaging) is a promising
   technique for capturing full colour spatial images using a single
   aperture holoscopic 3D camera. It mimics fly's eye technique with a
   microlens array, which will view the scene at a slightly different angle
   to its adjacent lens that records three-dimensional information onto
   two-dimensional surface. To date, holoscopic 3D camera adaptors are
   designed and prototyped for a large scale SLR cameras. This paper
   proposes an innovative design solution for prototyping a holoscopic 3D
   camera adaptor for Raspberry Pi, which is a credit-card-sized single
   board computer. This proposed method extends utilisation of holoscopic
   3D imaging and enables the expansion of the technology for various
   trends applications such as security, medical, entertainment,
   inspection, autonomous and robotics systems where 3D depth sensing and
   measurement are concern.}},

Abstract = {{We present an Adaptive User Interface (AUI) for online courses in higher
   education as a method for solving the challenges posed by the different
   knowledge levels in a heterogeneous group of students. The scenario
   described in this paper is an online beginners' course in Mathematics
   which is extended by an adaptive course layout to better fit the needs
   of every individual student. The course offers an entry-level test to
   check each student's prior knowledge and skills. The results are used to
   automatically determine which parts of the course are relevant for the
   student and which ones can be hidden, based on parameters set by the
   course teachers. Initial results are promising; the new adaptive
   learning platform in mathematics is leading to higher student
   satisfaction and better performance}},

Abstract = {{Industry and society as a whole are facing radical changes due to fast
   growing digital technologies and their penetration of practically all
   areas. Products and services will increasingly augment and integrate the
   real world with the digital world. This digital transformation has
   reached all business areas. The role of Requirements Engineering is
   therefore changing in becoming even more ubiquitous: Changing value
   chains and production processes, as well as new business models and
   innovative IT and software systems, need to be developed and operated in
   even shorter time frames. No wonder that project managers and IT
   departments feel unable to cope with the challenges on their own. We
   propose a panel in order to look into the role of requirements
   engineering in making digital transformations successful. It will
   address process, culture and technology dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless communications and mobile web in the domain of mobile commerce
   (mcommerce) are growing and gaining significant momentum throughout the
   internet. Researchers all over the world are actively studying the
   standardization to understand the factors that affects the acceptance of
   upcoming innovations and development in mcommerce. The digitalization
   and its advancements have ensured that, until recently, mcommerce has
   been constrained by few rules, disciplinary procedures, and operational
   norms. It has been characterized by considerable uncertainties in terms
   of operational governance. Specifically, it needs to include the
   altering magnitudes of the mcommerce contexts such as information type,
   personalization, location awareness, business activities, and quality of
   the mcommerce services. In this paper, we identified dimensions of
   mcommerce operations (MCOs) and corresponding factors impacting the
   MCOs. Operational governance framework of mcommerce (OGFM) is
   established to rationalize modeling of MCOs. It correlates the
   dimensions and context of mcommerce to the operations. OGFM distributes
   mcommerce control metrics in the identified categories of OGFM
   processes. They turn the theoretical framework to a practical model.
   Computation of consumer mcommerce active index (cMAX) is illustrated to
   continuously measure and regulate mcommerce participants' uncertainties,
   confidence levels, and retention.}},

Abstract = {{The collection and identification of digital evidence is an essential
   procedure in file forensics, which contains manual retrieval,
   traditional hash techniques and query by keywords techniques etc. For
   the vulnerability of electronic documents, it is easy to be changed or
   tampered with. So looking for files similar with target files becomes
   important for forensic. However, the traditional forensic system is
   usually based on searching for keywords or just scan the entire files,
   both lack of high enough speed and accuracy to support nowadays forensic
   tasks. Considering the fuzzy hash algorithm is of great value to
   calculating the similarity rate between files, in this paper, we
   analyzed the process and the improvement of the fuzzy hash algorithm,
   and verified the accuracy and efficiency of the improved algorithm, we
   innovatively applied fuzzy hash technology to the field of file forensic
   and designed a set of more adaptable and more accurate files forensic
   system, which follows the process of the acquisition of storage media,
   the collection of evident files, and the preservation of evident files,
   combined with text mining, data recovery technology, text clustering,
   classification, and some other technologies We believed that this system
   is a breakthrough of existing problems in file forensics field such like
   large manual workload and low accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The Doherty power amplifier has its origin from the pioneering work of
   William Doherty at Bell Laboratories in the 1930's where he investigated
   innovative methods of realizing efficient linear amplification at high
   power KW levels for transoceanic radiotelephony {[}1-2]. Over the
   ensuing decades and for most of the 20th century, the technique found
   popularity in AM broadcast transmitters, but more limited application
   elsewhere until the early 2000's and the advent and widespread
   deployment of modern cellular communications and digital broadcasting
   systems. Other key developments enabling Doherty architectures in these
   applications were advances in Si and III-V semiconductor device
   technologies to achieve higher performance RF amplification, and
   powerful digital signal processing (DSP) hardware and algorithms
   enabling distortion correction of the RF signal and amplifier
   linearization, thereby achieving efficient linear RF power
   amplification. This paper will examine underlying principles of Doherty
   PA operation, and highlight operational attributes and key developments
   which have resulted in it being the architecture of choice in today's
   cellular infrastructure transmitter.}},

Abstract = {{The sophistication and pervasiveness of cyber-attacks are constantly
   growing, driven partly by technological progress, profitable
   applications in organized crime and state-sponsored innovation. The
   modernization of rail control systems has resulted in an increasing
   reliance on digital technology and increased the potential for security
   breaches and cyber-attacks. This research paper showcases the need for
   developing the secure reusable scalable framework for enhancing cyber
   security of rail assets. A Cybersecurity framework has been proposed
   that is being developed to detect the tell-tale signs of cyber-attacks
   against industrial assets. This framework will be based on the concepts
   of developing protection profiles for railway assets such as point
   machine and evaluation assurance level in order to certify that chosen
   railway asset meet required security and safety properties. Endeavor is
   to make cyber health assessment of railway assets to prevent
   cyber-attacks.}},

Abstract = {{A large scale research initiative aimed at generating innovations around
   handheld devices based research as well as community based evaluation of
   related mobile applications. Big data refers to huge amount of digital
   information collected from multiple and different sources. Since a key
   point of big data is to access data from multiple and different domains,
   security will play a very important role in big data research and
   technology. Due to increase the challenges in mobile data or mobile data
   challenge (MDC), Big data is required for analysis and curation of
   mobile data. The rapid expansion of mobile technology has introduced a
   versatile global infrastructure that internally generate vast amount of
   data like user identification, location, device name and externally
   generate data related to mobile apps like number of mobile applications,
   number of downloaded applications, number of failure applications,
   number of popular applications etc. This paper presents a survey of the
   mobile applications (apps) in the context of Big data.}},

Abstract = {{New technologies, the internet and digitalization brought about major
   changes in the cultural and creative industries, affecting authors,
   designers, architects, musicians, photographers, film artists,
   advertisers, crafts, publishers, libraries, booksellers, electronic
   media, museums, galleries, users and customers as their stakeholders.
   Under the influence of these changes, the library of the new era became
   the source of traditional and digital information, and free access to
   information and mediation in their evaluation and transfer became the
   underlying principle of its activities. The starting premise of this
   paper is that books and libraries are the levers to link the cultural
   and creative industries with educational institutions and partners in
   their environment. The inspirational model of five concentric circles of
   the cultural industry, which puts the book and the library at the core
   of the concentric circles as the hotbed of creative ideas, skills and
   talents, was used to identify the book's and the library's place. This
   model was also used by the European Commission in its classification of
   the creative industries. The model suggests that creative ideas, as the
   core of the creative arts in the form of text, sound or image, spread
   out like concentric circles and affect all areas of the creative
   industries that exist in a particular area. The purpose of this paper is
   to raise awareness of the importance of these industries for the
   national economy. The paper aims to find effective tools, ideas,
   activities and processes for creative partnerships and for the
   interaction with the users and the environment that would facilitate
   innovative development of library and informational activities, as well
   as the contribution of libraries to the development of a knowledge-based
   society. Unlocking the creative potential of the library rests on
   creative librarians who are creating new value in the system of creative
   and cultural industries by using elements of marketing at the library.
   In conclusion, the paper discovers an economic dimension of the products
   and services of the cultural and creative industries, which promote
   intelligent, sustainable and inclusive development of the entire
   society.}},

Abstract = {{Money that has so far passed a large number of evolutionary processes of
   goods, metal, paper up to the information in the computer memory, the
   value especially given the trust of its users. Modern life as we know it
   would be unthinkable without cash and electronic money. Under the
   influence of globalization and the development of Internet trading
   technology gets more and more importance, a phenomenon
   cryptocurrencieslike Bitcoin lead to revolutionary changes in the
   financial world, presenting a sort of challenge to banks and all other
   interested parties. Searching for alternatives in light of the financial
   business becomes commonplace, a Bitcoin as a platform represents a good
   basis for the development and construction of new innovation where each
   user contributes to the creation of its value through a decentralized
   system of global networks. Its worth is determined by supply and demand
   in the market and the willingness of others to accept it as legal
   tender. Bitcoin technology includes features based on protocols,
   encryption and digital signature, which requires a certain level of IT
   knowledge and equipment to use. Despite the kind of risks in doing
   business with Bitcoin, Bitcoin every day becomes stronger, more robust
   and globally is gaining more supporters. Due to the increasing
   popularity of virtual currency aim of the paper is to investigate and
   analyze the Bitcoin system, based on primary research through a
   questionnaire to determine what kind of information to patients about
   Bitcoin, options trading and mining it and how Bitcoin trading at all
   represented in the Republic of Croatia. Given the speed of developments
   in technology, it is very likely that the market will play money in the
   future and continue to grow, and advocates of the concept of Bitcoin
   will face the potential ups and downs of this for now still
   unpredictable option to transfer money.}},

Abstract = {{Through this paper we step away from the proposition that there is one
   universally accepted notion of sustainability. We introduce the CSCW
   community to the scholarship of Anthony Weston, a philosopher who offers
   a way to acknowledge and leverage the plurality of values that inform
   conceptualizations of environmental sustainability. We use key themes
   from Weston's philosophy to analyze three social computing applications
   that employ tropes of sustainability, and explore their potential as
   sites of critical and disruptive discourse. Our focus is on openly or
   commercially available digital tools, simulations, and experiences that
   support the broader public, including children, learning about the
   environment and sustainability concepts. We posit that Weston's work
   provides an innovative framework for Sustainable HCI, one that is in
   alignment with the growing diversity of approaches to design in
   Sustainable HCI, alternatives to designing for tightly bounded problems
   and anticipated solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Bang \& Olufsen, a Danish high-end producer of consumer electronics, has
   experienced both failure and success in the process of strategic
   renewal, challenged by blurring industry boundaries and the rise of the
   digital technology paradigm. A study of the last decade shows how the
   company tried to renew itself by improving its new product development
   process from three angles: strategy, innovation and organizational
   design. Using ethnographic and grounded theory methods with a

Abstract = {{Nowadays, virtually all industries are impacted by the digitalization of
   business enabled by information and communication technologies.
   Consequently, it is a major challenge to any business to increase its
   ability to innovate through information systems. However the effort and
   the investments of companies are extremely varied, they do not have the
   same level of maturity with respect to their innovation strategy. While
   some highly mature use effective approaches, others still act as novices
   or use inadequate practices. The question raised in this paper is how to
   evaluate the level of maturity of an organization with respect to
   information systems based innovation. Also, the question concerns the
   identification of the salient features of ICT centred innovation
   maturity models. Taking these issues into account, the paper makes the
   following contributions: (i) a review of sixteen innovation maturity
   models collected from the research and the practitioners community,
   gathering facts about the models and about their effectiveness; (ii) a
   comparative analysis of these models.}},

   the BnF benefits from its experience with digital documents and its

   faces when dealing with the cataloging of ebooks and the management of
   their metadata, and the solutions that are emerging.}},

Abstract = {{Liver fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of
   extracellular matrix components in the liver parenchyma that distorts
   the normal architecture and hepatic function. Progressive fibrosis could
   end in the advanced stage known as cirrhosis, resulting in the need to
   resort to liver transplantation. Amniotic membrane (AM) has emerged as
   an innovative therapeutic approach for chronic liver diseases due to its
   anti-inflammatory, antiscarring, and wound-healing effects. We have
   recently shown that AM can be used as a patch on the liver surface at
   the same time of fibrosis induction, resulting in significantly reduced
   progression and severity of biliary fibrosis. Here we investigated the
   effects of human AM on the established rat model of liver fibrosis,
   induced by the bile duct ligation (BDL). We also explored the effect of
   AM on the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1),
   the main profibrogenic factor in hepatic fibrosis, and the
   proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),
   interleukin-6 (IL-6), and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Two weeks
   after BDL, the liver was covered with a fragment of AM or left
   untreated. Six weeks later, the fibrosis was first assessed by the
   semiquantitative Knodell and the METAVIR scoring systems and,
   thereafter, by CellProfiler digital image analysis to quantify the area
   occupied by collagen deposition, ductular reactions (DRs), activated
   myofibroblasts, and TGF-beta 1. The hepatic cytokines were determined by
   ELISA. AM-treated rats showed a significantly lower score compared to
   the control BDL rats (2.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.3, respectively;
   p<0.05). The collagen deposition, DRs, number of activated
   myofibroblasts, and TGF-beta 1 were all reduced to about 50\% of levels
   observed in untreated BDL rats. These findings suggest that AM, when
   applied as a patch onto the liver surface, is useful for treating
   well-established cholestatic fibrosis, and the mechanism was partly by
   means of downregulating the profibrotic factor TGF-beta 1 and IL-6.}},

Abstract = {{In a currently global, social and digital world, new challenges are
   coming to companies. The evolution of Information Technology and the
   rapid extension of the Internet have revolutionized the way of managing
   human resources. Nowadays, the real challenge for organizations is to
   achieve, hire and retain talents in order to enhance their competitive
   advantage. The paper aims to analyze the emerging trends in the
   e-recruitment services by investigating the case study of Face4Job, an
   innovative Italian start-up in this sector. The purpose is to explore
   why and how the problems related to traditional recruitment and
   e-recruitment models have led to an innovative solution of ``talent
   hunting{''}. Our findings show several innovative solutions in order to
   more efficiently match the requests of employers and job seekers and to
   make the search of talent much more qualified.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of the web has produced a broad change in partnerships and
   collaboration worldwide due to the centrality of internet, a virtual
   place where actors from different countries can easily meet and exchange
   in-formation. This new agency model represents the basis for the
   development of a new entrepreneurial organization where companies can
   redefine their idea of business in order to make the web instrumental in
   the creation of a global social network of actors. This model of
   cooperation is now possible thank to the creation of the new cloud
   working platforms that have brought about a revolution in the job
   market. Main objective of the present work is therefore 1. to analyze
   and compare, on one hand, three main communities of crowdsourcing
   (Knowledge or Gig economy) in order to show such evolution, and on the
   other; 2. to analyze and compare the main platforms of cooperation at
   distance, in order to identify critical success factors.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of integrated information on buildings is the premise
   for an effective assets management and the provision of innovative
   services to buildings users: such form of knowledge relies on the
   efficient exploitation of existing data, providing a complete overview
   on the state of buildings, and on the acquisition of real-time data
   flows, coming from sensor and mobile devices, reporting users
   behaviours. If, on the one hand, technology is progressively enabling
   the management of new huge streams of data, on the other hand the
   interconnection among traditional and well rooted datasets, the majority
   of which in charge of public administrations, is not always guaranteed.
   While, at European level, interoperability issues among public archives
   concerning buildings were properly addressed, and the relevance of
   geo-information is widely recognized, in Italy this process is still
   taking time to be undertaken. This paper discuss the current state of
   Building Information in Italy, outlining a possible path for the
   creation of a georeferenced Building Information System at municipal
   level, starting from the informative heritage available in existing
   databases, generated with different purposes and maintained by
   independent authorities: the idea is to solicit that digitalization
   process, started a decade ago with the ``Digital Administration
   Code{''}, through the proposition of real use cases that might be
   implemented once that public data on buildings are profitably combined
   together.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a study done in a sample of 123 diabetic
   patients. The photomotor reflex of the patients, as a reaction of an
   external and well-controlled light stimulation, was digitally measured
   to acquire variables and characteristics like pupil time of response,
   pupil diameter over the time and mathematical behavior of the photomotor
   response. These variables were added into a data base in order to
   computationally analyze them. Variables like gender, edge, weight,
   capillary blood glucose (CB) and glycated hemoglobin (GH), which were
   previously recollected on each patient, were also included in the data
   base for the analysis.
   The mathematical behavior of the photomotor response of each patient was
   statistically characterized to get an approximation of the signal to a
   sigmoidal function. From this characterization a set of 4 values of the
   signal along the time were also considered for the data base. A
   clustering based in the k-means algorithm was applied to the resulted
   data base in order to get specific groups with similar characteristics.
   The results indicate that, even all the patients where previously
   diagnosed with diabetes, there are differences between them and 4 groups
   of patients were detected. It means that not every patient with diabetes
   must receive the same medical treatment. In this way, we get an
   innovative model for the recognition of specific characteristics in
   diabetic patients for improving the quality of medical attention.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the impact
   of information technology on radiology services during the past 15 years
   and to promote awareness of the digital revolution that is taking place
   in health care, including radiology. The combination of two major
   innovations is playing a central role in this revolution, namely, the
   Internet and the digitisation of medical information. The various stages
   of the Internet development and their relationship with the almost
   simultaneously ongoing digitisation of the radiology department are
   described. The onset of teleradiology services and the more recent trend
   toward the usage of cloud-based networks and services are explained. The
   recent changes in digital communication and electronic transmission of
   medical information are discussed, hereby paying attention to the value
   of social media in medicine and radiology in particular. Finally, the
   future prospects of health care and medical imaging are outlined in the
   spotlight of today's major trends, and the role of the radiologist in
   this quickly changing environment is redefined.}},

Abstract = {{In modern telemedicine systems the physiological data of patients can be
   measured with the aid of electronic sensors located on and inside the
   human body. The collected medical data is then transmitted wirelessly to
   an external unit for processing, thereby enhancing the health
   monitoring, diagnosis, and therapy of the patients. In biomedical
   application, the process requires transmitting data, images and videos
   from inside the body taken by a radio system of a size of a pill seems
   to be the way. The use of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation in
   various areas like medical application has arisen the electromagnetic
   radiation problem. The services provided by this type of application can
   cause either good or bad effects on human body depending on the power
   level, frequency and the way it being used. The implant antenna with
   ultra-wideband (UWB) frequency will be used by inserting it into the
   nerve of human arm in term of homogenous model. Ultra-wideband (UWB) is
   a wireless technology that potential applications in variety of medical
   areas such as implant wireless sensors, microwave hyperthermia, imaging
   and radar. It can transmit digital data over a wide frequency spectrum
   with very low power and at very high data rates. Hence, this paper
   present the non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation effect on electrical
   nerve fiber of human arm model with the presence of other human tissues
   such as fat, muscle, skin and etc. at ultra-wideband frequency which is
   expected to improve the understanding of radio propagation inside human
   body hence contribute to more advance and innovative medical implants.

Abstract = {{In recent years, the rise of post-humanisms and new materialisms (Barad
   2007; Kirby 2011; Bennet 2010; Haraway 2004; Braidotti 2013) has
   produced a range of new approaches to ontology, epistemology and ethics
   in the arts and arts-based teaching and learning. What was once largely
   a domain of more humanist discourses, now by necessity includes critical
   terrains, such as material-discursive performativities, which entangle
   space, environments, objects, temporalities and hybrid identities, as
   notions of art', performance' and spectator' take on ever-multiplying
   meanings and possibilities.This article examines ways in which current
   trends in post-humanism and new materialisms complicate critical and
   pedagogical matters in higher education institutions, rendering simple
   subject/object approaches to curriculum design, studio practice and
   embodied making, and issues of participation and impact, inherently more
   complex, problematic and full of possibility as we enter an age that
   requires that education innovate new approaches to digital, ecological
   and social realities.Examining contemporary pedagogical modalities with
   particular reference to practice-as-research, the article identifies
   where teaching and learning in the academy may be falling short in its
   handling of such complexities, and how working notions of diffraction,
   material-discursivity and entanglement (Barad; Haraway; Kirby; Bennet)
   into the fabric of pedagogical design and practice, could enhance the
   way that the arts in higher education are meaningfully developed.}},

Abstract = {{Modern aerospace research programs are increasingly oriented towards
   adaptive wing structures for greening the air transport in the near
   future. New structural concepts implementing and integrating innovative
   technologies are mandatory for succeeding in this critical task. Among
   these, the so-called morphing structures are taken into account in
   aerospace applications, since they ensure the structural shape control
   in order to optimize the aerodynamic efficiency during the different
   flight phases. Among the most ambitious research projects launched in
   Europe, the JTI - Green Regional Aircraft (GRA) is placed in foreground
   for the design and the demonstration of a true-scale morphing flap
   applicable to the Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) wing of a 130-seats
   reference aircraft belonging to EASA CS25 category. In this framework,
   the authors intensively worked on the definition of a specific actuation
   and control system layout properly enabling two flap operational modes:
   overall camber morphing in deployed configuration, during take-off and
   landing, to enhance high lift performances; upwards and downwards
   deflection of the flap trailing edge (nearly the 10\% of the local
   chord) in stowed configuration, to improve wing aerodynamic efficiency
   in cruise. For this purpose, a digital logic control law was opportunely
   implemented into controller devices by using LTI DriveManager (R)
   software.
   Obtained results have been presented in terms of controlled morphed
   shapes, showing an excellent correlation with respect to the target
   geometries imposed by design requirements.}},

Abstract = {{A fablab, with its set of different tools and machines for digital
   fabrication, as well as with the people with various expertise who work
   in there, is a perfect environment for inter-and multidisciplinary
   connections and research. More and more fablabs are including the
   biology i.e. wet-lab components giving opportunity for various phenomena
   to be investigated from different perspectives, one from the biological
   point of view and the other from e.g. architectural. Biomimicry in
   architecture is an innovative concept of using organic forms found in
   nature as architectural solutions. Taking into account that such forms
   are difficult to produce in 3D without the tools of digital fabrication,
   present in a fablab, the authors postulate that the fablab (or more
   precisely a biofablab) can be efficiently utilized as a lab for
   biomimicry architecture research.}},

Abstract = {{Creating innovative, participatory and collaborative, interactive spaces
   that invite, engage and include urban youth is a challenge, particularly
   in the setting of research and participatory culture projects. Youth is
   involved in their ways and activities of own making It is often
   challenging for researchers to get them involved in cultural or civic
   activities that are part of research projects. On the other hand, access
   to youth cultures and subcultures can be difficult for researchers.
   Thus, in this workshop, we would like to discuss research approaches and
   methods of engaging youth in civic and participatory culture projects.
   Aiming towards a methodology to guide research in this area, the
   workshop explores diverse methods that are presently used in conjunction
   with participatory models and forms of cultural and civic engagement and
   new technologies of participation. Of particular interest are
   temporality (duration of engagement), outcomes (short and long-term, for
   researchers and youth) and the roles of digital means to scaffold
   participation, co-creation, or artifacts resulting from such
   participatory activities.}},

Abstract = {{Citizens' participation in an open innovation process enables them to
   express their needs and wishes for new kinds of public services.
   However, the challenge for citizens' participation in the open
   innovation process is finding methods and ways of working that
   familiarize the participants with new complex concepts. Also, the
   challenge is to make the participants' tacit knowledge visible. Design
   games aim at creating a forum for the meeting of users and designers as
   well as providing tools for making the empirical tacit knowledge
   visible. This paper introduces the WeLive design game that aims to help
   participants in co-design workshops to innovate and develop more
   concrete and detailed digital service concepts that utilize open data.
   The WeLive design game was evaluated and used in eight workshops and in
   total 147 persons took part. The results highlight that design game is
   an excellent method to involve citizens to the open innovation process
   and ease their abilities to understand new concepts like open data and
   form coherent public digital service concepts.}},

Abstract = {{Geospatial data, often embedded with geographic references, are
   important to many application and science domains, and represent a major
   type of big data. The increased volume and diversity of geospatial data
   have caused serious usability issues for researchers in various
   scientific domains, which call for innovative cyberGIS solutions. To
   address these issues, this paper describes a cyberGIS community data
   service framework to facilitate geospatial big data access, processing,
   and sharing based on a hybrid supercomputer architecture. Through the
   collaboration between the CyberGIS Center at the University of Illinois
   at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), a
   community data service for accessing, customizing, and sharing digital
   elevation model (DEM) and its derived datasets from the 10-meter
   national elevation dataset, namely TopoLens, is created to demonstrate
   the workflow integration of geospatial big data sources, computation,
   analysis needed for customizing the original dataset for end user needs,
   and a friendly online user environment. TopoLens provides online access
   to precomputed and on-demand computed high-resolution elevation data by
   exploiting the ROGER supercomputer. The usability of this prototype
   service has been acknowledged in community evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{A recent study in South Africa on the barriers to banking which involved
   customers in three disability groups namely mobility, hearing and vision
   has highlighted that currently banking in South Africa is not
   accessible. Customers with a disability are unable to independently use
   banking services across a wide range of channels. Exclusion from
   something as fundamental as managing their own financial affairs raise
   serious human rights concerns and requires committed action from
   decision-makers to address this. The fact that solutions to all of the
   identified barriers have been successfully implemented in banks in other
   parts of the world for many years emphasize that this is not a technical
   challenge. While some solutions require complex or expensive changes
   such as removing physical access barriers and ensuring that digital
   channels meet internationally accepted standards of accessibility, there
   are many simple and low-cost solutions which can be implemented
   immediately and would make a world of difference to these customers and
   their experience of banking. One key barrier which emerged in all the
   focus groups and surveys is attitudinal barriers - staff who are
   unwilling to assist, impatient, interact with the customer's assistant
   instead of directly with them and lack basic skills on how to interact
   with someone who has a disability. A comprehensive framework of banking
   was used to identify a wide range of barriers. The barriers were
   classified as attitudinal, barriers to physical access, digital access
   barriers, barriers to information, communication barriers and some
   generic concerns such as safe evacuation during emergencies and
   alternative authentication. Both the barriers and the solutions where
   ranked by participants. From a theoretical perspective, the benefit of a
   customer-centric approach to understanding these barriers and the
   innovation potential of a Universal Design approach is affirmed by this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{During the last half century, we have seen several innovations in
   industrial communication, from the introduction of 4-20mA signals, over
   digital fieldbuses to Industrial Ethernet and meshed Wireless Sensor
   Networks. These innovations met the demand for a higher degree of
   standardization, larger plants, and an increasing number of vertical
   applications inside the automation systems. With the Industrial Internet
   of Things, the number of communication nodes inside a plant will further
   increase, and seamless access to data will require an unprecedented
   degree of flexbility when it comes to configuring industrial IoT
   networks.
   Before setting out to define a reference architechture for IoT network
   management, it makes sense to do a stock-taking of the existing
   technologies, which have grown over the last decades and include a
   collection of vendor-and technology-specific solutions.
   In this paper, we summarize the constraints and requirements for network
   orchestration in IoT-centric automation systems, and we assess the state
   of the art against these requirements.
   At the dawn of Industrial IoT, the objective of this analysis is create
   a common understanding between IT and automation domains on the needs of
   industrial network management.}},

   of perceived copyright issues. Since 2010 the three libraries of the New
   York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC) have embarked on a series of

Abstract = {{Digital forensics has been utilized in computer crime investigation for
   last thirty years. It has evolved and progressed around the technical
   revolutions, and is now facing yet another new era due to the emergence
   of cloud computing. Cloud computing is a new computing model for
   enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared
   pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers,
   storage, applications, and services). The innovative nature of cloud
   computing has created unique challenges in the field of digital
   forensics. In this research paper, we present detail study to
   investigate the forensic issues in cloud computing and provide possible
   solutions, guidelines, including existing case studies. The basics of
   traditional digital forensics and cloud computing are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic ``I{''}-shaped connectors, properly placed in sculptured
   grooves, are used nowadays for restoring damaged connections of the
   Parthenon Temple. The grooves are then filled with a suitable cement
   mortar. In this study, the mortar was reinforced with multi walled
   carbon nanotubes, in an effort to develop a smart material which could
   monitor the structural integrity of the connection, by measuring its
   electrical resistance through the Electrical Resistance Change (ERC)
   technique. The connection was subjected to shear using a properly
   designed metallic restraining-loading system. The ERC technique was used
   in conjunction with traditional (electrical strain gauges and clip
   gauges) and innovative sensing techniques (Digital Image Correlation and
   Acoustic Emission). The data obtained by the ERC technique are in very
   good qualitative agreement with the respective ones provided by both the
   traditional and the innovative techniques. Moreover, the overall
   variation of the ERC is well compatible with the load applied,
   indicating that the specific quantity could be a flexible tool for
   monitoring strain/damage of the restored connections. Copyright (C) 2016

Abstract = {{End-user involvement is a central part in the strategy of public and
   private organisations to generate user-driven innovative solutions to
   real-world problems. The Living lab concept is an instrument to create
   user-centered solutions, with almost 400 recognized in the European
   Network of Living Labs (ENoLL) since 2006. Living labs cover diverse
   topics, such as smart-cities, innovative learning and digital health. A
   national initiative in Southern Norway has funded the Agder Living Lab
   (ALL) for eHealth, a user-centered innovation environment participated
   by multisectorial public and private partners. ALL implements a
   quadruple-helix model represented by citizens, industry, academia and
   government, offering an experimental arena for universal design to
   implement welfare technology, eHealth, telemedicine and mobile health
   solutions. ALL aims to catalyse inclusive innovation in the health
   sector by creating a multidisciplinary space where end-users (citizen,
   patient, relative, health professional) and health services can be
   interlinked making technology accessible and usable to everybody.}},

Abstract = {{Business strategies and operations are driven by scores of ever-shifting
   factors: from legal regulations to technological innovations and an all
   present digitalization. Companies need a powerful management approach to
   achieve high performance in today's digital world. In effect, they must
   know how and when to enhance their business processes, which processes
   are optimal candidates for intervention, and how to move rapidly from
   strategy to execution.
   That's where the Business Process Management-Discipline (BPM-Discipline)
   helps. It delivers significant business value by converting strategy
   into people and IT based execution at pace with certainty. The
   BPM-Discipline is implemented through the ``process of process
   management{''}. An efficient and effective implementation of this
   management process is achieved using a holistic framework and reference
   model as well as related tools and templates.}},

Title = {{Developing a Leading Digital Multi-sided Platform: Examining IT
   Affordances and Competitive Actions in Alibaba.com}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{738-760}},
Abstract = {{In recent times, digital multi-sided platforms (DMSPs) have
   revolutionized electronic commerce by enabling new forms of competition
   and collaboration. Existing studies provide useful insights yet do not
   recognize the role of information technologies (IT) in examining the
   development of DMSPs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a case
   study of Alibaba.com (henceforth simply Alibaba), the largest online B2B
   marketplace in the world with over 80 million members. We applied the
   theoretical notion of IT affordances to examine the possibilities for
   competitive action at a platform level based on organizational variables
   and IT features in the context of the environment in which they
   function. Our findings show that, toward market leadership, Alibaba has
   developed competitive actions from actualizing IT affordances. At
   Alibaba, actualizing IT affordances links closely with its defined
   organizational goals of developing: (1) a collectivist structure, (2) a
   coopetitive structure, and (3) an autonomous community among platform
   constituents. Our stage-wise model captures the relational aspects of IT
   affordances and proposes actionable prescriptions for a DMSP to achieve
   market leadership.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a framework to understand and explain the design and
   configuration of digital payment platforms and how these platforms
   create conditions for market entries. By embracing the theoretical lens
   of platform envelopment, we employed a multiple and comparative-case
   study in a European setting by using our framework as an analytical lens
   to assess market-entry conditions. We found that digital payment
   platforms have acquired market entry capabilities, which is achieved
   through strategic platform design (i.e., platform development and
   service distribution) and technology design (i.e., issuing evolutionary
   and revolutionary payment instruments). The studied cases reveal that
   digital platforms leverage payment services as a mean to bridge and
   converge core and adjacent platform markets. In so doing, platform
   envelopment strengthens firms' market position in their respective core
   markets. This study contributes to the extant literature on digital
   platforms, market entries, and payment.}},

Abstract = {{The future of intellectual property is in trade secrets. Changes to
   patent law make obtaining a patent more costly in some cases and
   impossible in others. The relentless spread of networked computing, with
   its inevitable vulnerabilities, and digital data make non-legal means of
   maintaining secrecy increasingly unreliable. Innovators will be forced
   to turn to trade secrets. This newfound prominence for trade secrecy
   will generate tensions with freedom of speech protections, federalism,
   and the balance between civil and criminal enforcement. The Article,
   part of a symposium on the Future World IP by the Denver Law Review,
   closes with a set of testable empirical predictions to evaluate its
   claims.}},

Abstract = {{The Small Size Telescope with Single Mirror (SST-1M) is one of the
   proposed types of Small Size Telescopes (SST) for the Cherenkov
   Telescope Array (CTA). The CTA south array will be composed of about 100
   telescopes, out of which about 70 are of SST class, which are optimized
   for the detection of gamma rays in the energy range from 5 TeV to 300
   TeV.
   The SST-1M implements a Davies-Cotton optics with a 4 m dish diameter
   with a field of view of 9 degrees. The Cherenkov light produced in
   atmospheric showers is focused onto a 88 cm wide hexagonal
   photo-detection plane, composed of 1296 custom designed large area
   hexagonal silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) and a fully digital readout
   and trigger system. The SST-1M camera has been designed to provide high
   performance in a robust as well as compact and lightweight design.
   In this contribution, we review the different steps that led to the
   realization of the telescope prototype and its innovative camera.}},

Abstract = {{The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) will be the
   fastest dedicated cm-wave survey telescope, and will consist of 36
   12-meter 3-axis antennas, each with a large chequerboard phased array
   feed (PAF) receiver operating between 0.7 and 1.8 GHz, and digital
   beamforming prior to correlation. The large raw data rates involved
   (similar to 100 Tb/sec), and the need to do pipeline processing, has led
   to the antenna incorporating a third axis to fix the parallactic angle
   with respect to the entire optical system (blockages and phased array
   feed). It also results in innovative technical solutions to the data
   transport and processing issues. ASKAP is located at the Murchison
   Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO), a new observatory developed for the
   Square Kilometre Array (SKA), 315 kilometres north-east of Geraldton,
   Western Australia. The MRO also hosts the SKA low frequency pathfinder
   instrument, the Murchison Widefield Array and will host the initial low
   frequency instrument of the SKA, SKA1-Low. Commissioning of ASKAP using
   six antennas equipped with first-generation PAFs is now complete and
   installation of second-generation PAFs and digital systems is underway.
   In this paper we review technical progress and commissioning to date,
   and refer the reader to relevant technical and scientific publications.}},

Abstract = {{ASTRI SST-2M is an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT)
   developed by the Italian National Institute of Astrophysics, INAF. It is
   the prototype of the ASTRI telescopes proposed to be installed at the
   southern site of the Cherenkov Telescope Array, CTA. The optical system
   of the ASTRI telescopes is based on a dual mirror configuration, an
   innovative solution for IACTs, and the focal plane of the camera is
   composed of silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM), a recently developed
   technology for light detection, that exhibit very fast response and an
   excellent single photoelectron resolution. The ASTRI camera electronics
   is specifically designed to directly interface the SiPM sensors,
   detecting the fast pulses produced by the Cherenkov flashes, managing
   the trigger generation, the digital conversion of the signals and the
   transmission of the data to an external camera server connected through
   a LAN. In this contribution we present the general architecture of the
   camera electronics developed for the ASTRI SST-2M prototype, with
   special emphasis to some innovative solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Project is a global science and
   engineering project realizing the next-generation radio telescopes
   operating in the metre and centimetre wavelengths regions. This paper
   addresses design concepts of the broadband, exceptionally sensitive
   receivers and reflector antennas deployed in the SKA1-Mid radio
   telescope to be located in South Africa. SKA1-Mid (350 MHz -13.8 GHz
   with an option for an upper limit of similar to 24 GHz) will consist of
   133 reflector antennas using an unblocked aperture, offset Gregorian
   configuration with an effective diameter of 15 m.
   Details on the unblocked aperture Gregorian antennas, low noise front
   ends and advanced direct digitization receivers, are provided from a
   system design perspective. The unblocked aperture results in increased
   aperture efficiency and lower side-lobe levels compared to a traditional
   on-axis configuration. The low side-lobe level reduces the noise
   contribution due to ground pick-up but also makes the antenna less
   susceptible to ground-based RFI sources. The addition of extra shielding
   on the sub-reflector provides a further reduction of ground pick-up. The
   optical design of the SKA1-Mid reflector antenna has been tweaked using
   advanced EM simulation tools in combination with sophisticated models
   for sky, atmospheric and ground noise contributions. This optimal
   antenna design in combination with very low noise, partially cryogenic,
   receivers and wide instantaneous bandwidth provide excellent receiving
   sensitivity in combination with instrumental flexibility to accommodate
   a wide range of astronomical observation modes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends existing Information Systems perspectives towards
   Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to consider HCI within Digital
   Infrastructures (DI) - heterogeneous and evolving systems comprising
   both IT and its design and user communities. Using the example of a new
   interface that has significantly decreased call handling times for sales
   and support agents (knowledge workers within a contact center), the
   paper finds that DI create an amount of flexibility that enables
   employees to shape tools over time. It argues that DI are a useful
   concept for HCI, as they stress the socio-technical and evolving nature
   of IT artefacts.}},

Abstract = {{In 2006 the Government of Oman has embarked on a strategy called
   `Digital Oman' which, aims to make government services available
   electronically throughout the country, and to facilitate e-Commerce in
   all of its forms. Part of the e-Government initiative was to develop an
   e-Payments gateway to facilitate the online payments for users of
   different departments and services. The Information Technology Authority
   (ITA) of the Sultanate of Oman has taken up the strategic initiative to
   drive the development of e-Payments in Oman. The ePayment gateway is one
   of a kind in the region, and it was implemented in partnership with
   MasterCard's ``MiGS{''} platform. The project has been live for over 8
   years, yet neither the number of customers nor the value of transactions
   is close the initial projections. The project is about to reach a dead
   end and get replaced with another solution. In this paper we apply the
   Diffusion of Innovations Model {[}12] in a case study to identify the
   issues and propose a solution for future initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Today, companies often face rapid and substantial change of their
   business environment. To stay competitive, firms are forced to engage in
   continuous innovation of their products and services. Moreover, the
   digitization of society and organizations has led to an increase in
   radical and disruptive innovations across all industries and trades. As
   a result, companies often find it difficult to develop an organizational
   identity - a shared understanding of ``who are we{''} and ``what makes
   us different from others{''}. In this article, we combine extant theory
   on both digital innovation and identity formation processes to develop a
   conceptual model of identity formation, highlighting the dynamics
   between innovation and identity formation. We use our model to discuss
   symptoms that organizations might experience when engaging in digital
   innovation, shaping the process of identity development. Finally, we
   suggest future research topics to investigate the relationship between
   innovation and identity formation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable technologies-innovative and multi-functional media technologies
   that can be attached to our body-have received a great deal of attention
   by the digital media industry. The wearability of technology brings new
   affordances that may significantly change the way humans interact with
   technological objects. However, little is known about how such emerging
   technologies can shape our perceptions of the body and the interactions
   associated with technology use. Focusing on users' experience of
   wearable technologies, this study explores the influence of wearable
   technologies on individuals' perceptions of their body-tool relationship
   and body awareness. A series of in-depth interviews was conducted to
   investigate how users' interactions with wearable technologies affect
   their perceptions. Our findings indicate that perceptual properties
   (materials, weight, battery life, and vibration) influence users'
   body-tool relationship, whereas motor activity properties (monitoring,
   tracking, and real-time feedback) influence users' body awareness.}},

Abstract = {{As swimming is a kind of water sports, swimming teachers generally find
   it difficult to express demonstration actions in practice teaching by
   using appropriate manners. Furthermore, teaching effectiveness will be
   optimized by avoiding technical barriers in learning, thus realizing
   great transformation and innovation of swimming teaching. This research
   combines three-dimensional virtual reality simulation and database
   technology, provides precise digital management platform for real-time
   data acquisition and monitoring system, and lets users can control the
   objects as they were right on the scene. With the help of VR technology,
   designers can not only publicize it to the mass, but also present it to
   decision makers for modified opinions applied in swimming teaching area.
   The purpose of this research is trying to design a virtual reality
   system to suit the complex demand of swimming teaching and promote the
   outcome of the course.}},

Abstract = {{New generation multimedia may have a great impact on exhibition visit
   experience. This contribution focuses on the innovative use of
   interactive digital technologies in cultural heritage practices.
   ``Live{''} displays steered by visitors support the creation of various
   content formats, smartly adapt the content delivered to the visitor,
   stimulate self-motivated learning, and lead to a memorable and effective
   experience. Multimodal interaction modalities have been developed for
   the exhibition ``1525-2015. Pavia, the Battle, the Future. Nothing was
   the same again{''}, a satellite event of the Universal Exhibition in
   Milan (Expo 2015). The Computer Vision \& Multimedia Lab of the
   University of Pavia, in cooperation with the Bulgarian Academy of
   Sciences, in the framework of the European project ``Advanced Computing
   for Innovation{''}, has contributed to set up the exhibition, enriching
   an educational and experiential room with products and targeted
   applications. Visitors can observe and analyze seven ancient tapestries,
   illustrating different phases of the battle, through 3D reconstructions,
   virtual simulations, eye interaction and gesture navigation, along with
   transpositions of the tapestries into tactile images that enable the
   exploration by partially sighted and blind people. In the near future,
   we may assess the impact of this interactive experience. Due to the
   novelty of the approach, new insights can be potentially derived about
   the effectiveness and manageability of each specific system component.
   Under this scope, not only the exhibition success is important, but also
   the augmented learning experience in cultural heritage contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) represent the dominant form of
   the business organization in the Slovak Republic. They undertake mainly
   within the areas of activities and sectors with claims for the
   workforce. Their competitiveness also depends on the ability of workers
   to meet the new requirements for skills and qualifications. A key
   problem for SMEs is a need to improve their innovative capacity. In a
   view of the limited resources they often have issues not only with
   attracting young employees and keeping them after completion of the
   training and education, but also with the integration of the older
   employees. They must deal with the problems arising from the ageing of
   the workforce and age-related changes in the structure. In this context,
   there are important measures, as the increase in the employment rate of
   women and older employees. For this reason, it is needed to use all
   available knowledge, skills and qualifications, in order to achieve more
   flexible qualifications, regadless where and how they have been
   obtained. The aim of the paper is to describe some of the innovative
   training modules to keep both young people and older employees. The key
   results should be improved quality of work and the overall performance
   of the organization, change of mentality and increased confidence. From
   the point of view of the individual employees there is also important to
   verify their previous skills and work experience, because it increases
   their chance on the labour market.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of computer technology and network technology, the
   traditional test mode is not able to fully meet digital, standardized
   test requirements. Traditional exam modes include artificial test paper,
   artificial marking, several processes statistics and performance
   analysis papers, results statistics, papers analysis etc., The whole
   process is cumbersome and inefficient. Moreover, with the change of
   examination techniques and carrier landmark, we can say the traditional
   examination method is no longer suitable for today's exam. Now appears
   online examination system is an extension of the traditional examination
   and change, with its own efficient and convenient, flexible benefits,
   widespread concern various institutions. On the other hand, with the
   rapid development of mobile communication technology and intelligent
   portable device innovation, appearing more and more sophisticated
   intelligence products, marking the arrival of the mobile Internet era.
   As a smart phone operating system, Android platform by virtue of its
   open source, openness and stability, it has become the current most
   users, the fastest growing mobile smartphone operating system.
   In summary, The campus of the previous examination system is applied to
   the mobile client, not only can make full use of space, anytime,
   anywhere to exam, not too much limited by time and space. And greatly
   simplifies the examination process, reducing the onerous test management
   work, which is a mobile Internet application development model better.
   In order to make the examination system to have flexible scalability and
   cross-platform portability, At the same time convenient for each
   subsystem integration, based Android platform and application software
   technology Web application server communication, combined with the
   actual traditional examination process, design the overall structure and
   function of the system to achieve the main module, in order to develop
   versatility, flexibility, ease of maintenance of the mobile phone side
   of the school examination system. The system includes system settings,
   test status, clear examination, re-examination, the online exam, the
   student information maintenance and queries, bank maintenance, query
   results, review papers, exit multiple module systems, it can enter their
   own questions and its related the freedom to create and delete, save
   students answer timely information, the system uses a manual marking and
   automatic scoring combination to provide a more objective reference
   points.
   The system uses Android as an operating system, using J2EE as a
   development framework, JAVA as the system development language, using
   the B/S structure of the network architecture model, applicating SQL
   Server2005 database management system to store student information and
   questions as to achieve different people, from different locations (such
   as LAN, WAN, Internet/Intranet), with different access methods to access
   and manipulate a common database. It can effectively protect data
   platform and access management, as well as its own security server
   database, to better improve the overall security of the system.
   In this paper, based on the Android platform school examinations system
   design, development and related technology is described and discussed.
   First of all, the analysis shows that schools in the past exam mode, so
   as to define the overall layout of the system and its related processes.
   Secondly, using the JAVA language for the completion of the layout of
   the main module for development, implementation steps are discussed in
   detail. Finally, the system is optimized and the relevant contents are
   summarized. After the completion of the system development, the function
   of each function should be checked to ensure that the system can achieve
   the expected purpose, better guarantee the availability and safety of
   the system.
   The realization of the Android platform of school examination system,
   not only to meet the school standardized tests of functional
   requirements, and well solves the shortcoming of lack of portability of
   the original system. It is able to improve the flexibility and
   practicality of the system, teachers and students can use and search
   examination system related information anytime and anywhere, to a
   greater extent save time and space occupancy. In the implementation of
   the Android examination system, there are still many problems, but also
   need to continue planning and design. But the whole process of its
   development, this is a familiar and the process of exploration, and it
   is proved that this is an effective research and development process, at
   the same time,, it has important guidance and reference for the future
   development of a more excellent and more efficient system.}},

Abstract = {{In cyber security of a modern information society, digital safety is
   becoming more and more important regarding governance and schools as
   well as well-being of common people, especially children. There are
   models to evaluate cyber-attacks and technical risks in institutions and
   ICT services, but there are no good models yet to help understanding the
   concerns and issues of everyday e-life of commoners, including students
   and teachers - especially the ones that can be encountered at schools
   (from primary to upper secondary). This makes digital safety an
   essential part of innovation and cooperation at schools as well as in
   teacher training. The aim of this paper is to propose a model that helps
   to build up internet security training and other activities that will
   improve children's and teachers' safety skills and resistance to

   on expectations that smarter use of personal digital devices will
   improve not only digital literacy of pupils, but also their academic
   achievements in various subjects. The Estonian government plans to
   allocate 47 million Euros of national and EU structural funds until year
   2020 for this purpose. There is also interest in improving digital
   skills of school-leavers on the side of the industry, as the Estonian
   ICT sector expects to double the turnover within the next 4-5 years. The
   sectoral analysis estimated the need for 8000 new employees in ICT
   companies. To achieve this, the industry has supported various
   educational programs like the Look@World Foundation's Smart Lab project,
   Samsung Digital Turn project for schools, using Raspberry Pi-s at school
   supported by TransferWise, Microsoft's Partners in Learning projects and
   so on.
   Challenges for the digital turn are related to people's involvement
   (teachers, school leaders, students, parents, officers); resources
   (gadgets, time, salary, maintenance); promises (this is beneficial for
   improving the students' skills and competences and also is the only
   way); lack of analysis (act more, measure less). In this article we will
   study the Samsung's Digital Turn project applications for the schools
   2014 and 2015 in order to understand what are the goals for the schools
   when they think of digital turn; we also have asked school ICT
   administrators, educational technologists and school leaders to list
   seven issues that come into their mind that should be death with in the
   process, and surveyed teachers of one school over a 4-year period,
   tracking the changes in using technology as well as learning and
   teaching.
   We will analyze the data to understand the trends and difficulties
   schools will face during this journey. This information is needed to
   train all other 450 schools that have not started their digital turn
   change yet, but are forced to act soon. The trends in digital turn
   projects will tell us the maturing process and goals that the schools
   have as opportunities and strengths while the list of difficulties shows
   the project's weaknesses and threats. Looking at one school over 4 years
   will help us to understand the change, especially the areas that have
   changed in teachers' practices.
   In the conclusion we propose a list of actions that can be used to meet
   the challenges that can ruin the digital turn for most schools. We also
   propose an area of measures where the digital turn is the most visible.}},

Abstract = {{High Quality survey models, realized by multiple Low Cost methods and
   technologies, as a container to sharing Cultural and Archival Heritage,
   this is the aim guiding our research, here described in its primary
   applications. The SAPIENZA building, a XVI century masterpiece that
   represented the first unified headquarters of University in Rome, plays
   since year 1936, when the University moved to its newly edified campus,
   the role of the main venue for the State Archives. By the collaboration
   of a group of students of the Architecture Faculty, some integrated
   survey methods were applied on the monument with success. The beginning
   was the topographic survey, creating a reference on ground and along the
   monument for the upcoming applications, a GNNS RTK survey followed
   georeferencing points on the internal courtyard. Dense stereo matching
   photogrammetry is nowadays an accepted method for generating 3D survey
   models, accurate and scalable; it often substitutes 3D laser scanning
   for its low cost, so that it became our choice. Some 360 degrees shots
   were planned for creating panoramic views of the double portico from the
   courtyard, plus additional single shots of some lateral spans and of
   pillars facing the court, as a single operation with a double finality:
   to create linked panotours with hotspots to web-linked databases, and 3D
   textured and georeferenced surface models, allowing to study the
   harmonic proportions of the classical architectural order. The use of
   free web Gis platforms, to load the work in Google Earth and the
   realization of low cost 3D prototypes of some representative parts, has
   been even performed.}},

Abstract = {{Current research study emphasizes the importance of advanced digital
   image processing methods in order to delineate between various LULC
   features. In the case of the Antarctica, the present LC (snow/ice,
   landmass, water, vegetation etc.) and the present LU (research stations
   of various nations) needs to be mapped accurately for the hassle free
   routine activities. Geo-location has become the most important part of
   geosciences studies. In this paper we have tried to locate three most
   important features (snow/ice, landmass, and water) and also have
   extracted the extent of the same using the multisource classification
   (image fusion/pansharpening) and pattern recognition
   (supervised/unsupervised methods, index ratio methods). Innovation in
   developing spectral index ratios has led us to come up with an unique
   ratio named Normalized Difference Landmass Index (NDLI) which performed
   better (Avg. Bias: 51.99m) than other ratios such as Normalized
   Difference Snow/Ice Index (NDSII) (Avg. Bias: -1572.11m) and Normalized
   Difference Water Index (NDWI) (Avg. Bias: 1886.60m). The practiced trial
   and error methodology quantifies the productivity of not only the
   classification methods over one other but also that of the fusion
   methods. In present study, classifiers used (Mahalanobis and Winner
   Takes All) performed better (Avg. Bias: 122.16 m) than spectral index
   ratios (Avg. Bias: 620.16 m). The study also revealed that newly
   introduced bands in WorldView-2, band 1 (Coastal Blue), 4 (Yellow), 6
   (Red-edge) and 8 (Near Infrared-2) along with traditional bands have the
   capacity to mine the polar geospatial information with utmost accuracy
   and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Taiwan's Ministry of Education (MoE) started planning and promoting
   comprehensive Digital Learning Initiative in 2013. It is expected that
   teachers and students can use broadband networks in campus in 2017.
   Students can do online learning with different kinds of digital devices
   at any time. Besides, students can do ubiquitous learning by getting
   digital learning resources on cloud devices. Teachers can grasp
   innovative teaching strategies with the application of digital
   technology and design the learning activities that are more adaptive to
   individual students. Students have the information force of mobile
   learning, the abilities to use information tools and grasp the
   information, as well as Internet literacy and ethics. The learning model
   of education at all levels will transform into student-centered to
   facilitate justice, public, autonomy and adaptive learning opportunities
   as well as make students in the country and those in the city have equal
   digital learning opportunities. Digital Learning Initiative will have
   profound influence on education system. Education cloud (EduCloud) is
   the flagship of the digital learning initiative. This paper presents our
   research and experience of applying Big data analytics to the EduCloud.
   We address Big data infrastructure and analytics to cover the issues of
   data collection, cleaning, storage, query, analytics, and visualization
   in order to make EduCloud more suitable for teachers and students in
   Taiwan.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive user model, built by monitoring a user's current use of
   applications, can be an excellent starting point for building adaptive
   user-centred applications. The BaranC framework monitors all user
   interaction with a digital device (e.g. smartphone), and also collects
   all available context data (such as from sensors in the digital device
   itself, in a smart watch, or in smart appliances) in order to build a
   full model of user application behaviour. The model built from the
   collected data, called the UDI (User Digital Imprint), is further
   augmented by analysis services, for example, a service to produce
   activity profiles from smartphone sensor data. The enhanced UDI model
   can then be the basis for building an appropriate adaptive application
   that is user-centred as it is based on an individual user model. As
   BaranC supports continuous user monitoring, an application can be
   dynamically adaptive in real-time to the current context (e.g. time,
   location or activity). Furthermore, since BaranC is continuously
   augmenting the user model with more monitored data, over time the user
   model changes, and the adaptive application can adapt gradually over
   time to changing user behaviour patterns. BaranC has been implemented as
   a service-oriented framework where the collection of data for the UDI
   and all sharing of the UDI data are kept strictly under the user's
   control. In addition, being service-oriented allows (with the user's
   permission) its monitoring and analysis services to be easily used by
   3rd parties in order to provide 3rd party adaptive assistant services.
   An example 3rd party service demonstrator, built on top of BaranC,
   proactively assists a user by dynamic predication, based on the current
   context, what apps and contacts the user is likely to need. BaranC
   introduces an innovative usercontrolled unified service model of
   monitoring and use of personal digital activity data in order to provide
   adaptive user-centred applications. This aims to improve on the current
   situation where the diversity of adaptive applications results in a
   proliferation of applications monitoring and using personal data,
   resulting in a lack of clarity, a dispersal of data, and a diminution of
   user control.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to explore teachers' different pedagogical
   approaches to teaching the ``sandbox{''} digital game Minecraft as a
   part of L1 primary education. The empirical data for the paper is based
   on a series of design interventions with a Minecraft curriculum in three
   different classes (two 1st grades and one 2nd grade) at three different
   Danish schools, which involved video observations of the teaching and
   interviews with the participating teachers. The project is financed by
   The Danish Ministry of Education (2013-2015) and is part of a larger
   project on ``ICT in the Innovative School{''}, which aims to develop
   students' 21st century skills. Drawing on theoretical work on
   professional practice (Schein, 1983), frame theory (Goffman, 1974), and
   Dialogic Self Theory (Ligorio, 2010), the paper aims to describe and
   understand how the teachers' positioned themselves through redesign and
   enactment of the Minecraft curriculum. In order to achieve this aim, the
   paper introduces a general model for understanding teachers' educational
   use of games, which describe the dynamic interplay between curricular
   concepts, game texts, game practices, and learning activities. Based on
   empirical analysis of teachers' l-positions to the Minecraft curriculum,
   the paper identifies three different pedagogical approaches, which are
   described as execution, improvisation, and transformation.}},

Abstract = {{The appeal of Mixed Reality (MR) digital games arouses interest among
   researchers and education specialists who since their recent
   proliferation, they have been trying to introduce their motivating
   potential in learning contexts. Our main research question in this work
   focuses on whether MR digital games can, via novel Presence (feeling of
   `being and doing there' in a virtual or augmented world) and MR
   gamification (dynamics, mechanics, components) support and foster future
   learning and teaching, to address a wide variety and variation of
   educational contexts. To accomplish the above, a consistent
   computational framework that supports new types of Mixed-Reality Serious
   Games and Gamification (MRSGs) is established in this work that features
   MR gesture-based and game-based learning. The introduced term Mixed
   Reality Serious Games (MRSGs), refers to digital mini game-shells that
   allow the learners and teachers to sense the feeling of `Presence'
   experienced under a novel MR educational learning framework, in both
   Virtual Reality (VR) as well as Augmented Reality (AR) formal and
   informal learning. The former (VR) allows for the unique feeling of
   `being there' and `doing there' in the virtual world, that will be
   transforming the overall game-based learning experience, via latest
   innovations as well as recent progress in low-cost h/w Head Mounted
   Displays (HMDs). The latter (AR) blends real and virtual elements so
   that the 3D virtual element is registered accurately in the real world
   and interacted freely by the learner via various mobile displays,
   including smart glasses, natural, gesture-based interaction (mobile RGB
   and RGB-D), MR virtual characters and gamified learning processes.
   Game-based learning also involves the incorporation of games into
   lessons. The principal aim of applying games in education is to increase
   students' engagement and motivation. In our case studies we provide two
   mini MRSGs in VR and AR that accompany the primary school history class
   and particular the period of the Minoan Civilization, as manifested by
   the archaeological site of Ancient Knossos in Heraklion, Greece. The AR
   MRSG implements a desktop-based holographic application using the
   Meta-AR glasses. This MRSG consist of three mini game shells in which
   the student has to complete various learning tasks by using
   gesture-based interaction. These tasks consist of puzzle-based and
   constructional games tasks. The VR MRSG implements a similar approach of
   a Virtual tour in Knossos with quests that student need to accomplish to
   collect rewards. The student has to fully explore the palace, interact
   with special characters and complete their quests. These MRSGs are a
   first attempt to formally study latest h/w and s/w advances in Mixed
   Reality technologies, applied in gesture-based and game-based learning
   in both formal and informal educational contexts. Moreover we compared
   the gamification elements for each enabling technology and define the
   gamification dynamics, mechanics and components that need to be utilized
   in each MR environment.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript is primarily dedicated on the innovative study of
   applying filters on 3D images. Unlike previous studies adroit efforts
   have been applied in understanding the effects of cascading two or more
   filters on noise affected colored({[}12]) images. The experiments are
   performed on Matlab. In today's digital world where one clicks and
   expresses their emotions across various social media platforms this
   study plays a crucial role in improving the picture quality. The
   findings emphasise upon using multiple filters on various noise affected
   images to get the best possible image. Each filter has its own unique
   effect on a noisy image and in turn plays a crucial role in removing
   noise from the image under consideration. A single filter if applied to
   a noisy filter reduces the noise content in an image to an extent but if
   the same image is filtered iteratively from two or more filters the end
   result is brilliant.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an innovative, digital-in-concept prospective idea
   for designing smart analog circuits, operated on low voltage. The mixed
   signal circuit consists of both digital and analog circuit in which the
   CMOS digital circuit is easier to fabricate and it increases the speed
   of the circuit as most of the delay in the circuit comes from the analog
   circuitry. In present work digitally enhanced analog voltage comparator
   has been designed using a pure digital differential circuit technique.
   The proposed digitally enhanced analog voltage comparator circuit has
   low power dissipation of 0.324 mu W, high resolution of 1.96 mV low DC
   offset of 1 mV full output swing of 0-1.8V and common mode input range
   of 0-1.8V. The digital differential circuit has been connected in the
   unity gain configuration to prove the concept of proposed circuit. The
   circuit has been simulated using SPICE in TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology
   at 1.8 V with load capacitance of 1 pf.}},

Abstract = {{A review of the digital marketing literature suggests that it is
   important to understand that what applies in marketing management in the
   past and in traditional marketing context may not create success of
   tomorrow. It is believed that digital technology has an effect on the
   implementation of marketing. Value creation is seen as the core purpose
   and central process of marketing management. To be able to operate in
   the digital environment businesses have started to look for
   possibilities to renew the ways of working in order to boost product or
   production innovation and the productivity of the organization. This
   suggests that also the management needs to change. The practices that
   enhance the operations of the company may vary, but according to prior
   literature, highly productive ways of working are such that they
   decentralize the organizational decision making and problem solving and
   increase the employee commitment. Thus, the aim of this study is to
   create a conceptual framework which describes the phenomenon. It
   integrates four major perspectives: the new digital marketing
   environment, the characteristics of the value proposition and creation
   processes in the organization, the characteristics of new ways of work
   and the characteristics of tools that can may help to change the current
   organizational practices. We build up the constructs from prior
   literature. Overall, the framework deepens the understanding the current
   and new practices of value creation processes from organizational
   perspective. In order to optimize the value creation in the future, it
   is important to understand if current practices can be organized and
   managed in a new way. Another advantage of such framework is that it may
   direct the future empirical fieldwork, data analysis and findings.}},

Abstract = {{In this study an innovative entrepreneurial approach was used to teach a
   postgraduate educational leadership course by incorporating digital
   tools to develop 21st century skills (creativity, collaboration,
   communication and critical thinking). Additionally, utilizing a
   practice-based approach facilitated learners operationalizing acquired
   skills within their institutions in real time and in the real world,
   thereby wedding knowledge, skills acquisition and dissemination in a way
   that had immediate impact and added value to the learner and The
   University of the West Indies School of Education (UWISOE) in Trinidad
   and Tobago (T\&T). Global factors impacting the business of education
   have made it imperative for tertiary education providers worldwide to
   seek innovative entrepreneurial pathways to increase the skills base of
   their populations and capitalize on the full potential of individuals.
   New digital technologies have brought this imperative within reach, but
   it is not sufficient. The innovators are entrepreneurs: their
   integration of new pathways in tertiary education foster institution
   building, albeit intrapreneurs: they build collective capacity and
   transform the institution from the inside. (Coyne et al, (2001) and
   Hekkert et al, (2011) technological innovation systems (TIS), seven-step
   system functions, was used as a theoretical framework to assess the
   challenges and extent of the value-added. A qualitative interpretive
   approach was used in the study. The participants comprised thirty
   learners (school teachers, school leaders and educational organization
   leaders) enrolled in the course, the four lecturers who integrated 21st
   century skills in the course, and a fifth lecturer who acted as a
   participant observer of the course. Data collection methods included:
   participant observation, field notes, realtime videography of
   participants, interviews, blog posts, online and face-to-face focus
   groups and an online survey. A content analysis approach to data
   analysis was adopted, with the aid of the NVIVO 10 data analysis
   software. Research Questions: How has the entrepreneurial, innovative
   approach to teaching an educational leadership course utilizing digital
   tools aided the development of participants' 21st century skills and
   capitalized on the potential of the individual's learning? How has the
   entrepreneurial, innovative approach to teaching an educational
   leadership course utilizing digital tools added value to the UWISOE? How
   have participants in the course translated the gains from the course
   experience into their real world activity? Preliminary findings indicate
   that learners are navigating new spaces and ways of functioning within a
   blended learning environment. They are willing to do so because they
   feel the acquired 21st century skills are adding value to them
   personally and the practice-based approach allows them to use these
   skills to begin institutional transformation. These findings are
   important because they show that acquisition of 21st century skills
   provides learners with confidence to develop their institutions
   utilizing these skills, thereby adding value to the T\&T educational
   system from the bottom up. From the UWISOE's perspective the benefits
   were: 1) economic, as open-source digital tools were used and there is
   the potential for increased student intake, 2) administrative, as
   digital instruction and assessment frees up administrative resources.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, healthcare is the biggest service industry, but healthcare
   practices have traditionally been slow to adopt new possibilities
   afforded by technologies and e-business. Digitalization can
   revolutionize healthcare delivery and open business opportunities for
   innovative start-ups. New companies in the healthcare service sectors
   are an important source of new jobs and significant promoters of new
   service innovations. The start-up stage is the most critical period for
   the survival of a new company, as decisions made during the early stages
   of growth have a definitive influence on its productivity and success.
   This study seeks to clarify the early stage of start-ups in the digital
   healthcare service business in a Swedish context. We utilize critical
   incident technique (CIT) and semi-structured interviews in data
   collection. In addition, through six cases of digital service-based
   start-up companies, the first phase of the four-stage service business
   framework is tested and considered: How do the experiences of start-up
   entrepreneurs in digital healthcare service firms relate to the
   assumptions of the stage framework's start-up stage in a Sweden context?
   The results provide partial support for the applicability of the service
   framework. Contrary to framework, cases have allocated resources to
   strategic planning even at very early stages. In addition, the results
   of the study include perceived context-specific viewpoints of healthcare
   business from the start-up entrepreneurs' perspective. The results of
   the study may be effectively used in intermediary organizations such as
   public advisory services, and new business can utilize the framework for
   predicting the early stage of digital healthcare service firms.
   Furthermore, the results may be of interest to the public sector, which
   has an essential role in the healthcare industry as a service provider
   and purchaser, but also as a creator of business conditions and
   opportunities. Service-based digital healthcare start-ups will provide
   fresh insights about the challenges and opportunities within the eHealth
   business sector.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses and examines initial trust formation and
   cross-cultural challenges when building collaboration towards and
   between partners in innovation-related multi-partner project design and
   planning between oriental and Finnish cultures. The paper focuses on the
   role of trust and challenges in the initiating stage presented by
   geographical distance and cultural differences. E-communication in
   interaction and negotiations are dealt with. Trust is seen as a
   potential unifying resource in relationships and looked from the view of
   intangible assets, as intellectual capital. The aim of the paper is to
   provide and increase understanding of both initial trust formation and
   cultural perspectives in the early stage of building relationships and
   network for innovation-related project involving knowledge holder
   institutions and other entrepreneurs. While a few studies of partnership
   trust development have been published lately in inter-organizational
   context (Cook \& Schilke, 2013; Sloan \& Oliver, 2013), this paper
   concentrates on the early stage (initial) trust formation and
   cross-cultural issues (Fulmer \& Gelfand, 2012) and challenges that have
   been scarcely examined empirically so far. The paper presents some
   preliminary empirical findings based on data from different actors
   involved in the project. Auto ethnography method is used as well as
   written material. The question is how initial trust develops towards and
   between multiple partners involving education institutions and aiming to
   collaborate with entrepreneurs, such as care business and digital
   solutions providers. Awareness of process development and relational
   management skills are essential for advancement of innovative
   initiatives and formation in new international partnerships. Service
   providers and educational institutions need to develop trust with and
   for cross-cultural competences and understanding of customer value in
   order to strengthen preparedness for new advancements within
   international innovation project concept. New opportunities for
   entrepreneurship development internationally may arise unexpectedly when
   reciprocal trust and trustworthiness have been recognized and pursued.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional Flipped Classroom teaching website can be
   constructed by the innovating of the theory and practice as well as the
   teacher's improvement of the way to teach. Combining the digitization
   with the heuristic teaching and in virtue of the multimedia courseware,
   the classroom teaching can be deepened. This article also raise the TBP
   teaching mode, and build a concept based on the harmonious unification
   of teaching researching and learning and the training of the students'
   creative ability.
   The Flipped Classroom raised by Jon Bergmann and Jon Bergmann was start
   to try out in part of the U. S which got the prominent effects. However,
   these research did not analyze the essence of the Flipped Classroom
   deeply but only stopped in the way to carry out. Therefore, Professor
   Robert Talbert took some experiments during his teaching time and has
   got good effects. He has summarized the teaching model of the Flipped
   Classroom according to the several-year experience. Although the model
   summarized the main process, it ignored the other important facts which
   can influence the Flipped Classroom. Thus, the Flipped Classroom need to
   be improved further especially in the lessons of information technology.
   When referring to the construction of the lessons' innovation, the
   teachers are meant to pay attention to how to impart the knowledge to
   students based on mastering the theoretical lessons as the ``Principles
   of Computer Composition{''} is a professional and less-well understood
   course. Traditional ways for teaching mainly focus on the teachers, and
   the students have to take lessons passively. As the less teaching
   period, the stronger theoretical property, the wider scope of knowledge,
   the more contents and the faster speed of updating of the ``Principles
   of Computer Composition{''} increase the difficulty of teachers and
   students, how to realize the harmonious unification between teaching and
   learning becomes to be a difficulty for all the educators. The authors
   has accumulated some experience during the eight-year teaching and
   practicing. Here are several parts which can be innovated in the
   lesson{[}1]. As the picture 1 shows.}},

Abstract = {{At present, digital learning terminal has larger impact on people's
   lives and students learning, and is likely to become more mature in a
   short period of time in the future. New digital terminal is built on the
   basis of reading. It is a dedicated terminal which is interactive,
   relevance, openness and has rich media features. It can help students to
   start meaningful learning. {[}1] Through the application and analysis of
   rich media and rich Internet and compared with multimedia technology
   features and digital terminal learning research, rich media and rich
   Internet technology can explore the terminals of digital learning,
   create a new type of digital learning environment, and further help and
   improve students' learning enthusiasm and initiative.
   In people's life and learning, electronic products such as smart phones
   and tablet computers are widely used as terminal equipment. Gradually
   mobile reading and extensive electronic reading form becomes an
   important part in people's lives. E-books, with the fast development of
   electronic technology, get new developments. Digital textbooks, as
   special electronic books in education teaching, earn widespread interest
   and attention. Departments of Education put forward the corresponding
   requirements for digital education informatization in 2013, which
   includes: fully launch second generation People's Education Press
   digital textbooks, realize the development of digital products, and
   ensure to introduce scientific applicability product in the autumn of
   2013. Deputy Minister of Departments of Education in our country put
   forward that we should insist on innovation and driving mechanism, fully
   implement the application in teaching and fully realize normalization
   and extensive application in Anhui province education information
   research. Modern teaching reform needs to rely on the innovation of
   digital teaching technology to truly achieve teaching wisdom and ascend
   the quality of teaching. It has become the inevitable development trend
   to apply digital teaching facilities in education and teaching,
   especially in elementary education class. {[}2] Although people make
   digital textbooks as the focus of the study, currently people have no
   unified understanding of digital teaching material, and issues such as
   the content design and application of digital textbook are still in the
   preliminary study stage.}},

   seen as a gateway for an individual company to penetrate new markets
   where new products, services, and highly personalized experiences are
   delivered to their customers. Despite the benefits of DBE, collaboration
   uncertainty is the main challenge for a company wanting to participate
   in a wider ecosystem. This paper presents an open digital business
   ecosystem model that prepares companies prior to participating in the
   world of digital business and to secure multi-faceted benefits. This
   model demonstrates three key functionalities: (1) evaluating a company's
   current digital and non-digital business capabilities driven by its
   vision, (2) capturing these capabilities in a value cloud register, and
   (3) integrating the business capabilities determined by innovative
   collaborations. A case study of a global non-profit organization is

Abstract = {{Scientific communities can be seen as highly focused organizations,
   composed of people performing strict patterns of behavior. The growing
   body of scientific data available digitally, as well as new
   infrastructure of distributed access, has given to funding agencies,
   politicians and scientists in general the foresight of novel
   possibilities of discovery and innovation reusing those data. Many
   stakeholders now expect the data to be released, although relevant
   sharing rates are not always verified. In this paper, we propose a
   method to bring forward and represent these interests. Applying this
   method, we investigated how the availability of software capable of data
   storage and sharing can act upon their users, and whether it makes them
   more suitable to share research byproducts. Results show that, although
   current software empowers the scientists to carry out their own
   research, it still does not create a path through which users can make
   their interests spread among other stakeholders.}},

   and ability to move. The data are gained during the research that was
   supported by National Research Program Innovative solutions in social
   rehabilitation in Latvian schools in the context of inclusive
   education{''}. The balance sway index (SI) was tested by digital
   platform BioSway. The research group included 8 boys and 7 girls in the
   12-14 years age range with vestibular function insufficiency. The aim of
   the study was to examine the immediate effect of vestibular exercises
   and to evaluate the degree of postural balance parameter changes after
   vestibular exercises complex applications. Vestibular exercise with head
   rotation 20 seconds with 3 repetitions caused statistically significant
   (p- 0.03) increasing of SI. The statistically significant (p- 0.025)
   improvement of SI was set after vestibular rehabilitation exercises
   complex application during 6 weeks (10-15 minutes a day).}},

Abstract = {{From time immemorial, Libraries have been the house of Illuminati. With
   the advancing world, new discoveries are being made creating new
   horizons of knowledge and with new and increasing researches being made
   there has been a proliferation of books, journals and transcripts. With
   this surplus production of books and journals in both existing and new
   areas managing them in library has become a tedious task. Looking up for
   a book seems like searching for a needle in a haystack. In this age of
   digitalization and automation we present an automated and innovative
   library management system which will not only automate the management
   process but will also ease the manual searching of books. The emphasis
   is on using the techniques of Optical Character Recognition to obtain a
   resulting system which can identify and locate books in a physical
   library by the use of searching algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we design and implement a face-based signage interacting
   system, called AdYou, for mobile users using smartphones. By using the
   AdYou system, mobile users only need to drag the service icon on the
   face of a particular target in a digital signage. AdYou is able to
   provide diverse services to mobile users through face detection and
   recognition techniques. Using the intuitive way of gesture-based
   operations, mobile users can directly interact with digital signage. We
   further integrate the AdYou server with a face cache mechanism that can
   make the system response time as small as possible for popular signage.
   AdYou reveals an innovative user interface for signage interacting
   between mobile users and digital signage. We have implemented an
   Android-based AdYou system that can be interacted by mobile users as
   fast as possible.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a CMOS particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) concentration to
   frequency converter with calibration circuits for air quality monitoring
   applications is newly proposed. A calibration technique is proposed in
   this work. Another innovation is that the outputs of the proposed chip
   are directly digitized, they could be easily sent over a wide range of
   transmission media, such as PSN, radio, optical, IR, ultrasonic, and
   etc. Before performing the proposed calibration circuits, the maximum
   linear error is 16.22\%. After calibration, the maximum linear error is
   reduced to 0.08\%. The PM2.5 concentration ranges from 6.64 to 55.62 mu
   g/m(3), and the corresponding output frequency range is 0.66 to 3.98
   MHz. The chip area is 1.15 x 1.15 mm(2). The proposed chip is suitable
   for devices of measuring PM2.5 concentration, such as monitoring air
   quality of industrial areas.}},

Abstract = {{Current consumer products are designed based on an ``outside in{''}
   process where parameters such as consumer experience and portability are
   prioritized to define the system and component design and performance
   targets. This drives innovation in electronic packaging to challenge the
   existing design boundaries and norms. One of the challenges faced by the
   electronic industry is managing the package warpage characteristics for
   seamless component to board assembly process. As part of a continuous
   effort, iNEMI has collaborated with individual companies to establish a
   sampling of current trends of electronic packaging warpage, and also
   initiated an effort to evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic warpage
   measurement metrologies. The former objective has provided a new batch
   of donated parts for warpage characterization which included Package on
   Package (PoP) memory, System in Package (SiP), Fine pitch Ball Grid
   Array (FBGA) as well as Flip Chip BGA (FCBGA) with and without a lid
   (heat spreader). The dynamic warpage metrologies considered were based
   on thermal shadow moire, 3D digital image correlation (3D DIC), fringe
   projection moireE and confocal technique. In this paper, the majority of
   the work covered will be the dynamic warpage characteristics of donated
   components and a brief description of metrologies under consideration.}},

Abstract = {{The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool which proves to be useful
   in a number of application scenarios. A number of large industrial
   players, such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and NEC, are currently investing
   in exploiting the blockchain in order to enrich their portfolio of
   products. A number of researchers and practitioners speculate that the
   blockchain technology can change the way we see a number of online
   applications today. Although it is still early to tell for sure, it is
   expected that the blockchain will stimulate considerable changes to a
   large number of products and will positively impact the digital
   experience of many individuals around the globe.
   In this tutorial, we overview, detail, and analyze the security
   provisions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain-effectively
   capturing recently reported attacks and threats in the system. Our
   contributions go beyond the mere analysis of reported vulnerabilities of
   Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of countermeasures to
   deter threats on the system-some of which have already been incorporated
   in the system. Recall that Bitcoin has been forked multiple times in
   order to fine-tune the consensus (i.e., the block generation time and
   the hash function), and the network parameters (e.g., the size of
   blocks). As such, the results reported in this tutorial are not only
   restricted to Bitcoin, but equally apply to a number of ``altcoins{''}
   which are basically clones/forks of the Bitcoin source code.
   Given the increasing number of alternative blockchain proposals, this
   tutorial extracts the basic security lessons learnt from the Bitcoin
   system with the aim to foster better designs and analysis of
   next-generation secure blockchain currencies and technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Green IT products collect personal small data by wearable computing and
   Quantified Self, Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything
   (IoE) link the small data with the big data, and transform the user
   experience from User-Centered Design (UCD) into User Participated
   (Involved or engagement) Design (UPD). To collect the seamless and
   sustainable UPD small data, we use the wearable computing sensors and
   applications for small data mining, filter, information visualization
   and interaction design. By information sorting the wearable computing
   into five types (in me, on me, with me, around me, beyond me), we intend
   to design the user experience in a sustainable way by Quantified Self.
   With the context awareness, conscious awareness and emotion awareness,
   we use LBS (location-based service) to construct context awareness, set
   up big five personalities and Enneagram to deal with the data of
   conscious awareness. For the Green IT Products, we set up the eco system
   information architecture and agile interaction model for the user
   experience design, we also use pre-conscious, subconscious and conscious
   awareness big data to analyze and predict the long-term impaction
   factors for the user experience and users' intuitive interaction. From
   the strategy level, structure level, framework level and visual level,
   we point out the Meaning-Centered Design methodology to dig out the user
   experience design for the Green IT Products, green and live information
   architecture for the life cycle evaluation for the Green IT products,
   figure out the stakeholder and interaction logic moving line by mapping
   the mental model for the diversified users' agile transformation needs,
   emotions and interaction feedback, provide the mass customization and
   crowds innovation contents to support the Green IT products and Product
   Service System (PSS), modify the quality of the real physical products
   and enrich the virtual reality digital information contents to prolong
   the life cycle of the Green IT Products. By decreasing the carbon
   footprint and increasing the three flows (information flow, logistics,
   financial flow) chain touchpoints, we find the painpoints and design the
   good user experience for the real people. We construct the user
   engagement innovation platform and transform the users' function with
   duality role player with user and designer. For the evaluation of the
   user experience, we change the scenario role player design into `real
   design for real people', and with the agile interaction and intuitive
   interaction, we modify the user experience with the real time
   high-fidelity prototype and iterative usability testing. In the pilot
   study, we design the smart clothes and interactive stage, props to
   collect the dancer's small data about the heart-beat, EMG, EEG, motion,
   body gesture, emotion and the audience feedback such as the sound of
   clapping, the environment light change, the audience moving line and the
   air smog haze index. We use the module and separate design for the
   clothes and sensors, memory metal, fiber-optical to balance the clothes
   light change, clothes form transformation and small data visualization.
   On the one hand, the clothes can collect the dancer's action data in an
   active way, at the same time, the clothes also interact with the dancer,
   the audience and the stage environment to support the digital contents
   of the dance. One clothes can express the five scenes of the dance in a
   sustainable way.
   And because of the separate design, the clothes and the sensors play the
   role in a parallel way to leave the dancer plenty of free uncertainty
   expression space. That win-win design support the real and virtual parts
   life cycle for the Green IT Products. We use the expert review,
   heuristic evaluation, big data visual analytics and usability testing
   for the user experience design evaluation and design the third version
   for the smart clothes and interactive stage.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, we introduce and discuss some of the most important and
   widely used models of personality. Focusing on trait theories, we first
   give a brief overview of the history of personality research and
   assessment. We then move on to discuss some of the most prominent trait
   models of the nineteenth century-including Allport's trait theory,
   Cattell's 16 Factor Model, Eysenck'sGiant Three, and the Myers-Briggs
   Type Indicator (MBTI)-before focusing on the Big Five Model (Five Factor
   Model), which is the most widely accepted trait model of our time. Next,
   we introduce alternatives to the Big Five that appear to be useful in
   the context of personalized services (the HEXACO and RIASEC models), and
   subsequently outline the relationships between all the models discussed
   in the chapter. Finally, we provide an outlook on innovative methods of
   predicting personality with the help of digital footprints.}},

Abstract = {{With the promotion of ``Internet + efficient logistics{''} and refer
   Tomorrow's Elastic Mobility Adaptive(TEAM), this paper extends the
   framework of urban logistics based on the Internet and cloud computing
   environment, specifies the challenges and transitions experienced by the
   commodity market, transport market, infrastructure market, then
   discusses several key technologies of IT application in urban freight
   transportation including dynamic regulation of the transport market for
   administrator, ``last mile{''} solutions, coding system and green
   vehicles. Now IT building blocks of digitally free open source software
   not only provide the IT infrastructure but also facilitate ``Share more
   - Develop less{''} for mass innovation convenience of cities. It no
   doubts that an efficient, environmentally friendly and intelligent urban
   freight system will come true in the near future.}},

   `enabling' governance structure. Other options, such as providing a
   level playing field or exploring how and to what extent the intermediary
   liability regime will need to even constrain undesired digital
   behaviour, have hardly been given consideration. The immunities granted
   under the intermediary liability regime have hence successfully enabled
   novel business models and assured freedom of expression on the internet,
   leaving, however, significantly declining investment rates in music an
   unaddressed policy issue. According to estimates of this study, the
   cumulative investments lost in the UK, Germany and France alone amounted
   to up to nearly 4 billion Euro between 2008 and 2014. For the European
   Union, this situation posits a challenge with important ramifications in
   the long run. If Europe continues to lose out on investments in creative
   content, it risks losing its international competitiveness. It is thus
   proposed to revisit the underlying policy rationale of the intermediary
   liability regime and explore what steps are needed to provide a more
   equal level playing field for all types of market participants, be they
   the traditional music industry or novel forms of online intermediaries.}},

Abstract = {{The human being, even if potentially inclined to learn, needs incentives
   to do it effectively. In these context, the virtual environments could
   simulate challenges of clinical practice and, at the same time, consider
   the personal experiences, allows the student's stimulus and also offer
   additional theoretical content updated and of excellent quality. The
   purpose of the project is to develop a Clinical Case Simulation Tool
   (CCST), it's supposed to be a supporter to the acquisition of clinical
   skills for medical education. This is an experimental study of applied
   technology for health education. The project is multidisciplinary
   between health sciences, computing and education. The development of an
   application to store real clinical cases is the starting point of this
   study. The structure of the proposed clinical case comprises the
   description of the case, clinical history, complementary tests,
   questions and further reading. The access to the application is password
   protected, composed of access profiles with specific characteristics
   such as teacher, coordinator, student. All clinical cases are linked to
   a specific college and discipline. The Clinical Cases simulator platform
   was created for storage of clinical cases and to provide technological
   support for preparing courses, workshops and support classroom teaching.
   This may be considered as an innovative approach, given the use of a
   digital system that enables the storage of clinical data and laboratory
   tests, as sounds of cardiac auscultation, pulmonary auscultation, images
   and videos.}},

Abstract = {{When an infrastructure fails prematurely because of poor workmanship,
   the Developer of a Public Private Partnership (P3) project incurs a
   significant cost that typically could have been prevented if a more
   systematic attention to higher risk requirements had of been in place.
   This practice paper will demonstrate how a risk based requirements
   verification system has been applied on a number of major transportation
   P3 projects as a way of addressing just such a problem. By using a total
   digital approach to design review and construction inspection, and by
   applying a systematic risk profiling approach, more and better
   performance verification data can be collected to clearly and
   objectively depict the status of the project. With this approach,
   developers can move beyond just saying they want a high quality project,
   they can actually determine with a measured level of confidence, what
   the level of performance is being observed. A lower level of performance
   is a predictor of possible future failures. The traditional approach of
   describing the scope of a transportation project has been by writing
   text in paragraph format or creating a series of books that read
   somewhat like a novel. The scoping of the work can be greatly improved
   by capturing all the expectations or requirements within a relational
   database structure. With each requirement identified, any number of
   attributes can be related, such as risk, owner, phase, cost, method of
   verification and observed performance. As the design effort is
   completed, the applicable design input requirements can be verified to
   ensure that they have been appropriately incorporates into the design.
   The performance of the design team to meet the requirements when the
   design is reviewed can be measured and the result used to identify areas
   or disciplines that are under-performing. Similarly when the design is
   realized on the worksite, the performance of the construction forces can
   be measured to objectively identify strong performers and
   underperforming efforts. Poor performance can be addressed early in the
   life of the project and not later when the cost impact can be multiple
   times higher.}},

   preparation of systematic, scientific and integrated experimental
   materials, increasing the synthetically designing experiments to
   stimulate the students' enthusiasm. The teaching experiment is divided
   into three different levels, the basic operation experiments, the
   comprehensive experiments and the synthetically designing experiments.
   Make full use of the digital teaching platform to realize the diversity

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of new technologies and new building
   materials, new network floor as a type of new building materials has
   been widely used in ground projects, owing to its wiring flexible,
   simple and practical, easy maintenance, and environmental friendly
   features. However, there are problems in the traditional construction
   process of network floor, like unreasonable arrangement, poor flatness
   and the waste of side plate cutting. To address these issues, this paper
   firstly proposes three innovative technologies for the comprehensive
   control of the implementation of network floor project, including CAD
   secondary typesetting and layout technology, precision laser level
   levelling + shock pads fine tuning technology, and computer code nesting
   of side plate technology. Furthermore, a complete set of construction
   technology processes has been presented. Finally, the economic and
   social benefits of these innovative technologies have been proved by the
   engineering project.}},

Abstract = {{This abstract is an introduction to the next generation of High
   Performance Industrial Manufacturing, through the Industry standard 4.0.
   The fourth Industrial standard is based on advanced Automation and
   Robotics, sensor based computer technology, interconnected by wireless
   communication, and supported by BIG Data solutions. Effective management
   and human cooperation i.e. teamwork and SUM (c) processes will be
   increasingly important in the future. This paper also focuses on the new
   industrial standard in relation to OEE (Overall Equipment
   Effectiveness), Predictive Maintenance and total performance related to
   all equipment in the industrial factory processes. Not a few highly
   automated machines, but the system as whole. OEE is a well-known
   standardized tool for performance measurement throughout the industry.
   In order to utilize data systems as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
   and PLM (engineering systems), they must be integrated with business
   systems. Management normally acts on the bases of facts and financial
   performance. In most companies increased profit is the overall goal.
   Future management systems aim for a fully integrated and automated data
   flow based on advanced sensor technology. Increased use of digital
   systems enables quicker and better decisions. Refers to previous paper
   ``High Performance Innovative teams (IWAMA 2010).}},

Abstract = {{Known to the power industry, there is an increasing functional safety
   need to isolate delicate control systems from the violent world of the
   Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT), which has resulted in a
   growing demand for Digital Isolators. This is where the gate control
   signal for the IGBT can be coupled across a dielectric barrier, while
   the barrier itself is capable of withstanding high working voltages and
   surge events.
   Preventing the formation of a complete integrated system solution for
   the end customer is the fact that while the control signal can be
   coupled across the isolation barrier - the transient power needed to
   drive the IGBT gate cannot. To solve that problem, this paper describes
   the development of an innovative IGBT architecture that targets the
   1200V voltage node, has a first silicon V-CE(SAT) = 2.7V at
   J(C)=10Amm(-l), provides latch-up immunity, and critically has gate
   drive capacitances that are over two orders of magnitude smaller, at
   0.58pF for every Amp of IGBT current, relative to conventional IGBT
   architectures that report values in the range of 70 - 150pFA(-1) at 25
   degrees C. This low input capacitance opens the door for the gate of
   this IGBT to be directly powered by integrated magnetically coupled
   isolation coils. For future work, further optimization of the V-CE(SAT),
   and transient switching times are required.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in 3D printing, sometimes referred to as additive
   manufacturing is considered a game changer relative to rapid
   prototyping. The industrial, military, commercial, aerospace as well as
   the automotive industry have made significant gains due to this
   technology. The 3D printing market is expected to reach \$8.43 billion
   by 2020, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14.37\% from 2014 to
   2020 (1). As in any new technology there are trade-offs and this work
   reports on an approach to optimize or save in power consumption for such
   systems. Because the 3D printing process is focused about producing
   three dimensional (3D) solid objects from a digital file, power
   consumption is an important consideration. This paper presents the
   prototype of a heated platform designed for use in higher-end 3D
   printers. The goal of this prototype was to improve the energy
   efficiency and reduce the power consumption of a 3D printer by employing
   an innovative and validated heating circuitry or platform without
   compromising print quality. For this investigation a 3D printer that has
   a surface component with dimensions of 10in X 10in is selected. As a
   baseline for comparison, the calculated power consumption under standard
   operating conditions is 50W where the source is 12V DC. The paper herein
   expands on key design parameters, presents the preliminary design
   calculations, and describes comparable products researched and
   statistical improvements over those products. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a high power density 2 kW single-phase inverter,
   with greater than 50 W/in(3) power density and 90\% line-cycle average
   efficiency. This performance is achieved through innovations in
   twice-line-frequency (120 Hz) energy buffering and high frequency dc-ac
   power conversion. The energy buffering function is performed using an
   advanced implementation of the recently proposed stacked switched
   capacitor (SSC) energy buffer architecture, and the dc-ac power
   conversion is performed using a soft-switching SiC-FET based converter,
   with a digital implementation of variable frequency constant peak
   current control.}},

Abstract = {{As predicted, intelligent networks with intelligent, wide multi-stage
   parallel processing have become a favorite in new-media applications
   like object-recognition and augmented reality with most recent energy
   efficiencies >1 Tera operations per Watt, 100-times better than
   conventional von-Neumann processors. Some leading companies in video-and
   graphics processors and in computer-aided design (CAD) tools are now
   introducing such products, and the Human-Brain projects enforce this
   long-term strategy. We see a further outgrowth of neural chips into
   networks. Firstly, they will appear in health monitoring for healthy
   living. Non-invasive measurements require time-and space-dependent
   models that are real-time derived from data. The size of complex neural
   systems becomes feasible due to further miniaturization by physical
   innovations like the memristor as well as by novel digital
   architectures. Together, that will provide effects of self-healing, a
   level of dependability required for large-scale distributed intelligent
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The Maker Movement emerged from a renewed interest in the physical side
   of innovation following the dot-com bubble and the rise of the
   participatory Web 2.0 and the decreasing costs of many digital
   fabrication technologies. Classifying concepts, i.e. building
   taxonomies, is a fundamental practice when developing a topic of
   interest into a research field. Taking advantage of the growth of the
   Social Web and participation platforms, this paper suggests a
   multidisciplinary analysis of communications and online behaviors
   related to the Maker community in order to develop a taxonomy informed
   by current practices and ongoing discussions. We analyze a number of
   sources such as Twitter, Wikipedia and Google Trends, applying co-word
   analysis, trend visualizations and emotional analysis. Whereas co-words
   and trends extract structural characteristics of the movement, emotional
   analysis is non-topical, extracting emotional interpretations.}},

Abstract = {{Brachytherapy of local cervical cancer is generally accomplished through
   film-based treatment planning with the prescription directed to point A,
   which is invisible on images and is located at a high-dose gradient
   area. Through a standard reconstruction method by digitizing film
   points, the location error for point A would be 3 mm with a condition of
   30 degrees curvature tandem, which is 10 degrees away from the gantry
   rotation axis of a simulator, and has an 8.7 cm interval between the
   flange and the isocenter. To reduce the location error of the
   reconstructed point A, this paper proposes a method and demonstrates its
   accuracy. The Cartesian coordinates of point A were derived by acquiring
   the locations of the cervical os (tandem flange) and a dummy seed
   located in the tandem above the flange. To verify this analytical
   method, ball marks in a commercial ``Isocentric Beam Checker{''} were
   selected to simulate the two points A, the os, and the dummies. The
   Checker was placed on the simulator couch with its center ball
   coincident with the simulator isocenter and its rotation axis
   perpendicular to the gantry rotation axis. With different combinations
   of the Checker and couch rotation angles, the orthogonal films were shot
   and all coordinates of the selected points were reconstructed through
   the treatment planning system and compared with that calculated through
   the analytical method. The position uncertainty and the deviation
   prediction of point A were also evaluated. With a good choice of the
   reference dummy point, the position deviations of point A obtained
   through this analytical method were found to be generally within 1 mm,
   with the standard uncertainty less than 0.5 mm. In summary, this new
   method is a practical and accurate tool for clinical usage to acquire
   the accurate location of point A for the treatment of cervical cancer
   patient.}},

   activities and modern advanced manufacturing technology, bringing new
   reform opportunities for innovative industrial design of theory and
   methods. The paper constructs the basic knowledge system of industrial
   design engineering and discusses its main contents: the base of modeling
   material, the base of forming process, the base of surface technology
   and the base of digital technology. Finally, it concludes that designers
   should master the basic knowledge of industrial design engineering,
   communicate their design ideas in the design process of transmission of
   information and cultural values properly, rather than making noise in

   new media era, we must innovate the educational ideas and reform the
   teaching mode. In the context of the new media, we should adopt a
   variety of teaching modes, combining classroom teaching and network
   teaching in order to build a new model of Ideological and political
   theory teaching which is comprehensive and open.}},

Abstract = {{Organizations working to protect the health and wellbeing of children in
   emergencies are moving away from traditional paper-based systems towards
   more sophisticated and innovative digitally-based systems. Formative
   research was conducted to identify the state of the current evidence
   base on the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for
   child protection case management in emergencies (CPCME). Most of the
   evidence is from the grey literature, and the sector is still nascent in
   linking ICT implementations to improvements in efficiencies of case
   management processes and outcomes in children. However, our preliminary
   findings, gleaned mostly from key informant interviews and reports,
   strongly suggest that using certain ICT applications can have a
   beneficial influence on reducing children's vulnerabilities and other
   key outcomes in emergency settings. The preliminary findings form the
   basis for currently ongoing subsequent research that will ultimately
   inform how ICT for CPCME can best contribute to improved outcomes in
   children in such settings. While there are challenges in the design,
   implementation, evaluation, and enabling environment to support ICT for
   CPCME that limit their potential impact, each challenge presents an
   opportunity for child protection programs to consider as the use of ICT
   for CPCME increases and matures over the next few years. (C) 2016 The

   event in the history of live sport mega events. A case study of the 2012
   London Olympics was used to demonstrate how effective management of
   innovations in (a) collaborative information and communication
   technology (ICT) and (b) social media marketing (SMM) ushered in a new
   platform template for live sport events worldwide. A review of the
   literature revealed four primary factors responsible: (1) the foresight,
   planning, due diligence, and management effectiveness of the Olympic
   Delivery Authority (ODA), London Organising Committee for the Olympic
   and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) and their technology partners; (2) the
   confluence of dramatically increased mobile device use and social media
   engagement by prosumers; (3) the willingness of sponsors, marketers, and
   global media enterprises to take risks with innovative media and SMM
   strategies; and (4) the enthusiasm and passion for sport of prosumers
   worldwide.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{In the past two decades, a significant number of innovative sensing and
   monitoring systems based on the machine vision-based technology have
   been exploited in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM). This
   technology has some inherent distinctive advantages such as noncontact,
   nondestructive, long distance, high precision, immunity to
   electromagnetic interference, and large-range and multiple-target
   monitoring. A lot of machine vision-based structural dynamic measurement
   and structural state inspection methods have been proposed. Real-world
   applications are also carried out to measure the structural physical
   parameters such as the displacement, strain/stress, rotation, vibration,
   crack, and spalling. The purpose of this review article is devoted to
   presenting a summary of the basic theories and practical applications of
   the machine vision-based technology employed in structural monitoring as
   well as its systematic error sources and integration with other modern
   sensing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Energy saving in building construction is an actual problem and it is
   central to the debate. In order to ensure low energy consumption of a
   building, the global building thermal resistance and the airtightness
   were enhanced until ``overinsulated{''} buildings and air permeability
   of the entire building envelope (opaque surfaces and windows) was
   reduced. In this way, moisture loads and surface condensations are
   favoured and ideal conditions for the proliferation of microorganisms
   arise. Innovative techniques for biofouling prevention include the
   application of nano-coatings able to destruct bond between cells of
   microorganisms and substrata. The most used nano-material is TiO2
   because of its non-toxicity, photo-chemical stability and low cost. In
   this chapter, biofouling on brick substrata was presented, and the
   inhibitory effect of TiO2 was studied as an alternative method to
   traditional maintenance intervention. Biofouling was measured through
   time by digital image analysis and colorimetric measurements. Results
   show TiO2 was able to inhibit algal adhesion, and TiO2 efficiency is
   strictly related to physical properties of substrata like porosity and
   roughness.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents a comprehensive view of 3D printing technologies
   and their evolution. Additionally, it provides a Nordic perspective on
   the topic by summarizing project based research conducted in Finland.
   Expert interviews and research data extracted from case studies are
   analysed to cover topical areas on additive manufacturing
   transferability. The contribution of this research is to combine
   industry case research with expert interviews, and finally present
   recommendations to promote technology transfer.
   The synthesis of the presented cases allowed us to conclude that
   additive manufacturing will offer greater possibilities in applications
   when: (1) innovation and design processes need to be enhanced, (2)
   customization is an advantage, (3) supply chain needs to be flexible,
   simplified or compressed, (4) material usage and inventories need to be
   reduced, (5) energy usage and waste in manufacturing have to be
   minimized and (6) product performance has to be optimized.
   In consequence, to promote technology adoption and competitive advantage
   in companies policy actions should be focused on increasing input for
   innovation and R\&D, improving and increasing the supply of skill as
   well as generating and exploiting the connections and complementarities
   of country-specific academia, research institutions, industrial clusters
   and funding bodies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a case study from a high-tech manufacturing
   company in Norway. The project was a close collaboration between
   managers and engineers from the R\&D department in an industrial tool
   manufacturer and a cross disciplinary team of researchers from an
   independent research institute and a university. The overall aim of the
   project was to revitalize and improve the manufacturer's innovation
   culture by focusing on real design challenges the R\&D department had to
   solve. Throughout an action research project, new innovation approaches
   and tools for collaboration and knowledge sharing were introduced to the
   company. The participants' reflections on their own individual and
   collective praxis were point of departure for a digital demonstrator of
   innovation culture. The overall aim of the research project was to a)
   investigate critical elements of what constitutes innovation culture in
   a Norwegian manufacturing company and b) to develop and distribute these
   elements as ICT-based learning histories in a web-based demonstrator.
   The evaluation of the research project concludes that innovation tools
   and approaches implemented in the company through the action research
   project increased the momentum in the development work. Still,
   disruptive innovation can easily be slowed down by practical challenges
   and changes in priorities. In addition, developing a digital
   demonstrator was a resource demanding process. It was evaluated by the
   company, but could not be implemented. Nevertheless, by developing the
   demonstrator the researchers analyzed the company's innovation culture
   from diverse perspectives and discussed a broad range of topics with
   company representatives.}},

   widely used in ceiling projects, owing to its concise, applicable, and
   environmental friendly features. However, there are problems in the
   construction process of integrated band, like large assembly gap, poor

   firstly proposes three innovative technologies for the comprehensive
   control of the implementation of ceiling project, including the
   three-dimensional digital typesetting technology of pipeline +
   integrated band + aluminous gusset plate, multi-directional cross line
   laser location \& check technology, and overall lifting \& unified
   adjustment technology. Furthermore, a complete set of construction
   technology processes has been presented. Finally, the economic and
   social benefits of these innovative technologies have been proved by the

   THROUGH ALTERNATIVE TEXTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{69-83}},
Abstract = {{This chapter provides an overview of an innovative approach that two
   instructors developed to use digital storytelling by pairing an
   Instructional Technology graduate course with another graduate course
   that focused on popular culture in social education during two
   subsequent fall semesters. The processes used by the instructors in this
   collaboration are described and results of the students' work are also
   presented and discussed. The focus is the merging of technology and
   alternative instructional texts to enhance content knowledge in social
   education. \{/ABS\} For the past several years, students and faculty
   members at the University of Houston College of Education have been
   exploring the educational uses of digital storytelling through a variety
   of undergraduate and graduate courses offered through the College of
   Education's Instructional Technology Program (Robin \& Pierson, 2005).
   In addition, a website titled The Educational Uses of Digital
   Storytelling has been established, which provides an introduction to
   digital storytelling, educational goals and objectives, tutorials to
   help users get started, evaluation materials for educators, and a large
   number of example stories. There are numerous ways that digital
   storytelling can be used as an effective teaching and learning tool.
   Educators can create their own stories as a way to present new material
   to students, enhance and contextualize content, or facilitate
   discussions. Digital storytelling can also be a potent tool for students
   who create their own stories. The process can capitalize on the creative
   talents of students as they begin to research and tell stories of their
   own, as they learn to use the library and the Internet to explore rich,
   deep content while analyzing and synthesizing a wide range of
   information. Students who create their own digital stories develop
   enhanced communication skills by learning to organize their ideas, ask
   questions, express opinions, and construct narratives. As they learn to
   create stories for an audience, the process allows them to present their
   ideas and knowledge in an individual and meaningful way. Ohler (2006)
   suggests that the process of creating a digital story helps students
   ``tap skills and talents in art, media production, storytelling, project
   development{''} and that ``helps students become active participants
   rather than passive consumers in a society saturated with media.{''}
   These concepts were used as the foundation for our approach in merging
   technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge in social education, but
   also how to connect the stories to personal and educational themes that
   are important to each student.}},

   geology to oceanography in order to demonstrate new and innovative SAR
   techniques. In the following years the bistatic formation will be used
   to acquire data to generate DEMs with even higher resolution and further
   improved relative high accuracy on local areas. In addition, temporally
   independent updates of parts of the global DEM will be provided. This
   paper gives an overview of the DEM acquisition status together with the
   plans for the upcoming years of the mission.}},

Abstract = {{In the domain of developing production systems, the design of a good
   factory is typically distributed over many disciplines and organizations
   to cover all involved technologies and levels of detail (process,
   logistics, machinery etc.). Modelling and simulation used to support the
   design process within each of the disciplines typically represent
   different contexts and perspectives. To cross the discipline borders and
   share experiences, to encourage innovation and make holistic decisions,
   one challenge is to interrelate various digital models and to reach a
   mutual system understanding between stakeholders.
   This paper presents a study based on principles from Social Science,
   Production Engineering, Computer Science and Information Design to
   address cross-disciplinary collaboration. Principles concerning visual
   communication and theories in regard to tangible boundary objects are
   used to clarify how to describe production system interdependencies in a
   digital factory context. Work in process of implementing a digital
   factory framework based on the principles is described, with a use case
   demonstrating the development of a digital factory for a new type of
   automotive vehicle. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The manufacturing sector is at the core of the American economy. With
   American leadership in advanced manufacturing at risk due to changes in
   the global economy and new competitors rising across the globe, the U.S.
   President announced an investment of \$ 1 billion in a National Network
   for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI). The key focus is on new technology
   paradigms that can improve the competitiveness of American manufacturing
   - with a focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) - through
   digitization of design and manufacturing, democratization of technology,
   and collaborative design and analytics to sustain leadership across the
   U.S. manufacturing ecosystem.
   Funded through the newly established Digital Manufacturing and Design
   Innovation Institute and supported through a Cooperative Agreement with
   the Department of Defense, the Digital Manufacturing Commons ( DMC) is
   an open-source platform based on previous Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology (MIT), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and
   General Electric (GE) projects and built to democratize development and
   access to the tools for manufacturing innovation across small and large
   companies, universities, institutes, and entrepreneurs. The DMC will
   bring together one hundred thousand or more users, thousands of SMEs,
   large manufacturing companies, and universities to collaborate on
   manufacturing and to accelerate technologies that integrate the digital
   thread from design to manufacture and service.
   The initiative to build the DMC is led by GE Global Research Center. The
   DMC will be transitioned to the Digital Manufacturing and Design
   Innovation Institute and made available to the U.S. manufacturing base
   to enable a digital revolution in manufacturing innovation.}},

   that redefines the role of a teacher. The project involved 100 teachers
   at all grades across Italy, who contributed to the implementation of a
   formerly developed methodology (called IDEActivity) enabling the
   delivery of innovation across different contexts. The methodology and
   its toolkit has been applied into the project and eventually shared
   online with other teachers in Italy. The final outcome is a co-designed
   guide that takes inspiration from design approach and techniques to be
   used for planning and implementing learning activities in class.}},

   Information and the Department of History at the University of Michigan,
   and Alexander Monea, doctoral candidate in the Communication, Rhetoric,
   and Digital Media program at North Carolina State University, Edwards
   addresses several concerns related to the history and critical analysis
   of media and technology. In particular, Edwards discusses archival
   methodology and interdisciplinarity in media studies, theories of
   technological momentum and infrastructural innovation, the political
   stakes of historiographic inquiry in terms of media and technology, the
   importance of the work of Michel Foucault, and the production of the
   self or subjectivization. He also discusses the contemporary
   implications of his earlier work on the history of computation and more
   recent work on climate science.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Evasive entrepreneurs innovate by circumventing or disrupting
   existing formal institutional frameworks. Since such evasions rarely go
   unnoticed, they usually lead to responses from lawmakers and regulators.
   The paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors introduce a conceptual model
   to illustrate and map the interdependencey between evasive
   entrepreneurship and the regulatory response it provokes. The authors
   apply this framework to the case of the file sharing platform The Pirate
   Bay, a venture with a number of clearly innovative and evasive features.
   Findings - The platform was a radical, widely applied innovation that
   transformed the internet landscape, yet its founders became convicted
   criminals because of it.
   Originality/value - Applying the evasive entrepreneurship framework to
   this case improves the understanding of the relationship between
   policymaking and entrepreneurship in the digital age, and is a first
   step toward exploring best responses for regulators facing evasive
   entrepreneurship.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of smart mobile devices presents increasing opportunities for
   health monitoring outside the clinic. Through the use of sensors and
   wearables, innovative Connected Health applications can be developed. In
   particular, Digital Therapeutics (DT), a type of technology-enabled
   intervention, can be made possible through continuous data capture,
   aiding users through gaining feedback on their lifestyle choices and
   engagement with programs of recovery, and supplementing conventional
   treatments for chronic disease management such as diabetes, epilepsy,
   and mental health. Unfortunately, patient-facing professionals capable
   of articulating appropriate sensor-enabled solutions, generally lack the
   full range of skills to develop such systems. A connected health
   application may involve mobile development, data services,
   visualisation, machine learning, and sensor signal processing, needing
   multidisciplinary teams, including professional software engineers. The
   cost of maintaining a software team across the research and development
   stages may prove prohibitive for many, hindering innovation. This paper
   focuses on gathering requirements for data collection in mHealth
   studies, and reports the initial findings after a round of interviews
   with researchers in areas such as psychology, physiotherapy, neurology,
   and health promotion education. Those requirements are framed within an
   existing End User Development (EUD) tool to create mobile apps for the
   Android platform, the open source project MIT App Inventor. The survey
   results highlight not only the development work needed for App Inventor
   to be used as a data collection tool in DT, but also a number of
   potential security and privacy issues, and the implementation of a
   layered feedback loop with a social aspect at the heart of it.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on theories in organizational sociology that argue that
   transpositions of people,/ skills, and knowledge across domains give
   rise to innovations and organizational foundings that institutionalize
   them, we conducted a mixed-methods study of the employment biographies
   of staffers working in technology, digital, data, and analytics on
   American presidential campaigns, and the rates of organizational
   founding by these staffers, from the 2004 through the 2012 electoral
   cycles. Using Federal Election Commission and LinkedIn data, we trace
   the professional biographies of staffers (N=629) working in technology,
   digital, data, or analytics on primary and general election presidential
   campaigns during this period. We found uneven professionalization in
   these areas, defined in terms of staffers moving from campaign to
   campaign or from political organizations to campaigns, with high rates
   of new entrants to the field. Democrats had considerably greater numbers
   of staffers in the areas of technology, digital, data, and analytics and
   from the technology industry, and much higher rates of organizational
   founding. We present qualitative data drawn from interviews with
   approximately 60 practitioners to explain how the institutional
   histories of the two parties and their extended networks since 2004
   shaped the presidential campaigns during the 2012 cycle and their
   differential uptake of technology, digital, data, and analytics.}},

Abstract = {{Digitization of governmental systems and services do still not seize the
   opportunities that e-governance offer. The transformation is often
   fragmented and the digital services seldom integrate the government
   horizontally and vertically. This paper discusses how governments can
   benefit from a holistic approach to digitization of services. The paper
   explores the possibility of exploiting service design and user-centric
   approaches, when innovating government-to-citizen and
   government-to-business services. With a case from a Norwegian
   governmental agency, the paper shows when and why service design can be
   implemented in digitization of government. Findings shed light on
   problems that are unique for the digital transformation of governmental
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in information technology triggered a digital revolution that
   holds promise of reduced costs, improved productivity, and higher
   quality. To ride this wave of innovation, manufacturing enterprises are
   changing how product definitions are communicated from paper to models.
   To achieve industry's vision of the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE), the
   MBE strategy must include model-based data interoperability from design
   to manufacturing and quality in the supply chain. The Model-Based
   Definition (MBD) is created by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
   using Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools. This information is then shared
   with the supplier so that they can manufacture and inspect the physical
   parts. Today, suppliers predominantly use Computer Aided Manufacturing
   (CAM) and Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) models for these tasks.
   Traditionally, the OEM has provided design data to the supplier in the
   form of two-dimensional (2D) drawings, but may also include a
   three-dimensional (3D)-shape-geometry model, often in a standards based
   format such as ISO 10303-203:2011 (STEP AP203). The supplier then
   creates the respective CAM and CMM models and machine programs to
   produce and inspect the parts. In the MBE vision for model-based data
   exchange, the CAD model must include product-and-manufacturing
   information (PMI) in addition to the shape geometry. Today's CAD tools
   can generate models with embedded PMI. And, with the emergence of STEP
   AP242, a standards-based model with embedded PMI can now be shared
   downstream.
   The on-going research detailed in this paper seeks to investigate three
   concepts. First, that the ability to utilize a STEP AP242 model with
   embedded PM! for CAD-to-CAM and CAD-to-CMM data exchange is possible and
   valuable to the overall goal of a more efficient process. Second, the
   research identifies gaps in tools, standards, and processes that inhibit
   industry's ability to cost-effectively achieve model-based-data
   interoperability in the pursuit of the MBE vision. Finally, it also
   seeks to explore the interaction between CAD and CMM processes and
   determine if the concept of feedback from CAM and CMM back to CAD is
   feasible. The main goal of our study is to test the hypothesis that
   model-based-data interoperability from CAD-to-CAM and CAD-to-CMM is
   feasible through standards-based integration. This paper presents
   several barriers to model-based-data interoperability. Overall, the
   project team demonstrated the exchange of product definition data
   between CAD, CAM, and CMM systems using standards based methods. While
   gaps in standards coverage were identified, the gaps should not stop
   industry's progress toward MBE. The results of our study provide
   evidence in support of an open-standards method to model-based-data
   interoperability, which would provide maximum value and impact to
   industry.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with technological determinants of the lifetime social
   well-being, as conditions of maintaining the level and style of
   consumption, social status throughout the whole life. Despite the high
   importance of the problem of the social well-being and the relevance of
   its solution for the development of modern society, the issues of its
   correlation with the technological level of production and the
   development of information technologies are still poorly researched. As
   the problem of the life-time wellbeing take on special significance, it
   is important to analyze its conditions, related not only to social
   benefits, but also to the scientific and technological progress. For the
   future innovation and the digital stage of social well-being is its
   network well-being. It is based on the usage of the Internet for
   professional activity and personal self-fulfillment during the whole
   conscious life. Network well-being also reflects the convergence of
   information and network, industrial, financial, marketing, and social
   technologies. The formation of the life-time network well-being requires
   from the Government some measures of social adjustment, fiscal policy
   and the regulation of employment to encourage Internet Education and
   Internet employment, enhancing the prestige of working in high-tech
   industries.}},

Abstract = {{The inherent possibilities of composites present an exciting frontier in
   architecture that has remained largely untapped. In light of the current
   computational capacities and new digital tools in manufacturing,
   composites are just beginning to re-situate themselves in the field of
   architecture. Efficiency and durability coupled with a load bearing
   capacity make a strong case for the use of composites as a primary
   building material.
   We now possess the computational and digital manufacturing tools that
   make the development of a composite building viable. On a holistic
   level, the research has concerned itself with an overarching focus on
   developing a composite building which minimizes the required costs and
   labor while simultaneously creating the potential for customized forms.
   Based on the concepts of mass customization, when the workflow from
   digital conception to digital production is seamless, a variety of
   composite structures can be produced at no greater expense. This
   potential for an efficient ``one off{''} composite architecture
   empowered by digital manufacturing and computation, is where the
   research is positioned.
   At present, the research has been focused on exploring surface composite
   structures through a reinvention of the `mold'. This approach has
   involved using inflated bladders, rather than traditional molds of
   milled foam or aluminum in order to produce composite structures. In
   doing so, the benefits of inflatables are all encompassing. Not only do
   they allow for inexpensive transportation and rapid deployment, but they
   also lend themselves to the production of large scale structures through
   the simple use of air and pressure, thus minimizing both material and
   effort. This lies in stark contrast to traditional composite
   manufacturing techniques which require molds to be milled out of solid
   aluminum blocks or high density foam volumes, whereas inflatable molds
   are easily heat sealed and inflated. When considering issues of
   scalability, traditional molding techniques demand significantly more
   labor, material, and with that, overarching costs. Inflatable molds
   however, require only more air.
   Coupled with the rethinking of molding techniques is a consideration in
   the technological methodologies in order to produce such composite
   structures. The research looks to the new developments in the composite
   industry, such as Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) and Vacuum Assisted Resin
   Transfer Molding (VARTM). These processes greatly simplify the
   manufacturing of composites and eliminate much of the manual labor
   traditionally associated with composite structures. By taking advantage
   of the existing vacuum bag used for compaction while producing
   composites, the VARTM process pulls resin through the bag under vacuum
   pressure, thus wetting out the fibers and eliminating typical layup
   deficiencies while producing a nearly weightless composite structure.

Abstract = {{Geological Surveys are faced with budget constraints and calls for
   efficiency gains; the effective application of digital techniques is
   often seen as a route to meeting these demands while increasing the
   value of outcrop studies and reducing the inherent subsurface
   uncertainty. The British Geological Survey may be the oldest national
   Survey in the world (established in 1835); however, developing and
   implementing new, innovative and efficient technologies for fieldwork is
   a high priority. Efficient tools for capturing, integrating,
   manipulating and disseminating outcrop data and information are
   imperative to enable geoscientists to increase their understanding of
   geological processes and therefore to reduce subsurface uncertainty and
   risk. Systems for capturing structured digital field data and for
   visualizing and interacting with large datasets are increasingly being
   utilized by geoscientists in the UK and internationally. Augmented
   reality and unmanned aerial vehicles are amongst the developing
   technologies being explored for future operational implementation. This
   paper describes the digital field mapping (BGS. SIGMAmobile) and
   visualization (GeoVisionary) systems and refers to a case study
   outlining their contribution to reducing uncertainty and risk in
   hydrocarbon exploration.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2012 a Parallel Virtual Urban Workshop (PVW) has been developed at
   the Department of Urban and Regional Planning (School of Architecture of
   Madrid, UPM). It was created by a group of professors in the framework
   of the Postgraduate Program. In 2014 this project became a consolidated
   Group of Educational Innovation called Urban Net-Working Workshop
   supported by the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UNWW-UPM). The
   initial targets of this workshop were: (i) improving international
   cooperation among academic institutions based on a virtual network, (ii)
   the implementation of a quasi-professional practice approach on urban
   regeneration projects and (iii) the development of a comprehensive
   methodology to manage complex urban issues in diverse urban contexts. Up
   until today, there have been five workshops: in 2012, a joint workshop
   between UPM (Madrid) and MIT (Boston); in 2013 and 2014, a collaborative
   workshop between UPM (Madrid) and UCL (London); in 2015, between UPM
   (Madrid) and KNG (London); currently, a parallel workshop is in progress
   between UPM (Madrid) and AF (Zagreb). Even though, every edition of the
   Urban Parallel Workshop has been rather unique, it can be asserted that
   initial targets have been overcome throughout successive workshops. ITCs
   and digitals tools have been gradually incorporated. (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{The world largest cities central parts do not have a homogenous
   structure due to the factors determining an urban growth and
   development. The variety of function, their density and concentration in
   the central part of the city within social, economic, political,
   cultural and other factors stimulated a rapid urbanisation and urban
   transformations. Transformations in urban design are not a new
   phenomenon, rather than a continuous process. Over the past 50 years'
   cities have changed incomparably. The aim of this paper is to discuss
   crucial transformations of urban functions and technological factors
   influencing urban functional mutations based on the outcomes of research
   carried out in the largest Lithuanian cities in the period between 1960
   and 2011. The research was done concerning the development of a method
   for determining an urban function transformation. In this paper, the
   main focus is on the development of new technologies, economy,
   globalisation, lifestyle, etc., which along with planning system and
   ongoing urban process have generated a great variety of urban
   development conditions. The research empirical methodology reveals the
   sensitivity of the functions at macro scale, their typology and
   allocation in the city reveals the character and correlation degree
   between the functions. Hence, the existing city structures are becoming
   complicated. Digital technology dissemination through various human
   activities impact human behaviour, the way how they use and live in
   cities. However, technological factors by themselves do not result
   innovations, but trying to meet the residence need, cities structures
   become complicated. As a result, new hybrid morphological types emerge
   misbalancing the urban functional system and fabric. Therefore, this may
   require a rethinking of the identification guidance and form the
   regulatory corresponding strategies for this phenomenon. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{The present paper presents the opportunities to elaborate a personalized
   and interactive content for teaching-learning-self assessment and
   assessment, with the help of a Moodle platform-the Lesson. The paper is
   a mini-tutorial to present the main steps which must be taken to create
   a lesson. The presentation of the facilities of this digital instrument
   ensures the understanding of the necessity and of the utility of the
   elaboration of a Moodle lesson as didactic material which motivates the
   students to do individual study. The simplicity of the creation of such
   a didactic resource means, for the teachers, an argument and a challenge
   to capitalize their own methodical creativity. The Moodle lesson is,
   practically, a succession of html pages easy to fill in with information
   and contents enriched with explanation videos, links to different
   virtual sources, practical use and self-assessment tests drawn up with
   the help of Wiris application, which are necessary for the facilitation
   of the understanding and of the assimilation of the subject/theme
   proposed to the students for study. In the paper it is presented the
   Moodle lesson which was offered in the virtual environment, for
   individual study, as an innovative method of the Flipped classroom
   teaching method - a flip-flop classroom. In the last part of the paper
   there are capitalized two of the advantages of using the Moodle lesson
   in the teaching process: the responsibility given to the pupils in what
   regards the handling of the understanding process and the assimilation
   of the transmitted information, the identification of the cognitive
   strategies of their consolidation through the insertion of explanatory
   exercises correlated with previously acquired knowledge or in the study

Abstract = {{Advancements in manufacturing technologies allow to integrate an ever
   increasing amount of functionality into single System on Chip devices
   (SoCs). This not only causes the well-known productivity gap, it also
   challenges the proper verification of these designs. While the
   efficiency of pre-silicon verification of purely digital designs is
   continuously increased, either by the use of sophisticated Hardware
   Verification Languages (HVLs) or with powerful software suites, there is
   a lack of applicable concepts for mixed-signal designs. Furthermore,
   pre- and post-silicon verification activities are still often treated
   separately preventing to exploit possible synergies. For these reasons
   there is a great need for new innovative mixed-signal verification
   methods and flows that are able to cope with a soaring amount of
   functionality further aggravated by a shrinking time-to-market.
   This paper presents an approach to use abstract test descriptions
   written in Perl (1) to increase the efficiency of the verification
   process of complex mixed-signal SoCs designs in a SystemC simulation
   environment and (2) to enable information exchange between pre- and
   post-silicon activities. Since Perl and SystemC are distinct languages
   several approaches to link them together were elaborated and are
   presented in this paper. Their suitability with respect to several key
   aspects is compared and their effectiveness for pre-silicon verification
   is evaluated on the basis of an example test case.}},

Abstract = {{For the traditional processing tasks of underwater data analysis system,
   including finite impulse response filter banks, fast Fourier transform,
   conventional beamforming and target tracking, the algorithm flow is
   relatively steady with little alternative control, which is to say that
   it is highly parallel. Besides that, the processing tasks need to deal
   with enormous data, which means great computational burden and high
   arithmetic intensity. But fortunately is that they have fewer
   requirements in computational precision. According to the significant
   features above-mentioned, it is convinced that an innovational data
   analysis system processing framework for underwater target detection
   would come into being, with sufficient capacity utilization of one type
   of processing devices, the programmable graphic processor unit (GPU).
   For the past few years, the GPU has developed into one type of devices
   with more generalized processing capability, which used to be a
   specialized device for graphic processing. Possessing the
   characteristics of many-core and high bandwidth, the modern GPU is able
   to parallelly operate tens of thousands of light-weighted threads, which
   implies enormous processing capacity. From the above we can see that the
   GPU is especially appropriate for handling issues of great computational
   burden and high arithmetic intensity. This paper adopts an innovative
   data analysis system processing framework for underwater target
   detection, comprehensively utilizing CPU and GPU, and implements the
   real-time signal analysis and processing for 160-channel data recorded
   from one towed array in marine experiment, demonstrating the feasibility
   of the framework in underwater target detection and tracking.}},

Abstract = {{The wide variation in process parameters now being observed in advanced
   semiconductor processes can sometimes cause the electrical impact of
   subtle manufacturing defects on observed signals during post
   manufacturing tests to remain within the acceptable range set to ensure
   viable manufacturing yields, thereby masking defect detection. Such
   undetected manufacturing flaws can potentially cause functional failure
   under inputs and/or operating conditions not tested during test; they
   can also behave as latent reliability defects that ``grow{''} over time
   to cause early life failure. Test methodologies that target the
   ``zero-defect{''} product quality requirements being pushed by
   automotive and an increasing number of other applications must address
   such test escapes by using innovative statistical methods and adaptive
   testing because of the prohibitive costs of extensive functional and
   stress/burn-in testing of all parts. The basic idea here is similar to
   ``zero-defect{''} security screening at airports: parts that pass the
   initial tests but appear to be ``suspect{''} is some respect are
   separated out for more extensive tests. Also, additional specialized
   tests are adaptively added to the test flow to target the suspected
   failure mode; this requires both the feeding forward and feeding back of
   results from different stages of the testing process. A few seriously
   suspect but passing parts may even be discarded outright to ensure
   quality, if the resulting yield loss is acceptable.
   Advanced statistical screening methods fall into two broad categories:
   those that exploit the statistics of defect distribution on wafers -
   e.g. passing die in ``bad{''} wafer neighborhoods are suspect parts; and
   those that exploit the correlation in performance parameters in lots and
   wafers - passing die that are performance outliers relative to matched
   parts are suspect. This tutorial presents screening methodologies that
   span both these categories, for both digital and analog parts. We
   illustrate their effectiveness using results from a number of published
   experimental studies on production circuits from IBM, Intel, LSI Logic,
   NXP Semiconductors, and MediaTek. The examples discussed focus on
   studies where the tests target classical stuck-at faults, as well as
   IDDQ testing, TDF and path delay timing tests, and also the newly
   introduced cell aware fault models.
   Recently, adaptive test methods have been more broadly defined to also
   include test time reduction techniques based on dynamic test reordering,
   adaptive scan shift frequency selection for each die, etc. The benefits
   and challenges of employing these methods are also discussed.
   Several new companies have emerged targeting the ``Adaptive Test{''}
   space in recent years. Their commercial offerings are also presented and
   discussed. Broadly, these aim to provide the software infrastructure and
   tools needed to support the feed forward and feedback sharing of results
   from the different test insertions in the test flow for effective test
   adaptation and optimization. These test results are then utilized by
   customizable templates to generate automated test selection algorithms
   that can dynamically apply the most effective test at each test
   insertion/stage in the test flow, and also perform statistical binning
   once all testing is complete.}},

Abstract = {{The canopy height is an important parameter in aboveground biomass
   estimation. Lidar remote sensing from airborne or satellite platforms,
   has a unique capability for forestry applications. This study introduces
   an innovative concept to estimate canopy height using CALIOP two
   wavelengths lidar measurements. One main advantage is that the concept
   proposed here is dependent on the penetration depths at two wavelengths
   without making assumption about the last peak of waveform as the ground
   location, and it does not require the ancillary Digital Elevation Model
   (DEM) data in order to obtain the slope information of terrain.
   Canopy penetration depths at two wavelengths indicate moderately strong
   relationships for estimating the canopy height. Results show that the
   CALIOP-derived canopy heights were highly correlated with the
   ICESat/GLAS-derived values with a mean RMSE of 3.4 m and correlation
   coefficient (R) of 0.89. Our findings present a relationship between the
   penetration difference and canopy height, which can be used as another
   metrics for canopy height estimation, except the full waveforms.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, people's news consumption has become increasingly
   fragmented over different devices, news sources and, especially with the
   advent of mobile technologies, different situational contexts. This
   renders a growing part of our (news) media consumption very volatile,
   even transparent. Journalism scholars are compelled to expand the
   existing methodological toolset at their disposal if they hope to grasp
   news audiences' changing practices. This article investigates the lines
   along which such a toolset should be conceived. As the digitisation of
   media and journalism challenges our understanding of news audiences, the
   article opens by paying considerable attention to the conceptual
   underpinning of news audiences by revisiting the notion of audience
   activity in the light of evolving news use practices. This reflection
   results in an integrated conceptualisation of the term ``audience
   activity{''}, which in turn makes out a case for adopting ``news
   users{''} as a more versatile concept to denote people engaging with
   news. Subsequently, this article addresses how such a more encompassing
   notion of news users can shape new topical and methodological directions
   in news audience studies. The article concludes by exploring the current
   advancements in modular online time use surveys as an illustration of a
   data-gathering method combining traditional techniques with digital
   tools to study news users as they cross different devices, platforms,
   sources and contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of technological, organizational, and societal change
   constitutes a highly dynamic and complex research setting for Digital
   Journalism Studies, calling for process-oriented and inclusive research
   perspectives. At the same time, journalistic organizations have to
   generate sustainable innovativeness and creativity to remain relevant in
   these times of change. Action research offers a framework for research
   collaborations between scholars and practitioners, generating holistic
   and solution-oriented outcomes of value for science and practice. With
   the clear intention to induce change, action research starts with the
   reflection on practice with a view to improving it. This article argues
   for more action research in Digital Journalism Studies, elaborating on
   the opportunities for science and practice. A current action research
   project in Switzerland is introduced and evaluated to give an impression
   of this research culture. The remaining challenges derived from
   experiences in this project are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Charged to innovate, digital news organizations are creating
   intrapreneurial units by embedding startups within the newsroom. While
   these in-house innovation labs are intended to infuse experimentation
   and creativity across the newsroom, several barriers exist toward their
   success. This exploratory research, which features 20 in-depth
   interviews with news innovation leaders in the United States and Canada,
   examines how news intrapreneurship interfaces with three qualities of
   managerial change: newsroom leadership, organizational culture and
   innovation speed. Because of the bureaucratic nature of newsroom
   authority, ideas created in the intrapreneurial unit are ultimately
   isolated from the lifeblood of the broader news organization. The
   findings identify three layers of tension (executive, practitioner and
   internal) existing within the newsroom's organizational structure that
   limits the spread of ideas developed within intrapreneurial units.}},

   critique in Borderland}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL JOURNALISM}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{462-477}},
Abstract = {{This article argues that though loosely configured and encapsulating a
   variety of approaches, the ``slow journalism{''} movement offers a
   useful set of techniques and tools for critiquing the way print and
   television news currently represents the US-Mexico border. Working
   against the sensationalism and lack of introspection in contemporary
   news media, slow journalism advocates champion projects that focus on
   developing innovative techniques for providing deeper coverage of social
   issues. Drawing on Borderland: Dispatches from the US-Mexico Border, a
   multimedia collaboration launched by National Public Radio's (NPR)
   Morning Edition staff and the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR)
   in 2014, I will address the interaction between two complementary
   ``slow{''} strategies: an ethnographic strategy that draws heavily on
   extensive interviews with individuals whose everyday lives are affected
   by border issues and an analytical strategy featuring visualizations
   created by processing large datasets related to annual seizure figures,
   ownership information, and demographics of border crossers Drawing on
   content analyses of newspapers and television programs on the US-Mexico
   border, in-depth interviews with staff members from NPR and the CIR, and
   a visual/textual analysis of the Borderland website, I hope to advance a
   strategy that incorporates multiple genres of journalistic coverage
   together in order to deepen and sharpen news' investigative potential.}},

Abstract = {{This study maps the emerging digital media landscape of online-native
   news sites in Latin America, interrogating to what extent these sites
   challenge mainstream, traditional journalism. Researchers identified and
   analyzed the region's online-native sites, exploring their influence and
   ``alternativeness{''}-in terms of ownership, funding, content, degree of
   activism, and organizational goals-and their ``digital-ness,{''} in
   terms of the sites' inclusion of multimedia, interactive, and
   participatory digital features. In general, results show that the most
   influential online-native sites are attempting to renovate traditional,
   outdated modes of journalism, serving as alternatives to mainstream
   media and aiming to change society, even if the sites do not necessarily
   self-identify as ``alternative{''} per se. Their emphasis on using
   innovative, digital techniques is important for re-conceptualizing not
   just the role of journalism in a digital era, but also journalism's
   relationship to alternative media and activism.}},

Abstract = {{Badminton is a sport that combines several different physical aspects.
   At a professional level, the sport demands excellent fitness criteria
   namely the player's aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed as well as
   precision. This study fundamentally entails the development of an
   innovative training system that incorporates technology that could
   improve the athlete's performance. Although existing motion tracking
   technology can provide reliable and accurate tracking results,
   nonetheless, the product cost and complexity keeps them away from being
   employed in most sports. This investigation involves the comparison
   between Kinect Technology and inertial measurement unit (IMU). The
   kinematic movement of the arm from wrist until shoulder was observed in
   this study for the purpose of investigating the difference between the
   acceleration of skeleton detected by the Kinect motion tracking and a
   low-cost IMU. The results obtained were found to be promising, and it is
   important in enabling pattern recognition of different badminton strokes
   in the next stage of the study. The movement of the right-hand wrist is
   tracked by Microsoft Kinect that can track the skeleton of the player
   whilst the IMU that measures the acceleration is attached at the
   right-hand wrist. Although the acceleration of the wrist may readily be
   obtained from the IMU, the acceleration from Kinect may only be obtained
   through mathematical manipulation. It was found that the accelerations
   of the upper limb movement from both IMU and Kinect demonstrated good
   agreement. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In 2013, in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the
   European Commission promoted a major initiative addressing cloud
   computing and the public sector, named Cloud-for-Europe (C4E),, for the
   creation of a digital single market of IT services in the cloud. That
   initiative pushes public sector organizations from Member States for
   preparing themselves in procuring secure, cost-effective, reliable and
   trustworthy cloud services. C4E has adopted the Pre-Commercial
   Procurement (PCP) instrument for involving not only public sector
   entities but also IT, Telcos, and SMEs in providing innovative
   cloud-based solutions that best fit public sector's needs. In this
   paper, after presenting a brief overview of C4E initiative and the
   current European scenario for public cloud services and cloud projects,
   we discuss the lessons learned on the relevance of achieving
   cross-border interoperability between public cloud computing services,
   deriving from our successful participation at the first PCP phase as
   tenderers.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper deals with contemporary changes in the world of
   entrepreneurship and economics. It explains the difference between the
   traditional and current cognizance of the innovation process and the
   related necessity of innovation of the entire business model. It is
   particularly focused on the field of publishing practice where the
   explicit phenomenon is at present digitalization. An analysis is
   presented of the facilities available in our country and on a global
   scale and summarizes and presents comments on contemporary trends in the
   sphere of media.
   The paper includes a case study of a publishing house which within the
   scope of the innovation of its business model introduced on the market
   in addition to a well-established print journal also its tablet version.
   On the basis of a questionnaire distributed among readers the paper
   presents the results of the survey which identifies reserves and shows
   the specific character of digital publishing.
   The definition and addressing of the target group of readers and
   focusing of marketing activities is a very significant factor. Another
   significant factor of success is besides the high-quality content also a
   guarantee of the optimum technical parameters of the journal related
   with the size of files and adaptation of the content to individual types
   of reading devices (tablet vs. smartphone). A frequent mistake is an
   excessive volume of data in a single edition which can discourage a lot
   of readers from downloading the file and subsequently reading it. Owing
   to the different display of the journal on a tablet, smartphone and
   desktop, the production of a tablet journal must count with and invest
   in three different output versions optimized for individual devices. In
   conclusion the paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of
   digital publishing.}},

Abstract = {{State of the art digital marketing enters into all the spheres of
   marketing positioning in the hotel industry. As opposed to large hotel
   companies, small and medium sized hotels are in a more disadvantageous
   position with respect to the size of marketing budgets; they, however,
   find new strength in proactive and dynamic tools of e-placements. They
   include search engine optimisation (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM),
   Metasearch, dynamic rate marketing (DRM), email marketing, as well as a
   strong social presence.
   Description of research sample - for the purposes of achieving a
   synergic conclusion, the research was conducted on two levels:
   stakeholders - researched hotels and implemented digital marketing tools
   and market - tourists' response to recognition of the said tools.
   Research methods - the methodology used includes quantitative,
   statistical and qualitative research methods, which include interview
   and creative thinking techniques.
   Findings and outcomes of the research - the research results point to a
   recommendation for the implementation of an optimal mix of digital
   marketing components for the purposes of realisation of results and
   return on investment.
   Application in practice - conclusions and recommendations are
   implicative and represent a new potential for application in practice,
   as well as support for new market recognisability and competitiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Social media have changed the requirements for the marketing seriously.
   Companies need to master new challenges that have arisen because of new
   media usage. This concerns the web 2.0 technologies, social media and
   the two-way communication between companies and customers. There are new
   opportunities for marketing, which require new approaches in handling,
   e.g. user-generated-content and risks like ``shitstorm(16){''}.
   Solutions may be reduction of risks and monitoring. It is a major
   challenge for such a conservative sector as insurance to integrate
   social media in their marketing in order to maintain existing customers
   and win new ones. They instigate changes in marketing strategy,
   marketing mix and processes and require a great deal of creativity in
   implementing them within the phenomenon of social media marketing. The
   paper deals with different views on social media marketing in the
   insurance sector using case studies on design of new processes within
   the innovation management, and indicating benefits in insurance
   business.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the number of publications about Industry 4.0 has been steeply
   increasing. However, the concept of ``Industry 4.0{''} is primarily
   being explored from a technical point of view robotics, Internet of
   things, big data, smart objects, smart factories. There has been very
   little inquiry into the question of what it means for people and the
   society as a whole. Increasing digitisation will not only have an
   enormous impact on machines, factories and sectors, but on societies,
   economics and management as well. That is why we must look more closely
   at these aspects. Where are the risks-but also where are the
   opportunities for social innovation and progress?
   Industry 4.0 still has not entered the mainstream academic research, it
   is much more frequently treated in reports of leading consultancies as
   McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture, BCG, World Bank and recently it became
   one of the main topics of discussion at the WEF 2016. However, as it can
   profoundly affect the future of jobs, management, education, and social
   systems, academic research in related disciplines should not stay aside
   and supplement the activities of technically oriented colleagues}},

Abstract = {{This discussion paper aims to set out the key challenges and
   opportunities emerging from distributed manufacturing (DM). We begin by
   describing the concept, available definitions and consider its evolution
   where recent production technology developments (such as additive and
   continuous production process technologies), digitisation together with
   infrastructural developments (in terms of IoT and big data) provide new
   opportunities. To further explore the evolving nature of DM, the
   authors, each of whom are involved in specific applications of DM
   research, examine through an expert panel workshop environment emerging
   DM applications involving new production and supporting infrastructural
   technologies. This paper presents these generalisable findings on DM
   challenges and opportunities in terms of products, enabling production
   technologies and the impact on the wider production and industrial
   system. Industry structure and location of activities are examined in
   terms of the democratising impact on participating network actors. The
   paper concludes with a discussion on the changing nature of
   manufacturing as a result of DM, from the traditional centralised,
   large-scale, long lead-time forecast-driven production operations to a
   new DM paradigm where manufacturing is a decentralised, autonomous near
   end user-driven activity. A forward research agenda is proposed that
   considers the impact of DM on the industrial and urban landscape.}},

Title = {{Extended responsibility through servitization in PSS An exploratory
   study of used-clothing sector}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The global textile-fashion industry is resource inefficient
   thus requiring higher product-service systems (PSS) intervention.
   Further, insight of how PSS extends corporate responsibility is rather
   limited; knowledge of which may contribute towards increased PSS
   viability. The purpose of this paper is to explore how companies
   operating with used-clothing PSS extend their responsibilities through
   servitization.
   Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory study of seven companies
   operating with various used-clothing PSS is conducted through
   semi-structured interviews and supplementary document studies.
   Findings - Six dominant ways through which servitization drives
   responsibility in used-clothing PSS are identified. These are through:
   value-adding services, product leverage, collaborative partnership,
   information transparency, awareness and platform-enabled networking. Two
   trade-offs exist in terms of their focus on physical process or
   digitalization, and developed by honing core competency or collaborative
   partnership. Further three differentiating attributes underlie these
   mechanisms for: raising awareness and/or improving transparency,
   collaboration in value creation and/or in promoting consumption, and
   product ownership and/or leverage.
   Research limitations/implications - A wide range of used-clothing PSS
   exists each in its own way extending responsibility. In-depth studies
   are required to investigate the relationship between servitization and
   extended responsibility for diverse PSS-types and on type of
   responsibilities they address.
   Practical implications - By identifying the key mechanisms or ways and
   their underlying characteristics companies can identify new
   servitization forms and ways to extend their responsibility, identify
   best practices and establish viability beyond the traditional measures,
   e.g. financial.
   Originality/value - So far no studies have investigated the role of
   servitization in PSS and how it extends corporate responsibility,
   especially in industries like textile-fashion, where both resource
   efficiency and responsibility is low.}},

Abstract = {{A range of recent academic, policy and practice-focused work in the UK
   and internationally has identified a need for more focused attention on
   the role of digital literacies in enabling young people to more
   effectively navigate their way through an increasingly complex,
   digitally mediated world. In this article, we explore the main debates
   taking place around the prevalence of digital media in the early
   twenty-first century, with emphasis on the role of pervasive digital
   media in educational settings. Focusing on the practice-based project,
   Digital Commonwealth, a series of critical insights are drawn,
   highlighting the difficulties facing educational authorities and young
   people in dealing with the opportunities and threats brought about by
   digital media. We conclude that a critical digital citizenship agenda
   needs to be embedded in educational narratives, where young people are,
   through practice, asked to ponder how digitally mediated publics operate
   in the school setting and beyond. Integrating making' and thinking
   critically' about the benefits and dangers of pervasive digital media in
   and outside of school is imperative. Our study suggests that there
   remain significant inequities in terms of provision across schools,
   access to suitable infrastructure and equipment, and the presence of
   qualified and confident staff with the requisite digital leadership
   attributes to enable digital media projects to be integrated into
   everyday learning practices. Major events, like the Commonwealth Games,
   can precipitate and accelerate uptake of new approaches and innovative
   thinking but they do not represent a panacea for the systemic
   development of critical digital citizenship over time.}},

   Anonymous as a socio-digital object, that is, as a social
   premise-embedded in the digital logic-which opens a determined horizon

   alternative and electronic space, generated by the use of digital
   technologies, which is characterized by a certain degree of autonomy,
   and a conscious oppositional character, in relation to mainstream
   society. The members of the Digital Underground have developed distinct

   Anonymous stands out as a main example of these initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{In modern data acquisition a constantly growing number of applications
   using technically advanced image processing systems has been observed in
   recent years. The work presented proves, that it is possible to use
   standard webcams combined with an innovative lighting concept to
   precisely measure displacements of high frequency structural
   oscillations. By means of stroboscopic light, the actual frequency of a
   periodic high frequency oscillation is shifted to the low detection rate
   of the cameras applied. Object or surface deformations are measured and
   visualized by well-established 3D digital image correlation procedures.
   The excellent performance of the proposed system is confirmed by a wide
   range of experimental studies. All results indicate that this innovative
   system is a perfect supplement to traditional modal analysis measurement
   systems, particularly in the context of teaching vibrations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of our report is to describe an innovative
   system used for mandibular immobilization during Gamma Knife surgery
   (GKS) procedures. It is based on an approach originally developed in
   Marseille in extracranial lesions, close to or involving the mandible,
   which may imply a certain degree of movement during the therapeutic
   image acquisitions and/or GKS treatment. Methods: The maxillofacial
   surgeon applied bone titanium self-tapping monocortical screws (4; 2 mm
   diameter, 10 mm length) between roots of the teeth in the fixed gingiva
   (upper and lower maxillae) the day before GKS (local anesthesia, 5-10
   min time). Two rubber bands were sufficient for the desired tension
   required to undergo GKS. We further proceeded with application of the
   Leksell stereotactic G frame and carried out the usual GKS procedure.
   Results: The mean follow-up period was 2.3 years (range 0.6-3). Three
   patients have been treated with this approach: 2 cases with extracranial
   trigeminal schwannomas involving the mandibular branch, with decrease in
   tumor size on MR follow-up; 1 case with residual paracondylian
   mandibular arteriovenous malformation following partial embolization,
   completely obliterated at 7 months (digital subtraction angiography
   programmed 1 year after treatment). Conclusions: Jaw immobilization
   appears to be a quick, minimally invasive, safe and accurate adjunctive
   technique to enhance GKS targeting precision. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG,

Title = {{Sociotechnical systems design: coordination of virtual teamwork in
   innovation}},
Journal = {{TEAM PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{7-8}},
Pages = {{354-369}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to report on a qualitative comparative case
   study of coordination in three ongoing research and development
   projects, each conducted by teams working virtually across multiple,
   geographically dispersed sites and involving varying degrees of task
   uncertainty at differing stages on an innovation continuum, from basic
   fundamental research to scale-up and commercial development.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study investigated characteristics of
   effective virtual innovation teamwork, primarily using structured
   interviews, observation and a limited number of surveys. The analysis
   was based upon Pava's (1983) methodology of sociotechnical systems (STS)
   for non-linear work and was used to assess the influence of virtuality
   and task uncertainty on the quality of team deliberations and the
   knowledge development barriers experienced at the various stages on the
   innovation continuum.
   Findings - The study identified different technical and social
   coordination mechanisms and their impact in mitigating knowledge
   barriers for differing levels of task uncertainty. Technical elements,
   many based in digital information technology, appeared most significant
   for coordination where task uncertainty and ambiguity were low. However,
   with high task uncertainty, the most significant mechanisms were closely
   tied to the formal and informal social systems of virtual organization.
   Research limitations/implications - The key implication for future
   research is the development of further applications to evaluate this
   coordination model for modern teamwork in virtual contexts.
   Practical implications - The findings extend previous theory about
   coordination of innovation to include fundamental research and virtual
   collaboration. Based on the results, a four-step STS methodology for
   design of virtual team coordination mechanisms was developed and piloted
   successfully by scientific teams at a prominent North American research
   laboratory.
   Originality/value - This research project has shown that modern STS
   methodology, updated for non-routine work in a virtual context, can
   provide a way to assess and mitigate ``coordination costs{''} associated
   with virtual teamwork. Further, it has identified clear categories of
   coordination mechanisms that are most effective when teams are working
   at different stages in the innovation process.}},

Abstract = {{KM3NeT is a European deep-sea multidisciplinary research infrastructure
   in the Mediterranean Sea. It will host a km3-scale neutrino telescope
   and dedicated instruments for long-term and continuous measurements for
   Earth and Sea sciences. The KM3NeT neutrino telescope is a 3-dimensional
   array of Digital Optical Modules, suspended in the sea by means of
   vertical string structures, called Detection Units, supported by two
   pre-stretched Dyneema ropes, anchored to the seabed and kept taut with a
   system of buoys. The Digital Optical Module represents the active part
   of the neutrino telescope. It is composed by a 17-inch, 14 mm thick
   borosilicate glass (Vitrovex) spheric vessel housing 31 photomultiplier
   tubes with 3-inch photocathode diameter and the associated front-end and
   readout electronics. The technical solution adopted for the KM3NeT
   optical modules is characterized by an innovative design, considering
   that existing neutrino telescopes, Baikal, IceCube and ANTARES, all use
   large photomultipliers, typically with a diameter of 8{''} or 10{''}. It
   offers several advantages: higher sensitive surface (1260 cm(2)), weaker
   sensitivity to Earth's magnetic field, better distinction between
   single-photon and multi-photon events (photon counting) and directional
   information with an almost isotropic field of view. In this contribution
   the design and the performance of the KM3NeT Digital Optical Modules are
   discussed, with a particular focus on enabling technologies and
   integration procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study was the assessment of the stress-strain
   fields of the sandwich core during bending tests. Finite element models
   (FEM) using Siemens NX10 and digital image correlation (DIC) were used
   to predict the behavior of sandwich beams in 3 and 4 point bending. Two
   different core thickness and two different sandwich length (short and
   long beams) with basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) faces were
   simulated. The numerical simulation using 3D finite element were
   compared and validated with experimental results obtained previously by
   DIC. This work validated innovative numerical simulations and
   experimental techniques for determining stress-strain fields in
   composite sandwich beams subjected to bending. The correlation between
   experience and analysis allowed a better knowledge and understanding of
   the complex stress-strain fields along the core thickness of sandwich
   beams in bending. (C) 2016, PROSTR (Procedia Structural Integrity)

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of crack closure on the propagation of short
   cracks is investigated. An experimental campaign, performed in the low
   cycle fatigue regime, was performed on specimens with micro-defects,
   considering two different strain ratios: initially, tests were performed
   under fully reversed straining, whereas the effect of an applied mean
   strain were studied by considering a strain ratio equal to 0.5. Crack
   closure was characterized with an innovative technique based on digital
   image correlation: crack opening and closing levels were measured
   starting from the experimental crack tip displacement fields. Finally,
   experimental results were compared to those computed with the analytical
   model proposed by Newman. (C) 2016, PROSTR (Procedia Structural

Abstract = {{Advances in informational and communication technology due to rapid
   technological changes made e-service innovations possible. The new
   technologies compete with other methods to meet the needs of consumers
   and provide innovation in new services and create new challenges for
   service providers who offer to their customer's high quality and
   customized services. In this regard, companies that offer distinguished
   and useful services to customers have more loyal customers rather than
   their competitor. Understanding the impact of consumer response to
   innovations on their loyalty is crucial for service providers in the
   field of digital products. Therefore, the aim of this study is the
   investigation of the impact of Innovation in Electronic Service on brand
   equity and customer loyalty in Samsung International Corporation. In
   this regard, data from 384 users of Samsung mobile phone who have used
   the services of this company was collected and tested through structural
   equation modeling. The findings of the study confirmed the impact of
   customized services and technology leadership on the brand equity, while
   direct impact of service innovation on brand equity was not found
   significant. Positive impact of technology leadership and brand equity
   on customer loyalty was also approved. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{as an infrastructural and productive industry, tourism is very important
   in modern economy and includes different scopes and functions. If it is
   developed appropriately, cultural relations and economic development of
   countries will be extended and provided. Web development as an applied
   tool in the internet plays a very determining role in tourism success
   and proper exploitation of it can pave the way for more development and
   success of this industry.
   On the other hand, the amount of data in the current world has been
   increased and analysis of large sets of data that is referred to as big
   data has been converted into a strategic approach to enhance competition
   and establish new methods for development, growth, innovation, and
   enhancement of the number of customers. Today, big data is one of the
   important issues of information management in digital age and one of the
   main opportunities in tourism industry for optimal exploitation of
   maximum information. Big data can shape experiences of smart travel.
   Remarkable growth of these data sources has inspired new
   Strategies to understand the socio-economic phenomenon in different
   fields. The analytical approach of big data emphasizes the capacity of
   data collection and analysis with an unprecedented extent, depth and
   scale for solving the problems of real life and uses it. Indeed, big
   data analyses open the doors to various opportunities for developing the
   modern knowledge or changing our understanding of this scope and support
   decision-making in tourism industry. The purpose of this study is to
   show helpfulness of big data analysis to discover behavioral patterns in
   tourism industry and propose a model for employing data in tourism.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Direct Metallization (DDM) is an innovative process for the
   production of planar or three dimensional circuit carriers. Both
   conductor lines for logic circuits and conductors for high power
   transmissions can be realized. This paper describes the manufacturing
   process chain of Digital Direct Metallization by plasma based copper
   coating and shows the potentials of this technology. Circuits can be
   applied to almost any base substrate such as polymers, ceramics or even
   metal since an insulating dielectric lacquer layer separates the
   substrate from the metallization. In contrast to previous plasma based
   copper depositing processes the Digital Direct Metallization enables
   clearly defined fine structures without using any inflexible and
   high-maintenance masks {[}1]. An enormous advantage of this procedure is
   the complete elimination of wet chemical process steps, which are known
   from the laser direct structuring method (LDS) {[}2]. In addition to
   diverse mechanical and electrical characterizations this paper
   represents the opportunities of the technology by means of a
   demonstrator application.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an innovative and reliable frame synchronization scheme
   is proposed for second generation digital video broadcasting (DVB-S2)
   system in Variable Coded Modulation (VCM) service. Frame synchronization
   in VCM suffers many difficulties from large frequency offset, extremely
   low SNR and variable physical layer frame (PLFRAME) lengths. To cope
   with variable PLFRAME lengths, multi-windows are proposed and utilized.
   Multi windows threshold-based search algorithm is presented with
   theoretical analysis to decrease the missed detection probability.
   Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is more robust
   and reliable than the existing approaches, especially in low signal to
   noise ratios (SNRs) and large frequency offsets.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grids are recognized as the next-generation power grid that uses
   digital information and communications technology to create an advanced,
   automated, and efficient energy network among a wealth of electronic
   appliances, meters, and energy producing and distributing devices. As
   more complex and distributed interactions among these different
   components are envisioned, an open, scalable, and manageable framework
   is needed to support the communication and computing needs. This paper
   proposes an innovative method to derive scalable information
   infrastructure for smart grids. The framework well aligns with the
   emerging micro-grid operational model of the smart grid. A prototype
   framework is being developed consisting of CloudLab {[}1], GENI {[}2]
   wired and wireless networks, and real-time power system platform at the
   RTPIS Lab {[}3].}},

   have increased drastically in different domains of engineering education
   and its application development. There are more openings for a fresh
   engineer with the computer expertise skills. The man power required with
   these skills is like a hot cake in the Industry all over the world.
   Designing a computer based teaching methodology for various courses in
   engineering education is certainly a challenging task and should meet
   the requirements of the Engineering Education standards. Today exploring
   different ideas and innovation of new techniques are mandatory for a
   fresh engineering graduate. Computer Based Active Learning Teaching
   Methodology is essential in the area of Electronics and Computer Based
   Engineering Education at under graduate level. This paper describes
   about the procedure to develop Compute Based Teaching Methodology (CBTM)
   and successfully implemented for various courses like Linear Digital
   Integrated Circuit Applications, Micro Processors \& Micro Controllers
   and Embedded System courses for engineering graduates. This paper
   presents the procedure to implement a CBTM for different engineering
   courses and how it is useful to develop applications or projects in the
   area of Electronics and Computer Engineering Education. This paper also
   discusses the effectiveness of usage of CBTM with the results and the

Abstract = {{Within the last two decades, there has been increased interest in how
   technology supports Indigenous language revitalization and reclamation
   efforts. This paper considers the effect technology has on Indigenous
   language learning and teaching, while conceptualizing how language
   educators, speakers, learners, and technology users holistically
   understand, skillfully apply and communicate creative and balanced
   technological solutions that are based on understanding of contextual
   factors. A total of 80 participants representing at least 47 Indigenous
   languages completed a survey in 2009 representing individuals,
   organizations, and institutions that serve one or more Indigenous
   language communities across the United States, Canada, Australia, New
   Zealand, Taiwan, Guatemala, Peru, Greenland, Mexico, Bolivia, French
   Polynesia (Marquesas Islands and Tuamotu Islands), and Russia. The data
   reveal the functions digital technology has in Indigenous language
   revitalization, which include (1) positive and supportive roles (2)
   concerns, constraints, and tensions, and (3) Indigenous language
   education. Regardless of the size of the community, opportunities for
   using technology in Indigenous language revitalization efforts are
   shaped by linguistic, cultural, social, economic, environmental, and
   technological factors as expressed in the technacy framework for
   language revitalization. Findings indicate that technology has wide and
   mostly positive applications in language learning and teaching, that the
   benefits of those applications remain consistent across communities
   regardless of size and geographic location, and that new and innovative
   uses of technology are being adopted to support language revitalization
   efforts. Overall, the study underscores the importance of context in
   making grounded decisions about technology as a component of
   contemporary language revitalization efforts.}},

Abstract = {{In autism and technology research, technologies are often developed by
   researchers targeting specific social and communication difficulties
   experienced by individuals with autism. In some technology-based
   projects, children and adults with autism as well as parents, carers,
   teachers, and other professionals, are involved as users, informers, and
   ( more rarely) as co-designers. However, much less is known about the
   views of the autism community about the needs they identify as areas
   that could be addressed through innovative technological solutions. This
   paper describes the ASCmeI. T. project which encourages members of the
   autism community to download a free app to answer the question: If there
   was one new technology to help people with autism, what would it be?
   This project provides a model of e-participation in which people from
   the autism community are involved from the start so that new
   developments in digital technologies can be better matched to support
   the needs of users.}},

Abstract = {{This conceptual paper considers the cooperative enterprise model in the
   light of how it can be affected by the digital world and - at the same
   time - of how it can positively affect both the Internet and its users.
   The aim of the paper is therefore twofold: (i) to consider the extent
   and the way in which cooperative principles are going to be affected by
   the transition of these firms towards `digital materiality' {[}1]; (ii)
   to outline the potential implications of a diffusion of cooperative
   forms to Internet organizations and users. Based on the traits of this
   enterprise model, an emerging perspective is described whereby the
   `cooperative' (especially if considered as a `service system') has an
   interesting potential both as a competent actor in the domain of virtual
   enterprises and as a possible driver for safeguarding Internet users.}},

   transformed the business environment. Therefore, enterprises need a
   user-centered and open-innovation ecosystem to promote the value

   paper presents a service-oriented approach for designing a Living Lab
   for continuous performance improvement in enterprises, especially
   small-and-medium-size enterprises (SMEs). The proposed Living Lab is an
   on-going project for the creation of a living laboratory that will
   support the upgrading program for SMEs in developing countries. The
   purpose of this Living Lab is to integrate the co-creation and

Abstract = {{The rapid evolution of Internet had a big impact on how digital media is
   being shared and distributed. Nowadays, copyright violation is a major
   concern, as security issues still exist in video content traffic.
   Moreover, a heterogeneous environment often increases the need for
   retransmission of content, so, the bandwidth consumption is larger and
   creates congestion at the network level and higher energy consumption.
   In this paper, we try to tackle these problems and introduce SStream, a
   solution which can be used to deliver multimedia content in an efficient
   and secured manner. Our solution is based on a new and innovative
   encryption scheme, Attribute-Based Encryption. SStream protects the
   digital content by avoiding piracy and enforcing access control. We
   evaluated our solution and show that the added security layer does not
   impact the quality of the content.}},

Title = {{Ubiquitous interaction for ESP distance and blended learners}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{489-503}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse some effective e-tools
   and interactive tasks to enhance language acquisition and competence
   building in today's English for specific purposes (ESP) students in
   higher education programmes.
   Design/methodology/approach - There are countless learning methods,
   often supported by the access of ubiquitous learning materials, which
   improve students' engagement, group interaction and independent learning
   skills in foreign language learners. More frequently, students become
   successful, independent and cooperative creative learners by means of
   participating in multimodal virtual learning platforms that would help
   them to improve a variety of competences. This study is based on English
   applied to social work, a compulsory subject offered either in a blended
   (b-learning) or a distance (d-learning) learning environment as part of
   the degree in social work. It combines its correspondent course book
   with digital content and multimedia tasks.
   Findings - Results suggest that a ubiquitous practice for ESP b/d
   learners can be innovative and successfully competence-addressed when
   implementing interactive learning tasks that can combine individual and
   group work inside and outside the classroom hours.
   Originality/value - The challenge of this research is to integrate a
   ubiquitous learning approach so that students would interact more and,
   consequently, enhance their communicative language skills, both in
   b-learning and d-learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) is an innovative,
   green, reliable, and rapid method for the characterization of complex
   sugar mixtures. For research into sustainable nontimber forest products,
   Adansonia digitata dry fruit pulp in this proof-of-concept study was
   used to demonstrate this method due to its reported high nutritional
   value and prebiotic activity. Chromatographic separations were performed
   on (20x10cm(2)) HPTLC glass plates with diol stationary phase, using a
   15-step gradient by mixing solutions acetone/acetonitrile 1:1, and
   ultrapure water for enzymatic degradation products. Instead,
   monosaccharide moieties were separated on HPTLC silica gel 60F(254) over
   isocratic mode with 80mm of eluent front composed of acetonitrile/acetic
   acid/water 63/33/5v/v/v. Identification and quantification were
   performed by densitometry acquisitions at 400nm after opportune
   derivatization. Our research highlighted that this technique can be used
   as a standard method to gain new insights into inulin determinations,
   with several advantages over existing conventional liquid
   chromatography. The development of innovative methods for the
   characterization of biopolymers is crucial, for food and nutraceutical
   industry and for quality control of phytochemicals. Characterization of
   such materials, up until now, has been done by mass difference and so
   accurate analytical methods were lacking.

Abstract = {{Libraries as memory institutions and infrastructure for science have for
   the most part undergone the digital transformation. For some people, the
   apparent dichotomy between the allegedly good old world of the printed
   book, which included readers and dignified education, and the world of
   the ubiquitous digital, which is often perceived to be dangerous and in
   which we are flooded with data and stimuli and wander about in
   confusion, may still stir heated discussions. For libraries, that
   dichotomy is long gone. Today the libraries' concern is to let knowledge
   contents do their work in the various innovative and-more often than
   not-mobile user scenarios of the internet. The content's format is
   irrelevant. The new mantra is `content in context'. The focus is as much
   on knowledge, learning, and research as on culture and education for
   everyone. The big challenge for the libraries of tomorrow is the trend
   towards the disappearance of that textual culture. It will be replaced
   by the new knowledge paradigm of the data stream that is dynamic,
   multimedia, and constantly changing.}},

Journal = {{LOGOS-JOURNAL OF THE WORLD PUBLISHING COMMUNITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{19-31}},
Abstract = {{This paper is based on primary research conducted with 22 senior
   publishing industry managers in the UK as a preliminary survey for a
   PhD. It seeks to establish a base on which to develop further research
   around the changes taking place in the organizational and collaborative
   behaviour of an industry facing digital challenges. The survey asked the
   22 managing directors and operations and digital directors how they view
   current conditions in the industry in light of digital change. It allows
   subjects to speak for themselves in order to learn (a) how far-reaching
   they feel change is, (b) where that change is having most effect in
   their day-to-day business, (c) whether they themselves are making
   organizational changes, and (d) how far collaboration forms part of this
   change. The collaboration aspect of the survey unpicks in more detail
   how far collaborations are (a) increasing in frequency, (b) are changing
   in vision (i.e. more exploratory or not), and (c) involve different
   organizational behaviour. The research reveals many areas of clear
   consensus around key issues of technical competence, new patterns in
   consumption, entrepreneurship, and silo structures. There is an
   understanding that the ability to respond quickly and to innovate
   continuously is essential. On collaborations, most people concurred that
   they were entering more partnerships than in the past and that these
   were often more experimental in approach and involved sharing risk;
   ultimately, this points to a clearer strategy emerging in companies to
   develop structures, skills, and techniques to facilitate new styles of
   collaboration, which in turn may lead to new ways of innovating in a
   flexible, failure-tolerant way.}},

Abstract = {{The new global economy has a great potential to shift economic power on
   a massive level resulting in a new and growing digital divide in the
   world. Over the past few decades, computers have transformed both the
   world and the workforce in many profound ways. As a result, computer
   science and associated technologies now lie at the heart of smart
   economies worldwide. Many reports around the world state that failure to
   teach Computer Science and associated technologies in the Digital Age
   will be disastrous. This paper summarizes the recently developed
   comprehensive standards and performance criteria for K-12 computer
   science and technology education designed to strengthen computer science
   fluency and competency throughout primary and secondary Schools in UAE.
   The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the up-to-date trends in
   computer science education worldwide and then demonstrates the
   adaptation of such practices to the design of a fully customized
   standards document that fit UAE culture and vision regarding
   transformation to knowledge based economy, innovation, and
   entrepreneurship.}},

Abstract = {{Experts on human-computer interaction (HCI) are required to establish
   communication media for a broad variety of users in consequence of the
   expanding services offered to the market and the changing technology
   landscapes. Software developers need suitable criteria to handle
   computer interfaces because of the diversity within the `digital
   population' and it seems natural that educators should answer the
   professional questions posed by software designers.
   In this paper we report on the experience of a vocational course on
   object-oriented design, which - among other topics - provides
   professional criteria to students who are required to plan a large
   assortment of computer interfaces from panels to object lists, from
   animated images to social web pages.
   In the first stage, lessons on HCI illustrate the psychological
   portraits of computer users. Second, the lessons deduce practical
   guidelines from those profiles. Finally the students learn the technical
   contents regarding HCI design.
   The concise psychological and social criteria which guide the students
   to prepare the visual interfaces constitute the innovative contribution
   of the present work at the didactic level. The initial lessons on HCI go
   beyond mere technical training and it may be said that they improve the
   professional culture of students. The feedback from participants
   appeared very positive.}},

Abstract = {{Colombia has survived a war for over half century, confrontation of
   civil society, guerrilla, paramilitary and our armed forces causing
   death and pain. Today we are close of achieving a peace agreement. USA
   President Barack Obama, The UN Office, The Catholic Church Pope
   Francisco and many other Governments and Organizations have expressed
   great support to our agreement. However, no serious studies have been
   done. In our side we are preparing for a post-conflict situation, we
   have to prepare thousands of demobilized requiring labor
   re-qualification. Also given the deficit of 100,000 ICT engineers and
   triple of technologists and technicians, our proposal is intended as a
   disruptive innovation to address the digital divide post-conflict and
   human talent in this country.
   The quality of HE (Higher Education) and ME (Media Education) in
   Colombia has been strongly challenged among others: By the TIMSS (Trends
   in International Mathematics and Science Study) and the PISA (Programme
   for International Student Assessment) results; as well as many others
   The HE less than 10\% of universities has quality accreditation which is
   an indicator of the low competitiveness. The problem of desertion in HE
   \& ME is, as it pertains to human resources in ICT Professional levels
   (P), Technology (T) and Professional Technical (TP), is dramatic;
   desertion reaches 50\% of the HE and in the case of T and TP is much
   higher than 65\%, a situation that represents a high volume of resources
   by Government and the Families.
   We propose a model based on the integration in an Intelligent MIS (iMIS)
   of 5 architectures that we are implementing in several HE Institutions
   (HEI), in Colombia. Those architectures are supported by the convergence
   of Engineering Information (EI), Software Engineering (SE) and Knowledge
   Engineering (KE), and with Artificial \& Computational Intelligence.
   They are also guided by mathematical and computational models. The iMIS
   are integrating hybrid architectures with multilevel systems, such as a
   space in order to respond to the solution of problems leading to get
   Competitiveness, observing specifically how you can include these
   technologies for evolving university in modernity, bringing together the
   governability, the student and teacher productivity, and also the HQ
   EDUCATION (HQE). The 5 architectures are: 1-Curricular Coherence
   Analysis and Management on ICT / On Line Government (OLG) Competencies.
   2-Intelligent COACHING. 3-Building the future: Roadmap for Student
   Permanence. 4-Process Engineering for Governability. 5-the HQE.
   The system offers alternatives to young people and adults who wish to
   make a career but a significant readiness semesters (Coaching) skills
   and competencies certification, e. g. ICT \& OLG. The strategic
   development is based on Social Innovation and Knowledge Engineering. The
   main Model Characteristics are:
   1-Approach: Bio-psycho-socio-technical-scientific
   2-High: Quality, Technology, ITC and Articulation
   3-OL learning
   4-Knowledge and competencies management
   5-Social importance: Reduce ICT talent gap and individual student driven
   6-Dual Impact: Using Post-conflict, job creation
   7-Business model
   As complementary uses is looking to extend its application to re-train
   users: demobilized from conflict to labor re-qualification, more than 3
   million..}},

   low orbit mobile satellite service development in Ku band. For all those
   systems, the availability of high performance and cost effective antenna
   is key. To address this need, fundamental enablers lie in manufacturing
   technologies able to handle complex 3D shape while providing at the same
   time fast and low cost prototyping as well as the ability to support
   volume production. This talk will try to illustrate how 3D printing and

Abstract = {{Phased array and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) radar systems are
   being developed with greater number of channels to achieve more
   flexibility, speed and range. Each channel contains either an ADC
   (Analog to Digital Converter) for a receiver channel - or a DAC (Digital
   to Analog Converter) for a transmission channel.
   In such large array, the channels need to be time synchronized as
   precisely as possible. This is one of the key to reach higher
   performance systems. One of the main synchronization to realize is at
   the data converter level. It is necessary to make sure that all channels
   sample the data at the precise same time to avoid errors in the
   transmission - such as corruption of orthogonality of an OFDM
   modulation.
   In system requiring small instantaneous bandwidth, and thus using low
   speed data converters (up to a few hundreds of megahertz), synchronizing
   the multiple channels is easier; the period of the system being larger.
   However for large instantaneous bandwidth - which relates to sampling
   rate - and high-speed data converters, synchronizing the channels become
   challenging.
   This paper presents an innovative method to synchronize highspeed data
   converters. This method uses a daisy chain approach with meta-stability
   detection and correction features to ease synchronizing large number of
   data converters.
   In this paper, the difficulty of high-speed synchronization will be
   discussed; the new method will be presented, along with its calibration
   and measurement results. Finally, the benefits and limitations of the
   method will be considered.}},

Abstract = {{The Enred@te initiative, created by Red Cross, the Vodafone Foundation
   and the TECSOS Foundation, emerged as an evolution of a previous project
   that developed and piloted a video-communication solution with older
   adults, using a system installed in their own televisions. Following the
   success of this first initiative, it was decided to advance toward a
   more flexible, robust, easy-to-use and high-quality solution, producing
   a social network accessible through tablets. Older adults can use the
   network to video-communicate with other older adults and stay informed
   on various topics of interest. Additionally, a new innovation
   incorporates the participation of virtual volunteers, a part of the
   network that promotes its use in an inclusive and participative manner.
   This solution was also piloted in 2014 with positive results and work to
   turn it into a service that can reach older adults through the Red Cross
   is currently on-going.}},

   Reflecting on this statement by Andrew Olah related to a 2014 Just Style

   offers a collective model of sustainable design wherein faculty in a
   university fashion and apparel program combined efforts and talents to
   develop a solution for reducing the environmental impact of indigo
   (while retaining aesthetic richness) through the integration of
   traditional and digital design. A case study method is adopted as a
   specific, unique, and bounded system (Stake 2008) that frames the
   creative process so as to capture best practice within a collective
   design working model. Within this model we analyze historic dye
   processes and relevant literature, as well as emergent technologies to
   define criteria for the resulting design output. Qualitative data in the
   form of observations, as well as our personal reflections as designers
   and educators, are transcribed and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{This article argues that technological innovation is transforming the
   flow of information, the fluidity of social action, and is giving birth
   to new forms of bottom up innovation that are capable of expanding and
   exploding old theories of reproduction and resistance because smart
   mobs', street knowledge', and social movements' cannot be neutralized by
   powerful structural forces in the same old ways. The purpose of this
   article is to develop the concept of YPAR 2.0 in which new technologies
   enable young people to visualize, validate, and transform social
   inequalities by using local knowledge in innovative ways that deepen
   civic engagement, democratize data, expand educational opportunity,
   inform policy, and mobilize community assets. Specifically this article
   documents how digital technology (including a mobile, mapping and SMS
   platform called Streetwyze and paper-mapping tool Local Ground) -
   coupled with ground-truthing' - an approach in which community members
   work with researchers to collect and verify public' data - sparked a
   food revolution in East Oakland that led to an increase in young
   people's self-esteem, environmental stewardship, academic engagement,
   and positioned urban youth to become community leaders and community
   builders who are connected and committed to health and well-being of
   their neighborhoods. This article provides an overview of how the YPAR
   2.0 Model was developed along with recommendations and implications for
   future research and collaborations between youth, teachers, neighborhood
   leaders, and youth serving organizations.}},

Title = {{Alternate reality games (ARG) as innovative digital information sources}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},

Pages = {{433-453}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the gathering,
   integration and analysis of digital information sources for the creation
   of a conceptual framework for alternate reality games (ARGs). ARGs hold
   potential for libraries, education, healthcare and many other sectors.
   Design/methodology/approach - Case studies were performed on three
   previously played ARGs to create case reports. The various digital
   information sources for each game, sourced from multiple media, are
   compiled into a chronologically ordered game narrative which formed the
   case reports. The focus of the paper is on the analysis of the case
   reports using constant comparative analysis to identify categories and
   subcategories. Relationships are established, based on each game,
   between the categories and subcategories to inform the creation of game
   diagrams. The game diagrams are then combined to create a conceptual
   framework that describes the functioning and components of an ARG.
   Findings - The conceptual framework effectively described the types of
   information found within an ARG as well as how these different
   categories of information interact and link to one another. The
   framework also provides an abstract description of the components of
   ARGs, namely narrative, game actions and community.
   Originality/value - The conceptual framework produced by the analysis
   enables an understanding of ARGs and how they are played and designed.
   Insight into how to analyse ARGs based on the information generated for
   the play of the game by both the players and the game designers is
   gained. Where other studies have provided insight into the phenomena of
   ARGs, this study focuses on constructing a conceptual framework of ARGs
   using the information generated by the game.}},

Abstract = {{Along with invention of film technique at the end of 19th century,
   people start to master language of animation art; along with continuous
   development of media technology, different forms of animation art such
   as film animation and current network animation appear successively;
   from evolving process of art forms including cave paintings, hand shadow
   game, shadow play art and raree show, we can feel human's capture
   efforts for object motion and people's record attempts for motion
   process. As the main source of artistic creation, Central Plains culture
   adds more artistic themes to the creation of network animation through a
   variety of artistic means of art processing. Traditional Central Plains
   art has rich and colorful species, such as folk color, folk style, local
   drama, paper-cut art, folklore, etc., the dissemination and inheritance
   of these artistic characteristics need to be driven by a powerful force
   in the era of new media. The intervention of digital information
   technology in the dissemination mode of Central Plains art has changed
   the mode of artistic creation and artistic appreciation, and thus
   influenced and changed the thinking mode of network animation art, and
   ultimately gave birth to the characteristics of network animation art in
   the era of new media.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with measuring eco innovations and their communication
   from two main viewpoints. The first one refers to the standpoint of
   Slovak businesses towards the implemented eco innovations of their
   products while the second one describes the impact of product
   innovations on consumers' purchasing behaviour.
   The first research we carried out by way of the questionnaire in course
   of three years (2012 to 2014) helped us to find out that all businesses
   having implemented their ecological innovations behave in a sustainable
   manner. When promoting eco innovations, they mainly make use of on-line
   communication, direct marketing or public relations while emphasizing
   environmental labelling of their eco-products. It is worth noting that
   they use only one communication tool, which may be considered as a gap
   and therefore, we assume businesses should pay more attention to
   implementing a larger set of tools.
   In the second research, which we carried out in the year 2014, we used
   the questionnaire to reveal what is the influence of eco innovations of
   products on purchasing behaviour of customers. When evaluating the
   results, we discovered that Slovak respondents were aware of the
   products with environmental labelling. However, they show objections
   regarding their labelling on a product package. They also stated a low
   level of information, insufficient communication in the media, print or
   on-line communication channels. One of the solutions may be combining
   classic forms of marketing communication with the digital ones which are
   considered as more ecological and environmentally-friendly.}},

   traditional financial market by disruptive service modes and concepts.
   ``Sesame Credit{''} with unique digital credit means, aiming at
   accurately measuring personal credit score, is one of the key links for
   Ant Financial Services to carry out disruptive innovation. Sesame Credit
   is in open beta period, in spite of wide attention and remarkable
   achievement, it is still at the experimental stage with certain
   limitations. Thus, this paper first discloses the disruptive innovation
   characteristics that Ant Financial Services has, then analyses and
   discusses the scoring of Sesame Credit, and finally on this basis
   proposes an improved personal credit scoring model.}},

Title = {{Quality assurance model for digital adult education materials}},
Journal = {{QUALITY ASSURANCE IN EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{562-585}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to present a model for the quality assurance
   of digital educational material that is appropriate for adult education.
   The proposed model adopts the software quality standard ISO/IEC 9126 and
   takes into account adult learning theories, Bloom's taxonomy of learning
   objectives and two instructional design models: Kolb's model (the
   learning cycle) and Gagne, Briggs and Wager's model.
   Design/methodology/approach - The structure of this paper is as follows:
   in the second section, the theory of ``the learning cycle of Kolb{''} is
   discussed. The third section discusses the model of Gagne, Biggs \&
   Wager. The fourth section discusses and categorizes the characteristics
   and sub-characteristics of the quality of digital educational material.
   The fifth section discusses and categorizes the quality attributes of
   digital educational material. Moreover, the correlation of the
   sub-characteristics of the material with the model of Gagne and that of
   Kolb are examined.
   Findings - The authors developed a quality model that adopts the
   structure of ISO/IEC 9126 standard, using basic notions of theories of
   adult education to define its characteristics and sub-characteristics.
   The model has been successfully applied in the quality evaluation of
   educational material distributed to distance learning adult students.
   Originality/value - The innovative combination of an established quality
   model with sound educational theories yields a comprehensive model that
   allows both a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the
   appropriateness of digital educational material. The applicability of
   the model is demonstrated by applying it to specific digital materials
   specially developed for adult education.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper reports on an investigation of new mobility and
   manufacturing concepts, carried out in the framework of a research
   project funded by the Regional Government of Campania for an innovative
   development of the automotive supply chain. With reference to a new
   concept of sustainability that involves citizens and communities, the
   scenario depicted is characterised by an integrated innovation that
   affects people, new technologies and, generally speaking, as well as by
   the appearance of alternative models generated by individuals and by the
   small production realities scattered across the territory. Just like the
   manufacturing industry is increasingly moving towards new forms of
   production, the mobility sector is also undergoing deep transformations.
   It is with this approach of radical renewal that the present research
   tries to re-imagine the new systems of interaction and involvement of
   users-co-designed models, and digital manufacturing modes leading to the
   efficiency of services and production processes in the automotive
   sector.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses an integrative literature review to explore the concept
   of re-distributed manufacturing and the opportunities to deliver more
   regenerative and resilient systems of production and consumption through
   the application of circular innovation. The study identified multiple
   similarities between the drivers of re-distributed and circular models
   of production and consumption that could be fostered by the use of
   digital intelligence. A set of criteria for redistributed manufacturing
   and circular innovation were developed and used to identify 33 existing
   case studies of consumer goods production. Case study analysis resulted
   in the identification of three types of re-distributed manufacturing
   that integrated characteristics of circular innovation. The paper
   concludes by describing some of the future research challenges in the
   transition towards re-distributed and circular models of production.}},

Abstract = {{To facilitate innovation of value-enabling IT services in a service
   ecosystem, digital service platforms are needed. However, existing
   service platforms, neither fully inscribes premises of the service
   dominant logic, nor the principles of open innovation. Seldom are they
   digital. We argue that there is a lack of consolidated normative theory
   of how to design digital service innovation platforms. This is
   problematic, because it hampers actors in service ecosystems to combine
   and advance their capabilities. To this end, researchers and
   practitioners have jointly designed and evaluated a digital service
   platform using Action Design Research methodology. Accordingly, the
   overall purpose of this paper is to present intermediate results from
   the evaluation of the digital service platform and to contribute nascent
   design principles enabling researchers and practitioners to leverage
   other instances of purposive digital service platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Tujia Ethinic Brocade is a historical precipitation for Tujia people,
   especially for the Tujia women who have unique aesthetic sentiments and
   pursuits. With the rapid development of contemporary society, it is
   difficult and challenging for the Tujia minority to protect and pass on
   their Brocades. In view of the seriousness of this phenomenon, we must
   adopt effective measures to defend them. It is essential to explore
   innovative ways by which to collect data to study Tujia Brocades. By
   exploring digitization design of Tujia Ethinic Brocades, we try to find

Title = {{E-government and transformation of service delivery in developing
   countries The Bangladesh experience and lessons}},
Journal = {{TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT- PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{368-390}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Since 2009, e-government has been high on governmental agenda
   in Bangladesh. Seen as a vehicle for improving governance and service
   delivery, it is also presented as a key to fighting poverty and
   achieving the millennium development goals. Thus, the goals of
   e-government remain broad and ambitious. Can a developing country such
   as Bangladesh realize its e-government vision? The purpose of this paper
   is to explore this and other related questions seeking to draw lessons
   that the Bangladesh experience may offer.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws primarily on secondary
   information, complemented by primary data gathered from various sources.
   In addition to an extensive review of secondary sources, necessary
   information was derived from websites of relevant government
   departments/agencies and through interviews and conversations with
   selected government officials having intimate knowledge on e-government
   projects at the field and local levels.
   Findings - The paper demonstrates the ways in which various
   e-initiatives have transformed traditional administrative systems and
   practices, notwithstanding the nation's limited overall e-development.
   It also shows how e-innovations have helped tackle some complex
   challenges, thereby adding to convenience and benefits to service users.
   A major conclusion of the paper is that although e-government is yet to
   make a breakthrough in governance and service delivery, it has set the
   wheels of change in motion.
   Practical implications - e-government must be seen as a long term
   project, it must attract high-level political support and it requires
   fruitful collaboration between the public, private and non-governmental
   actors.
   Originality/value - This paper adds to the limited knowledge in the
   field. Lessons learned from the Bangladesh experience have much
   relevance to other developing countries with similar socioeconomic
   circumstances. The policymakers and practitioners are expected to
   benefit from the insights of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Transformation is of crucial importance for many enterprises and
   creates new challenges both on the conceptual and architectural level.
   Therefore, a new, secure, and layered architecture is introduced that
   separates the process from the decision model in order to quickly react
   to changed requirements. It provides flexibility by separating three
   aspects of decision-making: foundations, methods, and data. Security and
   reliability is achieved by using a reputation system to judge data
   sources and data contributors. The reputation system offers a score for
   trustworthiness of a data source that could be used for the selection of
   appropriate data sources for decisions as well as a basis to calculate a
   confidence score of a decision.}},

Abstract = {{Many educators desire to see technology as a panacea for inequity in
   education. In this chapter, I argue that technology can, for now, best
   serve civic research by providing new lines of communication and capture
   moments of democratic teaching and learning in action. Through the
   Brooklyn Public Scholars project, I sought to undertake a six-semester
   curriculum design process with students to focus on three generative
   themes in the humanities: difference, democratic thinking, and
   community. These efforts to bring a humanities perspective to democratic
   decision-making encouraged me to expand my civic education aspirations
   to explicitly include my own research into the course curriculum.
   However, Hurricane Sandy brought to the fore levels of resistance to
   using digital technology as well as opportunities to make technology
   adaptable to student needs. Because some students exhibited disruptive
   and self-defeating behaviors in our online learning environments a
   creative use of technology supplemented the work we were doing in the
   college to solve modern challenges in and out of the classroom. This
   chapter explores how technology integration in meaningful civic
   education is a must, not an add-on, and argues that we have to provide
   learners with the digital tools necessary to collaborate globally on
   pressing modern challenges requiring innovative solutions.}},

Abstract = {{A European Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is an important instrument
   for boosting innovation and consolidating the European market and
   offering in a given sector. When it comes to cybersecurity, the
   establishment of a PPP is driven by the need to stimulate the
   competitiveness and innovation capacities of the digital security and
   privacy industry in Europe, and ensuring a sustained supply of
   innovative cybersecurity products and services in Europe. Given the
   growth and severity of cyber-attacks, such an initiative must take into
   account developments in cybercrime and cyberterrorism, including threats
   to particularly vulnerable and high impact areas such as critical
   industrial systems, the issue of trust and privacy, as well as the role
   of specific threat agents. It is therefore important that all relevant
   departments of the European institutions and agencies coordinate their
   efforts and bring in the perspective of Member States so that the full
   range of cybersecurity issues are considered from the public side,
   enabling the private sector to focus its efforts on developing a
   European cybersecurity industry through the adoption of an approach
   linked to the high and fast growth of technological competence and
   competitiveness. Only with strong governance and a dynamic approach can
   a PPP on cybersecurity develop a sustainable Digital Single Market
   ecosystem in Europe, making it a real and global cybersecurity leader.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter explores the origin and the ambitions of the CESL and its
   rules on contents and effects of contracts. Firstly, the chapter
   evidences how the CESL relies on previous models such as the Vienna
   Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG), the Principles of
   European Contract Law (PECL), the Unidroit Principles of International
   Commercial Contracts (UPICC), the Draft Common Frame of Reference
   (DCFR), and some EU directives in the field of contract law. The chapter
   thereby demonstrates that the CESL rules on contents and effects of
   contracts are not innovative, since almost all of them originate from
   the PECL (with the exception of two rules, of which one takes pattern
   from the DCFR and the other follows the model of the EU Consumer Rights
   Directive). Secondly, this chapter discusses whether the ambition of the
   CESL really consists in improving the functioning of the internal
   market, as the choice of art 114 TFEU as a legal basis might suggest.
   The chapter criticizes the latter choice and submits that invoking art
   114 TFEU for such an instrument is hardly compatible with the case law
   of the ECJ. Arguably, the most important ambition of the CESL is not its
   internal market functionality but a different one: The CESL
   substantially contains model rules of general contract law, suitable for
   all contracts, not just for sales of goods or digital content.
   Therefore, the CESL rules are important for the future of private law in
   Europe.}},

Abstract = {{New educational models are necessary to update learning environments to
   the digitally shared communication and information reality. Collective
   intelligence is an emerging field that already has a significant impact
   in many areas and will have great implications in education, not only
   from the side of new methodologies but also as a challenge for
   education, currently more focused on the individual than in the
   collective. This paper proposes an approach to a collective intelligence
   model of teaching using Internet to combine two strategies: idea
   management and real time assessment in the class. A digital tool named
   Fabricius has been created supporting these two elements to foster the
   collaboration, empowerment and engagement of students in the learning
   process. As a result of the research we propose a list of KPI trying to
   measure individual and collective performance in a course. We are
   conscious that this is just a first approach to define which aspects of
   a class following a course can be qualified and quantified. We finally
   discuss the need to connect research and innovation in this field.}},

Abstract = {{The Cognitive Learning Theory explains the brain as the most incredible
   network of information processing and interpretation. The ability to
   learn and make sense of new information is crucial to successful
   learning and that is why developing cognitive skills is so important.
   The current study proposes a new cognitive training application, which
   aims to help people (both children and adults) improve their learning
   skills, especially for those having particular difficulties, as poor
   visual memory or poor content memory. The functionalities, the
   technological details, implementation issues which were overcome with
   innovative solutions, as well as the strengths of the application are
   highlighted in the paper, in the context of other IT - supported
   instruments for cognitive learning. Our tool consists into a desktop
   application which offers for the user the choice of several learning
   games, e.g. 2048, Image, Digit Puzzle and Box Matching. The tool also
   helps the user track his or her progress by registering the high scores
   and the record times. Therefore, the competitive capabilities could be
   also developed for those who ought to improve these skills throughout
   this application. Completely written in C++ and using the custom graphic
   library built from the ground up, the developed app boasts superior
   performance over other applications of the same type using the default
   or other much more complex libraries written in C. The graphic library
   uses just the amount of computer power that it needs in order to offer
   the user a simple and fluid experience. Thus, we claim that our tool
   exploits successfully gamification and human computer interface
   principles to offer an accessible instrument to all individuals aiming
   to improve their lives, by solving their attention deficit disorder or
   poor memory issues, by enhancing their prediction skills and mind
   reflection abilities or by offering relaxation and pleasant game-based
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the technology evolves rapidly and with it increases the need
   for qualified professionals in the field of ICT. Employment of IT
   professionals is projected to grow worldwide by 22\% till 2022, much
   faster than the average for all occupations. The main reason for this
   rapid growth is a large increase in the market demand for computer
   software and mobile applications. In regard, nonprofit organizations and
   established businesses are looking for alternative ways to educate and
   grow the number of people, in particular students, involved in learning
   computer programming. On the other hand, most of the students regardless
   of their age have access to the Internet via laptops, tablets,
   smartphones which turns them into intuitive and everyday learners and
   gives them access to unlimited resources, content and information in the
   form of web-based platforms, mobile e-learning applications, social
   media, online games and others providing abundant and diverse learning
   experience. However, no matter how fast technology evolves and how many
   alternative teaching techniques are introduced constantly, the major
   challenge of the education still remains motivation. In this context,
   students are more driven to learn by playing online games, interacting
   via social media and expressing themselves via digital resources rather
   than struggling with the traditional educational methods. A relatively
   new, but gaining popularity, form of education is the use of interactive
   online e-learning platforms that merge the possibility of learning
   computer programming skills while building digital games. Most of the
   platforms are designed using gamification approach and provide vast and
   entertaining methods, based on rich user experience, interaction and
   simulation. The purpose of this paper is to present these innovative
   e-learning platforms for learning computer programming, to explore their
   features, advantages and drawbacks as well as to investigate the impact
   of the interactive learning experience they create.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a serious game, implemented as a software
   application, aimed towards beginner programmers with the purpose of
   teaching programming languages fundamentals. The application is a
   top-down 2D game combining elements from the shooter and strategy (
   particularly tower defence) genres, with high-level visual programming
   elements, giving it an educational component. The user creates the
   scripts in a visual manner, creating the flow of scripting elements then
   programming each element. Serious games are games which are designed and
   developed without having entertainment as their main purpose. Instead,
   their primary purpose is to educate, train, or inform their audience.
   The meaning of the term has evolved in the last few years and currently
   it is usually assumed that serious games are video games, rather than
   physical, non-digital games. Digital game-based learning is a subset of
   serious games having as a main purpose to educate the player through the
   use of video games. Video games manage to keep the players interested,
   even if they find themselves in challenging situations, and this is on
   account of the intrinsic motivation they achieve to maintain on the
   players. What makes learning an intrinsically motivating process is
   similar to what makes a video game intrinsically motivating, this being
   challenge, curiosity, fantasy and control. Contextualization,
   personalization, and choice improve the intrinsic motivation of a
   learner, thus increasing their degree of engagement in the learning
   process and ameliorating their learning performance. These three
   properties are often present in most video games. This compatibility
   between video games and learning makes integrating the one to the other
   an easier accomplishment. While some other serious games aimed at
   programming exist, such as RoboCode, CodeCombat, Kernel Panic, CoLoBoT,
   CeeBot, CodeSpells, there is still much room for innovation, and our
   application explores new features and modes of play, focusing more on
   the program structure and logic than on the syntax.}},

Abstract = {{In the information society digitalized data are all around us, which
   means that the world cultural heritage is nearer than ever. For using
   this treasure and making it circulate, the only condition is to have
   digital competences. That's why educational system has to be oriented in
   that way, making huge possibilities of ICT available to students during
   the learning process. So, new education has to be doubly oriented:
   toward implementation of technology, in order to facilitate transfer of
   knowledge, and toward process of acquiring knowledge itself, which
   implies appropriate pedagogical methodology i. e. new patterns of
   learning, using different internet sources, from e-books or e-media to
   e-games. The fact is that the teaching/learning process has to reflect
   constant dynamic changes of world and new rules of life, especially when
   students are ``digital natives{''}. It provokes a new culture of
   learning. The aim of this paper is to discuss how to create adequate
   e-learning environment for better learning about different cultures. As
   an example we describe e-learning strategies used in courses of French
   and Francophone Literature and Culture, at the Department of Romance
   Studies, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Novi Sad. New pedagogical
   methods are based on innovative types of learning in a way not only to
   increase students' knowledge, but to make them understand cultural
   values, to incite critical thinking and motivate them for further
   research. The students' response to activities and their answers to
   questionnaires make us believe that such learning has two dimensions: an
   explicit one (concrete knowledge about cultural goods), and also a tacit
   dimension, which is much more important to be recognized and applied,
   and is related to understanding cultural frames in question, in other
   words, to discover why is something important to life and society.}},

Abstract = {{The workshop aims to show the methods used for the developing of the
   transversal Skill Generator Assessment Game. The objectives are: -
   Enhancing digital integration in learning, teaching, training and youth
   work at various levels; - Promoting entrepreneurship education and
   social entrepreneurship among young people. The workshop describes the
   steps for developing an ICT-based education tool simulating real life
   situations in order to support apprentices/VET students to enhance and
   foster transversal skills needed by the current labour market. The score
   system embedded within the e-learning tool, instead, will provide a
   structure for the assessment of the skills developed. Due to the current
   labour market changes, there is a clear tendency towards the broadening
   of the required skills portfolio at all occupational levels, linked to
   ``non-routine{''} tasks. For example, ICT professionals have to develop
   skills in marketing or management; services workers have to develop
   customer-oriented skills and digital literacy or tourism services
   professionals have to look for new ways to attract interest by potential
   clients. In many knowledge-intensive sectors, skills as managerial and
   scientific knowledge are in fact more and more frequently needed. This
   reflects the growing demand from employers for transversal key
   competences. These personal attributes enhance an individual's
   interactions, job performance and career prospects. The transversal
   skills are crucial for employees themselves as well. There are many
   youngsters choosing self-employment as an alternative option to the
   regular employment. Young people still in education or training have not
   yet acquired the necessary knowledge and experiences or skills needed to
   decide whether the self-employment is suitable as their future career.
   While hard skills include job specific knowledge, transversal skills
   relate to a person's ability to interact effectively with co-workers and
   customers and are broadly applicable both in and outside the workplace,
   such as problem-solving, analytical skills, self-management and
   communication skills and stress management skills. Beside the regular
   entrepreneurial courses focused on economy, business planning, financial
   management etc. it is crucial for these young people to develop
   transversal skills, promoting ones creativity, innovativeness, ability
   to work in team or communication skills. As the output will be an
   e-learning product will run within the Moodle e-learning platform as LMS
   providing an infrastructure for MOOC.}},

Abstract = {{Textile design is basically the process of creating designs for woven,
   knitted or printed fabrics. To create a seamless repeat pattern or
   design on a textile fabric are used different traditional and digital
   art techniques. A pencil and paper could be present during the first
   part of this process. In order to complete a design and transfer it to
   the textile surface, before fabric weaving, knitting or printing
   process, it is necessary to use professional software. ArahPaint is
   Arahne's open source software which can be downloaded it for free along
   with a demo version of programs ArahWeave for weaving and ArahDrape for
   mapping. ArahPaint is a drawing program for the textile professionals,
   but in equal measure and for the engineering students who intend to
   develop their full creative potential as surface textile pattern
   designers. This paper presents the advantages of using ArahPaint as an
   inspired and unlimited teaching tool based on the elements and
   principles of construction of seamless repeat patterns. Some of the most
   important features of ArahPaint program are related to ability to
   magnifying the drawings with a specifiable scale, degree of
   magnification and units, to working with large images up to 30.000 x
   30.000 pixels, to drawing instantaneous in seamless repeat across
   borders, to viewing multiple repeats, to previewing the pattern in
   repeat and to generating fast pattern designs with special filters.
   ArahPaint contains many other useful tools for creative works, which,
   obviously, can never replace the human creativity, imagination and
   innovation, but can be used to explore a variety of repeat pattern
   formats. In connection with the process of converting a design idea into
   a fabric are presented the steps and modalities to creating repeat
   patterns for jacquard woven fabrics.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the severe economic crisis, Greek historic heritage is in
   risk. Historic cities as Hermoupolis, were dealing with this risk years
   before the crisis. The current situation needed drastic action, with
   innovative low cost ideas. The historic building stock in Hermoupolis
   counts more than 1.200 buildings. By recording the pathology, the GIS
   and the D.B.M.S ``HERMeS{''} with the appropriate algorithms identify
   the historic buildings in risk. In the first application of the system
   those buildings were 160, with a rate of 2.4 historic buildings
   collapsing every year. The prioritization of interventions in these
   buildings is critical, as it is not possible to lower the collapsing
   risk simultaneously in 160 buildings, but neither the interventions can
   be judged solely by the reactions of local residents. Bearing in mind
   the fact that one, given the current economic conditions, has to make
   best use of the funds for this purpose, it is proved that the relevant
   decision requires multi criteria analysis method of prioritizing
   interventions. Specifically, the analysis takes into account the risk of
   collapse of each building, but in connection with a series of other
   variables, such as the role of building in Hermoupolis, the position in
   the city, the influence in other areas of interest, the social impact
   etc. The final result is a catalogue with historic buildings and a point
   system, which reflects the risk of loosing the building. The point
   system leads to a Conservation Plan for the city of Hermoupolis, giving
   the hierarchy of interventions that must be done in order to save the
   maximum architecture heritage with the minimum funds, postponing the
   risk of collapsing. In 2015, EU \& EUROPA-NOSTRA awarded the
   above-mentioned project in the category of ``Research \&
   Digitization{''}.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature of the sea surface has been identified as an important
   parameter of the natural environment, governing processes that occur in
   the upper ocean. This paper focuses on the analysis of the Sea Surface
   Temperature (SST) anomalies at the greater area of Cyprus. For that, SST
   data derived from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   instrument on board both Aqua and Terra sun synchronous satellites were
   used. A four year period was chosen as a first approach to address and
   describe this phenomenon. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has
   been used as an integrated platform of analysis and presentation in
   addition of the support of MATLAB (R). The methodology consists of five
   steps: (i) Collection of MODIS SST imagery, (ii) Development of the
   digital geo-database; (iii) Model and run the methodology in GIS as a
   script; (iv) Calculation of SST anomalies; and (v) Visualization of the
   results.
   The SST anomaly values have presented a symmetric distribution over the
   study area with an increase trend through the years of analysis. The
   calculated monthly and annual average SST anomalies (ASST) make more
   obvious this trend, with negative and positive SST changes to be
   distributed over the study area. In terms of seasons, the same increase
   trend presented during spring, summer, autumn and winter with 2013 to be
   the year with maximum ASST observed values. Innovative aspects comprise
   of straightforward integration and modeling of available tools,
   providing a versatile platform of analysis and semi-automation of the
   operation. In addition, the fine resolution maps that extracted from the
   analysis with a wide spatial coverage, allows the detail representation
   of SST and ASST respectively in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Digital heritage data are now more accessible through crowdsourcing
   platforms, social media and blogs. At the same time, evolving technology
   on 3D modelling, laser scanning and 3D reconstruction is constantly
   upgrading and multiplying the information that we can use from heritage
   digitalisation. The question of reusing the information in different
   aspects rises. Educators and students are potential users of the digital
   content; developing for them an adaptable environment for applications
   and services is our challenge. One of the main objective of the EU
   Europeana Space project is the development of a holistic approach for
   educating people (grown ups and kids) on Monuments that are listed at
   UNESCO world heritage list, in Cyprus. The challenge was the use of
   Europeana Data (Pictures and the 3D objects) in a way that the
   information on the platform would be comprehensible by the users. Most
   of the data have little metadata information and they lack history and
   cultural value description (semantics). The proposed model ction is
   based on the cross cultural approach which responds to the multicultural
   features of present era but at the same time to the contemporary
   pedagogical and methodological directions. The system uses all
   innovative digital heritage resources, in order to help the user, in a
   UX friendly way, to learn about the different phases of the monument,
   the history, the pathology state, the architectural value and the
   conservation stage. The result is a responsive platform, accessible
   through smart devices and desktop computers, (in the frame of ``Bring
   Your Own Device{''} a.k.a. BYOD) where every Monument is a different
   course and every course is addressed to different age groups (from
   elementary level to adults' vocational training).}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the implementation of innovation in education at
   the University of West Bohemia (UWB) at the Faculty of Mechanical
   Engineering (FME). The main aim of these innovations is to introduce
   Project-Based Learning (PBL), which forces students to acquire deeper
   information about the issues that they are dealing with. PBL is playing
   an increasingly larger role in technical education all around the world,
   because this type of education is very advantageous for technical fields
   and so it is necessary to implement it effectively in our Faculty too.
   The aim of these innovations is primarily to enhance our students'
   practical knowledge and make teaching of technical subjects more
   attractive for students and thereby motivate more applicants to study at
   FME. `Today there is a great need to enhance science and math education
   and to broaden the learning experience to make it more enjoyable.'
   (Snyder et al., 2014) Implementation of PBL is described here using the
   examples of reverse engineering and rapid prototyping. These two modern
   methods are used in engineering practice for digitalization of already
   produced parts and for production of prototypes. Students at FME have
   the opportunity to become acquainted with these unconventional methods
   during their study of certain subjects, within which they can deal with
   projects similar to those occurring in real practice. These specific
   subjects provide students with practically applicable know-how which is
   important for every engineer.}},

Abstract = {{The paper aims to contribute at the debate on smart tourism destinations
   as intelligent configuration of regional integrated and multi-sectorial
   system, evaluating the promptness of Apulia, as regional destination of
   growing popularity. At this purpose, a web-survey was used to gather
   data regarding the level of use of technologies, internet and social
   media for communication; the collaboration attitude and the level of
   integration with the other actors of the tourism system for creating new
   and innovative business opportunities; the level of interaction and
   collaboration with customers for experience and service co-creation; and
   the advantages and the main drawbacks related to the use of ICT
   applications. The results of context analysis evidence that the Apulian
   offering of hospitality need to invest more in the ICTs' infrastructure,
   increasing digital services for customers and employees as well as in
   the creation of a cultural background able to sustain the process of
   emancipation of the destination in a smart perspective. Moreover,
   results suggest also the needs to create a culture of collaboration,
   enhancing dynamic interaction between diverse tourism actors.}},

Abstract = {{Watermarking protects legitimate copies of digital multimedia from
   unauthorised use. Digital watermarks are used to verify the
   authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of data. Watermark
   generation is one of the most important aspects of watermarking schemes,
   and should aim to produce as small a watermark to reduce the complexity
   of computational processes. Although embedding a large amount of
   watermark data increases the chances of recovering it, this also
   increases the complexity, which can become impractical for real-time
   applications. In this paper, we focus on the robustness of medical image
   watermarks and present a means to generate a small watermark. This idea
   is very innovative in the watermarking field. The proposed approach is
   based on zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZBDDs). Application
   of ZBDD to medical image watermarking will help us to take into account
   the complexity, the capacity and the watermark robustness factors. The
   results obtained are very significant and encouraging.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to test the promise of the NumberShire
   Level 1 Gaming Intervention (NS1) to accelerate math learning for
   first-grade students with or at risk for math difficulties. The NS1
   intervention was developed through the Institute of Education Sciences,
   Small Business Innovation Research Program (Gause, Fien, Baker, \&
   Clarke, 2011) as a digitally based technology tool to allow educators to
   intervene early and strategically with students struggling to learn
   mathematics. This study used a randomized controlled trial design to
   test the promise of the NS1 intervention. In total, 250 first-grade
   students were randomly assigned within classrooms to the treatment
   condition or a control condition. Results indicate significant effects
   favoring the treatment group on proximal measures of whole-number
   concepts and skills. Intervention effects were not statistically
   significant for distal outcome measures. Treatment effects were not
   moderated by special education or English learner status; however, the
   condition by initial skill level interaction approached significance.
   Additionally, there was no relationship between dosage variables and
   students' response to the intervention. Limitations and future
   directions for research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the second Logbook related to a series of
   compositions whose constructions were based on the digital analysis of
   spectral content. The procedure was applied in the preparation of the
   work ``O azeite, a lua e o rio - numa ilha rodeada de ouro, com agua ate
   o joelho{''} for flute; clarinet and cello (2013). A programming
   environment was developed in PD, together with a sound analysis library
   using audio descriptors called PDescriptors. We performed several
   experiments to evaluate a variety of timbre settings, relating them to
   perceivable qualities of sounds such as ``roughness{''} and
   ``smoothness{''}, with intensities ranging from pianissimo to
   fortissimo. This second Logbook confirms not only the applicability but
   also the potential for innovation that an embedding of such technologies
   in both the creative process and musical analysis may entail}},

Abstract = {{Medicine management is at the core of hospital care and digitalization
   of prescribing and administration of medicines is often the focus of
   attention of health IT programs. This may be conveyed to the public in
   terms of the elimination of paper-based drug charts and increased
   readability of doctors' prescriptions. Based on analysis of documents
   about hospital medicines supply and use (including systems'
   implementation) in the UK, in this conceptual paper electronic
   prescribing and administration are repositioned as only one aspect of an
   important wider transformation in medicine management in hospital
   settings, involving, for example, procurement, dispensing, auditing,
   waste management, research and safety vigilance. Approaching
   digitalization from a systemic perspective has the potential to uncover
   the wider implications of this transformation for patients, the
   organization and the wider health care system.}},

Abstract = {{Limited informatics competency uptake is a recognized nursing leadership
   challenge impacting digital practice settings. The health system's
   inability to reap the promised benefits of EHRs is a manifestation of
   inadequate development of informatics competencies by chief nurse
   executives (CNEs) and other clinicians. Through the application of
   Transformational Leadership Theory (TL), this discussion paper explains
   how informatics competencies enable CNEs to become transformational
   nursing leaders in digital health allowing them to meet their
   accountabilities to lead integrated, high-quality care delivery through
   evidence based practices (EBPs). It is proposed that successful CNE
   eHealth sponsors will be those armed with informatics competencies who
   can drive health organizations' investment in technology and innovation.
   Finally, some considerations are suggested in how nurse informaticists
   globally play a critical role in preparing our existing and future CNEs
   to fulfill their transformational leader roles in the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{Seamless patient identification, as well as locating capabilities of
   remote services, are considered to be key enablers for large scale
   deployment of facilities to support the delivery of cross-border
   healthcare. This work highlights challenges investigated within the
   context of the Electronic Simple European Networked Services (e-SENS)
   large scale pilot (LSP) project, aiming to assist the deployment of
   cross-border, digital, public services through generic, re-usable
   technical components or Building Blocks (BBs). Through the case for the
   cross-border ePrescription/Patient Summary (eP/ PS) service the paper
   demonstrates how experience coming from other domains, in regard to
   electronic identification (eID) and capability lookup, can be utilized
   in trying to raise technology readiness levels in disease diagnosis and
   treatment. The need for consolidating the existing outcomes of nonhealth
   specific BBs is examined, together with related issues that need to be
   resolved, for improving technical certainty and making it easier for
   citizens who travel to use innovative eHealth services, and potentially
   share personal health records (PHRs) with other providers abroad, in a
   regulated manner.}},

Abstract = {{Foundational theories of the public sphere prioritize civic speech while
   distrusting forms of visuality. As a corrective to this model of the
   public sphere, rhetorical theorists have recently emphasized visuality
   as a constitutive mode of contemporary public culture, but they
   nevertheless tend to prioritize the civic actor over the civic
   spectator. A productive alternative would begin to distinguish an
   emerging shift from ``deliberative publicity{''} to ``photographic
   publicity.{''} The bourgeois public sphere innovated verbal
   communicative practices that produced a specifically deliberative
   publicity, enabling one resolution to the core political problems of an
   earlier (feudal) era. Likewise, contemporary publics utilize emerging
   digital technologies to produce a specifically photographic publicity,
   allowing them to address fundamental limitations of the bourgeois public
   sphere. Photographic publicity helps us rethink the problem of the
   public sphere in terms of theatricality and civic spectatorship.}},

Abstract = {{The use of computational formats and digital tools including machine
   fabrication by indigenous people worldwide to augment traditional
   practices and material culture is becoming more and more commonplace.
   However within the practice of architecture while there are indigenous
   architectural practitioners utilizing digital tools, it is unclear as to
   whether there is motivation to implement traditional indigenous
   knowledge in conjunction with these computational instruments and
   methodologies. This paper explores how the tools might be used to
   investigate the potential for indigenous development, cultural
   empowerment and innovation. It also describes a general methodology
   whereby capacity can be shared between academia and indigenous groups to
   foster new knowledge through a recently implemented indigenous focused
   design research entity, SITUA. The importance and significant research
   potential of what we term domain based research' is reinforced through
   the exploration of emergent materials and building systems located
   within specific tribal domains. A recent project employing 3D clay
   extrusion printing is used to illustrate this approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates an agency of materials through a design
   methodology that follows Martin Heidegger's process of ``Entbergen{''}
   or ``unconcealing{''} as a non-instrumentalist understanding of tools
   and materials. This investigation takes place through the design of a
   children's theatre in South Africa where material innovation for
   architectural components is needed. The research studies vernacular
   African patterns and their inherent behaviour when transferred to
   materials. The transference of pattern systems to architectural
   prototypes is discussed alongside the discussion of their technical and
   architectural performance criteria. Following Heidegger's theory of
   ``Entbergen{''} ({''}unconcealing{''}) the paper will demonstrate how
   making in this methodology becomes an ``unconcealing{''}, which includes
   both digital and analogue means, linking the four causalities - causa
   materialis, causa formalis, causa finalis, and causa efficiens - through
   the agency of material within an integrated process between all four
   causes. Making becomes a process in which form is generated through
   interventions within fields of forces and currents of materials, taking
   cause and agency into account, and standing in opposition to methods
   that are defined by a premeditated notion of an ideal outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural heritage is traditionally mediated through institutional bodies
   that are authorised to broadcast heritage information, whereas new media
   technologies such as social media platforms continue to enforce
   individual storytelling and information sharing. Therefore GLAMs
   (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) have to cope with a shift
   of public interest from their services to more accessible, entertaining
   and democratic engagements available as `living' media. Unmediated
   cultural heritage is the paramount aim of this work and, in a
   theoretical sense, a utopia for generation of authenticity or
   meaning-making. Within the realm of digital heritage, this study
   explores the nature of engagement with cultural heritage using an
   innovative means. In this phase of the research, a photogrammetric model
   of Kashgar's narrow alleys is deployed in a system, called Hybrid
   Virtual Environment 3D (Hyve-3D). Via its 3D cursor technology, the
   concept of unmediated cultural heritage is unfolded through active
   participation, collaboration and interaction. Thus, in the context of
   heritage, this research explores a hitherto undocumented frontier of
   Hyve-3D designated to immersive collaborative 3D sketching.}},

Abstract = {{The CorkCrete arch is a 1: 1 scale construction aiming at testing the
   use of robotic fabrication technologies in the production of a novel
   building system made out of two different materials - cork and concrete
   (GRC). The combination of these materials is promising since it merges
   the sustainable and performative properties of first with the structural
   efficiency of the second one. The result is a material system suited for
   customized prefabrication and easy on-site installation. The current
   paper describes the design and fabrication process of the arch, which
   employed a single parametric design environment to bridge design and
   fabrication, and an innovative sequence of different robotic processes.
   The success of this experience invites the team to continue this
   research into the future construction of larger scale applications.}},

Abstract = {{Building on the research on the industrial potential of digital
   fabrication technologies commenced by the late University of Melbourne
   academic, Professor Bharat Dave, this paper explores actual patterns of
   technological adoption within communities of practice bound together in
   a few selected projects. Its main aim is three-fold: 1) highlight the
   distribution of knowledge required for the actual take-up of digital
   technologies; 2) look for the presence of possible gaps in such work
   landscapes; and 3) discuss the transformations that may occur in
   practice as a result of the conflation of innovative technologies and
   established professional cultures. The research being reported in this
   paper examines the socio-technical environment of the projects selected
   and the challenges intrinsic to the introduction of innovative digital
   technologies. Its findings suggest that the inherent complexity of
   building production needs to be considered in a far more nuanced and
   substantive manner than generally assumed by mainstream technological
   positivism.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an integral design that combines optical system with
   image processing is introduced to obtain high resolution images, and the
   performance is evaluated and demonstrated. Traditional imaging methods
   often separate the two technical procedures of optical system design and
   imaging processing, resulting in the failures in efficient cooperation
   between the optical and digital elements. Therefore, an innovative
   approach is presented to combine the merit function during optical
   design together with the constraint conditions of image processing
   algorithms. Specifically, an optical imaging system with low resolution
   is designed to collect the image signals which are indispensable for
   imaging processing, while the ultimate goal is to obtain high resolution
   images from the final system. In order to optimize the global
   performance, the optimization function of ZEMAX software is utilized and
   the number of optimization cycles is controlled. Then Wiener filter
   algorithm is adopted to process the image simulation and mean squared
   error (MSE) is taken as evaluation criterion. The results show that,
   although the optical figures of merit for the optical imaging systems is
   not the best, it can provide image signals that are more suitable for
   image processing. In conclusion. The integral design of optical system
   and image processing can search out the overall optimal solution which
   is missed by the traditional design methods. Especially, when designing
   some complex optical system, this integral design strategy has obvious
   advantages to simplify structure and reduce cost, as well as to gain
   high resolution images simultaneously, which has a promising perspective
   of industrial application.}},

   digital rock cores into physical rock models. Dynamic compressive and
   Brazilian disc tests were performed on the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar
   (SHPB) system to study its dynamic behaviours. The experimental results
   indicate that the strength properties and pre-peak stress-time curve of
   the 3DP models agree well with those of the rock samples. Fracturing
   process and failure pattern of the 3DP Brazilian disc are also similar
   to the rock sample. The innovative approach of incorporating micro-CT

Abstract = {{Digital technologies and social media platforms are changing civic
   expectations surrounding interaction with government. Local governments
   hold key positions in the development of digital spaces for civic
   participation in the issues that directly impact citizens' everyday
   lives. However, local practices largely prioritise information and
   services over reciprocal dialogue with citizens. This chapter explores
   digital civic engagement in Australian local governments. It draws from
   a nation-wide survey of councils' digital practices to highlight that
   opportunities for civic participation are increasing, particularly
   through social media. However, substantial discrepancies exist between
   the digital practices of rural and urban local governments. This
   discrepancy is further examined through comments from seven rural
   councils that participated in a workshop on digital engagement, and the
   views of urban citizens (through focus groups) whose local government
   offers advanced digital practices. For the rural authorities, key
   challenges to digital development include limited connectivity,
   capacity, and financial resources, as well as the different expectations
   that citizens have in relation to social media use. For the (urban)
   citizens, participation in online spaces has gone unanswered by their
   government, which is creating a sense of disenfranchisement. While there
   is evidence of innovation in Australian digital local government, civic
   demand and government use largely fail to align. Councils need to
   reconceptualise current approaches to digital engagement by considering
   the purpose of participatory spaces and integrating their use into
   everyday operations. Moreover, greater government receptivity and
   responsiveness is required to enable civic participation to inform local
   decision-making. Such involvement allows citizens to develop a sense of
   connection with local government and facilitates increased civic
   engagement.}},

Abstract = {{The core idea behind the concurrent engineering is an integration of
   upstream and downstream activities of design/manufacturing in order to
   produce better products in a timely manner. Digital engineering is one
   of the critical approaches towards this integration, and this approaches
   enables the promising area of digital dentistry. Digital dentistry is
   defined as a dental technology or device that incorporates digital or
   computer-controlled tools, for example, dental CAD/CAM systems. This
   research focuses on the area of dental wire clasp, which has been
   manufactured by manual bending operation performed by the skilled dental
   technicians. Normally, a team of dental doctor and dental technician
   works collaboratively to design and manufacture the dental wire clasp.
   However, the accuracy of the bending operation is inconsistent and
   depends mainly on the expertise of the technicians. This paper describes
   the current situation of dental wire clasp manufacturing, reviews some
   of the innovative computer- aided wire bending systems, and proposes a
   framework of collaborative prosthodontics wire clasp design and
   fabrication using an idea of virtual engineering approach in digital
   dentistry.}},

Title = {{Image Montaging for Creating a Virtual Pathology Slide: An Innovative
   and Economical Tool to Obtain a Whole Slide Image}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICAL CELLULAR PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Background. Microscopes are omnipresent throughout the field of
   biological research. With microscopes one can see in detail what is
   going on at the cellular level in tissues. Though it is a ubiquitous
   tool, the limitation is that with high magnification there is a small
   field of view. It is often advantageous to see an entire sample at high
   magnification. Over the years technological advancements in optics have
   helped to provide solutions to this limitation of microscopes by
   creating the so-called dedicated ``slide scanners{''} which can provide
   a ``whole slide digital image.{''} These scanners can provide seamless,
   large-field-of-view, high resolution image of entire tissue section. The
   only disadvantage of such complete slide imaging system is its
   outrageous cost, thereby hindering their practical use by most
   laboratories, especially in developing and low resource countries.
   Methods. In a quest for their substitute, we tried commonly used image
   editing software Adobe Photoshop along with a basic image capturing
   device attached to a trinocular microscope to create a digital pathology
   slide. Results. The seamless image created using Adobe Photoshop
   maintained its diagnostic quality. Conclusion. With time and effort
   photomicrographs obtained from a basic camera-microscope set up can be
   combined and merged in Adobe Photoshop to create a whole slide digital
   image of practically usable quality at a negligible cost.}},

   moving out of this pragmatic definition, we will realize that the use of
   digital acquisition techniques, which allow to carry out the analysis of
   archaeological artifacts without tactile contact and with a high degree
   of detail, call for new skills of digital data acquisition and
   management. The results that can be obtained may be innovative under

   integrated we are. We are ecological creatures interfaced by our
   sensoriness, microbiomes, shared regulatory (endocrine) mechanisms,
   immune system, biorhythms and nutritional pathways. Many of us are
   `nature-deprived'. We now suffer what might be termed ecological health
   disorders (EHD). If there were less of us, nature's resilience might
   cope, but more than 9 billion people by 2050 is probably an intolerable
   demand on the planet. Future food must increasingly take into account
   the pressures on ecosystem-dependent food systems, with foods probably
   less biodiverse, although eating in this way allows optimal health;
   energy dysequilibrium with less physical activity and foods
   inappropriately energy dense; and less socially-conducive food habits.
   `Personalised Nutrition', with extensive and resource-demanding
   nutrigenomic, metabolomic and microbiomic data may provide partial
   health solutions in clinical settings, but not be justified for ethical,
   risk management or sustainability reasons in public health. The globally
   prevalent multidimensional malnutritional problems of food insecurity,
   quality and equity require local, regional and global action to prevent
   further ecosystem degradation as well as to educate, provide sustainable
   livelihoods and encourage respectful social discourse and practice about
   the role of food.}},

Journal = {{COGENT ARTS \& HUMANITIES}},

Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Melanie Swalwell has discussed how `locality has largely been left out
   of game history, at least until recently'. Moreover, much of the
   research and literature about the still young history of video games has
   been conducted following a cult of celebrity mostly concerned with
   highlighting American and Japanese perspectives. Swalwell, discusses
   `the great historic diversity of contexts and games to play with', and
   considering that technological innovation is a multi-centred complex
   processnot the linear progression depicted in many writings-this article
   focuses on the specific context of the early eighties in Spain, in a
   decisive moment wherein personal computers began to reach markets, even
   though information on how to program them was confusing and difficult to
   access. While both, programming and gameplay are sometimes described as
   solitary or antisocial activities, this paper explores the landscape of
   Spanish computer games in the early eighties through a case study of the
   Spanish computer game ``Bugaboo (The Flea){''} programmed by Francisco
   Portalo and Francisco Suarez, ironically, released before in the UK (in
   1983) rather than Spain. By following the traces that this game was
   leaving behind (even before it was programmed), I will show the
   performative potential that this game had, first of all, as a way of
   tinkering and learning among enthusiasts and practitioners onto how to
   master micro computers and, afterwards, becoming a digital commodity as
   well as a bargaining chip in the negotiations to distribute Amstrad
   micro computers in Spain.}},

Abstract = {{In a traditional automotive cooling system, energy optimization could be
   achieved by controlling the engine temperature by means of several
   sensors placed inside the cooling circuit. Nevertheless, in some cases
   the increasing use of a great number of sensor devices makes the control
   system too bulky, expensive and not sufficiently robust for the intended
   application. This paper presents the development of a heavy-duty
   automotive cooling axial fan with morphing blades activated by Shape
   Memory Alloy (SMA) strips that work as actuator elements in the
   polymeric blade structure. The application of smart materials to
   compact, high-energy density devices as well as the development of
   modeling and control systems has been of great interest during the last
   decade. SMAs are frequently combined within monolithic or composite host
   materials to produce adaptive structures whose properties could be tuned
   in response to external stimuli.
   The blade was designed to achieve the activation of the strips
   (purposely thermo-mechanically treated) by means of an air stream flow.
   With the aim of studying the morphing capability of the adaptive
   structure together with the recovery behavior of the NiTi strips, four
   different polymeric compounds have been compared in a
   specifically-designed wind tunnel.
   Digital image analysis techniques have been performed to quantitatively
   analyze the blade deflections and to evaluate the most suitable
   polymeric matrix for the intended application. As the airstream flow
   increases in temperature, the strips recover the memorized bent shape,
   leading to a camber variation. To study the possibility of employing SMA
   strips as actuator elements, a comparison with common viscous clutch
   behavior is proposed. The time range actuator response indicates that
   the SMA strips provide a lower frequency control that fits well with the
   engine coolant thermal requirement. The experimental results demonstrate
   the capability of SMA materials to accommodate the lower power actuators
   in the automotive field. Finally, the blade tip airfoils, reconstructed
   using a CAD procedure, were used to study the fluid dynamic behavior of
   the blade tip airfoil. A CFD numerical simulation was carried out in
   order to highlight the differences in the airfoil performance due to the
   different shapes of the blade. The analyses showed that the activated
   blade tip airfoil led to an increase in the lift coefficient according
   to the stiffness provided by the polymeric compound.
   This innovative passive control system results from the selection of (i)
   the memorized shape of the SMA strips and (ii) the polymeric compound
   used for the blade structure.}},

Abstract = {{Recent outcomes of a trans-disciplinary debate spreading in America,
   Europe and Asia among scholars and practitioners in spatial planning,
   urban design, landscape architecture, and Geographic Information
   Science, propose the concept of Geodesign as a framework for planning
   and design aiming at addressing some of the most urgent issues of
   sustainable growth. Geodesign entails the application of methods and
   techniques for planning sustainable development in an integrated
   process, from project conceptualization to analysis, simulation and
   evaluation, from scenario design to impact assessment, in a process
   including stakeholder participation and collaboration in decision-making
   strongly relying on the use of digital information technologies. As
   such, Geodesign may help to put into practice the methodological
   innovation brought by Strategic Environmental Assessment in planning
   process that often, so far, failed to be properly implemented. In the
   light of the above premises, this paper aims at offering critical
   insights as a contribution to bridge the gap between Geodesign concepts
   and both spatial planning regulations and practices, with reference to
   the Italian case study. The analysis is intended to contribute to offer
   a better understanding of both normative and methodology issues for a
   fruitful application of Geodesign principles. Making a more explicit
   linkage between policy principles and planning, may possibly contribute
   to foster innovation in education, governance and practices to move
   towards more sustainable processes of savvy growth, which is one of the
   main goals in smart city governance.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations in technologies like improved internet data transfer,
   advanced digital data compression algorithms, enhancements in web
   technology, etc. enabled the exponential growth in digital multimedia
   data. Among the massive multimedia data, news videos are of higher
   priority due to its rich up-to-date information and historical
   evidences. This data is rapidly growing in an unpredictable fashion
   which requires an efficient and powerful method to index and retrieve
   such massive data. Even though manual indexing is the most effective, it
   is the slowest and most expensive. Hence automatic video indexing is
   considered as an important research problem to be addressed uniquely.
   In this work, we propose a Mathematical Morphology and Region Clustering
   based Text Information Extraction (TIE) from Malayalam news videos for
   Content Based Video Indexing and Retrieval (CBVIR). Morphological
   gradient acts as an edge detector, by enhancing the intensity variations
   for detecting the text regions. Further an agglomerative clustering is
   performed to select the significant text regions. The precision, recall
   and F-1-measure obtained for the proposed approach are 87.45\%, 94.85\%
   and 0.91 respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We developed an innovative procedure for digitizing
   maxillary edentulous residual ridges with a photogrammetric system
   capable of estimating three-dimensional (3D) digital forms from multiple
   two-dimensional (2D) digital images. The aim of this study was to
   validate the effectiveness of the photogrammetric system.
   Materials and methods: Impressions of the maxillary residual ridges of
   five edentulous patients were taken with four kinds of procedures: three
   conventional impression procedures and the photogrammetric system.
   Plaster models were fabricated from conventional impressions and
   digitized with a 3D scanner. Two 3D forms out of four forms were
   superimposed with 3D inspection software, and differences were evaluated
   using a least squares best fit algorithm.
   Results: The in vitro experiment suggested that better imaging
   conditions were in the horizontal range of +/- 15 degrees and at a
   vertical angle of 45 degrees. The mean difference between the
   photogrammetric image (Form A) and the image taken from conventional
   preliminarily impression (Form C) was 0.52 +/- 0.22 mm. The mean
   difference between the image taken of final impression through a special
   tray (Form B) and Form C was 0.26 +/- 0.06 mm. The mean difference
   between the image taken from conventional final impression (Form D) and
   Form C was 0.25 +/- 0.07 mm. The difference between Forms A and C was
   significantly larger than the differences between Forms B and C and
   between Forms D and C.
   Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that obtaining digital
   impressions of edentulous residual ridges using a photogrammetric system
   is feasible and available for clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of music informatics, multilayer representation formats are
   becoming increasingly important, since they enable an integrated and
   synchronized representation of the various entities that describe a
   piece of music, from the digital encoding of score symbols to its
   typographic aspects and audio recordings. Often these formats are based
   on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), that allows information
   embedding, hierarchical structuring and interconnection within a single
   document. Simultaneously, the advent of the so-called Semantic Web is
   leading to the transformation of the World Wide Web into an environment
   where documents are associated with data and metadata. XML is
   extensively used also in the Semantic Web, since this format supports
   not only human- but also machine-readable tags. On the one side the
   Semantic Web aims to create a set of automatically-detectable
   relationships among data, thus providing users with a number of
   non-trivial paths to navigate information in a geographically
   distributed framework; on the other side, multilayer formats typically
   operate in a similar way, but at a ``local{''} level. The goal of the
   present work is to discuss the possibilities emerging from a combined
   approach, namely by adopting multilayer formats in the Semantic Web,
   addressing in particular augmented-reality applications. An XML-based
   international standard known as IEEE 1599 will be employed to show a
   number of innovative applications in music.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, the traction gained by transmedia storytelling
   (TS) in increasingly varied academic disciplines, and in the practice of
   storytellers, has led to a rupturing of the boundaries between
   discursive territories and narrative practices. The rupturing force, as
   it were, can be seen as the influence of emerging networked
   technologies, and the widening gyre of convergence culture on the
   practice of storytelling, and the resulting attempts to understand the
   critical value of works experimenting in this space. In the absence of a
   robust framework that accounts for interdisciplinary, intersecting, and
   experimental practices that are often mobilised in TS works, this paper
   asserts that TS is best understood as a philosophical lens through which
   the nexus of text and technology, narrative and network, might be
   mediated, pulling into focus the liminality at intersecting storytelling
   practices and the networks which allow the telling to occur. The
   practice of creative writing, in particular, benefits from this framing,
   as it encourages innovation in a field where interest in large scale
   film and television properties overshadow much of the significant work
   being conducted by creative writers.}},

Abstract = {{In a presumably `post-material' digital age, the turn to materialism has
   been unmistakeably pronounced in recent years. Renewed critical
   attention to `thing theory' and material culture also points to fertile
   ground for writers and teachers of writing. This paper offers an
   exploration of how writing about `things' - in this case, a `garbage
   land' full of discarded things - can teach students to engage with the
   world in innovative, alert, and ethical ways. It considers such sites as
   rich repositories for creative research and embodied observation that
   can help beginning writers move beyond the `radical subjectivist
   expressionism' (in D. G. Myer's phrase) often associated with `creative
   writing'. From a case study in material ecology, the paper ultimately
   progresses to a consideration of the cultural ecology of the workshop
   environment itself, and the value of `situated learning.' Ultimately, I
   argue that thinking through material culture at the local level can help
   clarify - for us, no less than for our students - the value of a
   convergent mental and physical presence, of a critically honed sense of
   emplacement, or a sense of creative residency in its fullest reach.}},

   TCM can generally be divided into four aspects: conclude the experience
   of famous doctors, refine effective medicines, mine scientific
   connotations and improve the level of diagnosis and treatment. Making
   full use of information technology, for database as carrier and network
   as transmission, can not only originally collect comprehensively and
   preserve its information of cases and clinical data, which achieve the
   digitization and systematization of academic experience, but also form
   the platform of application, which can realize the quick, broad and
   effective spread. 3. Results: The research of academic experience from
   veteran doctors of TCM, based on date mining, can digitize the explicit
   knowledge and immediately find out potential and valuable innovations
   hidden in a large number of fuzzy data, which can make part of implicit
   knowledge explicit. 4. Conclusions: Upholding and deepening the research
   of inheriting the academic experience can improve national soft power,
   expand the fields, ideas and methods of TCM scientific research and
   cultivate advanced and comprehensive talents integrating literature,

Abstract = {{In Europe, the technology development of high-speed trains is
   increasingly exposed to societal needs, driven by ICT advancements,
   external to traditional design. Together with the liberalisation of the
   rail markets and increase pressures from other transport modes leads to
   an unprecedented situation where planers, operators and suppliers of
   high-speed have to take decision in this complex and competitive
   environment.
   In such broadening of elements influencing design and, thus, product
   development process, from the survey here to be presented, it was not
   observed technology options assessment or strategic agenda setting from
   visions shifting in the same way. For the high-speed train industry this
   new trend requires going beyond the visions of the past 15 to 20 years'
   practices of ``sector endogenous{''} and structurally closed strategic
   methods approaches to a broader interaction with the widening of
   societal actors now capable of being active contributors to innovation
   from digitalization.
   This way to understand the European industry readiness for undertaking
   such supra systemic challenge, this paper presents the results from a
   survey conducted by the authors to 74 representatives of the high-speed
   train innovation chain regarding to which extent societal embedding is
   considered in the drafting of their visions and technology development
   projects.
   This work becomes even more pertinent if considered that the debate is
   now open in the railway industry (not exclusive to highspeed trains) as
   they are launching the joint initiative SHIFT2RAIL, revise ERRAC (the
   European Rail Research Advisory Council) mandate and enter in a new
   research cycle with the European research framework Horizon 2020. (C)

Abstract = {{Railways managers and owners have to face several challenges to ensure
   commuters' safety and durable operation of their costly infrastructures
   and buildings which contribute tremendously to economic development.
   Whatever brand new or ancient railways infrastructures are concerned and
   according to heavy operation constraints and to consequences of any
   unwanted service disruption, the accurate, periodical and updatable
   evaluation of the condition of environments, structures and equipment is
   one of these challenges. The vast potential of contact-free innovative
   methods based on laser scanning and photogrammetric coverage developed
   accordingly is illustrated here by three recent real-cases: an ancient
   but congested railway concourse in Paris, retaining walls and tunnels of
   a new intercity line where increase in train frequency is already
   foreseen.
   Operating principles, technical features and benefits of these
   innovative methods developed to solve operators' complex technical
   issues are described in this paper. Structural condition of ancient
   truss-girder railway concourse through contact-free deformation
   measurements, complete tri-dimensional geometry as well as structural
   condition of long soil nail retaining walls and underground tunnels
   using a compact laser-scanner and photogrammetric coverage
   semi-automatic device were successfully surveyed and assessed, providing
   operators reliable and extensive data. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Photography was pronounced dead in the 1980s following the widespread
   introduction of digital cameras. At the time it was considered among
   photographic historians that the innovation of the digital pixel, that
   element that allowed for endless cloning and manipulation of the image,
   was the defining factor of the new photographic technology. My paper
   argues that the introduction of digital photography can be considered as
   but one point on the timeline of the history of computer-aided imagery.
   I argue that our understanding of what photography is and what it is yet
   to become, needs to recognize the direction of informational
   technologies to which photography is ever more connected.
   This paper considers contemporary advances in a range of computer-aided
   imaging. There are attendant shifts in our daily uses and practices of
   photography that operate on increasingly personalised and diaristic
   planes. But while `selfie', tagging and facial recognition are the
   everyday realities of social media usage and the online traffic in
   images proliferates and accelerates, developments in computational
   photography such as digital biometrics, recognition, stitching and 3D
   reconstruction remain lesser known and expert fields at the forefront of
   informational technology destined for use in security systems, market
   research and intelligence.
   Mark Zuckerberg's prediction that `the future will be social' is also a
   confirmation that the future will also be networked, that the digital
   interaction of users and experiences, call it `big data', relies on a
   connected online world of users. In this post-photographic moment, the
   photograph still exists but in series, in associations, connections and
   archives. Also the photograph is social. The single photograph, captured
   in a decisive moment, is of the past. In this paper I consider recent
   advances in the field of image technology to analyse the directions in
   which the traffic in photography is flowing.}},

Abstract = {{Work-integrated learning (WIL) has become commonplace in many higher
   education institutions across Australia. Similarly, there has been rapid
   integration of digital technologies for supporting teaching, learning
   and assessment in this domain. In the rush to address associated
   challenges within the sector - such as massification, limited
   placements, resourcing issues and staff turnover - the time to pause,
   take care of and meaningfully build upon WIL practices within this new
   digital context is often bypassed. This paper explores the role of the
   open educational resources (OER) movement for not only protecting and
   promoting the practices which practitioners care about in WIL - but also
   in shaping innovation that is mindful of local institutional contexts,
   disciplinary heritage and wellbeing. The notion of `curating
   work-integrated learning' is introduced to critically reflect upon the
   OER movement via the lenses of multidimensionality, multimodality and
   mindfulness. Despite the quick turnover of technologies and shifts in
   the global educational market, there is a need for `slow innovation'
   which invites a more ethical vision for shaping the future of higher
   education in the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{By offering worldwide access to high quality content, MOOCs (Massive
   Open Online Courses) are becoming notable alternatives to the
   traditional on-campus higher education. As large and complex online and
   offline systems, requiring sophisticated architecture, these platforms,
   like Coursera, edX, Udemy, Udacity, FutureLearn etc. are combining
   advanced hardware and software tools with human-centered practices and
   processes. They also have the capacity to gather and analyze huge
   amounts of information, providing a holistic view of all and each of
   their enrolled learners, of their learning behaviors etc. By using
   reliable data, by coordinating multidisciplinary high skilled teams, the
   business models behind the MOOCs platforms are continuously adapting to
   the changing digital education environment and their stake-holders
   expectations.
   This paper is an exploratory desk research aiming at investigating and
   emphasizing the innovative characteristics of the main business models
   behind the transformative power of MOOCs global phenomenon. By using
   comparative analysis of relevant secondary data and synthesis, the
   authors are revealing meaningful and valuable insights, in order to
   provide a comprehensive view of these business models, that are becoming
   more and more self-sustained and are setting a new major trend in
   education. Along with other researches, the paper's content can serve as
   a benchmark in the complex process of reshaping the way education will
   take place in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines and shares the promising practices in promoting
   health and well-being that emerged from an innovative project, entitled
   ``Feasting for Change{''}. Taking place on Coast Salish territories,
   British Columbia, Canada, Feasting for Change aimed to empower
   Indigenous communities in revitalizing traditional knowledge about the
   healing power of foods. This paper contributes to a growing body of
   literature that illuminates how solidarities between Indigenous and
   non-Indigenous communities can be fostered to support meaningful
   decolonization of mainstream health practices and discourses. In
   particular, it provides a hopeful model for how community-based projects
   can take inspiration and continual leadership from Indigenous Peoples.
   This paper offers experiential and holistic methods that enhance the
   capacity for intergenerational, land-based, and hands-on learning about
   the value of traditional food and cultural practices. It also
   demonstrates how resources (digital stories, plant knowledge cards,
   celebration cookbooks, and language videos) can be successfully
   developed with and used by community to ensure the ongoing process of
   healthful revitalization.}},

Abstract = {{A focus of daily life in the UK now revolves around the adoption of
   technology and the impact of Internet based technology raises issues of
   the digital divide, knowledge divide, social empowerment and socio
   economic effects. This paper focuses on the impact of the UK
   government's policy, `digital by default', on individuals with limited
   IT skills living in an area of deprivation. Following a review of prior
   research, the paper analyses data from semi structured interviews with
   progression support workers in their roles supporting individuals in
   their use of computers to find employment. Research results identify
   barriers inhibiting individuals from using IT and the discussion
   reflects whether the inclusion of concepts of Rogers' Diffusion of
   Innovations theory into the design of the `digital by default' policy
   has the potential to address the digital divide. The Conclusion draws on
   the research results to recommend a revised policy strategy.}},

   and Ultrahigh-Performance Concrete}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{In response to the demand for sustainable and improved bridge design
   practices, the development of emerging materials like
   ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) is at the forefront of structural
   innovation. UHPC offers significant advantages to bridge superstructure
   design as it provides advanced mechanical and durability properties,
   including high compressive strength and increased tensile capacity. With
   the introduction of high-strength steel fibers into mixture proportions,
   postcracking tensile and flexural tensile capacities are increased.
   These increased tensile capacities provide greater ductility and reduce
   or possibly eliminate the need for mild steel reinforcement. The present
   research investigated the behavioral response of full-scale prestressed
   bridge girders subjected to four-point flexural loading. Two channel
   shaped girders were designed to provide equal design moment capacities
   to facilitate comparative analyses of performance. The first of these
   girders was designed with high-performance concrete {[}HPC; 9.5 kips per
   square inch (ksi; 66 MPa)] and mild steel reinforcement typical of that
   used in New Mexico bridge designs. The second girder used nonproprietary
   UHPC {[}20 ksi (138 MPa)] mixture proportions consisting primarily of
   local materials, local mixing procedures, and a local curing regimen,
   all of which were developed at New Mexico State University, Las Cruces.
   Digital image correlation was used to capture deformations throughout
   the testing. This information creates a full field of displacements that
   captures tensile and compressive strain behaviors in the pure moment
   region. This investigation demonstrated the advantages and improved
   performance of UHPC and the contribution of steel fiber reinforcement to
   postcracking strength and flexural capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Visual access to the content in digital archives extends the classical

   metadata in a suitable manner. These approaches are elaborated on
   primarily in the context of scientific questions. Amidst these models,
   this article proposes a very simple strategy of networking images using
   only words. At present, this concept is realised at Zurich University of
   the Arts (ZHdK) through utilisation of the `Media Archive of the Arts',
   an in-house, open source software product. It responds to user
   heterogeneity, the variety of intellectual genres and the multiplicity
   of media formats that are distinctive of an art academy such as ZHdK.}},

Abstract = {{This research studies the treatment of news related to health in Ecuador
   digital platforms. Through a content analysis of news items search was
   conducted in 2014 and 2015, with a total of 198. They are based on the
   issues of child malnutrition, tuberculosis and smoking. They are
   classified using a structured code: results media information content
   and overall qualification information in the Ecuadorian demographic
   environment. Our research establishes communication links health and the
   introduction of ICTs, causing a revolution in the development of all
   branches of science in general. The results highlight that the news
   items no explanatory scientific language is managed and pose no
   innovative content schemes. Our conclusion is that even the digital
   media, where recent communication pathways in society and not pose

Abstract = {{The new media became an extension of the traditional media, allowing to
   the public access information in a wide range of digital devices. In
   this sense, our qualitative study with empirical descriptive nature
   focuses on a literature review about Web Radio and its educative strand.
   This is an innovator and incipient issue on literature when
   investigating the potentialities of the radiophonic universe to the
   online educative process. By itself, the fruitful study follows the path
   of the radiophonic evolution integrating the online education on the
   media sphere, especially on the production of educational content to the
   programs and the conception of a new language to the environment, a
   promising ambience to the contemporary radiophonic culture. This
   investigation considered it important to analyze the educational
   potentialities of web radios in the Portuguese academic universe. For
   that purpose, given the characteristics of the study, the research
   methodology used was of qualitative and empirical-descriptive.}},

Abstract = {{Management communication Ecuadorian companies is presented as a
   challenge of innovation processes and organization, and more
   particularly in the north of the country where communication has been
   restricted only to treatment with the media. Likewise, there are no
   identified communication objectives. Communication, from all
   perspectives of study (organizational, commercial, interpersonal), is a
   set of tools, strategies and actions important in the business world;
   therefore to use it properly it can become a key factor of success in
   the XXI century organizations {[}6]. Communicational performances
   organizations have multiplied and the media and the possibilities of
   public response. However, communication departments in organizations
   that exist in the north insistently project themes and brand identity.
   The areas that have transformed their structures and reformed their
   fields of action, result, on the one hand, from the analysis and
   application of the Communications Law created in 2013, seriously
   affecting the inclusion of media professionals in the companies, who are
   called to execute processes of institutional management. And secondly,
   organizational dynamics by themselves adopting changes in their own
   functions. Companies also attended a permeabilization realities,
   revealing the need to reorganize. However, institutions of Ecuador's
   innovations in communication just introduced as a new and diverse field
   Similarly, companies in information communication are developing a
   product for a single stand, become multimedia and coordinate the work in
   open newsrooms that share resources and operate unique and integrated
   manner, while maintaining the thematic specialization and
   differentiation product by brackets {[}7].}},

Abstract = {{Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of
   death among women and neonates in developing countries. To mitigate some
   of the risks, our research set out to develop an Android Based Digital
   Fetoscope, an application that would ease fetal heart monitoring and
   potentially reduce the number of neonatal deaths. We developed the data
   acquisition circuitry using a conventional pinard horn, the hardware
   interfaces and a custom software application resident on the Android
   platform. The application incorporates intuitive algorithms for data
   acquisition, analysis and display of the fetal heartbeat, graphically
   and numerically. The innovation has the potential to facilitate better
   health care outcomes for expectant mothers due to its affordability,
   ease of use and intrinsic analysis, thus reducing maternal and fetal
   mortality in developing countries. Further work is required to translate
   the prototype into a usable product.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Repositories are precisely intended to support information
   retrieval activities. They evolve to retain pace with novelty on the
   internet. Therefore, requires calibration in the architecture of such
   system. However, in endeavoring to deliver the best services, research
   must prominence on enhancing the motivational strategies and
   recommendation techniques to boost user participation and trust over the
   system. To attain this goal, the open learner model with the tag base
   recommender system is implemented. It narrows down the search space and
   empowers the users with the maximum level of trust and satisfaction.
   Developing countries are eager consumers of digital libraries but the
   unavailability of resources, not consigned to becoming ``read-only
   cultures{''} in the digital revolution and out-of-focus directions cause
   the digital divide. This proposed framework combines new motivational
   approaches with the integration of the best features of Digital
   Libraries, educational systems, and widespread resource sharing systems.
   To influence the effectiveness, learnability and convenience of a
   system, particular characteristics are syndicated. Pioneering
   consultation platform, news feed and membership strategies contribute in
   inspiring the users towards the system. Hence, it also diminishes all
   the weaknesses and flaws that have been disclosed in earlier researches
   regarding Digital Repositories. In this paper, the design of enhanced
   framework is described briefly.}},

Abstract = {{Modern classrooms see many innovative practices in facilitation. Most
   facilitators prefer using presentations animated videos and multimedia
   to better explain their content. Campuses are Wi-Fi enabled and students
   use tablets, laptops and smartphones to capture the essence of a
   lecture. However the one area where technological innovation is still
   lagging behind, in an academic setup, is in assessment. This paper looks
   at the perception of students to the use of clicker technology as a form
   of paperless assessment. Clicker technology was introduced as a tool for
   conducting formative and summative assessments to a first year
   electrical engineering subject, Digital Systems 1. The paper first
   elaborates on the significance, types and the methods of academic
   assessments. It then discusses the pros and cons of assessments using
   clicker technology. Thirdly it sheds light on the research methodology
   used in acquiring data for this research. Finally the results are
   analyzed which among others show that that 71\% students enjoyed using
   clickers in class for formative assessments while only 52\% appreciated
   its use in summative assessments. One of the reasons touted for this
   decrease is student anxiety. The key recommendation from this research
   is to increase the use of these assessment techniques within a formative
   assessment environment so as to familiarize students to eventually use
   it with confidence in summative assessments. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In this research, we undertake a systematic review of literature about
   Online Peer Assessment (OPA) in higher education, mediated by Digital
   Information and Communication Technology (DICT). We identify their
   optional and central characteristics and we map out practices
   (procedures and DICT) which can be transversal, adaptable and applied in
   several curriculum units and education regimes. The results indicate the
   use of OPA as a strategy that boosts ``assessment for learning{''}. The
   methods of assessment and the kinds of DICT used indicate directions for
   greater involvement and responsibility from the part of the student in
   his/her learning. Existing literature identifies the need to develop
   students' skills, proving them with opportunities for self-assessment
   and peer assessment on a regular basis through constructive feedback.
   From the results obtained, OPA is seen as a cognitive tool, contributing
   to the building of knowledge and to reflection about learning. Issues
   for further reflection are also identified such as the creative
   development of assessment methods with a focus on diversity and
   innovation in order to enhance students' learning and academic results,
   taking into account their learning needs in face of the expectations of
   current and future education and the demands of society. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{This paper will analyze Orient@mente, a project developed by the
   University of Turin since the 2014/2015 academic year. The project's
   main purpose is to support students in their choice of the most
   appropriate university study course. An educational model for university
   guidance has been developed and applied in the creation of a self-paced
   MOOC. It is provided through a learning management system integrated
   with an advanced computing environment, an automated assessment system
   and a web conference system. In the platform students can find
   accessible activities such as interactive resources, information,
   orienting material about 15 scientific courses, automatically graded
   tests, review courses.
   As a result, the University of Turin has recorded enrollment growth in
   scientific courses. Students' feedback has shown high appreciation of
   these innovative teaching methods and digital devices for learning
   Mathematics and other scientific subjects. In the next future, the
   University of Turin is interested in extending a similar service
   oriented towards other courses, especially courses which provide a
   highly selective admission test and requires a specific background of
   knowledge. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Gamification represents an innovative and engaging methodology to
   motivate students and enhance their learning process. Nevertheless
   despite an increasing academic interest in gamification over the last
   years, teachers' attitude towards gamification and actual use of
   gamification remains a neglected research area. This exploratory study
   aims to gain a better knowledge of teachers' serving in higher education
   institutions attitude towards gamification. Actual use of gamification
   is also explored. Main findings suggest only a small percentage of
   teachers (11.30\%) use gamification on a regular basis in their courses
   although teachers' attitude towards gamification is positive and high.
   Results show no differences in use of gamification by age, gender or
   type of institution (public or private). Nevertheless there is a
   significant more positive attitude towards gamification for teachers
   serving in private universities than in public universities. Results
   revealed no age dissimilarities in use or attitude towards gamification.
   Results also suggest an attitude-use gap. (C) 2016 The Authors.

   powered by several enabling technologies such as flexible and
   collaborative robots, autonomous vehicles, internet of things, cloud and

   industrial revolution: the digital manufacturing. However, there are
   still several challenges related to the effective adoption of these
   technologies and to enterprise level interoperability so that an entire
   cyber physical production system can work seamlessly. Besides the set of
   challenges faced by industrialists, this research work presents
   innovative results towards a plug and play seamlessly integration of

Abstract = {{Currently several major bridges are under construction in Germany, not
   only due to the construction of new roads and railway connections, but
   also because of the necessity to demolish and replace older bridges that
   no longer meet present requirements. Generally, the national
   infrastructure network is characterised by a relatively high average age
   of the existing bridges, a progressive increase in traffic volume
   (particularly with respect to the heavy traffic portion) and also a rise
   in weight of the individual vehicles and axle loads. In addition,
   several earlier design approaches for concrete bridges have been
   modified in modern codes, aiming to increase reserves in bearing
   capacity and to obtain more robust structures. Hence, an extensive
   assessment scheme was launched some five years ago, based on the
   so-called ``Nachrechnungsrichtlinie{''} (guideline for bridge
   re-analysis and assessment, latest release 04/2015), issued by the
   Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, which provides
   a systematic staged re-analysis approach (four levels of analysis)
   adapted to the special demands of existing structures.
   The present paper will firstly give a brief overview of selected new
   prestressed concrete bridges and related challenges and technical
   details in design and construction, including the utilisation of
   innovative materials and/or structural concepts. Subsequently, Germany's
   assessment strategy for existing bridges will be explained and relevant
   overall results and findings gained from the re-analysis scheme will be
   presented and discussed. Finally, current research activities focusing
   on a more realistic assessment of both actions (e.g. bridge-specific
   traffic loads) and resistances, i.e. the bearing capacity (particularly
   regarding the transmission of shear), will be addressed. In view of
   limited financial resources and the negative consequences induced by
   civil works in busy traffic infrastructure, it is of utmost importance
   to only strengthen (or even replace) those bridges where such measures
   are unavoidable and absolutely necessary. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The public sector needs to transform itself in order to reap full
   benefits of new digital technologies. In this regard, a paradigm shift
   is proposed from New Public Management (NPM) to Digital-Era Governance
   (DEG). Moving from NPM to DEG entails a full socio-technical change, and
   it is necessary to investigate what new business models will be needed,
   and what the impact will be on management, strategy, and governance.
   This research investigates the implications of moving from NPM to DEG.
   First, by applying Action Design Research (ADR) in the context of a
   government lab to examine the implications on strategy in a DEG context.
   Second, this thesis investigates how the literature is paving the way
   towards DEG by performing a literature review on open data case studies.
   In this specific aspect of DEG transformation, focused on ecosystem
   platforms, it explores how knowledge-based interactions are fostered by
   open data platforms. Together with the understanding of how to design a
   DEG strategy, this contributes to a holistic view on how to move towards
   DEG.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a critical stance in the face of the
   technology-enhanced language learning (TELL) hype in higher education
   (HE). This hype, largely driven by institutional - instrumental and
   financial - imperatives has come under increasing scrutiny in recent
   times. Indeed, emerging discourses surrounding the broader context of
   technology-enhanced learning question the focus on technology-led
   innovation rather than pedagogy-led innovation as well as a number of
   scholarly aspects that remain largely undertheorised (cf. Bayne, 2014;
   Kirkwood \& Price, 2013, 2014). In this paper we thus set out to
   articulate the challenges we face as language educators in the HE
   context and, in so doing, bring to light the glaring methodological gap
   that emerges from these. This discussion is complemented by practical
   examples from ongoing curricular innovation in intermediate Spanish
   language courses. These practical examples - drawn from an Action
   Research-driven pedagogic intervention on the use of PowerPoint in
   Spanish as a second/foreign language -illustrate the pedagogical
   strategies we have implemented to respond to these challenges
   critically, but also, creatively. These strategies integrate theoretical
   principles from cognitive grammar (cf. Llopis-Garcia, 2011) and an
   affective engagement approach (cf. Arnold, 2000) to address specific
   pedagogical concerns that have emerged in these courses.}},

Abstract = {{Personal Learning Environment (PLE) is a concept that allows the design
   of teaching around key skills such as learning to learn and digital
   competence. A group of teachers from the University of Jaen has designed
   tools, within the framework of different educational innovation
   projects, which increase the educational possibilities for creating such
   environments. The goal is to contribute to the incorporation of a new
   teaching culture that involves innovation and methodological changes
   focused on practice, skills development and introduction of ICT,
   according to the guidelines of the EHEA, enhancing the autonomous
   student work. This paper presents some ideas for discussion and helps to

Abstract = {{Since a few years, energy utilities are facing business model
   disruptions: grid parity of renewable technologies, stable or decreasing
   demand - especially in the EU -, acceleration of digital innovations
   within the smart-home market, uncertain policy directives and
   influential customers' opinions. If, in the past, the lack of
   entrepreneurial culture within large companies has caused losses of
   market shares towards smaller, innovative, more digitally mature
   companies or energy co-operatives, since the last 2-4 years, some
   utilities have been exploring pathways to fit the energy services demand
   of customers, in parallel to the requirements from investors and
   regulators. In this investigation, after a summary of the current status
   of the energy transition in the EU, emerging business models for the
   future utility are presented, in a tentative of drawing an updated
   overview of the current market mutations. The emerging role of the
   electric energy storage systems within the studied business models is
   detailed, including the illustration of specific pilot cases, for which
   technical and economic information are compared.}},

Abstract = {{Lab-scale results on the treatability of ammonium-rich wastewater from
   textile digital printing highlight the feasibility of an innovative
   biological process, based on purely autotrophic bacterial populations:
   ammonium oxidising bacteria (AOB) and anaerobic ammonium oxidisers
   (AAO). Activity of AOB has been measured through pH/DO-stat titration
   and that of AAO has been assessed through manometric tests, on raw mixed
   wastewater coming from textile-print factories (0.5 to 0-6 gN/L as
   ammonium nitrogen). AOB activity showed a reduction of 20-40\% if
   compared with maximum activity on a synthetic medium. AAO activity tests
   showed a residual specific maximum anammox activity (SAA) of 0.1-0.4
   gN(2)-N/gVSS/d, 40-60\% of the control values obtained with synthetic
   wastewater. Activity tests confirmed treatability of the textile
   wastewater by AAO. Tests have been performed also on concentrated
   wastewater (2 to 3 gN/L as ammonium nitrogen) from the first rinsing
   bath. In this case, strong inhibition (between 80 and 100\%) of anammox
   activity was observed. Careful operation of a continuous-flow completely
   mixed bioreactor can overcome this drawback, as pH and effluent ammonium
   concentration in the reactor are controlled.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this paper is to develop a photogrammetric method in
   order to obtain a robust tool for damage assessment and quantification
   of rubble-mound armour layers during physical scale model tests. With
   the present work, an innovative approach based on a reduced number of
   digital photos is proposed to support the identification of affected
   areas. This work considers two simple digital photographs recording the
   instants before and after the completion of the physical test.
   Mathematical techniques were considered in the development of the
   procedures, enabling the tracking of image differences between photos.
   The procedures were developed using an open-source application, Scilab,
   nevertheless they are not platform dependent. The procedures developed
   enable the location and identity of eroded areas in the breakwater
   armour layer, as well as the possibility of quantifying them. This
   ability is confirmed through the calculation of correlation coefficients
   in each step of the search for the more damaged area. It is also
   possible to make an assessment of the movement of armour layer units.}},

Title = {{Toward Reliable and Secure Data Access for Big Data Service}},

Pages = {{227-239}},
Abstract = {{Two innovative technologies have emerged on the last decade: Big Data
   and Cloud Computing. On the one hand, Big Data warrants innovative data
   analytics for a variety of new and existing data, providing real
   business benefits {[}4]. Digital traces from people and systems produce
   every day a massive volume of data collected from actions, sensors,
   algorithms, and social web. On the other hand, Cloud Computing has the
   potential to enhance business agility and productivity while enabling
   greater efficiencies and reducing costs. The convergence of Cloud
   Computing and Big Data technologies has envisioned to offer a
   cost-effective delivery model for Cloud-based Big Data analytics.
   However, this convergence imposes new challenges to the traditional
   security technologies that may need to be redesigned considering the
   current security models and tools {[}9]. In fact, Big Data-sets have
   made Big Data storage systems attractive targets for cyber attackers,
   whose goal lies in compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and
   availability of data and information. In order to address this new
   problem and further achieve a secure, available, and reliable Big Data
   Cloud-based service, we not only present in this chapter the
   state-of-the-art of Big Data Cloud-based services, but also a novel
   architecture to manage reliability, availability, and performance for
   accessing Big Data services running on the Cloud. The architecture is a
   service offered by the Cloud provider as an outsourcing of firewalling
   functions, characterized by a high availability, huge and dynamic
   resource provisioning. Those firewalling functions aim at ensuring a
   reliable and secure data access, high data availability, and cope with
   distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by managing their impacts
   in the Cloud and tilting the playing field in favor of the defender
   using network function virtualization technology {[}7] and Cloud
   benefits, such as flexibility, elasticity, and on-demand provisioning.
   This chapter follows several steps, such as the investigation of related
   works, the architecture design, software developing, testing, and
   results analysis. Hence, this chapter is organized as follows:
   introduction; the state-of-the-art; the description of the proposed
   reliable and secure data access for Big Data Cloud-based service;
   results from a case study applying the architecture; and conclusions and
   future work.}},

Abstract = {{This teaching case describes the trajectory of the Brazilian media group
   Esporte Interativo ( EI), a company started by three young
   entrepreneurs, and dedicated to produce and distribute sports content in
   multiple platforms. The dilemma was centered on the CEO and co-founder
   of the group, Edgar Diniz, who is facing a new phase in the company with
   the impending sale to Turner, television company owned by Time Warner,
   in late 2014. The clash of business models may pose challenges to the
   company's management that must decide the future strategic direction.
   The information used in the case are real and were obtained through an
   in-depth interviews with the founder and CEO, the other co-founder and
   Vice President of Digital Media and the Vice President of Business
   Development, as well as desk research and literature review. We suggest
   that the case may be used for postgraduate students in Business Strategy
   disciplines, with the following educational objectives: a) business
   ecosystems analysis and reconfiguration of industries from the changes
   generated by the development of Information and Communication
   Technologies; b) understanding of strategic issues related to the
   management platforms and dynamic ``winner-takes-all{''} where the
   rewards for achieving leadership are disproportionate to the benefit
   that one has on those who do not reach it, which is typical in
   networking markets; c) discussion on types of innovation ( incremental
   and disruptive) and consequences for new entrants and incumbents; d)
   planning with scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The initial development of cartoons in China began in 1970. The themes
   were mainly from traditional Chinese stories, folklore and faith.
   However, the box office of cartoons in Taiwan at that time was not good
   and it made great losses. Thus, most cartoonists lacked the momentum in
   creation. Cartoons in Taiwan were transformed from the basic carton OEM
   to the innovative cartoon trend. With the help of digital science and
   technology, departments relevant to acceleration of cartoon application
   and creation of cartoons in the education circle have been founded
   (Huang Yushan, Yu Weizheng, 1997). During the same time period, as the
   digitized study was popularized, digital content institutes were founded
   one after another. The development of the digital content industry like
   games and cartoons were encouraged and talents in departments relevant
   to cartoons were cultivated. Accordingly, cartoon teaching was
   transformed from basic knowledge to transfusion of cartoon creation
   skills to students. Teaching contents were transformed from plane
   cartoons to three-D cartoon production. No matter through self-study or
   from school training, products produced by departments relevant to
   cartoons began to stand out conspicuously in competitions and
   international movie exhibitions. Creation of students in cartoon
   departments began to seriously treat narrative structures and preference
   choices of works. The next step was to learn about the creation process
   of cartoons in Taiwan and the preference choice setting in cartoon
   contents of students in departments relevant to cartoons. They would
   discuss cartoons. And they needed to investigate and learn about them.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient estimation of power consumption is vital when designing large
   digital systems. The technique called power emulation can speed up
   estimation by implementing power models alongside a design on an FPGA.
   Current state-of-the-art power emulation methods construct models using
   various custom techniques, but there is no study on how the existing
   methods relate to each other nor how their differences impact the final
   quality of the model. We propose a methodology which describes the
   breadth of current approaches to automated construction of power
   emulation models. We also evaluate the current methods, finding that
   there is significant variation in accuracy and complexity. In 32.8 \% of
   all tests, the average accuracy of the least complex method is better
   than that of the most advanced method at less than 0.3 \% the hardware
   overhead. This result fuels the hope that further innovation may yield
   models with high accuracy at low implementation cost. Our software
   frameworks and experimental data are made available to promote continued
   work on the field.}},

Abstract = {{The ATHENIS\_3D FP7 EU project aims at providing new enabling
   technologies (analog, digital and power components) for high-voltage and
   high-temperature applications, tested for power systems of new
   hybrid/electrical vehicles. Innovation is exploited at process/device
   level (3D chip stacking, wafer level packaging, trench capacitors and
   TSV-inductors integrated in the interposer, high-reliable non-volatile
   Magnetic RAM), circuit-level (inductorless high-voltage DC-DC converter,
   high-temperature 28nm System-on-Chip platform) and system-level (compact
   3D embedded power mechatronic system). Enabling high integration levels
   of complex systems, operating in harsh environments, in a single
   packaged 3D device, ATHENIS\_3D allows for one order of magnitude area
   reduction vs. today PCB-based power and control systems. Integration
   costs will be consequently reduced in key industrial sectors for Europe
   where high-voltage/temperature operations are mandatory (vehicles,
   avionics, space/defense, industrial automation, energy).}},

   guide us in supermarkets, on highways and in airports. They even guide
   us to the right bathroom. Signs also help us when we read manuals or
   when we use a remote control. They are taken for reasoning important
   decisions in the medical as well as in the financial and business world.
   Signs are used everywhere. A less understood characteristic of signs is
   that they render service in very different ways. This chapter analyses
   how signs render service when ``carrying'' meaning, when they imply
   actions and when they change thinking. The findings reveal how signs
   affect services which are important to support future research on signs
   related service supply chain management.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION. Several international reports have revealed the importance
   of teacher education in ICT as a key factor to innovation and
   educational improvement. Recent studies analyze the teachers' skills to
   take advantage the educational potential of these tools. In this paper,
   we try to study the relation between teachers' training preferences and
   their digital skills in social networks, allowing us to discover which
   of the strategies for teacher education are the most effective to
   achieve an advanced level of digital competence. METHOD. We have carried
   out a research based on a survey to 1701 teachers from 114 schools in
   the area CEP Algeciras-La Linea, Cadiz (Andalucia, Espana). Two scales
   were applied to measure digital competences and learning preferences,
   which got reliability coefficients of .92 and .82 respectively. RESULTS.
   Teachers show a moderate level of digital skills, of which teaching
   skills are the less developed. Teachers with a good attitude towards the
   combined use of all training strategies and teachers, who prefer
   collaborative learning strategies and independent learning jointly, are
   those that express an advanced level of digital competence. We didn't
   observe differences in digital competence of teachers depending on
   gender but we found them depending on age. DISCUSSION. These results are
   consistent with other research on teacher education in ICT, which show
   deficiencies in teacher education in order to do a better pedagogical
   use of ICT. This research provides some evidences which allow us to
   extract conclusions to guide teacher training in ICT.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution optical microscopy has traditionally relied on
   high-magnification and high-numerical aperture objective lenses. In
   contrast, lensless microscopy can provide high-resolution images without
   the use of any focusing lenses, offering the advantages of a large field
   of view, high resolution, cost-effectiveness, portability, and
   depth-resolved three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Here we review various
   approaches to lensless imaging, as well as its applications in
   biosensing, diagnostics, and cytometry. These approaches include shadow
   imaging, fluorescence, holography, superresolution 3D imaging, iterative
   phase recovery, and color imaging. These approaches share a reliance on
   computational techniques, which are typically necessary to reconstruct
   meaningful images from the raw data captured by digital image sensors.
   When these approaches are combined with physical innovations in sample
   preparation and fabrication, lensless imaging can be used to image and
   sense cells, viruses, nanoparticles, and biomolecules. We conclude by
   discussing several ways in which lensless imaging and sensing might
   develop in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Today digital images have possessed the position of the first simple
   analog photographs. The forgery of such images has turned out to be
   logically non-identifiable to the naked eyes and it is simple to do with
   the assistance of innovation of digital technology. Image splicing is a
   frequently utilized technique among the various kinds of image
   forgeries. So, this paper intends to offer a novel method to reveal the
   image splicing forgery by extracting the histogram features of Local
   Binary Pattern (LBP) code. These features are given to the classifiers
   such as combined k-NN, back propagation neural network (BPNN), and
   support vector machine (SVM) to recognize the spliced images along with
   the authentic images. The experiment is conducted with the publically
   accessible dataset of Columbia image splicing forgery. The performances
   are evaluated and their results are also compared to the previous
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Pathology is essential for research in disease and development, as well
   as for clinical decision making. For more than 100 years, pathology
   practice has involved analyzing images of stained, thin tissue sections
   by a trained human using an optical microscope. Technological advances
   are now driving major changes in this paradigm toward digital pathology
   (DP). The digital transformation of pathology goes beyond recording,
   archiving, and retrieving images, providing new computational tools to
   inform better decision making for precision medicine. First, we discuss
   some emerging innovations in both computational image analytics and
   imaging instrumentation in DP. Second, we discuss molecular contrast in
   pathology. Molecular DP has traditionally been an extension of pathology
   with molecularly specific dyes. Label-free, spectroscopic images are
   rapidly emerging as another important information source, and we
   describe the benefits and potential of this evolution. Third, we
   describe multimodal DP, which is enabled by computational algorithms and
   combines the best characteristics of structural and molecular pathology.
   Finally, we provide examples of application areas in telepathology,
   education, and precision medicine. We conclude by discussing challenges
   and emerging opportunities in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Almost unknown at the turn of the twenty-first century, the construction
   design manager role is an innovation that has been adopted rapidly by
   the large to medium sized contracting organisations in the UK. Despite
   this, literature relating specifically to the construction design
   manager is sparse. Thus, the aim of the research was to better
   understand the role of design managers. A longitudinal study captured
   insights from early career design managers and experienced design
   managers working for contracting organisations, primarily on design and
   build type contracts. Following a pilot study, 36 face-to-face
   interviews were conducted over a six-year period. Findings revealed
   original views, new insights and trends related to the evolving role of
   the construction design manager in a digital environment. These views
   both support and extend understanding as reported in two guides for
   design managers published towards the end of the research programme.
   This is a unique insight into how a new role in construction has evolved
   over a six-year period.}},

   presence of digital academic libraries in the semantic web, to identify
   the elements that foster innovation in library and information services.
   Supported the documentary analysis and hermeneutic and discourse

Title = {{Collaboration in the consulting industry Analyzing differences in the
   professional use of social software}},
Journal = {{BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{693-711}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - By studying the drivers of social collaboration the purpose of
   this paper is to describe how, and for what job-related purposes, social
   software is employed in the digital workplace. Focussing on consultants,
   who are considered to be part of a knowledge-intensive and innovative
   industry, factors that may influence the adoption of professional social
   software are explored. In addition, insights about socio-demographic
   differences as well as distinct consulting segments and use categories
   are provided.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use
   of Technologies (UTAUT) is the theoretical backbone of this research.
   The UTAUT model is expanded to fit the research goals, and the results
   from a quantitative study (n = 341) are used to test the model.
   Findings - The results suggest that the adoption of social software is
   associated with the expectation that one's work performance will
   improve. There are significant differences regarding age and gender in
   the use of social software for job-related purposes.
   Practical implications - Using the results of the study, social software
   suites can be tailored to users' needs and preferences, which, in turn,
   may lead to higher levels of acceptance and intensity of use.
   Originality/value - Social software is already widely adopted for
   private purposes, and it is being used more and more within the digital
   workplace, too. However, little research has been conducted into how,
   and for what job-related purposes, social software is employed, or into
   the potential drivers for its adoption. The stakeholders in the research
   include scholars and practitioners alike.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter will address how to incorporate global and local learning
   and sustain mother tongue instruction through a science literacy program
   in the digital age in Zanzibar. Further, it will argue that this
   sustenance of learning in mother tongue education based in local
   knowledge ought to be defined as a right in education. I will frame my
   argument with the theories that reflect and reports on commentary and
   history compiled from the perspectives of both the dominant and
   nondominant cultures. The author envisions education as a set of
   processes intended to enhance multicultural dimensions in glo-local
   learning where e-learning has to be taken into consideration within
   education in order to enhance citizenship for the digital 21st century.
   This is a radical departure from most mainstream educational research
   and practice, which is designed to enhance global rather than local
   learning by using a science model in which reading, writing, and
   language are employed as tools to foster the development of glo-local
   knowledge and inquiry in science. I first examine key assumptions about
   knowledge that inform mainstream educational research and practice. I
   then argue for an emphasis on the contextualized dimension of learning
   as a right in education. This means accounting for contextualized
   knowledge and reversing the current trend in the digital age of
   decontextualization. I introduce a new model of learning involving
   alternative assumptions about the value of local knowledge and local
   languages in the teaching and learning of science subjects using the
   seeds of science and roots of reading model. I insist that this will
   form a new platform for innovation with a unique mix of local and global
   knowledge in understanding and reaching technology for learning in a
   digital age:}},

   Study on Teachers' TPACK Level in a Provincial City in China}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, the incorporation of information and
   communication technologies (ICTs) into daily pedagogical practices has
   been viewed as a viable solution for the innovation of educational
   systems. Teachers have been seen as crucial actors in this process, and
   therefore much emphasis has been put on the necessity to provide them
   with adequate technological and pedagogical competences through training
   and lifelong learning. However, while a greater knowledge of teachers'
   level of skills in technology-enhanced learning would be extremely
   helpful to deliver effective training courses, up to now, empirical
   studies on teachers' digital and pedagogical skills have been poor and
   fragmented, especially in developing and populous countries such as
   China. The current study attempted to explore this issue in a provincial
   city in China,. through the assessment of K-12 teachers' levels of
   skills in technology, pedagogy and content, and by looking into factors
   that might have influenced the obtained results. The research design was
   descriptive in nature and Mishra and Koehler's (2006,, 2009)
   technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) model was
   adopted as the theoretical framework. Besides determining teachers'
   level of skills, six hypotheses on possible correlations between
   teachers' TPACK level and their personal characteristics were
   investigated. Results of data analysis revealed that: (1) surveyed
   Chinese K-12 teachers (N = 691) were more competent in non-technology
   related TPACK domains than in technology-related TPACK domains; (2) male
   teachers rated themselves to be more competent in all of the seven TPACK
   domains than did female teachers; (3) discipline had a significant
   impact on K-12 teachers' technology-related knowledge domains; (4) age,
   professional title and teaching experience had a significant impact on
   K-12 teachers' TK, CK and PCK; (5) online education experience had a
   significant impact on-all seven TPACK domains of the K-12 teachers
   involved in the study. These results suggested that, regardless of age
   and the teaching experience, K-12 teachers in China need more training,
   especially in the area of ICT-pedagogy integration, and that increasing
   teachers' online educational experience could be an encouraging factor
   to make teachers more familiar with the use of ICTs in their daily
   pedagogical practices.}},

Title = {{Cyber-Physical Signage Interacting With Gesture-Based Human-Machine
   Interfaces Through Mobile Cloud Computing}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{3951-3960}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a cyber-physical signage interacting framework
   for the interaction between digital signage and mobile users using smart
   handheld devices, such as smartphones and tablets. The proposed
   framework can provide diverse multimedia/feedback services to mobile
   users interacting with digital signage through face detection,
   classification, and recognition techniques based on mobile cloud
   computing. Mobile users only need to click and drag the interested
   service over the face of advertising celebrities/endorsers displayed on
   digital signage and can obtain supplementary multimedia information or
   feedback related comments. Using the intuitive way of gesture-based
   operations, mobile users can directly interact with digital signage
   through their handheld devices. Our framework reveals an innovative
   human machine interface for signage interacting between digital signage
   and mobile users. In addition, we integrate our framework with a face
   cache mechanism that can make the interaction delay as small as possible
   for popular signage. Furthermore, an Android-based signage interacting
   system is implemented to verify the feasibility and superiority of our
   framework. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the
   existing methods and can significantly reduce the average consumption
   time of obtaining interested multimedia contents from digital signage.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how companies can
   design digital channels to evoke desired emotions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The successful business case of retailer
   Burberry has been examined to understand the strategy and customer
   engagement of digital channels implemented by decoding the emotional
   intensions.
   Findings - Results illustrate that the ability to create engaging
   interactions via digital channels with customers has a significant
   impact on growth, revenue and brand advocacy. Findings from this study
   provide a new empirical support for the proposition that emotions can be
   utilised to guide company digital strategy for building digital channel
   relationships with customers.
   Originality/value - This is the first study to examine the relationship
   between digital channels, emotion and customer responses to digital
   engagements. The inclusion of an emerging theory model is outlined to
   explain the successful process of reformulating business strategy
   through a dynamic and creative process of intersecting emotion, strategy

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on potential advances in
   pedagogy and on the process of learning in business schools. It examines
   innovations in teaching and learning methods particularly in the context
   of networked organizations.
   Design/methodology/approach - It approaches, and examine the impact of,
   three key developments in business schools, namely, recent advances in
   IT, changes in the architecture of classrooms and learning spaces and
   advances in the way teaching is undertaken.
   Findings - The paper suggests that a blend between self-learning via
   distance approaches and face-to-face learning will increasingly become
   the norm. Face-to-face sessions might be in a ``flat room{''}
   environment with a creative mix of short lectures, experiential, group
   learning and conceptual plenary lectures, software innovations, and
   digital textbooks ``open plan{''} learning spaces would complement the
   instructional process.
   Research limitations/implications - There are clear implications for
   parallel IT (developments in course modules) and architectural
   innovations for the design of more effective and creative learning
   spaces.
   Practical implications - Improving pedagogy together with the physical
   design and layout of learning spaces is critical. The aim is, through
   enhanced participative pedagogy and ``friendly{''} architecture, to
   improve learning by encouraging dialogue and closer interaction between
   students and professors from different disciplines and fields.
   Social implications - The authors argue that this model of collaborative
   learning and an interactive teaching framework should enable the same
   amount of learning material to be covered in a business school in
   approximately half-the-time required in conventional pedagogical
   approaches.
   Originality/value - It offers a prescription for a participative,
   technology enhanced and interactive teaching pedagogy that could produce
   more effective and efficient, teaching outcomes. This has strong
   implications for the sustainability, and funding capability, of many
   existing business schools and business school models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the drivers behind a recent ``urban turn{''} of
   planned knowledge locations in Europe. While acknowledging a general
   tendency towards more urbanity, we argue that a dense and diverse urban
   environment is not equally relevant for all types of knowledge-based
   activities because of nuanced workers' preferences and innovation modes.
   Based on a theory ``considering different types of knowledge bases{''},
   we suggest that activities that more intensively rely on symbolic
   knowledge (e.g., media, design) tend to have a stronger preference for
   urban settings, while this is less the case for activities based on
   analytical and synthetic knowledge (e.g., biotechnology and advanced
   engineering). We illustrate our thesis by three case studies: Kista
   Science Park in Stockholm, The Digital Hub in Dublin, and Biocant in
   Coimbra.}},

Journal = {{LONDON JOURNAL OF PRIMARY CARE}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{26-29}},
Abstract = {{Stories help us frame and understand complex ideas and challenges.
   Metaphors are particularly powerful linguistic devices that guide and
   extend our thinking by bridging conceptual domains, for example to
   consider the brain as a digital computer. Trees are widely used as
   metaphors for broad concepts like evolution, history, society, and even
   life itself, i.e. `the tree of life'. Tree-like diagrams of roots and
   branches are used to demonstrate historical and cultural relationships,
   for example, between different species or different languages. In this
   paper, we describe a theatrical character called a tree doctor which is
   a living metaphor. A human being, namely the author, lectures, acts or
   dances as a tree and offers lessons to Homo Sapiens about `holistic'
   ideas of health. The character teaches us to not only see the value of
   our relationships to trees, but the importance of seeing forests as well
   the individual trees. The metaphorical statement that we should not
   `miss the forest for the trees' means we should learn to think of health
   embedded in systems and communities. In medicine, we too often focus on
   individual molecules, pharmaceuticals, or even patients and miss the
   bigger picture of public and environmental health. In a time of great
   ecological system change, the tree doctor points to broad ethical
   responsibility for each other and future generations of humans and other
   living creatures. The character embraces arts and particularly music as
   a powerful way of infusing purpose and improving the qualities of our
   lives together, especially as we age. The tree doctor knows the value of
   intergenerational relationships. But it also points to intergenerative
   innovations across many cultural domains, disciplines and professions.
   The tree doctor supports primary care and empowers the value of
   intergenerational relationships, art and music in the recommendations
   doctors make to patients to improve their health and well-being.}},

Abstract = {{In this digital world, data mining is a decisive for innovation and
   better services for user, but it raises the issues about individual
   privacy. Privacy can be achieved by hiding sensitive or private
   information in database before publishing it for innovation. This paper
   presents a hybrid technique for hiding sensitive association rules,
   which combines two heuristic based techniques viz. Decrease Support and
   Decrease Confidence of sensitive rule for selection and modification of
   items from the transactions. The proposed hybrid technique combines
   advantages of both algorithms to maintain the quality of the database
   and preserve the privacy of database. From the experimental results it
   is observed that proposed algorithm is competent to maintain privacy and
   database quality.}},
