Abstract = {{The development of an innovative position sensitive pixelated sensor to
   detect and measure with high precision the coordinates of the ionizing
   particles is proposed. The silicon avalanche pixel sensors (APiX) is
   based on the vertical integration of avalanche pixels connected in pairs
   and operated in coincidence in fully digital mode and with the
   processing electronics embedded on the chip. The APiX sensor addresses
   the need to minimize the material budget and related multiple scattering
   effects in tracking systems requiring a high spatial resolution in the
   presence of the large track occupancy. The expected operation of the new
   sensor features: low noise, low power consumption and suitable radiation
   tolerance. The APiX device provides on-chip digital information on the
   position of the coordinate of the impinging charged particle and can be
   seen as the building block of a modular system of pixelated arrays,
   implementing a sparsified read-out. The technological challenges are the
   3D integration of the device under CMOS processes and integration of
   processing electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Many authors have used the diffusion of innovation (DOT) theory of
   Rogers (1995) to study factors affecting citizen e-Gov adoption. But
   none of these authors studied the moderating role of the digital divide
   on the relationship between innovation characteristics and veterans'
   intention to adopt e-Gov. Our research model postulates that a veteran's
   intention to adopt e-Gov services is determined by the interaction
   between the digital divide and five innovation characteristics: relative
   advantage, perceived compatibility, perceived complexity, subjective
   norms and perceived risk. Data was collected from 183 veterans in a US
   state where a government website is designed to deliver e-services to
   veterans. We found that the digital divide did not moderate the effect
   of relative advantage and subjective norms on the veteran decision to
   adopt e-Gov services. However, the digital divide moderates the effect
   of some factors: perceived compatibility, perceived complexity and
   perceived risk. Discussion and implications are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Broadband offers key advantages as a communication infrastructure,
   including efficiency and cost savings which can stimulate productivity,
   innovation, and ultimately economic growth and social well-being. This
   paper presents a comparative study on the adoption of broadband in urban

   which we validate with data collected using a computer-aided telephone
   survey. We find that relative advantage, utility outcomes, and
   facilitating conditions play a crucial role in explaining the broadband
   adoption behavior of both urban and regional household users. In a
   dynamic environment where technologies are changing quickly, our
   findings about broadband adoption drivers are useful to stakeholders
   such as internet service providers, regulators, broadband application
   developers for encouraging further broadband and application adoption
   and developments in communication space in both regional and urban

Abstract = {{Innovations in international health require the use of state-of-the-art
   technology to enable clinical chemistry for diagnostics of bodily
   fluids. We propose the implementation of a portable and affordable
   lock-in amplifier-based instrument that employs digital technology to
   perform biochemical diagnostics on blood, urine, and other fluids. The
   digital instrument is composed of light source and optoelectronic
   sensor, lock-in detection electronics, microcontroller unit, and user
   interface components working with either power supply or batteries. The
   instrument performs lock-in detection provided that three conditions are
   met. First, the optoelectronic signal of interest needs be encoded in
   the envelope of an amplitude-modulated waveform. Second, the reference
   signal required in the demodulation channel has to be frequency and
   phase locked with respect to the optoelectronic carrier signal. Third,
   the reference signal should be conditioned appropriately. We present
   three approaches to condition the signal appropriately: high-pass
   filtering the reference signal, precise offset tuning the reference
   level by low-pass filtering, and by using a voltage divider network. We
   assess the performance of the lock-in instrument by comparing it to a
   benchmark device and by determining protein concentration with
   single-color absorption measurements. We validate the concentration
   values obtained with the proposed instrument using chemical
   concentration measurements. Finally, we demonstrate that accurate
   retrieval of phase information can be achieved by using the same
   instrument. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Within project-based supply chain inter-organizational cooperative
   innovation, the achievement of project value-adding reflects by factors
   such as effect level of project-based organizations, the relationship
   between construction project cooperative innovation objectives.
   Therefore, based on the assumption of equal cooperation between
   project-based organizations, considering the relationship of effect cost
   between knowledge input and innovation stage, and the reciprocity
   preference of project-based organizations, the collaborative incentive
   model for project-based supply chain cooperative innovation was
   established, and the digital simulation was presented. The results show
   that, the project-based supply chain cross-organizational cooperative
   innovation is in the most favourable position to be realized when rising
   project-based organizations' effort level at one stage can reduce the
   effort cost of another stage. The reciprocity preference of
   project-based organization does not automatically lead to the
   achievement of the project-based supply chain cross-organizational
   cooperative innovation, but can enhance the incentive outcome of project
   value-adding sharing and knowledge collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Ambidexterity, defined as the capability to simultaneously explore
   knowledge to identify new market opportunities and exploit knowledge to
   capitalise on a firm's existing niches, is considered to be crucial in
   today's competitive marketplace. However, there is relatively limited
   research on how such a capability can be developed, and even less on the
   role of IT-enabled practices in promoting this. Drawing on the
   strategy-as-practice perspective, we investigate how interrelationships
   amongst practitioners, IT-enabled practices and praxis create a
   particular site of practice. More importantly, we consider how a site
   gets shifted over time through the emergence of changes in the
   interrelationships between IT-enabled practices and practitioners,
   stimulated by on-going praxis. Building on the findings derived from a
   case study of DaM,(1) the leading ticketing company in China, we explain
   how the phenomenon of site-shifting can provide a useful conceptual lens
   for explaining ambidexterity. In doing this, we bring to the fore the
   importance of IT in achieving an ambidexterity capability. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this paper the insights and results are presented of a long term and
   ongoing improvement effort within the Netherlands Forensic Institute
   (NFI) to establish a valuable innovation programme. From the overall
   perspective of the role and use of forensic science in the criminal
   justice system, the concepts of Forensic Information Value Added (FIVA)
   and Forensic Information Value Efficiency (FIVE) are introduced. From
   these concepts the key factors determining the added value of forensic
   investigations are discussed; Evidential Value, Relevance, Quality,
   Speed and Cost. By unravelling the added value of forensic science and
   combining this with the future needs and scientific and technological
   developments, six forensic grand challenges are introduced: i) Molecular
   Photo-fitting; ii) chemical imaging, profiling and age estimation of
   finger marks; iii) Advancing Forensic Medicine; iv) Objective Forensic
   Evaluation; v) the Digital Forensic Service Centre and vi) Real time
   In-Situ Chemical Identification. Finally, models for forensic innovation
   are presented that could lead to major international breakthroughs on
   all these six themes within a five year time span. This could cause a
   step change in the added value of forensic science and would make
   forensic investigative methods even more valuable than they already are
   today. (C) 2013 Forensic Science Society. Published by Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to explain the timing and location of the
   diffusion of heavy metal music. We use data from an Internet archive to
   measure the population-adjusted rate of metal band foundings in 150
   countries for the 1991-2008 period. We hypothesize that growth in
   ``digital capacity{''} (Internet and personal computer use) catalyzed
   the diffusion of metal music. We include time-varying controls for gross
   national income, political regime, global economic integration, and
   degree of metal penetration of countries sharing a land or maritime
   border with each country. We find that digital capacity is positively
   associated with heavy metal band foundings, but, net of all controls,
   the effect is much stronger for countries with no history of metal music
   prior to 1990. Hence, our results indicate that increasing global
   digital capacity may be a stronger catalyst for between-country than for
   within-country diffusion of cultural products.}},

Abstract = {{This Special Issue analyzes the dynamics of disassembly and reassembly
   unfolding in selected creative industries through the advent of
   digital,technology. It argues that a full understanding of the
   much-observed organizational or sectoral lock-in effects on the one
   hand, and the possibilities for transformation and innovation on the
   other is only gained by analyzing jointly how institutional logics,
   business models and creative processes are affected by digital
   technology and how they interrelate in producing stability or change.
   These three dimensions provide a framework for reviewing the findings of
   the papers comprised in the Special Issue and for integrating their
   insights towards a research agenda. This introduction starts with a
   reflection on creative industries classification systems and related
   possibilities for generalization and discusses how digital technology
   acts as a driver for disassembly and reassembly. It concludes by
   highlighting three avenues for further research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Inspired by new digital technologies, diverse actors in cultural and
   creative industries propagate conflicting visions of how to adequately
   innovate - or rather preserve and strictly enforce - copyright-related
   business models, which has resulted in substantial amounts of regulatory
   uncertainty. Looking at a decade of regulatory discourse at industry
   events in the popular music industry in Germany, we investigate how
   these actors make sense of and strategically shape this uncertainty in
   the process of industry transformation. Our longitudinal argumentative
   discourse analysis reveals cycles of regulatory propaganda of two
   discourse coalitions that do not engage in debate, but aim to find
   support for competing business models among regulators and the public.
   Organizing, canceling, and participating in industry events are
   discursive strategies used effectively to transport their claims by both
   industry lobbyists and challenging actors, but industry incumbents are
   failing to use these sites for testing out and introducing new business
   models. We conclude that regulatory struggles, not least at industry
   events, mediate between disruptive technologies and business model
   innovation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{The digital creative industries exemplify innovation processes in which
   user communities are highly involved in product and service development,
   bringing new ideas, and developing tools for new product uses and
   environments. We explore the role of user communities in such
   co-innovation processes via four case studies of interrelations between
   firms and their communities. The digitization and virtualization of
   firm/community interactions are changing how boundaries are defined and
   how co-innovation is managed. The transformation of innovation
   management is characterized by three elements: opening and redefining
   firm boundaries; opening of products and services to community input and
   reducing property rights; and reshaping organization and product
   identities. Innovation in collaboration with user communities requires
   firms to orchestrate their communities and their inter-relationships to
   encourage the creativity and motivation of users, and develop the
   community's innovatory capacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Like other creative industries, the book publishing industry is
   currently experiencing a shift from analogue to digital technologies and
   formats. This shift challenges existing business models and impels firms
   to re-examine their product portfolios. and core competencies. Through a
   qualitative case study of the three largest publishing houses in Norway,
   Aschehoug, Cappelen Damm and Gyldendal, this paper investigates how
   digitisation affects business models in the book publishing industry.
   The paper argues that the publishing houses are two-faced in meeting new
   digital technologies. The industry has come relatively far in developing
   industry standards and joint distribution systems. However, the
   functionality and user experience of digital products is still poor,
   prices are still high, and the share of Norwegian language digital
   titles is low. In addition, knowledge acquisition from consumers and
   lead users are suboptimal. Due to divergence in goals, formats and
   markets, there is a lack of a common dominant design for digital
   publishing. This represents a substantial uncertainty for the
   publishers, who are moving step-by-step into the new digital era and
   whose exploration of new market opportunities and alternative business
   models remains anchored in traditional and analogue business models. The
   paper also discusses how current institutions contribute to preserve the
   analogue publishing regime. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade newspapers all over the world have faced a severe
   and in many cases even existential crisis. At the same time, the
   technology for producing and supplying journalistic content has changed
   dramatically. While digitalization, along with socio-cultural and
   technological changes, threatened the established newspaper business
   models and therefore increased the necessity for change, it
   simultaneously offered various opportunities to establish new business
   models, not least for quality journalism, which is crucial to a vital
   democracy. Adopting a strategy process perspective and introducing the
   concepts of ``horizontal{''} and ``vertical{''} creativity, we analyze
   how the key players in the quality-newspaper sector in Germany have
   tried to benefit from digitalization and why they have failed so far.
   Our analysis of select cases shows that, under specific conditions,
   organizations tend to use up all their creative potential in order to
   maintain problematic strategies rather than explore new ones. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Do entrepreneurs construct new cognitive frameworks or adapt existing
   ones in unstable, transforming industry contexts, and what importance do
   existing mental models, in particular the value chain, take on for them?
   The official discourses, Mission and vision statements of the 21 most
   visible online music ventures were analyzed using mixed methods to
   capture the representations of the digital music industry of the
   entrepreneurs at their helm. The managerial cognition of digital music
   entrepreneurs challenges all the dominant logics and industry recipes of
   the traditional music industry and encounters no cognitive barriers. The
   cognitive frame of the value chain remains prevalent however in the
   representations of digital music entrepreneurs, and restrains them from
   embracing the specificities of the creative industries. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The advent of digital technologies has led to profound changes in the
   creative industries, including the digitization of resources and the
   consequential fragmentation and greater physical distance of work
   practices. Looking at the production of digital visual effects for film
   production, this paper asks how collective digital bricolage is enabled
   by specific resources and involves particular coordination mechanisms.
   Based on a large set of interviews with industry experts, we identify
   the important role of two dominant coordination principles: ``narrative
   alignment{''}, i.e. a scene's contribution to an overall storyline, and
   ``verisimilitude{''}, which we define as a sense of perceptual realism.
   Together, these two principles facilitate collective bricolage in an
   increasingly fragmented and specialized professional field.
   Conceptually, we develop the notion of `digital bricolage', which relies
   on digital assets and tools, and emphasize the need to study the impact
   of digitization on the nature of resources and on the coordination
   mechanisms emerging in specific creative industries. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Digital technology, with its distinctive characteristics that result
   from the fundamental process of digitalization that underpins it, is
   seen as fundamentally altering processes of creativity. However, we
   currently have limited understanding of creativity in relation to the
   development of digital technology. Computer game development, with its
   combination of esthetic, affective and cultural use features and highly
   sophisticated digital technologies, is a valuable setting for
   investigating these issues. In this paper, we explore how computer games
   are shaped through the interplay between the creative intentions of
   developers and the digital technologies involved in their production and
   playing. Drawing on in-depth studies conducted at three leading computer
   game development studios and a leading producer of the software system
   used in game development, this paper shows how the game developers'
   creative ideas for imagined novel game-playing experiences relate to a)
   the development of relevant digital technologies, and b) the emergence
   of new game development practices. The article goes on to propose a view
   of creativity as an on-going flow that, following an initial `creative
   impulse', ripples through the sociomaterial entanglements of a
   particular setting, reconfiguring them in the process and spreading out
   in time and space in often unexpected ways. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Creative processes are partly stable over the ages, and partly
   influenced by their techno-historical contexts. In this paper we examine
   the effects of technology on creative effort in two historical periods
   separated by five hundred years: the early Italian Renaissance and the
   contemporary Internet age with the production of art for digital
   products such as video games and animation. We examine how human
   creative processes, or more broadly, creative work, can be
   conceptualized as a general nature within a complex framework of
   evolving practices, technologies, and social norms. Commonalities emerge
   by comparing these two ages. In particular, creative work can be thought
   of as a combinative activity, operating on motifs in culture, and
   bounded by their social acceptance. Second, creative work involves
   techniques that expand the frontier of creative output. Third, creative
   work involves much iteration, facilitated by the media, techniques and
   technologies. We examine the constants in human combinative creativity
   by comparing these ages, as well as how this combinative creativity and
   iterative activity is mediated differently by the technologies of the
   time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma multiforme and other malignant cancers resulting in solid
   tumors continue to be devastating diseases. In order to find more
   effective treatments, it is necessary to cultivate a better
   understanding of the dynamics of tumor development in relation to both
   primary and secondary tumors. Although hand-held or digital caliper
   methods can measure tumor growth in subcutaneous xenograft models, to
   date, the only way to follow and monitor the progression of growing
   tumors in orthotopic animal models is imaging. This is not enough. To
   improve our knowledge of the biological characteristics that take place
   during tumor progression at both primary and metastatic sites, it is
   indispensable to develop an in vivo model which enables us to reproduce,
   from the beginning to the end of the cancer's natural history, what
   really happens in a patient affected by a solid tumor. The ideal tumor
   model must allow us to monitor all the stages of the tumor's
   development, both in the primary bulk and in secondary locations, by
   obtaining cells, biopsies as well as performing stainings on sections.
   In this paper, ``the development tumor model{''}, already proposed by
   the author to monitor the whole progression of the glioblastoma, is also
   applied to the study of all solid malignancies. It is a xenogeneic
   orthotopic transplantation model using human tumor-derived cells from
   the pre-hypoxic phase as transplanted material, which will be cultured
   in a neurobasal serum-free medium. By transplanting the same material at
   the same time (time zero) into a number of immunodeficient and
   genetically identical mice or rats, the model can be used to create a
   pool of twin animal transplant candidates under the same testing
   conditions. By sacrificing one animal a week (or choosing other
   intervals as needed) and performing multiple biopsies and stainings on
   sections, we can monitor the entire development of both the primary and
   secondary tumors. This may shed light on which specific cells and
   particular markers need to be focused on in order to develop innovative,
   valid therapeutic strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In most cases, the polychrome paintings that decorated heritage
   buildings no longer exist or are reduced to mere remnants. These facts
   decontextualize the sites in their historical and artistic evolution,
   distort the intention under which they were conceived, and hamper their
   accomplishment. Current recovery methods are restricted to the
   stabilization of the remains in their present status, requiring a lot of
   completely manual work that is expensive and almost unrelated to the use
   of new technologies. Three-dimensional digitalization and modelling is
   proved to be the basis for the virtual recovery of paintings in a
   significant edifice. To do so, an innovative methodology is presented
   that allows the 3D geometric information of a site (captured using a
   laser scanner) to be combined with specially designed 2D artistic
   images. The resulting 3D digital models can then be focused, with high
   efficiency projectors, on the equivalent area of the original site, and
   also used as raw material to compose a video-projection without
   perspective effects to emulate, with due rigour, the primitive
   appearance, its evolution along time, the effects of the deterioration,
   or other interesting aspects. The results obtained at Sta. Maria de Mave
   (Palencia, Spain) are presented, supporting the potential of this new
   methodology not only as a scientific way to discuss possible restoration
   hypotheses with experts or as a didactic tool for narrating the
   historical evolution of a monument, but also as a spectacular show for
   tourists. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Performance of Kiestra Total Laboratory Automation-Combined with MS in

Journal = {{ANNALS OF LABORATORY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Background: Microbiological laboratories seek technologically innovative
   solutions to cope with large numbers of samples and limited personnel
   and financial resources. One platform that has recently become available
   is the Kiestra Total Laboratory Automation (TLA) system (BD Kiestra
   B.V., the Netherlands). This fully automated sample processing system,
   equipped with digital imaging technology, allows superior detection of
   microbial growth. Combining this approach with matrix-assisted laser
   desorption ionization time-offlight mass spectrometry (MS) (Bruker
   Daltonik, Germany) is expected to enable more rapid identification of
   pathogens.
   Methods: Early growth detection by digital imaging using Kiestra TLA
   combined with MS was compared to conventional methods (CM) of detection.
   Accuracy and time taken for microbial identification were evaluated for
   the two methods in 219 clinical blood culture isolates. The possible
   clinical impact of earlier microbial identification was assessed
   according to antibiotic treatment prescription.
   Results: Pathogen identification using Kiestra TLA combined with MS
   resulted in a 30.6 hr time gain per isolate compared to CM. Pathogens
   were successfully identified in 98.4\% (249/253) of all tested isolates.
   Early microbial identification without susceptibility testing led to an
   adjustment of antibiotic regimen in 12\% (24/200) of patients.
   Conclusions: The requisite 24 hr incubation time for microbial pathogens
   to reach sufficient growth for susceptibility testing and identification
   would be shortened by the implementation of Kiestra TLA in combination
   with MS, compared to the use of CM. Not only can this method optimize
   workflow and reduce costs, but it can allow potentially life-saving
   switches in antibiotic regimen to be initiated sooner.}},

Abstract = {{Technological innovations have initiated a fundamental change in
   invasive therapeutic approaches which has led to a welcome reduction of
   surgical trauma but was also associated with a declining role of
   conventional surgery. Active utilization of future technological
   developments is decisive to promote new therapeutic strategies and to
   avoid a further loss of importance of surgery. This includes
   individualized preoperative therapy planning as well as intraoperative
   diagnostic work-up and navigation and the use of new functional
   intelligent implants. The working environment ``surgical operating
   room{''} has to be refurbished into an integrated cooperating functional
   system. The impact of new technological developments is particularly
   obvious in minimally invasive surgery. There is a clear tendency towards
   further reduction in trauma in the surgical access. The incision will
   become smaller and the number of ports will be further reduced, with the
   aim of ultimately having just one port (monoport surgery) or even via
   natural access routes (scarless surgery). Among others, improved
   visualization including, e.g. autostereoscopy, digital image processing
   and intelligent support systems, which are able to assist in a
   cooperative way, will enable these goals to be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Periodontal regenerative therapy is aimed at reconstruction and to
   restore the architecture and function of lost or injured tissues.
   Melcher (J Periodontol 47(5):256-260, 1976) introduced the concept of
   guided tissue regeneration (GTR) for osseous reconstructive surgery. The
   aim of the present innovative clinical and radiographic study was to
   evaluate the effect of chorionic membrane (CM) in GTR in periodontal
   pocket therapy. Ten patients with moderate to severe periodontitis were
   selected in the single blind randomized controlled clinical trial.
   Patients were treated with periodontal pocket therapy along with CM in
   study sites and the control sites were treated with periodontal pocket
   therapy alone. The clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and 12
   months. The radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline, 6 and 12
   months. Clinical parameters included gingival index (GI), plaque index
   (PI), pocket probing depth (PPD) and relative attachment level (RAL).
   Digital images were analysed for bone gain (BG) and density. Data were
   evaluated using t test. Statistical significant differences were found
   in both sites at 12 months for GI, PI, PPD and RAL. Highly significant
   reduction was seen in GI 0.40 +/- A 0.08 (p = 0.0001), PI (0.41 +/- A
   0.18), PPD 2.50 +/- A 0.53 mm (p = 0.0431) and increased BG 0.86 +/- A
   0.18 (p < 0.0001) were observed in study sites. This shows that CM when
   used with pocket therapy can have influence on clinical parameters.
   Radiographic findings from this study demonstrated significant BG and
   density in sites treated with CM as compared to control sites.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the findings of a research project investigating the
   use of iPods by student nurses to enhance their interactions with
   content, instructors and peers while located at a distance from their
   university campus.
   Wireless handheld devices (WHD) are an important tool in nursing
   environments that are undergoing rapid technological change. Preferred
   treatments, drug dosages, postsurgical care, and preventive healthcare
   regimens continually change and such devices allow students to rapidly
   confirm information while in the clinical area, thus fostering active
   learning and safe practice.
   A case study approach was adopted with each participating student cohort
   comprising a case. Multiple data collection methods were used to enable
   rich descriptions of each case. This paper focusses on factors, relating
   to the use of iPods, which influenced student learning in distance
   courses at two regional Queensland universities. It furthermore
   highlights a range of creative interventions reported by students and
   educators in resolving issues with their devices.
   The study found that connectivity difficulties, technology literacy
   level, compatibility of study resources with the WHDs, and small screen
   size were all factors that impacted negatively on the use of iPods in
   distance courses. The paper describes the responses of students and
   educators to the use of iPods for learning. This study concluded that
   nursing students and nursing educators alike may experience problems
   when WHD's are introduced to courses as a platform for learning.
   However, both students and educators can be innovative and resourceful
   in managing these problems and, when access to course resources that
   were enabled for viewing on the WHDs were available, the learning
   experience of the students and the teaching experience for the educators
   were enhanced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, three-dimensional, digital models have become
   increasingly important in geosciences and in particular in
   palaeontological research. Although significant advances in hard- and
   software technology have facilitated the acquisition and creation of
   such models, the presentation of three-dimensional data is still greatly
   handicapped by the traditionally two-dimensional means of publication.
   The ability to integrate three-dimensional (3D) models, which can be
   interactively manipulated, into portable document format (PDF) documents
   not only considerably improves their accessibility, but also represents
   an innovative, but so far neglected, approach for the presentation and
   communication of digital data. This article introduces and illustrates a
   comprehensive workflow for the creation of 3D PDFs, incorporating
   different techniques and methodological steps, and using both commercial
   and freely available software resources. Advantages and disadvantages of
   each method are discussed, and are accompanied by selected examples of
   digital models. These examples encompass different methods of data
   acquisition (computed tomography, synchrotron radiation X-ray
   tomographic microscopy, photogrammetry) and span a wide range of sizes
   and taxonomic groups. To the best of the author's knowledge, this
   article represents the first application of 3D PDF technology fully
   integrated into a scientific publication in palaeontology or even
   geosciences, and not restricted to supplementary material. It provides
   the reader with extended visual information and facilitates the
   dissemination of data. As both authors and readers benefit greatly from
   their usage, it is argued that 3D PDFs should become an accepted
   standard in palaeontological publications of three-dimensional models.}},

Abstract = {{The staminal lever mechanism of pollination in Salvia has been
   considered as a key innovation, which was proposed to contribute to
   adaptive radiation of the genus. Considering its sophisticated
   interaction with pollinators, we hypothesized that relevant floral
   traits in the lever mechanism might be subject to intense selection in
   natural populations. In the present study, Salvia digitaloides was
   employed to investigate phenotypic selection on the floral traits. The
   results indicated that there were large variations in the floral
   structural traits and spatial position of the stigma. No significant
   selection was detected on the plausible key trait, i.e. the stamen lever
   length. Strong stabilizing selection acted consistently on the size of
   corolla entrance; that is, the intermediate corolla entrance was at a
   selective advantage. Both corolla length and style exsertion were
   subject to opposite directional selection in both years; and corolla
   entrance height was subject to disruptive selection, which was
   attributed to divergent adaptation of the trait to different body-sized
   pollinators. Furthermore, correlational selection acted on a few pairs
   of traits which described corolla entrance size and stigma position.
   Flower production was consistently subject to significantly positive
   directional selection in both years. In conclusion, it was most likely
   that floral traits involved in the staminal lever mechanism evolved in a
   functionally integrated manner for the enhancement of pollination
   efficiency in the natural population of S. digitaloides.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by Herbert Simon's notion of nearly decomposable systems,
   researchers have examined modularity as a powerful approach to manage
   technological change in product innovation. We articulate this approach
   as the hierarchy-of-parts architecture and explain how it emphasizes
   decomposition of a design into loosely coupled parts and subsequent
   aggregation of these into an industrial product. To realize the scale
   benefits of modularity, firms successively freeze design specifications
   before production and therefore only allow limited windows of
   functionality design and redesign. This makes it difficult to take
   advantage of the increased speed by which digitized products can be
   developed and modified. To address this problem, we draw on Christopher
   Alexander's notion of design patterns to introduce a complementary
   approach to manage technological change that is resilient to digital
   technology. We articulate this approach as the network-of-patterns
   architecture and explain how it emphasizes generalization of ideas into
   patterns and subsequent specialization of patterns for different design
   purposes. In response to the increased digitization of industrial
   products, we demonstrate the value of complementing hierarchy-of-parts
   thinking with network-of-patterns thinking through a case study of
   infotainment architecture at an automaker. As a result, we contribute to
   the literature on managing products in the digital age: we highlight the
   properties of digital technology that increase the speed by which
   digitized products can be redesigned; we offer the notion of
   architectural frames and propose hierarchy-of-parts and
   network-of-patterns as frames to support innovation of digitized
   products; and, we outline an agenda for future research that reconsiders
   the work of Simon and Alexander as well as their followers to address
   key challenges in innovating digitized products.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary digital ecosystems produce vast amounts of data every day.
   The data are often no more than microscopic log entries generated by the
   elements of an information infrastructure or system. Although such
   records may represent a variety of things outside the system, their
   powers go beyond the capacity to carry semantic content. In this
   article, we harness critical realism to explain how such data come to
   matter in specific business operations. We analyse the production of an
   advertising audience from data tokens extracted from a
   telecommunications network. The research is based on an intensive case
   study of a mobile network operator that tries to turn its subscribers
   into an advertising audience. We identify three mechanisms that shape
   data-based production and three properties that characterize the
   underlying pool of data. The findings advance the understanding of many
   organizational settings that are centred on data processing.}},

Abstract = {{New variation of nanostructures are introduced and developed to sustain
   Moore's Law as device dimension is scaled drastically. Among those low
   dimensional technological innovation is silicon (Si) nanowire
   field-effect transistor (NWFET). The usefulness of Si NWFET is its
   compatibility with existing complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
   (CMOS) technology that been widely pursued for more than four decades.
   Device simulation of nanowire is essential to explore physics in depth
   and to assess, quantify and benchmark the device performance metrics
   with a nanoscale metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor
   (MOSFET). SPICE model of Si NWFET is constructed based on the device
   model proposed by researchers from Purdue University. A semi-empirical
   solution of the self-consistent is presented so that the device model is
   made portable and can be simulated in SPICE and other platform. Then,
   silicon-based digital logic circuit namely inverter, NOR and NAND are
   simulated and analysed. The circuit performances of nanowire digital
   gates are then compared against 32 nm MOSFET in terms of energy-delay
   product, power-delay product, propagation delay and average power
   dissipation. The results shown that silicon nanowires perform better
   than 32 nm MOSFET generally due to the high velocity transport of quasi
   ballistic carriers and superior gate control.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the development of an interface to the US Patent and
   Trademark Office (USPTO) that allows for the mapping of patent
   portfolios as overlays to basemaps constructed from citation relations
   among all patents contained in this database during the period
   1976-2011. Both the interface and the data are in the public domain; the
   freeware programs VOSViewer and/or Pajek can be used for the
   visualization. These basemaps and overlays can be generated at both the
   3-digit and 4-digit levels of the International Patent Classification
   (IPC) of the world intellectual property organization (WIPO). The
   basemaps can provide a stable mental framework for analysts to follow
   developments over searches for different years, which can be animated.
   The full flexibility of the advanced search engines of USPTO are
   available for generating sets of patents and/or patent applications
   which can thus be visualized and compared. This instrument allows for
   addressing questions about technological distance, diversity in
   portfolios, and animating the developments of both technologies and
   technological capacities of organizations over time.}},

Abstract = {{In today's competitive business environment, the timely identification
   of potential technology opportunities is becoming increasingly important
   for the strategic management of technology and innovation. Existing
   studies in the field of technology opportunity discovery (TOD) focus
   exclusively on patent textual information. In this article, we introduce
   a new method that tackles TOD via technology convergence, using both
   patent textual data and patent citation networks. We identify technology
   groups with high convergence potential by measuring connectivity between
   clusters of patents. From such technology groups we select pairs of core
   patents based on their technological relatedness, on their past
   involvement in convergence, and on the impact of their new potential
   convergence. We finally carry out TOD by extracting representative
   keywords from the text of the selected patent pairs and organizing them
   into the basic description of a new invention, which the potential
   convergence of the patent pair might produce. We illustrate our proposed
   method using a data set of U.S. patents in the field of digital
   information and security.}},

   the emergence of critical cartography and exploring its implications for

   maps, and to investigate the criminological implications of emergent
   digital mapping technologies. Maps and map making afford a host of
   innovative methodologies that criminologists have yet to take advantage
   of, and some tentative suggestions are made as to how criminologists
   might utilize cartographic methods in order to generate unique empirical
   insights. Finally, the article considers how criminologists might

Abstract = {{This article explores the future impact on intellectual property (IP)
   rights as additive manufacturing technologies enable a larger segment of
   the population to create copies and derivatives of rights-protected
   objects. Despite growing concerns of widespread economic disruption, in
   reality, 3D-printed IP infringement will impact only a few specific
   industries, and even then, additive manufacturing will have a gradual
   and localized effect. Borrowing IP protections modeled on those used in
   the digital media industry would be ineffective. Instead, a more
   effective approach for companies seeking to thrive in an era of
   widespread additive manufacturing technologies would be to spend
   resources not on IP enforcement but on enticing customers with business
   model innovation and adding value to products in the form of quality
   assurance guarantees.}},

Abstract = {{New technology may offer many opportunities for humanitarian action, but
   it also presents a number of challenges. Currently, most of the critical
   analysis of these potential challenges takes place in the blogosphere,

   engagement on the subject. This article offers an agenda for critical
   inquiry into the emergent field of humanitarian technology as applied to
   a broadly defined context of crises, encompassing both natural disasters
   and conflict zones, by identifying what technology does to the
   humanitarian enterprise, and by reflecting on the key challenges that

Abstract = {{Bonded composite constructions using timber and ultra-high performance
   fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) are investigated as highly innovative
   structural elements technically and economically efficient, and having
   better environmental performances. Such technique could indeed offer new
   structures typologies for bridges for instance associating timber for
   main beams with UHPFRC slabs. In timber-concrete-composite structures,
   connection is traditionally achieved with mechanical means. The research
   presented herein describes the timber-concrete assembly by adhesive
   bonding and specially the behaviour of bonded joint between Laminated
   Wood (LW) and UHPFRC. This type of assembly has to be investigated
   concerning mainly the durability of the bonded assembly and its ability
   to transmit the forces concentrated on edges. The present study
   describes the development of a test called ``Push-Out{''} used to
   characterize the behaviour of the timber-concrete bonded after or prior
   to environmental ageing. Following the development of the used test
   protocol, investigations are realized on four different commercial
   resins to study the influence of the adhesive stiffness on the force
   transfer focusing in particular on the failure mode, on the ultimate
   capacities and some local deformations. The mechanical behaviour of the
   bonded joint is investigated in particular from a theoretical point of
   view and from the determination of deformation field obtained by Digital
   Image Correlation (DIC). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social media is considered a valuable platform for gathering and
   analyzing the collective and subconscious opinions of people in Internet
   and mobile environments, where they express, explicitly and implicitly,
   their daily preferences for brands and products. Extracting and tracking
   the various attitudes and concerns that people express through social
   media could enable us to categorize brands and decipher individuals'
   cognitive decision-making structure in their choice of brands. We
   investigate the cognitive network structure of consumers by building an
   inter-category map through the mining of big data. In so doing, we
   create an improved online recommendation model. Building on economic
   sociology theory, we suggest a framework for revealing collective
   preference by analyzing the patterns of brand names that users
   frequently mention in the online public sphere. We expect that our study
   will be useful for those conducting theoretical research on digital
   marketing strategies and doing practical work on branding strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In this study focus is posed on an innovative joint between a Carbon
   Fiber reinforced carbon-matrix Composite (CFC) and copper (Cu or its
   alloys) based on the modification of the CFC substrate and on a one-step
   brazing process with a non-active brazing alloy. To assess the
   mechanical response of the joint subjected to shear tests, a
   numerical-experimental methodology is presented herein, which consists
   of two inverse problems in a sequence, coherently formulated and solved:
   (i) the ``optical{''} inverse problem tackled by an improved 2D global
   Digital Image Correlation procedure, allowing one to reconstruct
   displacement fields from digital images; (ii) the ``mechanical{''}
   inverse problem, exploiting kinematic full-field measurements and a
   finite element model to estimate the governing parameters for the joint.
   The proposed methodology can provide a useful feedback to improve the
   design process and the validation stage of innovative joining
   techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Coopetition (collaboration between competing firms) is a phenomenon that
   has recently captured a great deal of attention due to its increasing
   relevance to business practice. However, current research on coopetition
   is still short on explaining how the potential advantages of coopetition
   can be realized over time as part of an individual firm's business
   model. In order to gain insights into this, we conduct a longitudinal,
   in-depth case study on the coopetition-based business models of
   Amazon.com. We find evidence of three distinct coopetition-based
   business models: (1) Amazon Marketplace, (2) Amazon Services and Web
   Services, and (3) the collaboration between Apple and Amazon on digital
   text platforms. We conclude by forwarding several propositions on how
   value can be created and captured by involving competitors in a firm's
   business model. As a whole, the results contribute to the current
   understanding of how firms - as well as their stakeholders - can better
   benefit from coopetition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The single-slope analog-to-digital converter (SS-ADC) is the most
   commonly used column-level ADC for high-speed industrial, complementary
   metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-based X-ray image sensors because of
   its small chip area (the width of a pixel), its simple circuit
   structure, and its low power consumption. However, it generally has a
   long conversion time, so we propose an innovative design: a
   complimentary dual-slope ADC (CDS-ADC) that uses two opposite ramp
   signals instead of a single ramp to double the conversion speed. This
   CDS-ADC occupies only 15\% more area than the original SS-ADC. A
   prototype 12-bit CDS-ADC and a 12-bit SS-ADC were fabricated using a
   0.35-A mu m 1P 4M CMOS process. During comparison of the two, the
   measured maximum differential non-linearity (DNL) of the CDS-ADC was a
   0.49 least significant bit (LSB), the maximum integral non-linearity
   (INL) was a 0.43 LSB, the effective number of bits (ENOB) was 9.18 bits,
   and the figure of merit (FOM) was 0.03 pJ/conversion. The total power
   consumption was 0.031 uW. The conversion time of the new CDS-ADC was
   half that of the SS-ADC. The proposed dual-slope concept can be extended
   to further multiply the conversion speed by using multiple pairs of
   dual-slope ramps.}},

Abstract = {{The second part of this article reports our query into the essential
   characteristics of effective engineering networks in the current
   business environments through case studies focusing on engineering
   design, manufacturing engineering, and engineering services. The
   engineering networks of four global leading companies were studied to
   refine, enrich, and extend the preliminary understandings gained from
   the first part of this article. The case studies suggested essential
   characteristics of effective engineering networks in four main areas,
   including (1) efficient engineering processes, (2) effective engineering
   learning, (3) flexible engineering resources, and (4) digital
   engineering environment. This contributes to the theoretical
   understanding of international engineering operations by bridging a
   missing link between the engineering network theories and the unique
   nature of engineering. It is expected that the findings can help
   managers to improve the performance of their engineering networks and
   facilitate the effective interface management between engineering and
   other functional areas.}},

Abstract = {{The behavioral sciences have flourished by studying how traditional
   and/or rational behavior has been governed throughout most of human
   history by relatively well-informed individual and social learning. In
   the online age, however, social phenomena can occur with unprecedented
   scale and unpredictability, and individuals have access to social
   connections never before possible. Similarly, behavioral scientists now
   have access to ``big data{''} sets - those from Twitter and Facebook,
   for example - that did not exist a few years ago. Studies of human
   dynamics based on these data sets are novel and exciting but, if not
   placed in context, can foster the misconception that mass-scale online
   behavior is all we need to understand, for example, how humans make
   decisions. To overcome that misconception, we draw on the field of
   discrete-choice theory to create a multiscale comparative ``map{''}
   that, like a principal-components representation, captures the essence
   of decision making along two axes: (1) an east-west dimension that
   represents the degree to which an agent makes a decision independently
   versus one that is socially influenced, and (2) a north-south dimension
   that represents the degree to which there is transparency in the payoffs
   and risks associated with the decisions agents make. We divide the map
   into quadrants, each of which features a signature behavioral pattern.
   When taken together, the map and its signatures provide an easily
   understood empirical framework for evaluating how modern collective
   behavior may be changing in the digital age, including whether behavior
   is becoming more individualistic, as people seek out exactly what they
   want, or more social, as people become more inextricably linked, even
   ``herdlike,{''} in their decision making. We believe the map will lead
   to many new testable hypotheses concerning human behavior as well as to
   similar applications throughout the social sciences.}},

Abstract = {{The early phase of diffusion plays a critical role in determining
   information technology (IT) success in a market. Takeoff, the transition
   point from the introduction to the growth phase in the IT life cycle, is
   viewed as an add test for whether a technology will succeed. We develop
   a theory to understand global takeoff for digital wireless phones that
   can be extended to other technologies with related characteristics.
   Drawing on technology dominance and product life cycle theories, we
   build a model that consists of standards, market competition, technology
   costs, and technology substitution to explain takeoff and subsequent
   market penetration growth. The data are from 41 developed and developing
   countries. The results suggest that the presence and effects of
   standards play an important role in driving takeoff and penetration
   growth. Familiarity with wireless phones and an installed base of analog
   phone technologies also explain faster takeoff times. Non-price factors
   are important drivers of penetration growth after takeoff as well. Our
   results have managerial and policy implications on innovative
   strategies, standards and competition policy settings for digital
   wireless phones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article showcases the online research and comprehension
   competencies students will need to successfully engage with Internet
   Inquiry. The Common Core State Standards, the research on new literacies
   skills, and the future of technology-based assessments require educators
   to fully take on the challenges of meaningfully embedding and supporting
   innovations in authentic, inquiry-based learning with digital texts.
   This manuscript focuses on four fundamental competencies that are
   important for Internet inquiry tasks: 1) generate high-quality inquiry
   topics, 2) effectively and efficiently search for information, 3)
   critically evaluate Internet resources, and 4) connect ideas across
   Internet texts. A rationale, what it looks like in the classroom, what
   scaffolds are needed to support and guide students to independence are
   provided for each competency.}},

Abstract = {{The business model concept, although a relatively new topic for
   research, has garnered growing attention over the past decade. Whilst it
   has been robustly defined, the concept has so far attracted very little
   substantive research. In the context of the wide-spread digitization of
   businesses and society at large, the logic inherent in a business model
   has become critical for business success and, hence, a focus for
   academic inquiry. The business model concept is identified as the
   missing link between business strategy, processes, and Information
   Technology (IT). The authors argue that the BISE community offers
   distinct and unique competencies (e.g., translating business strategies
   into IT systems, managing business and IT processes, etc.) that can be
   harnessed for significant research contributions to this field. Within
   this research gap three distinct streams are delineated, namely,
   business models in IT industries, IT enabled or digital business models,
   and IT support for developing and managing business models. For these
   streams, the current state of the art, suggest critical research
   questions, and suitable research methodologies are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Business and Information Systems Engineering (BISE) is at a turning
   point. Planning, designing, developing and operating IT used to be a
   management task of a few elites in public ad-ministrations and
   corporations. But the continuous digitization of nearly all areas of
   life changes the IT landscape fundamentally. Success in this new era
   requires putting the human perspective - the digital user - at the very
   heart of the new digitized service-led economy.
   BISE faces not just a temporary trend but a complex socio-technical
   phenomenon with far-reaching implications. The challenges are manifold
   and have major consequences for all stakeholders, both in information
   systems and management research as well as in practice. Corporate
   processes have to be re-designed from the ground up, starting with the
   user's perspective, thus putting usage experience and utility of the
   individual center stage.
   The digital service economy leads to highly personalized application
   systems while organizational functions are being fragmented. Entirely
   new ways of interacting with information systems, in particular beyond
   desktop IT, are being invented and established. These fundamental
   challenges require novel approaches with regards to innovation and
   development methods as well as adequate concepts for enterprise or
   service system architectures. Gigantic amounts of data are being
   generated at an accelerating rate by an increasing number of devices -
   data that need to be managed.
   In order to tackle these extraordinary challenges we introduce `user,
   use \& utility' as a new field of BISE that focuses primarily on the
   digital user, his or her usage behavior and the utility associated with
   system usage in the digitized service-led economy.
   The research objectives encompass the development of theories, methods
   and tools for systematic requirement elicitation, systems design, and
   business development for successful Business and Information Systems
   Engineering in a digitized economy - information systems that digital
   users enjoy using. This challenge calls for leveraging insights from
   various scientific disciplines such as Design, Engineering, Computer
   Science, Psychology and Sociology. BISE can provide an integrated
   perspective, thereby assuming a pivotal role within the digitized
   service led economy.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-increasing production of genetically modified crops generates a
   demand for high-throughput DNA-based methods for the enforcement of
   genetically modified organisms (GMO) labelling requirements. The
   application of standard real-time PCR will become increasingly costly
   with the growth of the number of GMOs that is potentially present in an
   individual sample. The present work presents the results of an
   innovative approach in genetically modified crops analysis by DNA based
   methods, which is the use of a microfluidic dynamic array as a high
   throughput multi-detection system. In order to evaluate the system, six
   test samples with an increasing degree of complexity were prepared,
   preamplified and subsequently analysed in the Fluidigm system.
   Twenty-eight assays targeting different DNA elements, GM events and
   species-specific reference genes were used in the experiment. The large
   majority of the assays tested presented expected results. The power of
   low level detection was assessed and elements present at concentrations
   as low as 0.06 \% were successfully detected. The approach proposed in
   this work presents the Fluidigm system as a suitable and promising
   platform for GMO multi-detection.}},

Title = {{Novel Telemedicine Technologies in Geriatric Chronic Non-Cancer Pain:
   Primary Care Providers' Perspectives}},
Journal = {{PAIN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveWe sought to identify primary care providers' interest in, as
   well as perceived barriers and facilitators to, using novel telemedicine
   technologies (e.g., smartphones) for managing chronic non-cancer pain
   (CNCP) in older adults.
   DesignSix focus groups were conducted with 25 primary care providers.
   SettingTwo academically affiliated primary care practices serving older
   adults with CNCP in New York City.
   MethodsThe investigators used content analysis to analyze transcribed
   focus group data and identify specific themes.
   ResultsWhile most providers reported limited use of telemedicine, they
   expressed substantial interest in trying devices such as smartphones in
   the management of older patients with CNCP. Perceived barriers to
   implementation of telemedicine tools included information overload, lack
   of mobile device usability among patients and clinicians, liability
   issues, and cost. To overcome these barriers, participants suggested
   implementing electronic or human-based pre-analysis of data (e.g., a
   computer or a person that triages patient data), creating a low-cost and
   user-friendly mobile device design, and targeting appropriate user
   populations.
   ConclusionsPrimary care providers are interested in applying
   telemedicine when caring for older adults with CNCP. Although they
   perceived multiple barriers to device implementation, they offered
   innovative solutions to address these barriers. Providers felt that
   novel telemedicine technologies may improve the management of CNCP but
   wanted evidence that the devices were both cost- and time-efficient, and
   led to improved patient outcomes before adopting their use in practice.}},

Abstract = {{To test the impact of method of administration (MOA) on the measurement
   characteristics of items developed in the Patient-Reported Outcomes
   Measurement Information System (PROMIS).
   Two non-overlapping parallel 8-item forms from each of three PROMIS
   domains (physical function, fatigue, and depression) were completed by
   923 adults (age 18-89) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
   depression, or rheumatoid arthritis. In a randomized cross-over design,
   subjects answered one form by interactive voice response (IVR)
   technology, paper questionnaire (PQ), personal digital assistant (PDA),
   or personal computer (PC) on the Internet, and a second form by PC, in
   the same administration. Structural invariance, equivalence of item
   responses, and measurement precision were evaluated using confirmatory
   factor analysis and item response theory methods.
   Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis supported equivalence of factor
   structure across MOA. Analyses by item response theory found no
   differences in item location parameters and strongly supported the
   equivalence of scores across MOA.
   We found no statistically or clinically significant differences in score
   levels in IVR, PQ, or PDA administration as compared to PC. Availability
   of large item response theory-calibrated PROMIS item banks allowed for
   innovations in study design and analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a multimedia solution for the interactive
   exploration of illuminated manuscripts. We leveraged on the joint
   exploitation of content-based image retrieval and relevance feedback to
   provide an effective mechanism to navigate through the manuscript and
   add custom knowledge in the form of tags. The similarity retrieval
   between miniature illustrations is based on covariance descriptors,
   integrating color, spatial and gradient information. The proposed
   relevance feedback technique, namely Query Remapping Feature Space
   Warping, accounts for the user's opinions by accordingly warping the
   data points. This is obtained by means of a remapping strategy (from the
   Riemannian space where covariance matrices lie, referring back to
   Euclidean space) useful to boost the retrieval performance. Experiments
   are reported to show the quality of the proposal. Moreover, the complete
   prototype with user interaction, as already showcased at museums and
   exhibitions, is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines to what extent and how the presence of gazelles,
   young high-impact firms, is related to the growth of industries over
   time. For this purpose, we analyze gazelles in The Netherlands over a
   12-year period, annually from 1997 until 2008, and relate them to the
   dynamics of industry employment. We use a panel vector autoregressive
   model to explore the relationship between the prevalence of gazelles in
   an industry and industry employment growth, in an economy-wide dataset
   including 43 two-digit industries. An increase in the prevalence of
   gazelles in an industry appears to have a positive effect on subsequent
   industry growth. We do not find evidence of an inverse causal
   relationship: there are no long-run positive effects of increases in
   industry growth on the prevalence of gazelles. There is also no
   relationship between overrepresentation of gazelles and subsequent
   industry growth.}},

Abstract = {{Firms competing in new product categories face great technical and
   market uncertainty as they try to move from early adopters to mainstream
   markets (Mahajan and Muller, 1998; Muller and Yogev, 2006; Rogers,
   2003). While the management literature identified several factors that
   may contribute to adoption, the role of specific product models has been
   understudied. To address this gap, we studied portable digital music
   players (MP3 players) from 1987-2006 and tested the role of specific
   product models in market takeoff, convergence and product category
   evolution. We introduced the concept of beacon product, defined as a
   specific product model that has great appeal to customers and sends a
   strong signal about what they want.
   We found that Apple's first iPod model triggered market takeoff and that
   many competitors tried to emulate the original iPod design, leading to
   convergence around its key design features. But it took the iPod/iTunes
   store combination, a new ecosystem for the legal download of digital
   music, to bridge the gap between early MP3 adopters, primarily young
   people, to mainstream markets. The iPod/iTunes ecosystem proved more
   difficult for competitors to copy and many of the firms that had
   pioneered the MP3 category exited the industry or were relegated to
   small niches. By subsequently introducing new models with smaller form
   factors at lower prices and expanding iTunes Store offerings, Apple
   effectively preempted competitors from gaining share in this growing
   market. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study employed Rogers' model to compare the diffusion of digital
   terrestrial television with the diffusion of digital cable in Taiwan. A
   telephone survey, which yielded 753 valid questionnaires, was conducted
   to collect data. The results of this study show that the factors
   affecting the intention to adopt digital terrestrial television differed
   widely from those affecting the intention to adopt digital cable. The
   diffusion of digital cable was discovered to be generally congruent with
   the prediction of Rogers' model, while the diffusion of digital
   terrestrial television was not. This second finding reveals a limitation
   in Rogers' model, namely, its alleged pro-innovation bias. It may be
   that the respondents in this study looked favorably on digital cable
   because they considered it, and not digital terrestrial television, to
   be an inevitable technology. Furthermore, this study found that
   awareness played an important role in respondents' adoption of digital
   television. This study therefore suggests that, to accelerate digital
   conversion, Taiwan's government should establish policies to educate
   people about digital television. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: There is an urgent need for innovative and developmentally
   appropriate lifestyle interventions to promote healthy lifestyle
   behaviors and to prevent the early onset of type 2 diabetes and
   cardiovascular disease risk in obese Latino adolescents. Guided imagery
   offers promise to reduce stress and promote lifestyle behavior change to
   reduce disease risk in obese adolescents. Our objectives were: 1) To
   pilot test a new 12-wk lifestyle intervention using a randomized trial
   design in obese Latino adolescents, in order to determine the effects of
   the mind-body modality of Interactive Guided Imagery(SM) (IGI), over and
   above those of a didactic lifestyle education, on insulin resistance,
   eating and physical activity behaviors, stress and stress biomarkers;
   and 2) To explore the role of intervention-related changes in stress and
   stress biomarkers on changes in metabolic outcomes, particularly insulin
   resistance.
   Methods: Obese (BMI > 95th percentile), Latino adolescents (n = 35, age
   14-17) were randomized to receive either 12 weekly sessions of a
   lifestyle education plus guided imagery program (GI), or lifestyle
   education plus a digital storytelling computer program (DS).
   Between-group differences in behavioral, biological, and psychological
   outcomes were assessed using unpaired T-tests and ANCOVA in the 29
   subjects who completed the intervention.
   Results: The GI group demonstrated significant reductions in leisure
   sedentary behavior (p < .05) and increases in moderate physical activity
   (p < .05) compared to DS group, and a trend toward reduced caloric
   intake in GI vs DS (p = .09). Salivary cortisol was acutely reduced by
   stress-reduction guided imagery (p < .01). There were no group
   differences in adiposity, insulin resistance, perceived stress, or
   stress biomarkers across the 12-week intervention, though decrease in
   serum cortisol over the course of the intervention was associated with
   improved insulin sensitivity (p = .03) independent of intervention group
   and other relevant co-variates.
   Conclusions: The improvements in physical activity and stress biomarkers
   following this pilot intervention support the role of guided imagery in
   promoting healthy lifestyle behavior change and reducing metabolic
   disease risk in obese Latino adolescent populations. Future
   investigations will be needed to determine the full effects of the
   Imagine HEALTH intervention on insulin resistance, stress, and stress
   biomarkers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we illustrate the core technologies at the basis of the
   European SPADneL project (www.spadnet.eu), and present the corresponding
   first results. SPADneL is aimed at a new generation of MRI-compatible,
   scalable large area image sensors, based on CMOS technology, that are
   networked to perform gamma-ray detection and coincidence to be used
   primarily in (Time-of-Flight) Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The
   project innovates in several areas of PET systems, from optical coupling
   to single-photon sensor architectures, from intelligent ring networks to
   reconstruction algorithms. In addition, SPADnet introduced the first
   computational model enabling study of the full chain from gamma photons
   to network coincidence detection through scintillation events, optical
   coupling, etc. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an efficient framework and a sustainable pilot
   project on the effective use of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR) in low-income countries and semi-arid climatic contexts. The
   technical efficiency was pursued by integrating SAR models and
   hydrological assessment methods; the socio-economical sustainability was
   guaranteed by the joint work of scientists, technicians, and volunteers.
   The pilot project was developed in the Yatenga region, a Sahelian area
   in northern Burkina Faso. In particular, an original development of SAR
   interferometry algorithms was tailored to the peculiar climate, the soil
   characteristics, and the land cover of the semi-arid regions. A digital
   elevation model (DEM) was derived, and an original approach based on the
   use of SAR amplitude images is proposed for its validation. The achieved
   resolution (9 m) is significantly better than that of the previously
   available DEMs in the study area (30 m). Based on the DEM, the soil
   sedimentation rate of small reservoirs was estimated together with the
   average soil loss in the contributing catchments due to the erosion
   process. A multi-temporal filter was implemented on the SAR images for
   monitoring of water intake volume in small reservoirs, and its seasonal
   evolution. The developed tools provide an innovative contribution for
   the improvement of water resource management in the study area. This
   approach is repeatable and scalable to suit situations with similar
   economic and climatic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Information and communication technologies are often cited as one major
   source, if not the causal vector, for the rising intensity of
   transnational practices. Yet, extant literature has not examined
   critically how digital media appropriation affects the constitution of
   transnational organizations, particularly Chinese spiritual ones. To
   address the lack of theoretically grounded, empirical research on this
   question, this study investigates how the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu
   Chi Foundation (Tzu Chi), one of the largest Taiwan-based civil and
   spiritual nonprofit organizations among the Chinese diaspora, is
   co-constituted by various social actors as an operationally closed
   system through their mediated communication. Based on an innovative
   theoretical framework that combines Maturana and Varela's notion of
   autopoiesis' with Cooren's ideas of incarnation' and presentification',
   we provide a rich analysis of Tzu Chi's co-constitution through
   organizational leaders' appropriation of digital and social media, as
   well as through mediated interactions between Tzu Chi's internal and
   external stakeholders. In so doing, our research expands upon the
   catalogue of common economic and relational behaviors by overseas
   Chinese, advances our understanding of Chinese spiritual organizing, and
   reveals the contingent role of digital and social media in engendering
   transnational spiritual ties to accomplish global humanitarian work.}},

Abstract = {{Modern urban areas constitute of rich mix of mobile user devices enabled
   with sensors and capability of being continuously connected to existing
   social networking infrastructure. In future the cities can act as single
   socio-technical super-organism with capability to generate large-scale
   adaptive urban dynamics expressing various forms of urban intelligence.
   Such an advanced situation-aware super-organism will be difficult to
   manage with traditional approaches and there is a need for innovative
   mechanisms for coordination in such open, unpredictable and dynamic
   pervasive environment. In this paper we propose a novel unified model of
   bio-inspired mechanism for modeling spatially situated pervasive
   computing scenarios and exploring emergence of self-adaptive behaviors
   in individuals within urban super organism. Simulation results
   demonstrate efficacy of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm constitutes the
   basic building block to progress towards unified ICT platforms for a
   variety of applications within the large framework of the smart cities.
   Unfortunately, designing a general architecture for IoT is still a very
   complex challenge, since in such system may be involved several devices,
   link layer technologies and services. Cultural Heritage represents a
   worldwide resource of inestimable value and it gains more and more
   importance when embedded into the digital ecosystem of a smart city. In
   this paper we focus specifically to design a IoT architecture that is
   able to support the designing of a smart museum, a static cultural space
   that becomes intelligent thanks to the definition of an innovative model
   of sensors and services. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
   a real case of study, placed in a temporary art exhibition of sculptures
   in the Maschio Angioino Castle, located in Naples, Italy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the structure characteristic and the measurement of
   knowledge work. This approach aims at measuring the knowledge works
   quantitatively and optimizing its productivity. Current knowledge on the
   issue is summarized based on the existing literature on the
   characteristic identification and measurement of knowledge work.
   Identification and definition for the concept of knowledge work are
   developed. Meanwhile, In order to give a structural measurement for
   knowledge work, this paper introduces the concept of entropy and builds
   a tree structure model for the quantitative expression of the
   uncertainty degrees of knowledge work. This tree structure model is
   applied empirically in a case of knowledge work measurement. Empirical
   data was collected by interviewing 3 knowledge workers in a digital
   technology company. The findings show that mastery of knowledge work's
   structural rules is a challenging phenomenon in practice. This study
   also shows that the tree structure model can be applied as an analytical
   tool. The findings of the study may help managers to achieve knowledge
   work's standardized management and excavate the innovation activities
   among knowledge work. This can be used as a starting point for
   developing novel productivity measures for knowledge work.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic systems generated much innovation of automotive development
   in recent years. The number of integrated sensor-systems is rising
   significantly faster compared to other electronics in automotive
   applications. Miniaturization and integration limit space for
   conventional solutions of robustness against electro-magnetic fields. To
   achieve robustness for Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of highly
   integrated sensors-systems is becoming more and more challenging. To
   proof EMC conform design at an early stage of development and to finally
   to meet customer-requirements.
   This paper introduces a new approach of engineering measurements by
   modulated radio frequency (rf) signals. It is intended to increase
   measurement-accuracy on chip-level and to save test time. The first step
   is to describe different noise-parameters of modern digital Integrated
   Circuits (IC / ASIC). Based on this knowledge parameters of
   frequency-modulated (FM) signals are chosen. By the study of different
   errors in test devices, represented by smart sensor devices in
   system-on-a-chip (SOC) and systems-in-package (SIP), the advantage and
   usability of the introduced test-method is pointed out and compared to
   conventional EMC-testing on chip-level.}},

Abstract = {{In Hungarian and international practice, many attempts and sets of
   example can be found as a direct or indirect use of the latest ICT
   (Information and Communication Technologies) in the teaching-learning
   process. With the support of Web 2.0 and e-learning 2.0 new education
   informatics methods have been published, often reshaping significantly
   the learning environment with new media instruments (Forgo, 2011). This
   way we shall get all the way to digital pedagogy 2.0 and its latest
   developments. The Web 3.0 as a line of continuation goes rather beyond
   the scope of existing technologies, and in addition to previous services
   promotes intelligent orientation in large data sets, reveals primacy of
   distributed mobile technologies and connectivity options as well as
   provides a among the first a space for new technologies such as
   artificial intelligence. The education system is trying to follow the
   new environment, the new roles, the digital generation's attitude, and
   the challenges of constant changes, as indicated by several
   international and Hungarian community forums. (For example Forum of
   Innovative Teachers). However, due to the development of
   multi-dimensional background variables adequate education / learning
   methodology recipes solutions are not available just yet. The research
   is looking for questions arising from this situation, searching for
   learning ways and habits of the digital generation as well as for the
   latest tools of digital communication and in order to achieve a more
   efficient outcome, it seeks methodological and technological support on
   base of higher education.}},

Abstract = {{Today's societies place challenging demands on so-called key
   competencies, a part of which are informatics competencies in meaning of
   a general computer or digital literacy. The key competencies look
   different in different contexts, but in of them they should strengthen
   one's capacity to participate in the world right now as well as in the
   future. In the paper the authors present a methodological background and
   results of a pilot research carried out to innovate and optimize
   informatics discipline teaching within selected non-informatics study
   programmes at the Faculty of Economics and Management at the Slovak
   Agricultural University in Nitra. A key part of the research has been a
   screening of students' requirements and opinions on informatics content
   which is and should be taught within their study programmes, and their
   assessment of the quality of the taught informatics disciplines. To
   collect the required data the authors developed a questionnaire
   containing 153 items divided into six areas. In the paper there are
   summarized main results of a pilot research which purpose was mainly to
   verify the reliability of the created questionnaire. Based on the pilot
   research data collection this was done by the means of the analysis of
   reliability/items and the questionnaire reliability value was calculated
   by using Cronbach's Alpha. The obtained results show high internal
   consistency of the created measurement instrument and guarantee credible
   data collection for a broader research which will follow.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of globally distributed computing services and network access
   allows `big data' on consumption to be used to model, explain and
   predict consumer behavior at resolutions that range from individual
   cities to whole countries. Given access to suitable infrastructure, the
   most significant challenge is to create conditions under which `Data
   Scientists' may access and manipulate the required data whilst observing
   individual, national, and commercial constraints set by the type and
   location of the data. This paper draws on the experience of building the
   first Global Computing Grid to connect collaborating sites in three
   continents and describes the architecture of an embedded analytical
   facility installed within a Chinese commercial organisation that has
   enabled collaborative analysis of millions of consumer records. We
   report how this access has provided new insights into consumer behaviour
   within China ranging from testing strategic models of economic
   development to exploring `digital exclusion' and the impact of migration
   on technology adoption.}},

Abstract = {{Phase-contrast mammography with synchrotron radiation is an innovative
   x-ray imaging technique that improves the identification of breast
   lesions. Previous studies have proven the superiority of the mammography
   images taken in the phase contrast modality using synchrotron radiation
   beams as compared with images taken in conventional mammography by
   subjective analyses. However, to our knowledge, no previous study has
   compared different acquisition systems in order to quantify this
   improvement by means of objective robust indicators. In this research,
   we intend to quantify the superiority of phase contrast imaging by means
   of objective metrics of image quality. The initial analyses were made
   using phantom images from two digital equipment for mammography and
   phase contrast images using synchrotron radiation. The acquisition
   conditions were varied and three indexes of image quality estimated in
   order to compare the image quality. The results showed an improvement of
   the contrast in phase contrast images. This contrast improvements is
   important in the detection of small lesions and details.}},

Abstract = {{Decision making in early production planning phases is often based on
   vague expert knowledge due to lack of a reliable knowledge base. Virtual
   planning has been prevailed as a method used to evaluate risks and costs
   before the concrete realization of production processes. This paper
   introduces a new concept and the corresponding data model for Design for
   Assembly by using Data Mining (DM) methods in the field of series
   production. The approach adopts the usage of existing planning data in
   order to extrapolate assembly processes. Especially linked product and
   process data allow the innovative usage of Data Mining methods. The
   concept presents assistance potentials for development of new products
   variants along the product emergence process (PEP). With this approach
   an early cost estimation of assembly processes in series production can
   be achieved using innovative Data Mining methods as shown in an
   industrial use case. Furthermore, design and planning processes can be
   supported effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Public and private organizations in various areas are setting up digital
   Information Infrastructures (IIs) for interconnecting government,
   businesses and citizens. IIs can create value by sharing and integrating
   data of multiple actors. This can be the basis for value added services
   and especially collaborations of public and private partners can make
   IIs thrive. Easier access to integrated services and products (jointly)
   offered by government and businesses may stimulate transparency and
   innovations. IIs are under development in many domains, including for
   open data and international trade. However, there are notable
   differences in the design, characteristics and implementation of the
   IIs. The objective of this paper is to compare two diverse IIs in order
   to obtain a better understanding of common and differing elements in the
   IIs and their impact. Among the differences are the roles of government,
   businesses and users, in driving, developing and exploitation of the
   IIs.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced technical developments have increased the efficiency of devices
   in capturing trace amounts of energy from the environment (such as from
   human movements) and transforming them into electrical energy (e.g., to
   instantly charge mobile devices). In addition, advancements in
   microprocessor technology have increased power efficiency, effectively
   reducing power consumption requirements.
   In combination, these developments have sparked interest in the
   engineering community to develop more and more applications that utilize
   energy harvesting for power. The approach here described aims to
   designing and manufacturing an innovative easy-to-use and
   general-purpose device for energy harvesting in general purpose shoes.
   The novelty of this device is the integration of polymer and ceramic
   piezomaterials accomplished by injection molding. In this spirit, this
   paper examines different devices that can be built into a shoe, (where
   excess energy is readily harvested) and used for generating electrical
   power while walking. A Main purpose is the development of an indoor
   localization system embedded in shoes that periodically broadcasts a
   digital RFID as the bearer walks. Results are encouraging and real life
   test are conducted on the first series of prototypes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Talent is a critical factor for organizational success.
   Multinational corporations (MNCs) face the challenge of fierce
   competition for talent worldwide by increasing their efforts in global
   talent management (GTM). To improve the strategic alignment of GTM,
   organizations increasingly incorporate information and communication
   technology (ICT) applications to support their GTM system. However, not
   every organization is successful at applying these new opportunities
   (e-GTM) and aligning them successfully with their organizational
   strategy. This chapter aims at conceptualizing the relationship between
   strategic GTM and strategic ICT in an aligned effort. It presents a
   conceptual framework that identifies four types of MNC approaches to
   e-GTM.
   Design/methodology/approach - By means of a review of, both the GTM
   literature as well as the ICT literature, we connect the two concepts,
   GTM and ICT into e-GTM, into a framework along two axes: the extent to
   which MNCs apply GTM (ad hoc vs. strategic) and the scope of ICT in MNCs
   (operational vs. strategic).
   Findings - Although the framework identifies four approaches to e-GTM in
   MNCs, the framework is less black and white than as presented. Companies
   can display e-GTM characteristics which place them in the gray areas in
   between each of the profiles. Additionally, we assume that achieving the
   alignment of strategic GTM and strategic ICT is an iterative process.
   Research limitations/implications - Since strategic alignment is not
   static but continuously changing, it requires companies to reevaluate
   their current GTM practices and ICT applications constantly while
   scanning the external market for new developments in the field of GTM
   and ICT to ensure the innovative state of their system. Furthermore, we
   assume that MNCs from high-tech sectors are more successful in
   supporting their strategic GTM applications with suitable ICT
   applications than MNCs from low-tech sectors. The study presents a first
   step toward researching the relationship between strategic GTM and
   strategic ICT in MNCs. The proposed framework might be used as a
   foundation for further research studies.
   Practical implications - The framework presented in this chapter can
   help MNCs to address the issue of connecting GTM and ICT.
   Originality/value - The relationship between GTM and ICT have not been
   conceptualized before. Furthermore, the typology presented in this
   chapter, with four approaches to ICT-enabled GTM, is a new way of
   looking at the GTM-ICT relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Health professionals constantly need to improve its education with
   continuing education. However these courses are costly, not only for
   participants, but also to the institutions due the absence of health
   professional available work to participate on physical courses.
   According with Castro (Castro et al., 2011) it is necessary to find new
   teaching and learning methods in the health area, with the development
   of actual, innovative and appealing digital resources that could be used
   in different learning activities. Learning Management Systems (LMS),
   Learning Objects and Thematic repositories of digital contents are some
   concepts linked together with the purpose to create a new global model
   of teaching and learning. The Faculty of Dental Medicine of the
   University of Porto (FMDUP), particularly, professors of Removable
   Prosthodontics pretends to implement a thematic Learning Object to
   support the teaching of Removable Partial Denture. This paper will
   describe a work in progress to achieve this goal.}},

Abstract = {{The movement toward utilizing information and communications technology
   (ICT) for control systems began in the early 1960s with the development
   of computers and computerized communication. This development has been
   applied in many industries, such as power generation, railroad, steel,
   and automotive.
   Because ICT innovation has progressed so rapidly, CPU performance and
   memory capacity have quadrupled every 3 years. Thus, the digital units
   have changed every 15 years. For example, in 1997 the most commonly used
   unit prefixes were giga and nano, whereas today the units used are tera
   and pico. Changes in real-world, actual control systems, have not
   occurred as rapidly as in ICT, and it is said that in this field
   undergoes a revolution occurs every 15 years. The new ICT era, which is
   characterized by cloud computing, smartphones (or tablets), and
   broadband radio networks, began in 2010. This chapter discusses the
   potential future outlook for real-world control system technology.}},

   taken with the x-ray source moving in a limited angle of rotation around
   the breast. These low dose projection images should become processed
   using mathematical methods, to reconstruct tomographic images, resulting
   in a 3D representation of the imaged breast. In tomosynthesis imaging,
   out-of-focus slice blur problem arises due to incomplete sampling
   problem. Several approaches have been suggested to deal with this
   problem. The purpose of this work is to implement Algebraic
   Reconstruction Technique (ART) and Multiplicative Algebraic
   Reconstruction Technique (MART) which are kind of that approach. Former
   studies addressed largely 2D tomosynthesis image reconstruction problem.
   In this study, a 3D phantom model was used. All of the algorithms and
   experiments are programmed with C++. The differences between two
   reconstruction algorithms are also investigated by means of comparing
   root mean square error (RMSE) and mean structural similarity (MSSIM).}},

   airworthiness, because it helps a lot in keeping crew safety and
   reducing economic losses. For the purpose of improving the
   crashworthiness performance of a kind of general aviation-type
   helicopter, an innovative light-weight composite energy-absorbing
   component has been developed in this paper. This component consists of
   carbon fiber woven cylindrical thin-walled tube and external triggers.
   The triggers let the cylindrical thin-walled tube split and break along
   its longitudinal axis and the energy is absorbed at the same time. In
   order to verify the results, a serial of test components were made and
   several tests were carried on. Finally, a digital simulation was carried
   on, whose results correspond with those of the tests. (C) 2014 Published

Abstract = {{Music industry records sale is facing a decline in many countries. This
   phenomenon was mostly happen by force of music emerging technology and
   changes in consumer behaviour. The emerging digital technology that gave
   rise to the MP3 and peer-to-peer file sharing online services was
   indirectly affecting consumer behaviour in purchasing music. Since music
   sharing is become common, buying music in form of physical is now less
   becomes an option.
   Actors in music industry in developed and developing countries often
   innovate some business models to survive. The innovation was conducted
   by finding new actors and their role, finding a new revenue stream, and
   finding a new marketing and distribution strategy. By using an expert

Abstract = {{In the last years, efforts have been focused towards new approaches for
   the automation of gas metal arc welding process parameters. In this
   framework, an innovative welding system based on a 3-axis motion device
   and a vision system consisting of a video camera, a laser head and a
   band-pass filter has been developed and implemented to recognize the
   desired features of weld joints, such as geometry and dimensions, and
   automatically adapt the welding process parameters according to these
   features. This papers focuses on a real case study of the railway
   manufacturing industry related to the welding process of a bogie frame.
   Through the employment of 3D Motion Simulation, the identification of a
   suitable reconfiguration of the system through the substitution of the
   3-axis motion device by means of an industrial robot is studied in a
   totally digital framework. Simulation of the welding process allows
   calculation of robot kinematics, collision detection and motion

Abstract = {{The complexity of product realization has increased significantly due to
   the requirements on ecological and social as well as economical
   sustainability. This has led to an increased demand on innovations
   concerning new materials and product-and process technologies, as well
   as on new business models for a better utilization of products and
   materials.
   Most innovations occur through a learning process where various actors,
   individuals as well as organizations, take part. Breakthroughs do not
   necessarily occur within the research or development departments, they
   are equally likely to occur during production or utilization. The
   challenge thus lies in providing platforms and tools for
   cross-divisional, collaborative innovation and for sharing Best
   Practices.
   This paper describes an initiative at KTH Royal Institute of Technology
   for supporting the integration of various company disciplines and
   external expertise through a collaborative framework where industry and
   academy can collaborate, supported by modeling, simulation and
   visualization during the innovation process. The approach combines
   theories and methods concerning innovation and digital factories and
   emphasizes aspects concerning learning, communication and collaboration.

Abstract = {{Innovative design approaches are needed for mass housing
   implementations. Especially increasing interaction between user and
   designer is major important in the design decisions of these buildings.
   For this, it is seriously necessary to benefit from technological
   advances in computational designs, because digital tools like shape
   grammar, cellular automata, genetic algorithm, l-systems and agent-based
   models in this field provide not only to save time and to manage the
   relationships but also to generate many different alternatives.
   Accordingly, a digital support tool for designers has been developed by
   using cellular automata approach and scripts of 3Ds Max software. It
   produces samples of housing design plans which is generated by cellular
   automata approach according to the data of users' preferences. In this
   paper the interface and contributions of the developed model are

Abstract = {{Technological innovation has been an important driving force in
   architecture, enabling and inspiring architects and engineers by giving
   them new tools for solving existing problems. In the last two decades,
   the exploration of digital design and fabrication technologies has
   stimulated the development of a variety of interests and strategies to
   materialize increasingly complex and customized solutions in
   architecture, with traditional building materials. Reinforced concrete
   is the most widely used material in the building industry today and
   throughout its history has been the subject of vast research into its
   performance as a construction material and its tectonic potential in
   architecture. As such, the introduction of digital fabrication processes
   in concrete construction represents the biggest prospect for renovation
   of our built environment and at the same time, presents particular
   difficulties and opportunities, which are now being addressed. In an
   effort to investigate the alternative design and material possibilities
   in concrete emerging from the use of digital fabrication technologies in
   architecture, this paper proposes a focused view of digital fabrication
   applied to concrete construction with two areas of research. By framing
   the research in the context of reference works in concrete architecture
   of the 20th century, this paper describes and illustrates taxonomy of
   existing and possible types of integration of digital fabrication
   technologies in concrete architecture in the realms of Practice and
   Research. This characterization allows the authors to frame the relation
   between material, technology and architecture in different environments
   regarding the same material, extracting a clear image of existing
   processes, their potential and shortcomings, as well as expectations for
   future developments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a theoretical approach and a methodology to investigate
   and document a narrative architecture will be presented. In the
   architecture field the word narrative is often used in reference to ways
   of representing or telling the story of a project. Within the context of
   this research with the expression ``narrative architecture{''} the
   authors mean an architecture that, like a book, tells a story through
   its material and immaterial characteristics. In order to analyze the
   selected characteristics of a narrative architecture, a possible
   approach is represented by a digital 3D reconstruction and a critical
   analysis of the digital model produced. The digital reconstruction
   process and the theoretical background have been applied to a case
   study, a masterpiece in the history of architecture: Mackintosh's
   Glasgow School of Art. Several graphic works have been created to
   communicate the main characteristics of this narrative architecture. The
   research project attempts to explore ways to study and explain existing
   buildings from new and innovative points of view, but at the same time
   it can trigger important reflections in architectural design and
   education.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetic systems offers new perspectives and design innovation in
   research and practice. These systems have been used by architects as an
   approach that embeds computation intelligence to create flexible and
   adaptable architectural spaces according to users changing needs and
   desires as a way to respond to an increasingly technological society.
   The presented research attempts to answer to this question based on the
   results of a multidisciplinary on-going work developed at digital
   fabrication laboratory Vitruvius Fablab-IUL in Lisbon. The main goal is
   to explore the transformation of the shape of a construction by
   mechanisms which allow adaptation either to environmental conditions or
   to the needs of the user. This paper reports the initial development of
   a kinetic system based on an origami foldable surface actuated by a
   user. The user can manipulate a small scale model of the surface and
   evaluate at all times if it is achieving the desired geometry.}},

Abstract = {{is paper is an exploratory intercession in the way mobile technology is
   used by the Romanian nonprofits, including work activities, stakeholder
   engagement, and the perceived impact upon their mission fulfillment. The
   purpose is to map the current state of use in order to identify the
   local trends and to shed light on how Romanian nonprofits can harness
   the entire potential of mobile devices. The research is based on a
   self-administered questionnaire developed by the author, addressing
   issues related with daily work flow, mobile applications, SMS campaigns
   and benefits of the mobile technologies for the organization. The global
   tendency in what concerns mobile technology for nonprofits has shifted
   from administrative efficiency towards delivering a mobile experience
   for the nonprofit stakeholders, innovation in fundraising strategy, data
   analysis, integration of their activities with their own mobile
   application and changes in the way nonprofits drive their mission online
   and offline. The findings reveal an increasing interest in the mobile
   technologies in the Romanian nonprofit sector, including building their
   own mobile app or using SMS campaign for different purposes, but the
   main activities are targeting the daily work routine and organizational

Abstract = {{Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the only imaging sensor
   technology that can provide all-weather, day-and-night and
   high-resolution images on a global scale. Today, SAR data are used for a
   multitude of applications ranging from geoscience and climate change
   research, environmental monitoring, 2-D and 3-D mapping, change
   detection, 4-D mapping (space and time), security-related applications
   up to planetary exploration. With the launch of the SAR satellites
   TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, COSMO-SkyMed constellation, Radarsat-2 as well
   as Sentinel-1a a new class of SAR satellites was introduced providing
   images with resolution in the meter regime. A paradigm shift is however
   taking place in spaceborne SAR systems. By means of the development of
   new digital beamforming and waveform diversity technologies in
   combination with large reflector antennas, future SAR systems will
   outperform the imaging capacity of current systems by at least one order
   of magnitude. This paper will provide an overview of the state of the
   art in spaceborne SAR technologies and applications, and will describe
   the innovative techniques and technologies that will shape its future

Abstract = {{Systems engineering has made significant strides over the last decade
   with the advent of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and the
   Systems Engineering Markup Language (SysML). These advances have made it
   possible for collaborative engineering teams to communicate using a
   common language and share information in the form of digital models
   rather than hard-to-maintain paper documents. One major advance that
   needs to occur next is enhancing systems engineering languages to
   address the needs of all stakeholders especially non-engineers. In this
   paper, we advance the proposition that recent advances in systems
   modeling, virtual world building, and technical storytelling are the key
   enablers of next generation systems engineering and systems engineering
   languages. To this end, this paper presents an innovative approach for
   developing an experiential design language that augments existing
   systems engineering language (i.e., SysML) with new perspectives
   informed by exploration and storytelling in virtual worlds. This
   language is intended to allow all stakeholders to understand and
   collaborate on system designs without having to learn engineering
   notation, and bring to bear their unique perspectives during
   collaborative system design. Furthermore, immersive experiences made
   possible by storytelling in the virtual world can potentially illuminate
   key system interactions and behaviors, allowing all stakeholders to make
   meaningful contributions in upfront systems engineering. The benefits
   and payoffs of the experiential design language are: increased
   participation of all stakeholders in upfront systems engineering;
   superior collaboration among stakeholders by allowing them to focus on
   different system levels and perspectives; and elegant system design by
   getting the architecture right the first time with minimum structural
   complexity. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of innovative low-cost home
   dedicated fire alert detection system (FADS) using ZigBee wireless
   network. Our home FADS system are consists of an Arduino Uno
   Microcontroller, Xbee wireless module (Zigbee wireless), Arduino digital
   temperature sensor, buzzer alarm and X-CTU software. Arduino and
   wireless ZigBee has advantages in terms of its long battery life and
   much cheaper compared to the others wireless sensor network. There are
   several objectives that need to be accomplished in developing this
   project which are to develop fire alert detection system (FADS) for home
   user using ZigBee wireless network and to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the home FADS by testing it in different distances and the functionality
   of heat sensor. Based from the experiments, the results show that the
   home FADS could function as expected. It also could detect heat and
   alarm triggered when temperature is above particular value. Furthermore,
   this project provides a guideline for implementing and applying home
   FADS at home and recommendation on future studies for home FADS in
   monitoring the temperature on the web server.}},

Abstract = {{Attempts to avoid ``massive noise{''} in large data sets associated with
   social networks have moved away from technical approaches that attempt
   to filter or classify social network data into meaningful elements
   through key words or other classification schemes. Rather, new
   approaches have an increased emphasis on communication flows between
   people in order to determine situational awareness. This paper
   summarizes recent innovative projects that stress agents (individuals)
   interacting with each other to generate an emergent and evolving social
   network. The projects build on Norbert Wiener's concept of ``emergent
   behavior{''} and show how it is applied to communications between
   individuals reporting on emerging biological diseases. Socio-technical
   analyses have concluded that the lack of feedback explains why Severe
   Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was widely transmitted. A pro-active
   approach to disease detection using feedback loops is introduced to help
   the Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) detection community communicate in a
   social network dedicated to the prevention of pandemics. This network
   does not depend on predetermined categories of information. Rather, it
   tracks a pandemic as it evolves in such a way that ``digital
   pheromones{''} help to prevent the risk of wide transmission in a
   changing socioecological world.}},

Abstract = {{Graphical user interfaces embody the complex dynamics between humans and
   everyday technologies. Designers and developers, constructing the
   graphical interfaces which determine and ``control{''} the structures of
   user experience, are themselves informed by observations of user
   behavior and interaction. The recent commercial proliferation of these
   graphical interfaces in consumer electronics and digital computing has
   expanded their use and influence. Revisiting the graphical user
   interface reveals the influence of the Wiener's original cybernetics
   project on early pioneers of interface design. The general cybernetic
   inquiries of control and communication are especially relevant to the
   concept of graphical user interfaces as modern communicative media
   between human and machine, as is the later work in understanding the
   reflexivity of observers acting within systems. In the potential
   capacity of graphical interfaces to expand human agency, but only if
   conceptualized and designed by humans to do so, understanding the
   cybernetic and systemic ontology of the graphical user interface is
   important in motivating innovative interface design and understanding
   the determinants of contemporary digital culture.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents i-m-Cave, a multitouch tabletop system for virtually
   touring the Mogao Caves. To recreate the experience of such a tour, a
   field study was conducted, and identified two key design considerations
   - exploration and restoration. For exploration, an innovative tangible
   figurine that can perform human-like neck extension/flexion is
   developed, and users can control the figurine to freely visit every
   corner of the virtual caves. Furthermore, users can view authorized
   animations to better understand the story behind important artifacts.
   With respect to restoration, users can restore digital artifacts and
   observe the rejuvenation and aging of artifacts with midair hand
   gestures and mobile devices, as if the users were shuttling back and
   forth between the present and the past. The i-m-Cave system presents the
   relationships between presently damaged artifacts and their virtually
   restored versions, which cannot be experienced in a real tour. Finally,
   the system was evaluated by interviewing experts. User feedback was
   positive, indicating the value of the system and its design.}},

Abstract = {{The creative application of digital technologies is accelerating as
   artists, designers and technologists continue to experiment and explore
   ways to create new aesthetic fields, semantically enhanced communication
   and innovative relations between people and machines. Our virtual worlds
   meet the real material world through the interdisciplinary research of
   computer scientists, digital media technologists, artists, designers and
   culture theorists. This paper will explore ways of bringing the virtual
   to the real through a range of differing conceptual positions and
   research approaches while demonstrating the creative interplay of
   variable media and online platforms for producing liminal works which
   cross the boundary between the analogue and the digital. The intent is
   to provide insights and examples of creative practice employing new
   technologies in innovative and unusual ways to generate exciting new
   work and offer new pathways for digital media research and development.
   The paper will present relevant theoretical frameworks and examples of
   current practice in the area of digitally enabled transitional spaces
   for artists, theorists and curators, as well as researchers working both
   in the field and beyond to those working with new technologies, social

Abstract = {{The laboratory side of a digital dental workflow consists of
   heterogeneous software tools including digitization (scanning), modeling
   (CAD), production planning (CAM) and production. The heterogeneity can
   be structured in two dimensions: `various partial systems', composing
   the dental product development system and `various vendors', offering
   software solutions for these partial systems. As a result the value
   creation process lacks efficiency and different input / output data
   streams are still necessary. As a standard for the representation of
   geometric data the STL format has been established, whereas for
   additional information, such as organizational and administrative data,
   as well as requirements and design data, the XML (eXtensible Markup
   Language) format is considered appropriate. However, a variety of
   proprietary XML data formats have been developed by system vendors. Thus
   incompatibilities are a significant source for errors. Data flow
   structures as available today only allow unidirectional flow of
   information `downstream'.
   A new approach is based on a federative workflow data management. The
   basic concept is a unified XML scheme that represents data about all
   activities and states of dental objects created, throughout the whole
   cycle of dental process. The new unified XML scheme provides a data
   structure, which can be adapted for the respective input / output data
   streams of all partial systems. The XML scheme represents a unified data
   scheme which allows both vertical (within a certain partial system
   class) and horizontal (along the digital dental workflow and independent
   of system vendor) data usage. Each dental system supplier only needs to
   create one input and output filter for the neutral XML interface. The
   system architecture is based on a web server to which a XML database
   server is connected. The XML database server manages project specific
   XML databases. Data can be made available through REST-, as well as
   through WebDAV-interface on LAN or WAN. With the help of)(Path and
   XQuery required data can be extracted from the database. Redundant data
   input as well as incompatibility errors can be avoided by this approach.
   The innovative core is a unified workflow data format, in which a
   bidirectional data flow can be provided for both downstream and
   upstream, along the digital dental workflow.}},

Abstract = {{Successful product planning and development revolves around great
   innovation, effective implementation of new ideas, cross-functional
   collaboration, and right decision making before translating ideas into a
   right product portfolio, features and technology roadmaps, and finally
   launching them as successful products. Managing the product planning
   processes offers multiple challenges in the absence of a healthy idea
   pipe line, a good visibility into market and competition dynamics, lack
   of cross functional collaboration and finally, absence of an integrated
   process and system to support the complex information interplay.
   Organizations have, in past, adopted different process models and
   technologies ranging from product data management (PDM), product
   lifecycle management (PLM), knowledge management and collaboration
   solutions to address above challenges. However, there is a significant
   opportunity to leverage next generation technologies such as digital
   social networking (DSN), cloud computing, and big data management in
   conjunction with the traditional technologies to improve the efficiency
   and effectiveness of product planning and development.
   This paper presents an industry perspective on the major potential areas
   where these next generation technologies can be leveraged in the early
   stages of design, particularly product planning. Specific examples from
   automotive design and manufacturing are used to illustrate the
   complementary nature of traditional technologies and the emerging
   web-based technologies. The paper discusses major industry trends and
   reviews academic research in this area, and concludes with the authors'
   point of view on how the combination of these technologies can be
   leveraged for developing a profitable product portfolio. The paper also
   highlights specific research issues from technological and business
   process standpoint that need to be addressed for successful integration.
   The potential benefits of such integration include productivity
   improvements, improved product offerings, first time right \& on time
   product launches.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of theories analysing intelligent cities brings some
   misunderstandings as well as fragmented interpretation of this
   phenomenon. The common approach is linked to focus on ICT
   infrastructure, being digital, virtual, and innovate via technologies.
   However, in social sciences the concept of intelligence is quite
   different and more complex compared to technological sciences. Therefore
   the article suggests that an intelligent city primarily should concern
   about creating knowledge by gathering it from external environment (not
   only internal) and applying it into decisions. Information communication
   technologies are important but only in the role of helping tools for
   more successful development. The article discusses various concepts of
   an intelligent city, the essence of the concept of intelligence and
   stress key aspects of being an intelligent city. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The term, ``ecosystem{''} is mostly noticed in the science of biology;
   nonetheless it frequently appears in economy related literature, as
   well. The following terms can be found throughout particular writings:
   business ecosystem, entrepreneurship ecosystem, an innovation ecosystem,
   digital business ecosystem and industrial ecosystem. The aim of this
   research is to compare these analogies. Every analogy has different
   actors, its environment and various interactions between them;
   furthermore every ecosystem is a community of subjects that interact as
   a complete system. Biological ecosystem analogies have a distinctive
   effect on their entities and the environment, moreover they have
   different key determinant affecting the performance of the whole system.

Abstract = {{Global integration process influenced the development of technologies
   and the extension of the information industry around the world. Due to
   technological innovations borders of delivering information between
   sectors of traditional systems of mass communication are changing. This
   process will lead to the creation of new mass media systems. In the
   space of extending mass communication sphere the press and broadcasting
   are considered as the ``old{''}, traditional mass media, the appearance
   of new channels of delivering information and the information, based on
   a digitalization, are defined as the ``new media{''}. Global
   distribution of information and communication creates opportunities for
   free communication at different levels: vertical, horizontal, network,
   mass and individual. Models of change of media systems in Kazakhstan and
   abroad become similar, and the tendency of globalization plays an
   important role in this process. It is difficult to distinguish the mass
   and personal form of communications. But the consumption of new media
   has more individual and interactive character. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This chapter focuses on learning space design for students'
   technologyrich lifestyles, in particular the evolution and future of
   learning spaces in the United States. JISC design principles - bold,
   supportive, future proof, creative, and enterprising - frame discussion
   in the chapter's first section, ``Planning for the learning spaces of
   tomorrow.{''} The section begins with pioneering work in the field and
   follows with recent learning spaces (both classrooms and informal
   learning environments) that seek new and innovative ways for students to
   collaborate. Examples clearly point to students' need for continual
   access to flexible, tech-rich spaces that support their work and study
   habits.
   The chapter's second section, ``The future of learning spaces: On-demand
   apps and Bring Your Own Technology (BYOT),{''} is a case study focused
   on software virtualization's influence on learning space design at
   Indiana University. The section brings in examples from the University
   of South Florida and the University of Iowa, asserting that physical and
   virtual learning spaces must be designed to come together seamlessly,
   echoing students' on-the-go lifestyles and constant connectedness.
   Ultimately, the section makes a bold contention about the evolution of
   learning spaces: Any space can become a tech-rich learning environment,
   if students have access to virtualized software.
   Throughout, the chapter touches on compelling questions about meeting
   the learning needs of digital natives: How do we challenge traditional
   educational paradigms? Can we flip the classroom to further the
   potential of all learners? What is the role of collaboration in
   learning? Which models will energize and inspire learners and
   instructors of the future?}},

Pages = {{141-160}},
Abstract = {{This chapter presents some basic concepts on time studies and discusses
   what a temporal approach can offer for higher education research. Being
   an invariable constituent of life, time structures and organizes
   activities and processes in higher education, covering all of its levels
   and functions. Furthermore, the current policy agenda that emphasizes
   the need for higher education to accelerate innovation flows, and to
   speed up the production of new knowledge and workers, accentuates the
   importance of the temporal perspective. The chapter examines the
   dominant, taken-for-granted conception of time - clock time - which
   involves a linear, quantitative, cumulative, homogenized, abstract and
   decontextualized conception of time. The core features of clock time are
   described by the four Cs put forward by Barbara Adam: creation,
   commodification, colonization and control of time. It is argued that, in
   the current digital, post-modern era, social acceleration reshapes and
   transforms the nature of clock time, which results in compression of
   time, shrinking future and extended present, all manifest in the overall
   speeding-up of life. In addition, a temporal lens for analysing higher
   education is presented, with examples from empirical studies on time and
   temporalities in academic work and identity building.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we seek to discuss and
   highlight the disruptive innovation that is currently under way in the
   evolving field of digital currencies and Bitcoin. Second, drawing on
   theories and frameworks in the Information Systems (IS) discipline, we
   highlight possible paths for research that will shed light to some of
   the challenges opened up by the digital currency phenomenon. An agenda
   for systematic IS research in this area is envisioned to assist the
   transition from the first era of applications in this domain (i.e.
   Bitcoin as currency) to more disruptive uses of the Bitcoin protocol as
   an enabler of decentralized trusted peer-to-peer transaction ledger
   systems and applications.}},

Abstract = {{Responding to local, regional and international demands and initiatives,
   the government of Ecuador has rolled out an innovative program Sistema
   Integral de Tecnologias para la Escuela y la Comunidad (SiTEC) to place
   information, and communication technologies (ICTs) into the hands of
   students, teachers, and other educational institutions. SiTEC draws upon
   several elements of social entrepreneurship and has successfully reached
   some of the most regionally remote and culturally diverse communities in
   the country. The SiTEC program is emblematic of many of the criteria set
   forth regarding social entrepreneurship including the vision of
   leadership, the focus on a social mission and the importance of
   innovation in partnership and resource allocation. This study looks at
   survey and interview data from the Shiria community teachers and school
   leaders to determine the effects of the SiTEC program and the
   availability and use of ICTs in schools, SiTEC has equipped public
   schools with computers, projectors, digital boards, and Internet.
   Additionally, SiTEC organizes training courses on ICTs for public school
   teachers and provides schools with educational software available in
   Spanish, Kichwa, Shuar, and English. While there is still much work to
   be done, SiTEC and the associated partnerships and programs are
   beginning to have impact in their specified outcomes. Creative
   partnerships developed within the Ministry of Education, Office of
   Bilingual Education, Shiria community have allowed for communication and
   exchange of knowledge and resources across multiple partners. This
   chapter explores S1TEC as an innovative government-based program that
   meets targeted social outcomes in ICTs and education.}},

Abstract = {{Social media use in times of crisis and disaster has the potential to
   deliver many benefits. Uniquely, social media is a bilateral
   communication medium, which allows information to be conveyed and
   solicited between both the citizen and state. Social media is also a
   domesticated technology, which creates potential paths for surveillance
   crossover from the public into the private sphere. Any indications that
   state institutions (revenue commissioner, police, social welfare
   department) are abusing the technology - for example, by prying into
   citizens' behaviour - will have negative implications on the trust
   relationship between state and citizen. Crucially, ills this trust
   relationship that needs to be fostered, as those very state institutions
   will call upon it during times of crisis.
   Social media has also become deeply politicised, wherein parties, for
   their own ends, either valorise it as a societal innovation, an
   important component and contributor to the digital economy, or demonise
   it as the cause of societal ills (e.g. London riots, eyber bullying,
   harmful online fads) - of course, both arc reductive, serving only to
   undermine and distort the true societal impact of social media.
   At its worst, social media can be can be seen as an engine of moral
   panic, occupying a space where headline driven journalism and
   opportunistic politics collide, which inevitability leads, over time, to
   further erosion of the bonds of trust between government stakeholders
   and the citizenry.
   In the absence of transparent, structured social media strategies, as
   part of a piece of coherent government policy and implemented at
   institutional level, the successful use of social media in disaster
   management (response and recovery) will be severely restricted. As it
   stands, government or party political interventions and engagement with
   social media tend to be focussed on narrow matters of voter mobilisation
   and engagement. While this approach can, in the short term, serve to
   deliver - as part of a set of campaigning tools a temporary dividend in
   support, the cynical motives of it will, over time, only serve to
   undermine citizen trust. The power to harness the real benefits of
   social media will continue to be undermined as long as the societal
   impact of government constructs around social media do not recognize the
   important dynamics of such a trust relationship.
   A new paradigm of engagement, one that is rooted in trust, transparency
   and open dialogue, must be engendered before social media can fully
   realise its potential as a robust, reliable, effective communications
   component within crisis management strategies for periods of
   instability.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation is a main economy driver in the 21st century and in recent
   years has shifted from a primarily technological `information society'
   mantra to one describing broader non-technological innovation and
   intellectual capital. In any case this current approach is more suitable
   for a service-based sustainable society. The creative and cultural
   economy in the digital environment is a growing part of the global
   economy. Trade based on creativity, knowledge and information generates
   jobs, wealth and cultural engagement. According to a UNDP report
   Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) contribute up to 7\% of GDP and
   is the fastest growing sector of many economies. In Latvia the term
   Creative Industries (CI) has been used since 2005 and similarly to other
   Baltic States Latvia has accepted the CI definition provided by the
   British Department of Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS). Despite that,
   broader entrepreneurship policy support for CCI is used very little. In
   spite of the lack of attention by economic policy makers, creative
   industries in Latvia exist, therefore it makes sense to talk about them
   and analyze their economic condition as a means of understanding more
   deliberately their economic potential. The aim of this paper is to
   explore the concept of CCI with the method of literature review and to
   establish an understanding of the describing terms and theories. This is
   crucial because the amount of literature is large and many sources
   express policy formulations which could be questioned with respect to
   their academic strength. This research paper has three main themes - (a)
   key descriptions of CCI and related concepts; (b) statistical
   perceptions and the limitations of existing statistical frameworks; and
   (c) some interesting theories of how to perceive CCI.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the implementation of an innovative
   interactive learning tool in teaching a Mechatronics Engineering course
   at the University of Waterloo. The course deals with digital logic, PLC
   programing, and assembly language. The interactive tool, developed at
   Top Hat Monocle Inc., was used in teaching the assembly language part of
   the course. The interactive tool has two components: students'
   electronic devices and a front-end website in which the instructor has
   control to launch demonstrations and quizzes and receive students'
   responses. Students are connected through WiFi connection or their smart
   phones. In this study, students' performance was evaluated using the
   final exam scores and the surveys. The exam results showed about 23\%
   improvement. According to the results of the survey administered at the
   end of the term, students who participated on the interactive simulation
   and quizzes agreed that it helped the concepts ``stick in their memory
   better{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Nth-Dimensional Truncated Polynomial Ring (NTRU) is a lattice-based
   public-key cryptosystem that offers encryption and digital signature
   solutions. It was designed by Silverman, Hoffstein and Pipher. The NTRU
   cryptosystem was patented by NTRU Cryptosystems Inc. (which was later
   acquired by Security Innovations) and available as IEEE 1363.1 and X9.98
   standards. NTRU is resistant to attacks based on Quantum computing, to
   which the standard RSA and ECC public-key cryptosystems are vulnerable
   to. In addition, NTRU has higher performance advantages over these
   cryptosystems.
   Considering this importance of NTRU, it is highly recommended to adopt
   NTRU as part of a cipher suite along with widely used cryptosystems for
   internet security protocols and applications. In this paper, we present
   our analytical study on the implementation of NTRU encryption scheme
   which serves as a guideline for security practitioners who are novice to
   lattice-based cryptography or even cryptography. In particular, we show
   some non-trivial issues that should be considered towards a secure and
   efficient NTRU implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Health care industry has come a long way from more than just Hospital
   Information Systems (HIS), Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to computer
   assisted surgeries and remote patient care, since the advent of
   information technology into the health care domain. With the advances in
   information technology, healthcare in all kinds of markets is becoming
   more digital, more collaborative, more patient-centric, more datadriven.
   It aims towards accessing information anytime, anywhere. The traditional
   technology infrastructure of health care sector will not be able to
   cater to this massive amount of data generated and the various health
   care services to be offered to the patients. Cloud Computing is a fast
   growing trend that includes several services, all offered on demand over
   the internet in a pay-as-you-go model. It promises to increase the speed
   with which applications are deployed and lowers costs. Cloud computing
   can play a critical role in managing the current trend of growth in
   digital data and anywhere anytime availability of medical services.
   Cloud computing can also contribute significantly to containing
   healthcare integration costs, optimizing resources and ushering a new
   era of innovations in healthcare.
   This paper examines in brief, some of the digital data challenges that
   the healthcare industry is facing. The paper describes a system that is
   capable of offering various health care services that utilize cloud
   computing. The paper also presents the implementation of one service
   offered as part of the system described.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of our research is to identify opportunities for improving
   the strategic management of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by
   utilizing digital advancements. Our main objectives were: identifying
   the degree of adoption of digital technologies by SMEs in comparison
   with large companies; assessing responsiveness and the degree of
   adaptation to the digital SMEs management; formulating recommendations
   for strategically managing SMEs in the digital era. SMEs better adapting
   to the changes generated by the digital age is beneficial not only for
   their survival and development but also for economic growth and
   reduction of unemployment in developed and developing countries. The
   emergence of digital products and services creates new opportunities for
   enterprises and individuals alike an example of that bing the fact that
   for every job eliminated by the adoption of new digital technologies 2.6
   new jobs are created {[}2]. The EU digital Agenda for 2020 states as one
   of the objectives that a minimum 33\% of SMEs sell online and 50\% of
   the population purchase goods or services online by 2020 {[}8]. As
   working methodology we used a questionnaire aimed to identify perceived
   obstacles in the adoption of digital instruments by SMEs. Following the
   interpretation of our results and also studying policies supporting the
   adoption of digital instruments in over 600 SMEs worldwide we proposed a
   number of relevant measures for improving the strategic management of
   SME's. Since the adoption of digital instruments is no longer a choice
   but a necessity {[}5]. SMEs need to innovate not only by offering
   products and/or unique services but also by adopting the latest
   technologies dynamically able to highlight their capabilities and
   possibilities. Many organizations have turned to the internet to
   facilitate and develop fast access to information and only then realized
   that the adoption of digital media could play a more important role in
   improving their entire activity {[}1].}},

Abstract = {{Conference paper documents on number of examples the fundamental changes
   which have occurred in the last few years, in particular thanks to the
   technological and other innovations in the society and specifically in
   the field of media studies (study stream of marketing communications)
   3.2.3. The old paradigms have not been valid anymore and have been
   replaced by new ones. The concept of marketing is changing, as well as
   the position of individual media and their behaviour. Not only
   advertising media have changed marketing communication, but above all ad
   formats, strategy and the overall concept have changed. Significant
   changes occur with the advent of new online media. Internet and
   digitalisation, however, also have some shortcomings and brings a number
   of problems, in particular in the development and behaviour of young
   generation. In conclusion, the author presents some topics on which the
   faculties offering the marketing communication study program of 3.2.3
   should search for answer. If they want keep up with Joneses they should
   accept those changes and on their basis develop themselves progressively
   further on.}},

   digital applications not just in the metros but also in smaller cities
   and towns. There has been a phenomenal growth of digital media usage
   despite the poor power and infrastructure situation in India which is a
   huge deterrent. India today boasts of the third largest population on

Abstract = {{Now a days, image watermarking is becoming a very important issue for
   image authentication and copyright protection due to explosive growth of
   multimedia applications. In this paper, an innovative robust digital
   watermarking scheme is proposed for image authentication and copyright
   protection which is based on the probability of existing total number of
   one's and zero's in a single block. The proposed scheme uses scrambled
   binary watermark to embed four times into different locations of host
   image in order to ensure high security and to be robust. The extraction
   of watermark is done by comparing between total amount of detecting
   `one' and `zero' bit from each block of size eight by eight. The
   experimental results show that the proposed method provides perceptually
   invisible watermark, high security and robustness against various image
   processing and geometrical attacks such as filtering, cropping as well
   as salt and pepper noise attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Network monitoring represents an important factor in improving the
   quality of the services provided by communication networks. In this
   paper we describe a network management and monitoring system that will
   use Machine-to-Machine (M2M) sensor systems, reducing costs through fast
   isolation of a subpart of the network that is not functional. The system
   is composed of an innovative low-cost sensor with an integrated M2M
   interface and a web server solution for management and network
   monitoring. The main contribution of this paper consists in the
   integration of data acquisition from the various equipments and sensors
   together with existing systems for management and monitoring of
   resources in a network, including workforce management systems,
   furthermore allowing configuration of network elements. Finally, the
   paper discusses the main findings for an implementation of M2M sensor

Abstract = {{The submitted survey was focused on the analysis of opinions and
   attitudes expressed by the teachers participating in the national
   project called `Education Process Modernization at Elementary and
   Secondary Schools' performed in selected training centres on the
   territory of Slovakia in years 2008 - 2013. The main objective of the
   project was innovation and modernization of teaching procedures,
   methods, and education forms, supported by a suitable and didactically
   well-prepared application of available digital technology. The education
   included 6,527 qualified teachers of elementary and secondary schools
   specialised in one of the 10 selected subjects (Biology, Mathematics,
   Physics, Geography, Chemistry, Slovak Language and Literature, History,
   Music, Art, and subjects taught in the 1st stage of elementary
   education) and several-year lasting pedagogical experience. The
   education consisted of 3 modules in the total extent of 100 to 106
   lessons, whereas a part of the education was carried out in form of
   e-learning. In the introductory, analytical part of the study, we
   describe the course and the content of individual educational modules.
   These modules were focused on the development of general digital skills
   of teachers, acquisition of the general knowledge on the existing
   technological solutions, and acquisition of specific skills in the field
   of efficient use of the modern didactic technology in the teaching
   process. The key role in the methodical preparation of teachers was
   played by the 3rd module which represented the response to the long-term
   requirements of teachers to create, and illustrate with particular
   examples, efficient application of digital technologies in the
   education, especially in the context of the existing educational
   contents of specific subjects. The teachers proved their overall
   readiness for active implementation of innovative elements into the
   education process and their ability to use reasonably the available
   educational technologies when teaching their subjects by elaboration of
   their final theses and successful defence of these theses before the
   commission of experts. The core of the study consists of the results of
   our findings which are mapping the overall satisfaction of education
   participants with the general professional quality, difficulty level,
   and contents of individual modules, as well as their own assessment of
   the acquired skills and knowledge regarding the work with modern
   didactic technology and specific software solutions. The survey is
   supplemented with the analyses of teachers' attitudes towards the real
   usability of the available model methods, their opinions on the quality
   of the produced teaching aids and digital technologies engaged in the
   education process. In the end of the article, we present the suggested
   measures which could, in accordance with our findings, facilitate
   improving quality of the education process at Slovak schools, in order
   to reflect the real needs of life in the sciential society.}},

Abstract = {{In advanced applications such as satellite telecommunications, digital
   radar, frequency hopping data links and micro-wave communications,
   powerful signal processors able to handle broadband signal vectors are
   becoming more common. The bottleneck is now the availability of high
   sampling rate and high linearity data converters, ADCs (Analog to
   Digital Converter) for reception and DACs (Digital to Analog Converter)
   for transmission.
   Advanced high bandwidth and high data rate data converters are
   revolutionizing the way that microwave communication systems are
   designed. The ability to perform direct microwave synthesis in the L, S
   and lower C bands brings higher flexibility and lower part count without
   any performance degradation. Some of these data converters are now
   available with space grade quality and as such are being used in many
   satellite applications.
   This paper describes an innovative 12bit 3GSps DAC, EV12DS130A, with an
   output bandwidth of 6GHz which gives good performance up to lower C
   band. It describes the design features of the device along with a novel
   output shaping scheme which extends the performance up to higher
   frequencies.
   The paper also covers the interfacing to the device which can often be
   problematic for space grade Application Specific Integrated Circuits
   (ASICs). A novel timing verification feature is described along with a
   timing mode which can reduce the input data rate but allows data output
   at higher clock speeds.
   A companion 10bit 1.5GSps ADC, EV10AS180A is also described, which
   offers good performance into the L band and along with the EV12DS130A
   can provide a complete space grade transceiver solution. Also covered
   are aspects of these components' performance under radiation testing.}},

Abstract = {{In an ever more digital world, cloud computing has emerged as a new way
   of doing things for IT. But is it just that or is it a fundamental
   transformation of the role of IT in business? Isn't IT slowly becoming
   the way business is done? In this talk, I will discuss how the
   combination of cloud computing, mobility, social media and big data is
   fundamentally transforming our lives and our way of doing business.
   Beyond just doing IT differently, it opens up new opportunities for
   business people and opens up brand new avenues of innovation. Using real
   examples, I will illustrate the tremendous opportunities technology
   provides today and in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The objective of the paper is to prove how it is possible to
   enhance relational capital in the football industry by proposing an
   innovative approach in the evaluation of football clubs and football
   players founded on their popularity on the social network. The research
   is directed in representing how the value created by social networks can
   be a determinant of relational capital value, by increasing strong and
   trustworthy relationships, especially, with young clients.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on a qualitative
   and quantitative approach. Following the analysis of existing literature
   on intellectual capital and on social media, research has been across
   two analyses. The first analysis has been carried out by international
   professional football clubs on which popularity on social networks may
   have an important influence. The second objective is to check whether
   the economic value of footballers is taken from the total of human
   capital value and their value of relational capital developed through
   new digital platforms. Empirical research aims at proving the
   correlation that exists between the decisive factors indicated above.
   Originality/value - The methodology puts in evidence the existence of
   economic opportunities, deriving from the management of web platforms,
   especially with reference to the needs of managers to take advantage of
   competences deriving from the social media to transform fans and
   followers in consumers. The analysis configures future research through
   the integration of social networks impact in the evaluation formula of
   relational capital of professional football clubs and players, with
   reference to their transfer prices.
   Practical implications - From a comparison carried out with the sales'
   value of a sample of clubs belonging to the Top 30 ranking, drawn up by
   Deloitte in the Football Money League 2014 Report, and their level of
   popularity on social networks, research investigates into the existence
   of a correlation between sales of football clubs and the number of fans
   present on the web platforms. The aim is to prove that social networks
   are indicators of the relational capital value. Using the same approach,
   the analysis focuses on the transfer prices of a sample of footballers
   playing in the most important European League clubs.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims at evaluating the effects of the exploitation
   and exploration strategies on the economic and innovative performance of
   a local system of firms. Accordingly, this study embraces the
   exploration-exploitation dilemma (e.g., March, 1991; Benner and Tushman,
   2003; Burgelman, 2002; Holmqvist, 2004; Katila and Ahuja, 2002) and
   differently from the extant literature we investigate the two above
   mentioned innovation strategies at the level of a system of firms rather
   than at a single organization's one. Specifically, we aim at empirically
   analyzing which strategy is more beneficial for those systems of
   organizations? Can systems benefit more by the introduction of new
   technology into existing products and processes or they can take more
   advantage by the continuous improvement of their technological knowledge
   base?
   Design/methodology/approach - To reach our aim, an empirical research
   has been conducted on the 103 Italian Provinces, by measuring for each
   province both economic and innovative performance and indexes that
   capture the exploitation and exploration strategies. Specifically,
   focusing on the manufacturing sector, we use two different indexes, as:
   the inverse Gini coefficient of the distribution of firms by sector
   (two-digit level) in each province, which measures the heterogeneity
   across unrelated manufacturing sectors, and the inverse Gini coefficient
   of the distribution of firms within each two-digit sector in each
   province, which measures the heterogeneity across related manufacturing
   sectors. Furthermore, a set of control variables is included to account
   for other potential effects on provinces' performance.
   Originality/value - Our results reveal that exploration strategies, as
   reflected by the agglomeration of industrially different organizations,
   have positive effects on the economic and innovative performance in a
   territory, as well as that this effect results greater when the
   exploration regards more similar industrial sectors. Our interest on the
   effects of the two strategies on a system of firms rather than on a
   single organization significantly offers contributions both to the
   literature related to innovation strategies and to the studies on local
   economic growth. Specifically, while most of previous studies on
   innovation strategies adopt as level of investigation the single
   organization or dyadic collaborations, we focus on the
   exploitation-exploration balancing at the level of firms' geographical
   systems. Furthermore, analyzing which of the two strategies is more
   conducive for the territorial development and growth, allows us to give
   a contribution in the field of economic growth and regional development,
   answering the question on the relevance of heterogeneity in firms'
   competencies and capabilities for the competitive advantage of the local
   systems of firms (Boschma, 2005; Schamp et al., 2004).
   Practical implications - Of course this study presents a number of
   practical implications, especially referring to the definition of
   innovation strategies and policies aimed at sustaining the economic and
   innovative outcomes of given territories. In particular, our findings
   suggest the importance of enhancing local development by favouring the
   establishment of organizations operating in different by complementary
   industrial sectors.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Global economic integration, technological change, the rise of
   digital opportunities and a new and sophisticated demand for products
   and services are creating a multitude of new opportunities and business
   options for firms and organizations. Accordingly, they are increasingly
   challenged to develop more and more renewed strategic, management and
   knowledge models, approaches, tools and techniques to satisfy
   effectively customers and to improve performance and sustainability.
   Although these scenarios characterize all the economic activities, this
   is particularly true for some industries more involved to face these
   transformations: it is the case of the banking sector. In fact, in the
   last decade, in a regulatory framework changing and under an high
   competitive pressure, banking organizations are revisiting and expanding
   their traditional borders and modalities to do business, trying to
   re-think their internal structures and to integrate more effectively
   places and channels, new services, new technologies, customers' wants
   and cost-reduction needs.
   The aim of the paper is then to examine the new strategic, management
   and knowledge models elaborated and adopted in the banking sector in the
   Italian context. The relationships among these models and the business
   performance of the main banking organizations are identified and
   analyzed. Five successful experiences related to the adoption of new
   strategic, management and knowledge models are introduced and discussed.
   Design/methodology/approach - To support our arguments we adopt a
   multiple-case studies methodologies. We provide the case examples of
   Banca Fineco, Azimut, Banca Fideuram, Banca Mediolanum and Banca
   Generali which recently have effectively planned and implemented
   innovative strategies and models aimed to activate and support a
   sustainable growth of their business.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to further develop our
   comprehension about the importance to elaborate and implement new
   strategic, management and knowledge models in a very relevant business
   sector such as the banking one. The analysis of the case-examples shows
   in particular how some Italian banking organizations - often considered
   too small to compete in the capitals global competition - have been able
   to elaborate and successfully implement new mechanisms to guarantee
   performance and sustainable growth.
   Practical implications - The paper provides implications for future
   research and useful insights for management. However, further and
   detailed case studies are called to improve understanding of the
   phenomena and the capacity to generalize insights and best practices.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper investigates Smart Working (SW), a set of modern
   and not-conventional organisational models that are characterised by
   high flexibility in the choice of the working spaces, time and tools,
   and that provides all employees of a organisation with the best working
   conditions to accomplish their tasks. Specifically, the paper aims to:
   (i) identify whether firms adopt different SW models: (ii) explore
   complementarities between the elements that can lead to choose a SW
   model, and (iii) figure out whether contingent variables matters in the
   implementation of a particular SW model.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a continuative
   research initiative promoted since 2012 by the School of Management of
   Politecnico di Milano, i.e. the Smart Working Observatory. In order to
   achieve the paper goal, during 2013 we have run a survey delivered to
   100 HR directors of medium and large Italian organizations to collect
   empirical evidence on SW phenomenon, and accomplished multiple, embedded
   case studies to better explain the findings achieved in the quantitative
   analysis.
   Originality/value - The paper aims to look inside the black box of SW,
   by unpacking the elements that can generate complementarities between
   the adoption of digital tools, workplace and work practice innovation.
   Practical implications - Managers who aim to fully benefit of SW
   practices should not only invest in the enabling digital technologies,
   but also make the complementary transformations in organisational
   policies and workspace settings, according the contingent conditions
   under which they operate.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increases in promotional pressure by manufacturers and retailers
   to counter the effects of the economic crisis, promotional effectiveness
   is decreasing. Brands are reacting by experimenting with innovation in
   promotion, enabled by new digital channels, customer insight derived
   from individual customer information and new intermediaries. We respond
   to a call for research on promotion innovation (Grewal et al., 2011) by
   analyzing the post crisis promotional scenario. We see it shaped by the
   convergence of three industries: loyalty, payments and apps. Players and
   solutions from these three areas are merging to make a blend of loyalty
   and price promotion available for brands to deliver over digital
   channels and in targeted ways. We discuss managerial implications and
   new research opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{he modernization of existing and creation of new global and regional
   navigation satellite systems as well as the modern threats to navigation
   receivers like intentional and unintentional interference rises the need
   for realistic testing of GNSS receivers not only under normal conditions
   but also under severe environments with low received power levels,
   shadowing and/or massive multi path as well as under interference
   conditions.
   The innovative and advanced design of the NavX (R)-NCS Professional GNSS
   Simulator gives users significant advantages in terms of flexibility and
   upgrade potential, allowing to simulate the RF signals received by one
   or more GNSS antennas as realistic as possible by maintaining full
   reproducibility and configurability of the simulated environment.
   The objective of this paper is to show specific capabilities and
   strengths of IFEN's premium-grade GNSS simulator. For this purpose
   different tests were conducted with the GALANT receiver of DLR IKN.
   GALANT utilizes an array antenna with four radiator elements and applies
   adaptive array processing after correlation of the signals of each of
   the four antenna channels. Because the array processing is applied after
   correlation, the directions of arrival of the GNSS satellite can be
   estimated and individual antenna beams can be adaptively steered to the
   satellites in view by adaptive digital beam forming.
   Additionally, strong interference signals are suppressed by generation
   of nulls during the beam forming process. By comparison of the estimated
   satellite directions with the known satellite positions from the decoded
   almanac the attitude of the array itself can be determined. In order to
   achieve a high accuracy in the direction of arrival estimations and the
   attitude determination a continuous calibration of the differential
   carrier phases between the four receiver hardware channels is performed
   by utilization of a special PRN code. For real antenna measurements the
   calibration PRN code is generated internally within the receiver, mixed
   up to RF and fed into a calibration port of the array antenna, from
   where it is distributed to the four antenna channels. However, in the
   hardware simulations no antenna is used and the simulator signals are
   directly fed into the receiver RF frontend {[}2, 1].
   As these techniques exploits the different carrier phases of the
   observed GNSS RF signal in each antenna element, the correct simulation
   and generation of the differential carrier phase for all antenna
   elements is crucial. With the NavX (R)-NCS, the carrier phases for all
   antennas can be simulated and generated with an absolute accuracy of
   better than one half of a degree (approximately 0.3 mm with respect to
   the L1 carrier). To support DLR's calibration technique, the NavX
   (R)-NCS can be programmed to simulate a zero-range/zero-doppler
   calibration signal using a configurable pseudo-random code (PRN). With
   this, the receiver's internal calibration routine achieved an accuracy
   of about 1 degrees.
   Exploiting the capabilities of the NavX (R)-NCS, it is also possible to
   simulate a phase coherent, modulated or un-modulated interference signal
   for all antenna elements. This allows to demonstrate the awesome
   interference mitigation capability of the GALANT adaptive antenna array.
   The present paper starts with an overview of the NavX (R)-NCS
   Professional GNSS Simulator that gives the user the potential to
   simulate a total of 108 channels. Any GNSS constellation and frequency
   may be freely assigned to any channel and re-assigned, as required, in
   subsequent test scenarios. The assortment of channels is totally under
   the control of the user and allows the same hardware to simulate a wide
   range of signals. The user has the option to use the same hardware to
   simulate different signals, in different test scenarios, and simulate up
   to nine different signals simultaneously. Furthermore, it keeps
   significant upgrade potential, giving the NavX (R)-NCS Professional GNSS
   Simulator outstanding versatility.
   The NavX (R)-NCS Professional GNSS Simulator may be fitted with up to 4
   independent RF outputs. That could be used to simulate multiple vehicles
   (for example, for real time kinematic (RTK) or formation flying
   scenarios), or multiple antennas on the same vehicle (for example, for
   attitude determination scenarios), or for separate elements of a
   Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA). In addition to the
   independent RF outputs the Simulator is fitted with a combined RF output
   for standard single output testing. The complete GNSS constellation
   simulator fits in a 2 high-units / 19 inch housing plus the control
   computer, which could be either a powerful notebook or a one height-unit
   / 19 inch computer.
   The paper discusses the GALANT adaptively steered antenna array and
   receiver and demonstrates the test scenarios generated with the GNSS
   simulator. Exemplary results of different static and dynamic test
   scenarios will be presented, demonstrating the attitude determination
   capabilities as well as the interference detection and mitigation
   capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{In the last two decades, the demand for geo-spatial data has
   tremendously increased. Mobile mapping Systems (MMS) are considered the
   main source of data for mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
   applications. MMS, which integrates navigation systems (such as Global
   Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation Systems
   (INS)) and imaging sensors (such as cameras and laser scanners), have
   been an emerging trend in mapping applications because they allow the
   implementation of the mapping concepts from moving vehicles (e.points
   external to the platform in the same mapping coordinate frame.
   Nevertheless, the major drawback of current MMS systems is their high
   price due to the type of the used platform, navigation and mapping
   technologies.
   Today's smartphones are getting more sophisticated and smarter and
   therefore they will narrow the gap between computers and mobile phones.
   Current generation of smartphones are equipped with GNSS receivers,
   microelectro mechanical systems (MEMS) based navigation sensors (such as
   gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, and barometers) and high
   resolution digital cameras. As a result, smartphones are now getting
   quite popular for data collection projects including point data mapping
   tasks and it is not far before we see smartphones are used as mobile
   mappers. This paper will present a new and innovative application of a
   portable MMS based on smartphones that overcome the high-cost drawback
   of the current land-based MMS with reasonable accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Compare with outdoor positioning, indoor positioning has been overlooked
   by many investigators. While GNSS can be made to work indoors, the lower
   signal levels and poor multipath environment mean that performance is
   much worse than outdoors, and in some places there is no coverage at
   all. Indoor GNSS and cell-phone bearer positioning will be in general
   use for emergency calls from mobiles (E911/E112), but with an accuracy
   close to 100 m (which is sufficient for this particular service). In
   contrast to the GPS, the DTV signals are received from transmitters at
   relatively short distance, while the broadcast transmitters operate at
   levels up to the megawatts effective radiated power (ERP). Also the RF
   frequency of the DTV signal is much lower than the GPS, which makes it
   easier for the signal to penetrate buildings and other objects. So it is
   suitable for the precision positioning inside the building and the city
   center. The digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTMB) is one of
   important standard about DTV, which is regulated by the national
   standard GB2006-20600. DTMB transmission system using time domain
   synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS innovation
   OFDM) of single and multicarrier modulation. This modulation mainly for
   broadband transmission channel characteristics of terrestrial digital
   multimedia television broadcasting can achieve good performance in
   linear time-varying transmitter channel or frequency selective and time
   selective exist at the same time channel. Pseudorandom sequence (PN) is
   introduced in DTMB signal frame header, DTMB signal has more stronger
   correlation than other DTV standards. So DTMB is more suitable for
   precise indoor positioning. Integration of DTMB with GNSS can provide a
   seamless transition from outdoor to indoor position and vice-versa. The
   ranging accuracy expected from DTMB systems is expected to be better
   than 1m in severe multipath environments. The paper describes the
   concept of using the DTMB signal for indoor positioning and how it is
   proposed to ensure seamless operation with GNSS and crucial techniques
   of positioning system based on digital television terrestrial
   broadcasting is researched. Firstly, it proposal one acquisition and
   tracking method based on DTMB digital TV signal and the infrastructure
   of indoor positioning system based on DTMB is given. The operating
   principle of the indoor positioning system is very similar to that of a
   GNSS. Fixed terminals transmit accurately timed signals, along with
   information about the terminal's location and the transmission time. The
   handset has both GNSS and indoor DTMB receiving terminals, and uses
   either or both so that the positioning service is seamless. Secondly, it
   analyzes the DTMB system structure and signal frame structure, and takes
   an example as PN420 mode to research the relationship of signal frame
   head original function. PN sequence in DTMB signals should be used for
   position location and multipath estimation under some circumstances.
   However, large position location error may be introduced when there is
   co-channel interference in the DTMB signal. In the presence of
   co-channel interference, multipath estimation is actually the linear
   combination of the multipath channel responses from all the DTMB
   transmitters on the same channel, since an identical PN sequence is used
   for all co-channel DTMB transmitters. Thirdly, the receiver design in
   baseband is fulfilled by analyzing the operation principle of receiver
   and validated on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA.
   Some key receiver techniques in baseband includes the digital filtering
   signal tracking, carrier tracking and code tracking, FIR filter and
   raise cosine filter is investigated. Based on some advantages of Field
   Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Implementation of the receiver in
   baseband is used on FPGA hardware platform. Finally, the positioning
   result combined with the GNSS and the DTMB signal is achieved. The
   result is shown that the positioning combined with satellite navigation
   signal and the DTMB signal is precise in the complex city environments.
   It provides that combined positioning system with GNSS and digital
   television terrestrial broadcasting signal is realizable in complex
   circumstance of city.}},

Abstract = {{GNSS localization in urban environment remains a key issue that must be
   solved in order to enable innovative driver assistance systems or
   cooperative applications. This positioning key issue exists not only in
   terms of accuracy, but also in terms of integrity. Actually, one aims at
   reducing as much as possible the error mainly due to multipath on
   buildings, and provide in the mean time a certain guarantee on the user
   position exactness. This communication shows how a simple geometrical
   modeling, named ``Urban Trench{''}, of the city environment can improve
   significantly the positioning accuracy. Authors also propose an
   algorithm for computing in this context an urban trench protection
   level, with a much higher reliability compared to standard protection
   level whose open sky assumption is violated. Preliminary results are
   given in the city of Nantes, France. One of the most interesting feature
   of the model is that it complies with the existing digital road map
   features and does not cause data storage or computational throughput
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the antenna's privileged position as the first line of defense
   against interferers, jammers and spoofers, most detection and mitigation
   techniques are realized in the receiver's backend signal processing
   blocks. Nonetheless, these solutions often require considerable
   additional hardware added to the receiver's frontend and antenna design.
   For example, multi-antenna arrays replace a single antenna design for
   the purpose of detection/mitigation of interference, jamming {[}1] and
   spoofing {[}2] {[}3]. Among the single antenna detection/mitigation
   designs, some form of antenna movement over time is required. For
   example, the use of a synthetic aperture {[}4] and the generation of
   high frequency antenna motion {[}5] has been proposed for spoof
   detection/mitigation. All of the aforementioned innovations utilize
   additional signal processing blocks in the backend, in conjunction with
   the supplemented frontend hardware, to achieve their intended goals.
   A primary technique for achieving this type of adaptability in
   sub-wavelength single antenna systems is the use of discrete circuit
   components on or near the antenna element {[}6]. Circuit components
   manipulating signals in the RF domain can achieve analog ``signal
   processing{''} directly on the antenna, essentially eliminating
   additional computational complexity. However, signal processing in the
   digital domain often affords far more flexibility and applicability. The
   primary limitation of this design is that the spoof-detection technique
   is most effective when spoofed signals are originating from a source
   below the antenna, thus limiting its applicability to predominantly
   aerial implementations. Nonetheless, we feel this solution is well
   suited to the form-factor and payload constraints that aerial
   applications such as commercial aviation and UAVs demand. Additionally,
   we introduce some techniques for extending the applicability of this
   design.
   In our design we simply add an electronic switch inside the radome of
   the antenna that permits high speed switching from the default radiation
   pattern that is predominantly right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) to
   one that is predominantly left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP), in the
   upper hemisphere of the antenna. However, at very low angles of
   elevation and generally below the antenna, the radiation pattern is
   neither predominantly RHCP or LHCP {[}7], so the switching has little
   effect on the radiation pattern at all. We can exploit this expected
   telltale drop in the received SNR or C/N-0 to identify if the signal is
   originating from above the antenna or from below it, and thus, if the
   signal is genuine or spoofed.}},

   paths of digital storytelling in Emilia and Molise schools{''} was born
   from the need to find new ways to educate from an early age to the
   prevention of earthquake risk in the Italian regions that are
   particularly sensitive to this issue. In this sense, we used, as digital
   tool, a moodle platform in a lower age group (7-8 years old). Using
   moodle have been carried out a series of activities: starting from a
   description of the fears and experiences of children, it has gone to the
   creation of materials published in the platform. Were made drawings,
   images, videos, documentation of educational activities related mainly
   to issues of a scientific nature and at least partially reusable for
   further educational pathways. The project was presented and accepted for

Abstract = {{In the context of the continuous development of technology, which
   nowadays has a ubiquitous character, innovative strategies involving ICT
   in education require new frameworks and curriculum development models.
   Even though these new models might be based on a solid theoretical
   background, by considering the advantages of technology and its
   metamorphose from technology - the instrument into technology - the
   method or technology - the medium, different approaches extend the
   classical views on curriculum development through providing a dynamic
   perspective: not only focusing on content and results but on the process
   and on discovery. Part of an action research, combining qualitative and
   quantitative methods as well, the experimental study presented in this
   paper was designed and implemented by considering the above mentioned
   dynamic perspective in the context of student teacher training in
   ``Alexandru loan Cuza{''} University of Iasi (UAIC), Romania. The aim of
   the study was to identify the factors influencing the emergence of
   collaborative learning in virtual environment (given our students' low
   level of knowledge in using ICT) and which of these factors are
   increasing the potential of collaboration in the process of learning how
   to use ICT in education. The results corroborate our hypothesis by
   highlighting that the frequency of collaborative technologies usage
   during learning process influences the perception on the level of team
   work and the occurrence of team cohesion. Also, the technology and the
   social presence of the team members influence positively the team's
   adaptation to the technology features. The conclusions of the present
   experimental study contributed in the final stage of suggesting a
   curriculum development model with eight dimensions. This model might
   support teachers/ professors/ trainers to infuse the training on how to
   use ICT in all subjects they teach. Moreover, it might overcome the
   digital skills gap caused by discontinuous use of ICT in education
   during the last three decades or by digital divide.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
   Development has examined the evolution of the innovating process assumed
   by politicians, but also by public and private institutions from member
   states in order to promote, disseminate and use digital learning
   resources in schools. Consequently, a project of OECD `s Centre for
   Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) through the Innovative
   Learning Environments (ILE) is analyzing the way youth learn and in
   which conditions they could learn better. By identzbling specific cases
   of innovative learning environments worldwide, ILE aims at practical,
   management and reform informing by generating some analyses regarding
   innovative learning configurations for children and youth. The role of
   the project is to analyze the innovative ways of organizing the learning
   process at micro level (learning environment) and the way it is
   connected to the middle level (networks and communities of practice), as
   well as the implementation of change strategies in terms of learning at
   macro level, namely at system level. The studies shown in this work have
   tried to focus on the way in which the analyzed studies within OECD
   institute educational innovation based on Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) and related to digital learning resources, the
   influencing factors on the success of political action which focuses on
   promoting those educational innovations, as well as the response of the
   educational system to these innovations. By comparing the national
   policies, a ranking of the country came forth regarding ICT measures
   taken and initial teacher education: countries with a weak involvement
   in the field, countries with a higher level of awareness regarding the
   matter and countries who have integrated ICT in initial teacher
   education, on several levels. Other studies reveal pedagogical models
   that use digitization as support to teach science, technology,
   engineering and mathematics, others explore expectations of cooperation
   in an artzficially created network to promote educational innovation

Abstract = {{Paper deals with an actual development of the educational applications
   that aims mainly to the connection of educational activities at the
   universities through usage of modern technologies, iPad touchscreen
   tablets in particular. IPad tablets present innovative technological
   element and effective educational tool of direct and indirect education,
   allowing students to use a virtual environment that provides information
   in digital and multimedia form. Furthermore, tablets offer a possibility
   of real interraction through various animations, videos, references and
   other interactive elements, so they directly strengthen active knowledge
   acquisition and development of skills and abilities. Authors of the
   paper present development of a compact selection of specialized
   educational applications focused on the partial syntactic areas - simple
   sentence and hierarchical sentence structure diagram, compound and
   complex sentence, exercise for compound sentence analysis and its
   graphic description, valence syntax and exercise for grammatical
   sentence structure, semantic statement construction and exercise for
   semantic and complex sentence structure. Development activities react to
   the fact that partial syntax areas offer possibilities to its transition
   to the form of specialized educational applications focused on
   theoretical and practical subject matter. Nature of syntax and its core,
   which is based in the mastering of the complicated structure of simple
   and compound sentence and its graphic description, implicates
   possibilities for education that is based on the graphic, interaction
   and communication educational environment. Moreover, paper deals with
   the possibilities of implementation of modern technologies and
   innovative software in a form of applications to the direct education
   within the seminars. Paper also concerns its possible usage within the
   framework of elementary, secondary and special education. Authors' main
   objective is to warn of the new possibilities of virtual study
   environment that presents effective educational tool for exercise of
   complex syntactic simple and compound sentence analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Because, today's students tend to be more digitally savvy, mobile and
   transitory, socially connected, and more democratic in their worldview,
   higher education needs to find innovative and attractive ways to help
   students respond to the needs of opening up and the requirements of
   economic and social development. Higher education has to find a way to
   increase students' interest in academia by providing opportunities for
   deeper, more meaningful, and connected learning, in creating a practice
   ground for skill development within a meaningful context. Virtual
   learning communities, a 2P century requirement on education, can help to
   prepare students for work environments during college and after
   graduation and easily get students involved into community. The purpose
   of this study is to explore the benefits of building virtual learning
   communities among students, focusing on availability and accessibility
   of course material from any location as a benefit of e-learning, on the
   advantage offlexible study, at a time and pace suited to the student,
   and also the importance of virtual interaction with other students or
   teachers. Online revision and practice exercises and the possibility of
   using virtual learning communities in preparing for online exams are two
   other benefits of building virtual learning communities, which are being
   evaluated during our survey. Also, the frequency students access virtual
   learning communities it is also one of the questions included in this
   survey. Overall, during this study it is emphasised the fact that
   virtual learning communities have the potential to create more authentic
   and experiential learning spaces for students.}},

Abstract = {{An important and challenging issue of modern education process is the
   meaningful usage of multimedia and interactive materials. Nevertheless,
   there is a significant lack of electronic educational materials which
   can meet the needs of all involved in education process and to support
   different styles of learning and teaching. The aim of this paper is to
   show educational web platforms and interactive materials that are
   designed to enhance the educational process in Serbian schools.
   Mentioned digital materials are created with special attention to
   curriculum, interactivity and visualization of various abstract
   mathematical concepts in order to make innovative learners by PhD
   students from Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade, Serbia.
   Educational e-platforms help teachers to monitor the students' progress
   after each lesson, analyze data and adapt teaching to students' needs
   and interests; include parents in educational process in order to
   support their children in better planning of learning activities and
   etc. Some of the goals are to help students with their homework
   assignments and to prepare them for national final exams due to
   reinforce and extend their motivation, knowledge and skills that will be
   useful and outside the classroom. Last, but not the lead{*}
   individual achievements and motivation problems of each student. All of
   the created educational materials emphasize interactivity, exploring and
   linking different mathematical concepts mutually as crucial part of
   learning process. The article points out an importance of innovations in
   mathematics education which is suitable for the modern students and
   highlights research results on relevant topic .}},

Abstract = {{Since 2007 a teaching course on the subject of ``reporting In natural
   and intentionally caused catastrophes and disasters has been carried on
   in the Department of Media Studies at the Faculty of Philosophy at the
   University of Novi Sad. The mentioned subject deals with media reporting
   and journalist engagement on the place where catastrophes caused by
   people (terrorism, explosions, car accidents, citizen gatherings, fires)
   or natural calamities (floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes,
   tornadoes, extremely bad weather conditions) happen. The subject
   syllabus for a school year is carried out during one term with two
   classes of lecture and two classes of exercise per week. Students are
   interested in carrying through the syllabus and a number of those
   enrolled in this elective reaches maximum which is about 35 students for
   each course. We carried out a study on a theme of possibility of using a
   media digital technology in performing the syllabus ``Reporting in
   natural and intentionally caused catastrophes and disasters{''} with the
   aim to examine how much students are interested to make a use of new
   digital technologies in the teaching course. An extensive analysis of
   the students answers was made relating to their perception of the use of
   new digital technologies, lecturing on Skype, the importance of online
   debate with the aim of exchanging different views with the students from
   other universities in the region and world. The researchers were
   interested in how much students use digital resources when they write
   their term papers, if they have a good on line communication with their
   professors and assistant professors, if they would like to have an on
   line cooperation with the Military, the Fire Department or some other
   institutions which deal with crisis situations and which digital
   innovation they would implement into the realization of this subject
   syllabus. The fundamental idea in this project is to analyze the
   students attitudes about using of media digital technologies in the
   realization of this syllabus which offers great opportunities for
   implementing the mentioned technologies. We expect that the result of
   this research will be the modification of the plan and the syllabus for
   this subject, which is to implement innovations in the sense of
   application of digital technologies observed as the most significant by
   students. Thus the teaching course will be enriched and innovated with
   new digital technologies and the syllabus will be adapted to students
   requests.}},

   (Lifelong learning of teachers of Romanian, English and French, in the
   knowledge society, POSDRU ID 87/1.3/S 62536), based on a teacher
   training program with ICT support. This project is implemented by Braila
   County School in partnership with the University of Bucharest, SIVECO
   Romania and TEHNE The Center for Development and Innovation in
   Education, sustained in January 2011 December 2013. Out of the 5000
   teachers included in the target group were trained, using a form of
   applied curriculum, exchange experience and on-line collaboration. The
   aim of this paper is to describe an interesting link between the
   training curriculum and e-learning platform. We illustrate the results
   of the two training modules available on the project platform
   (Curriculum design and Differential education), both in interactive and
   text forms. We will present some evaluation results of the final report,
   including the impact of technology in teacher training. In this sense,
   the portal dedicated to teachers of Romanian, English, and French was
   appreciated as an efficient tool for professional communication. In
   synthesis, the project offered teachers new opportunities to develop a
   teaching career, through the certified training program and modern
   digital resources. In order to understand Mastery learning teaching

Abstract = {{The paper is focused on provisions and challenges for the eLearning
   process, analysing the premises for the successful implementation of the
   e-learning programmes, i.e. the adequate infrastructure and the key
   competences required. The digital divide represents a barrier for the
   further development of the eLearning processes and the wide
   accessibility to these innovative tools. Obstacles and difficulties in
   accessing the virtual environment, representing the main causes of the
   digital divide, have been highlighted and analysed in order to find
   solutions for their removal. The study emphases the role of the higher
   education institutions in compensating the students' lack of appropriate
   competences required for participating in e-learning education
   processes, such as: digital skills, self-motivation, self-driven
   learning capacity, good communication skills, including communication in
   foreign languages and cultural awareness. The research has been based on
   the identification and analysis of the state-of-the-art in this area,
   from both perspectives, i.e. IT infrastructure and its accessibility,
   and students' competences. Statistical data analysis has been used
   regarding the actual challenges and the existing IT infrastructure
   available in the Romanian education system. In addition to the desk
   research, a study case has been presented, illustrating the concrete
   students' situation and profile. In this context, a survey has been
   organised for the identification of the existing students' key
   competences and also the needed skills for facilitating the students'
   involvement in the eLearning processes on a continuous basis, as an
   important asset for their social insertion. The universities are key
   players that may be involved in bridging the digital divide and in
   developing the necessary adults' skills for the successfully
   participation in online learning processes. The role of the eLearning in
   the adult continuous education, based on cybergogy and andragogy
   paradigms, has been also emphasised. Besides the main competences and
   skills required as pre-conditions for the efficacy of the online
   learning process, the paper emphasises also the impact of the eLearning
   on the educational processes and knowledge democratisation.}},

Abstract = {{The article focuses on the relationship between information and
   communication technology (ICT) and foreign language skills' training.
   Integrating information and communication technologies in teaching,
   learning and assessment has therefore become a necessity nowadays.
   Recent years have brought a conceptual revolution in education,
   information and communication technologies becoming a medium for
   learning in general, for all subjects in the school curriculum. Adapting
   to the needs of knowledge society calls for teachers to rethink
   educational way of young people, allowing them to explore the new, to
   solve problems through their research activity, to connect with others
   in different cultural and social backgrounds, to express opinions. When
   properly oriented, technology contributes to an active learning
   student-centered, to develop creativity and critical thinking.
   Technology is part of everyday life of the citizen, and information and
   communication technologies can be found in the socialization process.
   Taken together, these activities will provide new opportunities for
   students to personalize access to digital learning resources in school
   and beyond, becoming more important the need to bring side by side these
   learning experiences. The introduction of ICT in school, in classroom,
   in the educational process as a whole, contributes, to a great extent,
   to improve student results. Firstly, this is because ICT adapts the
   learning needs of students and teaching needs of teachers. Secondly, the
   use of ICT in schools creates a new, innovative approach of teaching,
   learning and assessment activities. Learning can be custom tailored to
   the needs of all students, and teaching would no longer be limited to
   fifty minutes in the classroom, but can be practiced anytime and
   anywhere outside the school.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents initial experiences in using online debates as an
   innovative academic learning technique in multicultural and multilingual
   communities. The purpose of the paper is to illustrate the potential of
   creative and critical learning through debates, and to demonstrate the
   use of new technologies in achieving such learner outcomes. Description
   is provided of participant experiences in debates regarding actions and
   values. The debates were conducted in the Karl Popper format by means of
   Skype, with audience questions. The debaters were journalism students of
   the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia, and of
   the University of Bratislava, Slovakia. The following research
   methodologies were employed: a) theoretical analysis; b) descriptive
   method; c) group surveys as scientific discussion; e) modelling method,
   in which a model is offered of Skype-based debates as an innovative
   distance-learning technique in the context of international exchange of
   experiences. Analysis of the group surveys, which were completed by the
   student debaters and audience, revealed that this form of learning is
   exceptionally dynamic, creative and demanding. Teams present
   constructive arguments for and rebuttals against, asking cross-questions
   in order to identfn, and resolve inconsistencies, flawed arguments,
   insufficient data, ambiguities and any other impediments to clear
   communication and learning. The debate programme has enabled the
   Department of Media Studies in Novi Sad to conduct quality debates using
   new digital technologies, and to organise international and bilateral
   debate tournaments in virtual time and space. Debate tournaments as a
   form of intellectual competition require the participants to prepare, to
   analyse cause and effect, to gather data, to recognise topics of social
   significance, to formulate arguments, to predict social consequences if
   a problem remains unresolved, to identify human actions which contribute
   to the problem, and finally to propose solutions to conflict situations.
   The same type of analysis is employed by journalists in their
   investigative work. Therefore it is clear that such debating skills
   serve as useful tools in learning the process and techniques of
   analytical journalism. With the addition of the international aspect,
   the benefits are even greater. This study of the online debating
   experience of students from Serbia and Slovakia is a modest initial
   contribution to a new model of learning which merits further attention
   by researchers.}},

Abstract = {{For real time digital video transmission, an innovative multi-layer
   design of wireless systems is needed, where information among layers is
   exchanged and parameters are jointly optimized for richer interfaces
   among the layers of the protocol stack. The growing prevalence of
   wireless calls for such design of wireless network to support Quality of
   Service (QoS). Accounting for the limited availability of radio
   resources, the above requirement can be met through the development of
   flexible or adaptable radio interfaces of multi-layer architecture.
   Specifically, based on the traffic analysis with QoS requirements
   jointly Application (APP), Media Access Control (MAC), Physical (PHY)
   layers can be designed to optimize the network performance. This
   architecture is developed in view of benefits and necessities of sharing
   information among different layers where parameters are jointly
   optimized. To this respect, this paper gives the proper relevance to
   resource management strategies such as coding efficiency, media access
   control and error control and proposes a block level model of
   multi-layer architecture of wireless network.}},

Abstract = {{Online Social Networks became a relevant part of daily digital
   interactions for more than half a billion users around the world. The
   various personal information sharing practices that social network
   providers promote have led to their success as innovative social
   interaction platforms. At the same time, these practices have risen much
   critique and concerns with respect to privacy and security from
   different stakeholders. In fact, the massive use of online social
   networks has risen the attention of hackers and attackers that want to
   propagate malware and viruses for obtaining sensitive data. In this way,
   every social network user should be able to easily access, control and
   analyse the information he shares on his profile in order to efficiently
   detect any usage deviation. The possibility of detecting different
   sources of shared information in the same account lead us to design a
   system based not on information itself but on the timestamps associated
   to it. The proposed event collector framework can collect all posted
   information and store it in a relational database for further analysis.
   Using a friendly graphical interface, users can access all stored
   information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event,
   thus facilitating the analysis of the user behaviour. Since each event
   is stored with its corresponding timestamp, it is possible to perform an
   efficient analysis of all posted contents, compute statistics over
   collected data, infer/establish the so called ``normal{''} or
   ``typical{''} usage profile and, thus, be able to detect possible
   deviations that may correspond to a compromised user account.}},

   to the central office (CO). A new segment called fronthaul connects the
   base band unit (BBU) with the remote antenna over a digital radio over
   fiber (DRoF) transmission based on the common public radio interface
   (CPRI). In this work we investigate, by means of simulation, the
   performance of DRoF in several contexts: single channel and in
   coexistence scenario. To meet this goal, we first investigate the key
   aspects of DRoF in an isolated transmission and next we proceed with a
   coexistence scenario based on the ITU-T G.989 standard (NG-PON2). The
   results show that the DRoF system is compatible with a NG-PON2 with
   respect to the wavelength plan and bandwidth requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an innovative 3D imaging technique
   implemented using a limited number of low dose projections, which are
   taken with the x-ray source moving in a limited angle of rotation around
   the breast. These low dose projection images should become processed
   using mathematical methods, to reconstruct tomographic images, resulting
   in a 3D representation of the imaged breast. In tomosynthesis imaging,
   out-of-focus slice blur problem arises due to incomplete sampling
   problem. Several approaches have been suggested to deal with this
   problem. The purpose of this work is to implement Algebraic
   Reconstruction Technique (ART) and Multiplicative Algebraic
   Reconstruction Technique (MART) which are kind of that approach. Former
   studies addressed largely 2D tomosynthesis image reconstruction problem.
   In this study, a 3D phantom model was used. All of the algorithms and
   experiments are programmed with C++. The differences between two
   reconstruction algorithms are also investigated by means of comparing
   root mean square error (RMSE) and mean structural similarity (MSSIM).}},

Abstract = {{Citizen-government interaction has been innovatively improved through
   the use of e-Government services. Such e-services provide governmental
   agencies with the opportunity to enhance their reputation and increase
   citizens' engagement with them. However, accomplishing this
   transformation will not be achieved without removing any impediments
   that affect citizens' trust in the provided e-services. This paper aims
   to understand the way social individual differences (age, gender,
   education level, and Internet experience) affect citizens' trust in
   e-Government services in developing countries. A survey, looking at
   people's perception of trust in e-Government, of citizens drawn from
   different geographical areas in Saudi Arabia, was conducted. The
   findings of this research indicate that out of the four factors
   investigated, only education level has a significant impact on citizen's
   trust in e-government services. Therefore, it appears that as
   educational level increases, so does citizen's trust in e-government and
   so they are more likely to engage with these e-government services.}},

Abstract = {{Multimedia has been widely accepted and used in most of the teaching
   courses and it is scientific, advanced and helpful for teaching methods
   promotion. With the further development of computer science and the web,
   it will be one of the most important factors for the reform of teaching.
   However, something difficult during the course may exist. This essay
   will focus on some potential problems about it according to the teaching
   methods of business English.
   In the recent years, multi-media technology immensely has promoted the
   development of most fields, and has been applied in the teaching as
   well. CAI integrating the audio, image and animations differ with the
   traditional teaching methods, so it can further meet the need of
   informatization, digitization and networking. The innovation in the
   teaching contents and methods help achieve the educational objectives
   better. Otherwise, we should use the new technology properly in spite of
   its scientificity and advancement. Based on the features of business
   English teaching, the author takes the teaching practice for example and
   connects the characteristics of multimedia teaching to discuss the
   potential problems and make suggestions in the application of multimedia
   to the teaching.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of innovation-driven development strategy is
   influenced by innovation capability of engineering and technical
   personnel. In environments of big data, with the rapid changes in the
   innovation of technology and management, we put forward a new training
   model to cultivate innovation capability of engineering and technical
   personnel, regard massive information as materials of innovation,
   process information through the innovative methods based on intelligent
   knowledge management, TRIZ and Extenics, exploit computer's advantages
   of collecting and processing information by human-computer interaction,
   make a breakthrough of human's thinking limitation, digitize and
   systematize the training of innovation capability, which improve
   innovation capability more effectively. The training practice among
   engineering college students shows the model has good practicability.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of wireless communication calls for new spectrum
   resources. TV band is considered the most promising band for spectrum
   reallocation and spectrum efficient technologies such as cognitive
   radio. To facilitate spectrum innovation in this band, we conducted both
   fixed and mobile measurements in Beijing, China. Unlike previous
   spectrum surveys which mainly focused on average spectrum occupancy, we
   analyze the usage of TV band from a comprehensive view. Multiple factors
   including frequency, time, space domain and specific TV standards are
   all considered. We find the actual utilization in Beijing is 7\% higher
   than reported in previous study. Moreover, the time and geographical
   utilization peak of TV coincides with current communication systems,
   which results in limited time and space domain spectrum opportunity for
   cognitive radio. We strongly suggest that China accelerate the
   transition from analog television to digital television to leave more
   available spectrum resources for other services.}},

Abstract = {{The talk will present my own research focused on how new Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) have affected politics and society in
   Latin America. Specifically, it will examine if and in how far the
   spread and use of digital technologies affected central aims of
   democratic governance such as strengthening citizen participation in
   political decision making; increasing the transparency of legislative
   processes; improving administrative processes; providing free access to
   government data and information; and expanding independent spaces of
   citizen communication.
   While these aspects have been extensively studied in the United States
   and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
   context, their systematic analysis in the regions of the Global South
   and more concretely in Latin America remains an academic task ahead.
   However, while it was largely assumed that in catching up on the digital
   divide developing nations would simply emulate practices and structures
   of the Global North, the analyses to be presented seeks to demonstrate
   that Latin American citizens and governments have come up with
   innovative digital solutions to the particular political problems
   related to the region's historical legacy.
   Summarizing, this presentation seeks to assess in how far digital
   technologies in Latin America either contributed to or obstructed:
   -government accountability and transparency,
   -civil society's ability to fulfill socio-political watchdog's
   functions, such as scrutinising the efficiency and effectiveness of
   public services and holding politicians accountable
   -citizen participation in political decision making
   -the creation alternative mobilization structures for political
   participation}},

Abstract = {{In this article, I discuss the influence of stage lighting on the
   processes of scenic design and the functioning of performance space.
   There has been a huge advance in lighting technology with regard to
   their accessibility, usability, luminosity and costs during the past
   decades. Light can no longer be thought of as a necessity that can just
   be added to the performance. It has become one of its basic visual
   elements, directing and focusing the spectators gaze. The rhythm of
   changing lighting cues create a visual dramaturgy, which has turned
   visual design from solid constructrions to a score of temporal events.
   Today you seldom see a performance without any use of projections or
   digital videos.
   I begin with a quick historical survey on the adaptation of electric
   light in order to exemplify the artistic significance of technological
   innovations. I move on to a more philosophical conversation about the
   metaphorical connotations of light as a basic component of the visual
   mise-en-scene. Then I return to the practices of contemporary theatre
   making and examine the contributions of the latest projection
   technology.
   I suggest that stage lighting has developed from being a technical tool
   making the scenes visible into a sovereign artistic agency creating
   images on its own terms. Today's intermedial scenography can be seen as
   a parallel to the contemporary experience of our spatio-visual
   environment in everyday life, echoing the changes that happen in our
   ways of perceiving and conceptualizing the world.}},

Abstract = {{The film has entered the digital era, and the extraordinary expressive
   forces formed by the combination of the computer technology with the art
   of the film brought hitherto unknown attraction to the audience. From
   the earliest children's entertainment, to today's Film Festival movies,
   every leap of the films is accompanied by the technical innovation. With
   the application of the 3D technology in the film, those gorgeous screens
   and the grand scenes we appreciate in the modern movies cannot be seen
   in the traditional films. The digital technology was treated as the
   special tool in the movies, but today its influence on the film has been
   far beyond the level of the ``tool{''}.
   French film critic Francois Tatelei once said, ``The most attractive
   thing of the previous films is the plot and the actor's expression, and
   now some new things are added, that is, the dazzling computer stunt
   pictures eyes cannot take in, and the feelings it brings to the audience
   is revolutionary.{''} This shift has brought us the new aesthetic
   enjoyment on one hand, and on the other hand, the traditional films seem
   to be losing its essence as the film, and are becoming dim and dark. Now
   the so-called film digitization is not only the concept of ``computer
   graphics{''} in a narrow sense, which refers to a process. With the
   intervention of the digital technology in the film production, the
   computer plays more and more important role in participating in the
   making of the movie stunt.}},

Abstract = {{Energy-efficient wireless communications are key enablers for the
   development of smart objects. New architectures with very low-power
   profile have to be investigated for targeting advanced implementations.
   In this context, the paper proposes to employ the Compressive Sensing
   theory for the detection of M-ary orthogonal signals, without complete
   recovery. This allows to lower the digital baseband computation load for
   almost equivalent performance. Simulations based on the IEEE 802.15.4
   standard shows that the BER matches the theoretical results with a
   tolerable loss, depending mostly on the compression rate. Then,
   numerical analysis brings out some practical limitations that have to be
   considered when using this technique. Finally, the paper underlines the
   innovative use of compressive sensing for reducing the computation load
   during detection. This flexibility enables the selection of the most
   efficient operating point.}},

Abstract = {{Precise tree diameter estimation for a lightweight and intelligent
   vehicle such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a commercial farm is
   still an unresolved problem. A lot of UAVs and the ground vehicles (UGV)
   are navigated across the farm by relying on the aided of the vision
   sensor as well as laser scanner. All of these methods require an
   extremely massive image computation, bulky package dimension and some of
   the components are pricey. This paper evaluates the morphological
   technique of an innovated infrared scanner technique for cylindrical
   object diameter measurement which is fundamentally comprised of a
   low-cost infrared sensor and digital servo motor. Filter algorithm,
   compensating for the ascertained midpoint of the object was also
   developed and tested. The method is tested on three different poles with
   diameters of 9 cm, 11.4 cm and 16.4 cm. It is found that the filtered
   method, compensating for midpoint data, reduced the error to 82.92\% for
   9 cm, 30.37\% for 11.4 cm and 6.30\% for 16.4 cm, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the usage of a just in time knowledge management
   system. Based on an expert's digital trace, the system is able to
   request their support in providing answers to problems others have
   posted. Siemens' TechnoWeb is used as case study to demonstrate such a
   system. Knowledge is an indispensable asset of corporations, and
   increasing the productivity of the knowledge worker is an important
   management challenge in the 21st century. As such, knowledge management
   systems (KMS) play a crucial role. Siemens has combined a corporate
   social media platform, knowledge networking and formerly isolated bodies
   of knowledge with a semantic algorithm that can identify relevant
   experts. The system allows for innovation to occur and problems to be
   solved by experts, who would previously not have been involved.}},

Abstract = {{Since the financial crisis, established banks have to deal with
   different challenges. The lack of confidence of bank customers in
   established banking business models leads to increasing interest in
   alternative solutions and models in the financial industry. In the area
   of personal and small business loans and investment, peer to peer (p2p)
   lending offers an online-based transparent granting of credits between
   individuals without much need for traditional banking services. These
   p2p lending marketplaces provides private lenders and investors a more
   user-centric and interactive digitization of their lending and investing
   operations. Therefore, the questions arise whether p2p lending
   represents a disruptive threat for established banks and how the
   disruptive potential can be analyzed in this context. Since previous
   approaches did not pay enough attention to the business model aspect
   linked to disruption in services, we propose further improvement
   especially in case of two-sided markets which might display different
   levels of disruptive potential on each market side. We illustrate this
   enhanced theoretical approach by applying it to the case of p2p lending
   marketplaces in Germany. Finally, we provide a modified method and
   research implications together with managerial options for the future of
   the retail banking industry in the German context. Future research
   should analyze this approach in other contexts such as other p2p lending
   markets or similar industries.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid evolution of mobile technologies and the increasing diffusion
   of smartphones have given significant opportunities for innovative
   companies to create new payment solutions and offer value-added services
   to their customers. Near Field Communication (NFC) mobile payment has
   been emerging as a noticeable phenomenon that can enable consumers to
   turn their smartphones into digital wallets. Although there has been a
   lot of coverage on consumer acceptance of mobile payments, there are
   only few researches providing guideline to interpret NFC-based mobile
   payments adoption.
   Taking into consideration of theoretical backgrounds of innovation
   diffusion and specific characteristics of NFC mobile payments, this
   study propose a research framework to provide a profound understanding
   of factors facilitating or impeding the adoption of NFC-based mobile
   payments among Taiwanese consumers. This study expects that intention to
   adopt NFC mobile payments is affected by product-related factors
   (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, perceived
   security and privacy risk, trialability, perceived cost of use and
   additional value of NFC mobile payment), trust-based factors,
   personal-related factors (personal innovativeness in new technologies,
   absorptive capacity), and attractiveness of alternatives.
   This study will be able to advance literature on innovation adoption and
   facilitate technology marketers in NFC mobile payments. It provides a
   useful guideline to help researchers investigate of issues related to
   NFC mobile payments. It also bring some managerial implications by
   assisting relevant parties in NFC mobile payments ecosystem such as
   mobile network operators, card issuers, payment processing institutions,
   bank decision makers and merchants when devising their business
   strategies and marketing campaigns to facilitate NFC mobile payments.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of socio-economic aspects of heritage with innovative
   technologies for its documentation is progressively bringing the
   recording activities closer to heritage management and valorisation.
   This paper investigates the surveying and documentation phases of one of
   the most important monuments in Cyprus - the Monastery of St.
   Herakleidios in Politiko village, on the outskirts of the capital of
   Lefkosia. St. Herakleidios was the first Archbishop of Cyprus and his
   cult was very influential all throughout the island. With its frescos,
   St. Heraklideios church has inspired many byzantine artists that have
   decorated churches of Troodos Mountain, such as UNESCO protected
   Archangel Michael church and the church of Kalopanayotis village. This
   paper discusses the results of the survey conducted on the cave
   considered to be the tomb of St. Herakleidios and its church. New
   tendencies of surveying and modelling that could contribute to a better
   communication of heritage and to a more reflective society are discussed
   in the conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Identity certification in the cyberworld has always been troublesome if
   critical information and financial transaction must be processed.
   Biometric identification is the most effective measure to circumvent the
   identity issues in mobile devices. Due to bulky and pricy optical
   design, conventional optical fingerprint readers have been discarded for
   mobile applications. In this paper, a digital variable-focus liquid lens
   was adopted for capture of a floating finger via fast focusplane
   scanning. Only putting a finger in front of a camera could fulfill the
   fingerprint ID process. This prototyped fingerprint reader scans
   multiple focal planes from 30 mm to 15 mm in 0.2 second. Through
   multiple images at various focuses, one of the images is chosen for
   extraction of fingerprint minutiae used for identity certification. In
   the optical design, a digital liquid lens atop a webcam with a
   fixed-focus lens module is to fast-scan a floating finger at preset
   focus planes. The distance, rolling angle and pitching angle of the
   finger are stored for crucial parameters during the match process of
   fingerprint minutiae. This innovative compact touchless fingerprint
   reader could be packed into a minute size of 9.8{*}9.8{*}5 (mm) after
   the optical design and multiple focus-plane scan function are optimized.}},

   revealed that innovativeness, although it is called the main tool to

   of contemporary cities. Innovativeness is an attribute of smartness just
   in the case, if it is based on intelligence, learning, knowledge,
   agility, and networking and seeks sustainability, while digitality,
   which can be seen as one of the outcomes of innovativeness, plays a role
   of the facilitator of these processes. Otherwise, innovativeness may
   even have harmful effects to the city.}},

Abstract = {{Recently the term ``smart{''} has become an increasingly popular concept
   used in many different situations, in urban development context in
   particular. Often the term ``smart city{''} is used in association with
   other categories, such as ``knowledge city{''}, ``innovative city{''},
   ``intelligent city{''}, ``digital city{''}, ``sustainable city{''} etc.
   The idea of smart specialization of cities and regions is spreading fast
   and has successfully become a platform for economic and social
   development of local communities. However, there is still a lack of
   clear scientific interpretation and conceptualization of this
   phenomenon. Therefore the aim of the paper is to identify the most
   popular general characteristics used to define the concept of smart
   city. Authors of the paper explain the theoretical basis of the concept
   ``smartness{''} emphasizing its specifics in social sciences, compare
   different ``smart city{''} definitions highlighting main similarities
   and differences of their content and identify the most common elements
   of the ``smart city{''} concept. The results of the paper suggest key
   characteristics for a city aiming to become a ``smart city{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Digital media technology is part of `new media' as a phenomenon, and is
   in the forefront of social and individual use, research and market
   positioning. This article does not aim to define new and old, modern and
   traditional media, but aims to analyse users' acceptance patterns
   regarding new technologies appearing subsequently, one after the other.
   The research presented int he article examines digital video recorder
   technology in relation of live television viewing, and tries to identify
   the influencing factors of its acceptance. From a theoretical point of
   view, the study proved the relevance of integrating media technology
   acceptance model and gratification theory. Also, from a practical point
   of view, it provides a detailed case study of the acceptance of digital
   video recorder technology.}},

Abstract = {{More and more digital supports are being developed to assist creativity.
   Some of them are designed to uniquely support specific creative methods,
   while others target the overall support of the creativity and innovation
   process. Whatever they might offer, only a few use a systems engineering
   approach. Generally, they do not formalize the environment or
   interactions within it. The present study proposes a new formalism for
   modelling the creativity process through the design of a Creative
   Support System (CSS). This formalism attempts to model an Innovation
   Challenge and is inspired by actual system engineering modelling
   formalisms and the literature on creativity. The first section will
   discuss CSS support of the ``48h to Generate Ideas (R){''} creativity
   challenge. Following this, the new representation formalism will be
   discussed. The conclusion will focus on the application of this
   formalism and establishment of the basis for future research.}},

Abstract = {{One of the prerequisites of economic growth in the Republic of Croatia
   is the development of an e-government based on openness, transparency,
   efficiency and effectiveness. New trends in ICT technology create new
   economic opportunities which on one hand support the economic sector by
   generating added value and on the other, contribute to the
   rationalization of public administration activities. The use of
   innovative solutions leads to a decrease in the need for traditional
   advertising channels which are more expensive and less effective.
   This paper presents a way of using new ICT technologies in such a manner
   that the existing Public Sector Information is republished at public
   places by Cloud Computing Solutions making the information more
   accessible to a wider range of citizens. The paper presents and
   describes an example of good practice i.e. it presents the advantages of
   cloud solutions achieved through the Speeding Every European Digital
   (SEED) EU project in which the City of Rijeka took part as one of the
   partners. The paper focuses on the advantages of using Cloud Computing
   for interactive Public Sector Advertising of services provided by public
   authorities. Its affordability contributes to long-term sustainability
   of the system, establishment new e-Service for informing the public
   about services provided by public authorities, educational and
   scientific institutions thus having a stronger end user impact and
   raising public awareness of the existence of e-Government and content
   and open data services. This all contributes to an increase in the level
   of transparency, openness and mutual benefit, thus providing the
   information that will give its users the possibility for creating new
   economic opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{Skill development in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)
   education present one of the most formidable challenges of modern
   society. The Community FabLab platform presents a viable solution. Each
   FabLab contains a suite of modern computer numerical control (CNC)
   equipment, electronics and computing hardware and design, programming,
   computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided machining (CAM) software.
   FabLabs are community and educational resources and open to the public.
   Development of STEM based workforce skills such as digital fabrication
   and advanced manufacturing can be enhanced using this platform.
   Particularly notable is the potential of the FabLab platform in STEM
   education. The active learning environment engages and supports a
   diversity of learners, while the iterative learning that is supported by
   the FabLab rapid prototyping platform facilitates depth of
   understanding, creativity, innovation and mastery. The product and
   project based learning that occurs in FabLabs develops in the student a
   personal sense of accomplishment, self-awareness, command of the
   material and technology. This helps build the interest and confidence
   necessary to excel in STEM and throughout life. Finally the introduction
   and use of relevant technologies at every stage of the education process
   ensures technical familiarity and a broad knowledge base needed for work
   in STEM based fields.
   Biomedical engineering education strives to cultivate broad technical
   adeptness, creativity, interdisciplinary thought, and an ability to form
   deep conceptual understanding of complex systems. The FabLab platform is
   well designed to enhance biomedical engineering education.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular morphology is widely applied in digital pathology and is
   essential for improving our understanding of the basic physiological
   processes of organisms. One of the main issues of application is to
   develop efficient methods for cell deformation measurement. We propose
   an innovative indirect approach to analyze dynamic cell morphology in
   image sequences. The proposed approach considers both the cellular shape
   change and cytoplasm variation, and takes each frame in the image
   sequence into account. The cell deformation is measured by the minimum
   energy function of object alignment, which is invariant to object pose.
   Then an indirect analysis strategy is employed to overcome the
   limitation of gradual deformation by run length statistic. We
   demonstrate the power of the proposed approach with one application:
   multi-classification of cell deformation. Experimental results show that
   the proposed method is sensitive to the morphology variation and
   performs better than standard shape representation methods.}},

Abstract = {{This research, based on Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), investigates why
   networks, a shared language and storytelling help organisational
   advantage in microfoundations in international environments, especially
   in Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM). The first part of this
   paper is dedicated to an in-depth literature review. In the second part,
   the research method is explained: survey questionnaires were developed
   based on Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), translated from English to French
   and German and distributed. The questionnaire consisted of 28 closed
   questions on a five-point Likert scale and two open questions regarding
   networks in person or digital networks, producing many direct quotes
   from the respondents. A total of 253 questionnaires were collected, out
   of which 246 were usable. One interview was conducted for the purpose of
   this research, with the objective to validate the results from the
   questionnaires, but it was not included into this paper. Further
   research could focus on qualitative research methods, as well as the
   influence of new media and age. In the third part, the findings of this
   research are presented: Networks provide access to information, are
   easily accessible, flexible and efficient, diverse, they are fast,
   cheap, ``Who you know{''} determines ``What you know{''}, there are
   obligations, norms, and expectations within a network, and there are
   issues with trust and confidentiality in networks. Some HR managers have
   a preference for networks in person compared to digital networks; their
   respective arguments are presented. A shared language is used as
   identifier as it defines the in-group and distinguishes from the
   out-group, is important in social relations, enables people to discuss
   and exchange information, to ask questions, to conduct business, creates
   group-specific communication codes, enables the combining of
   information, the development of new concepts and the creation of new
   knowledge, and influences our perception. If people do not speak the
   language, they are kept apart and have restricted or no access to
   information. Storytelling is used to show and transmit values, norms,
   and culture, to share knowledge and understanding, it is useful in
   education and training, it helps to communicate quickly, naturally,
   clearly; with storytelling one can focus on a vision and plan the
   future, solve problems and conflicts, inspire continuous innovation,
   manage change, and make decisions. It is proposed that networking, in
   person and in digital form, a shared language as identifier and
   storytelling are capabilities for shaping the future and success of
   microfoundations in international environments. Conclusion and
   discussion, limitations, further research, and references follow.}},

Abstract = {{In a small to medium sized organisations, managements' understanding of
   the complexity of the Information Technology (IT), software
   applications' usability and lead time needed to build a new application
   is limited. Often these organisations do not have comprehensive
   understanding of the new market due to inadequate market research. To
   design and develop a new software application, software engineers elicit
   requirements, ideally from end users, but the end users and stakeholders
   are often unavailable. User-Centred Design (UCD) is a methodology used
   to develop applications that consider the goals of the users as a
   primary requirement. Personas, archetypical users, and scenarios, the
   interaction of personas with the application to achieve goals, are tools
   used within UCD methodology. Software engineers can deduce the
   application requirements from personas and scenarios. Hence the closer
   the persona represents the end user, the more usable the resultant
   software application will become. Holistic Persona, a persona with five
   dimensions: factual, personality, intelligence, knowledge and cognitive
   process, seeks to more closely resemble the end user.
   Reflection-inaction, reflection on the spontaneous thinking that is
   happening during a task, Reflection-on-action, reflection after the task
   is over, Reflection-for-action, reflection done to gain knowledge for a
   similar future task, enhances the skills of software engineers while
   designing a new software application. Reflective capacity is regarded by
   many as an essential characteristic for professional competence. In this
   paper we explore the research question: how can software engineers apply
   UCD methodologies and reflective concepts in designing and developing
   new software applications? Through two case studies, we provide insights
   into the applications of UCD methodologies and reflective concepts in
   software engineering for development of a new application. We present
   our experiences during design and development of the applications and
   lessons learnt from the projects. We speculate how Holistic Personas and
   scenarios would have resulted in speedier development and improvements
   in the quality of the end products. Case one is about engineering an
   idea into an e-health software application at a research-intensive
   Australian university. Case two is about engineering a system and an
   application to provide automated program guide, news, sport highlights,
   short feature films and weather published on an Australian national
   broadcasting services' website for the multi-channel digital television
   system. Both applications were green-field developments with no past
   histories of a similar application to model for their design and
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The scarcity of resources with the changing fiscal environment of more
   nations have increased the need for innovative solutions in most fields.
   Numerous bodies have as a result called for higher integration of ICT in
   organizational processes. Its adaption has in several cases democratized
   innovation processes. From this, open and/or social innovation has
   emerged. One type of open innovation is the ideation contest known as
   hackathon. The aim of the paper is to identify factors leading to the
   success of hackathon contests. This has been done by examining six such
   contests held between the years 2012 and 2014. Structured interviews
   have been held with the owner/project manager of each contest. In
   addition, the authors attended five of the contests. This allowed for
   both making observations of the events from start till end, and also to
   hold very informal interviews with participants and event personnel. A
   total of six factors, reflecting the expectations held by both the
   hackathon organizers and its participants, were identified. Thereafter
   an analysis was conducted to see how the contests responded to the
   identified factors. Of the six examined contests, three are believed to
   have been successful, two unsuccessful and one is believed to have
   reached a moderate level of success. The results obtained showed that
   the identified factors are correlated to the success of such contests.
   However, the level of influence of each factor on the success of the
   contests differed in each case. As such, while each factor is of
   importance, they are all dependent on each another. As a conclusion, the
   paper stresses the need for organizers of such events to take into
   consideration each of the mentioned six factors when planning a
   hackathon. Furthermore, this paper can be of interest to both
   researchers and practitioners seeking to better understand democratized
   methods for change efforts, such as with open innovation, social
   innovation and/or hackathons.}},

Abstract = {{The Parliamentary Archives is responsible for preserving and providing
   access to the historical records of the UK Parliament, a collection of
   national, and indeed international, importance which encompasses a wide
   range of formats, created and used in an ever changing environment.
   Since 2010 a staged project has led to the successful implementation of
   an operational digital repository. The digital repository adopts
   third-party cloud services as a primary means of storage. The project
   has demonstrated the viability of using cloud storage providers for
   digital preservation despite common concerns over their adoption. Using
   the Parliamentary Archives as a case study this paper will explore in
   depth the challenges and opportunities resulting from the use of the
   cloud. Using cloud providers has enabled the provision of a rigorous
   preservation storage capability which is flexible, scalable, and
   provides a low barrier to entry. The ingest of content into the cloud
   and the portability or provisioning of data remains a concern, and this
   paper will explore whether this undermines the use of the cloud. There
   can be an inherent tension between the flexibility and rapid change
   which the cloud enables and archival requirements to preserve and
   sustain content for the long-term. This paper will demonstrate how the
   Parliamentary Archives has mitigated these risks and why data
   portability remains a pressing concern. There are significant technical
   and organisational challenges involved in maintaining digital materials
   over time. The cost effectiveness of the cloud over the long-term
   remains a concern. Cost effectiveness threatens the staged process
   needed to address current technical and organisational issues which
   endanger the long term stewardship of parliament's digital content. This
   experience has highlighted a particularly important consideration in
   terms of being prepared for managing transition when thinking about
   cloud services in an archival context. The successful implementation of
   an advanced digital repository in conjunction with the use of cloud
   storage services provides an innovative practical application of using
   the cloud to enable a best practice digital preservation environment.
   Parliament's experience of addressing authenticity requirements,
   including issues of reliability, usability, and especially integrity in
   the cloud will be explored. Cloud providers increasingly recognise the
   opportunity to tailor their offerings in order to meet the particular
   needs of specific sectors or industries, and must be encouraged to do so
   for cultural heritage institutions. This case study can contribute
   significantly to the debate on adoption of cloud services for the
   management and preservation of digital records. This paper aims to help
   in shaping the debate around the emerging archival marketplace by
   outlining current and future issues associated with cloud services. By
   highlighting issues associated with data portability and cost
   effectiveness of cloud services this paper aims encourage debate between
   archives and cloud service providers. Despite concerns over the use of
   cloud services for digital preservation, the Parliamentary Archives
   experience shows that with the right application robust preservation
   environments can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Information and communication technologies represent one of the main
   innovation factors within the teaching and learning process, especially
   in Higher Education. In this context, the search for building useful and
   grounded knowledge using strategies which meet students' needs and
   interests requires the use of innovative resources, among which we
   highlight digital educational resources, particularly open educational
   resources (OER). The open educational resources issue has deserved the
   attention of teachers, students and institutions. Considering the
   present situation as well as the importance given to OER and to the role
   these may play in supporting learning, the aims of this paper are as
   follows: assess the digital educational resources features most valued
   by higher education students; verify the extent to which students' IT
   knowledge influences their assessment of digital educational resources;
   identify the knowledge that higher education students have of OER;
   assess the knowledge that higher education students have of open
   educational resources platforms. In order to achieve the proposed aims,
   we focus our attention on open educational resources, starting by
   assessing digital educational resources' features as well as the
   connection between students' IT knowledge and that same assessment. We
   also assess the knowledge that higher education students have of OER as
   well as of their corresponding platforms. The data was obtained through
   a questionnaire conducted within a sample of 315 students at a
   Portuguese higher education institution. Among the results obtained, we
   highlight that the most valued features of digital educational resources
   are: free access; any time access; allows reuse; and free and open. The
   results show that there is a positive, low, or very low correlation
   between students' IT knowledge and the features associated with digital
   educational resources. In addition to this, the results show an almost
   inexistent knowledge of the OER concept and of their uses as well as of
   the existing OER platforms. The data indicates that there is still a
   long way to go so that OER may be part of the resources used by students
   to improve their learning.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing interest in online teaching, learning and assessment is
   based on the notion that current and future generations of students in
   higher education are and will be increasingly attuned to digital forms
   of communication and assessment (Prensky, 2001; Buckingham \& Willett
   2013). Hard pure disciplines tend to make more use of objective online
   assessment techniques (such as online quizzes and tests) than soft pure
   or qualitative disciplines (Smith et al, 2008). Furthermore, online exam
   assessments tend to be `output' oriented; they act as final tests aimed
   at replacing traditional end of course handwritten assessments. In other
   words, summative exam assessments provide no opportunity for individual
   and generic feedback. In this context, the key question is: can
   pedagogies of face-to-face teaching and learning be enhanced by
   innovative (formative) forms of online exam type assessments? This case
   study reports on a three-year pilot online formative exam type
   assessment (2011-12 to 2013-14). The pilot ran in conjunction with a ten
   week face-to-face course (SA4H7) entitled `Urbanisation and Social
   Policy in the Global South' offered by Dr Sunil Kumar in the Department
   of Social Policy and was supported by the Centre for Learning
   Technology, London School of Economics and Political Science. The case
   study critically reflects on how the incorporation of a formative online
   essay based exam assessment has enhanced the pedagogy of face-to-face
   learning offered by the course. The case study, in four sections, begins
   with a discussion of the pedagogies of teaching and learning and the
   role that online formative exam type assessments play in its
   enhancement. Second, it critically discusses the opportunities and
   challenges of designing and running online assessments. Ranging from the
   choice of platform to the anonymous extraction of student responses, a
   number of practical, technical and logistical issues had to be assessed
   and dealt with. These are discussed all along with the solutions
   provided before and after the assessment process. Third, it reports user
   perspectives by drawing on focus group discussions held in each of the
   three years. Despite being a small scale pilot, a wealth of information
   emerged. These ranged from practical issues such as technical
   requirements (e.g. spellcheck, keyboard noise management etc.) and
   accountability in using students own devices (BYOD), to more substantial
   online assessment information (e.g. changes in cognitive
   processes/approaches in answering questions when typed in compared to
   handwritten exams and stress/nerves leading up to online exam). Fourth
   and finally, the case study reflects on the key opportunities and
   challenges in integrating the pedagogies of face-to-face teaching and
   learning with online exam types of assessment that incorporate both
   individual and generic feedback. The discussion will cover the
   limitations of the pilot as well as key issues in scaling up online
   assessments at the LSE. Some of the lessons learned may be of value to
   others in higher education with an interest in similar assessment
   formats.}},

Abstract = {{E-learning has the potential to transform the educational experience by
   going beyond traditional ways of learning such as reading textbooks or
   listening to in-class lectures. Digital content forms the foundation of
   e-learning and internet connectivity makes the delivery of digital
   content fast, reliable and convenient. However, thus far most e-learning
   content has been simply traditional content converted to digital form
   (paper textbooks become e-books and in-class lectures become online
   video lectures). But digital content can offer new functionality that
   transcends the limitations of traditional content. One important example
   where this is true is digital 3D models. Digital 3D models allow
   learners to interactively navigate and visually examine the spatial
   structure, composition and arrangement of objects. This type of
   interactivity supports spatial thinking, which is strongly linked to
   academic success in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and
   mathematics) disciplines. The STEM subjects are important drivers of
   innovation and economic growth in knowledge-based societies, but
   currently the number of young people pursuing and obtaining high
   qualifications in STEM is insufficient to meet the future needs of many
   developed countries. In this paper we explored how digital 3D content
   can enhance and improve STEM learning. To investigate this topic we
   created a digital 3D model of the human respiratory system, distributed
   it via a web-based platform to three experienced biology teachers and
   then conducted in-person interviews with the teachers. Based on the
   teacher responses we were able to synthesize four instructional design
   principles (dynamic, spatial, informative and authentic) that
   characterize what effective 3D content should look like. The opinions
   and attitudes of teachers towards using digital 3D models for teaching a
   domain-specific STEM subject, and their views on the learning
   experiences afforded by 3D content are important for designing and using
   new e-learning content so it impacts student learning in an effective
   and meaningful way.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of internet technologies by consumers and organisations has
   created more and new data. Thus the shift in behaviour and the resulting
   data necessitate new approaches to researching organisations and
   consumers. Recent practitioner-led papers have indicated there exists a
   continued reliance on traditional research methods which may not reflect
   the internet-enabled space now inhabited, yet commercial market research
   has begun incorporating new media as both a site and a tool for data
   collection. Academic researchers have lagged behind in embracing new
   thinking and approaches to incorporating new media within research in
   marketing. In order to further encourage take up of utilising new media
   within research this paper aims to provide evidence of the use of new
   media through drawing together illustrations of both quantitative and
   qualitative research, where new media has been applied in order to
   demonstrate the potential for taking such approaches. This discussion
   paper outlines a current gap in academic practice in research in
   marketing and demonstrates that there is much to be gained from using
   new media as both a tool for and site of research. Originality stems
   through the identification of the key beneficiaries (the research
   community, teaching community, research institutions, marketing
   practitioners, consumers and citizens and society) of broadening the
   prevalent approaches to research. Specific benefits include; the
   potential for improved response rates for the research community and
   greater engagement with research by consumers, the development of more
   adapt researchers through teaching innovative approaches to research
   methods, the possibility of more successful research funding
   applications by institutions, further value adding to marketing
   practitioners which involve themselves in new media research methods,
   improved efficacy of research for consumers and greater inclusivity of
   research for citizens. Scepticism of the new approaches to research
   methods is acknowledged and tensions within the research ethics domain
   are recognised within this nascent subject area. The contribution of the
   paper resides in the positioning of a strong case for extending the use
   of new media as a tool and a site for research in marketing. Using new
   media in research may provide new insight and relevancy for researchers
   and is worthy of further consideration.}},

Abstract = {{The changes in society such as the shift of business from onsite to
   online where the customer is not present in person have made identity
   crimes easier and more attractive in terms of financial rewards. The use
   of digital equipment and the Internet has facilitated not only business
   and consumers but also malicious users by exposing valuable digital
   assets to potential criminals. Any business that has online presence
   collects and stores personal information from its customers, employees
   and partners, which travel over the Internet for fulfilment of online
   transactions. As a result an identity theft happens every three seconds,
   which causes identity fraud and crimes. Retail is considered the most
   compromised industry with 45\% recorded incidents (Trustwave Global
   Security Report 2013). Therefore, to reduce its impact on business, past
   research focused on technical solutions as if the problem arose from the
   technology. However, technical solutions alone are not sufficient as the
   problem of data breach is continuing to increase. Some authors have
   suggested sharing of information security prevention related knowledge
   between the organisations (Stahl, Parkin and van Moorsel 2011; de
   Crespigny 2012; Feledi, Fenz and Lechner 2013). However, there is hardly
   any study which focuses on this issue. This study is an attempt to
   bridge this gap. The literature indicated that that there is a lack of
   empirical evidence in the inter-organisational knowledge sharing for
   identity theft prevention. The aim of this paper is to systematically
   review existing literature to understand the problem in the context of
   identity theft and report any promising solution and/or suggestions.
   This study also provides a direction for future studies in the security
   disciplines and opens a discussion for inter-organisational knowledge
   sharing in the context of identity theft prevention through sharing best
   practices and lessons learned.}},

Abstract = {{Our research investigates the question: how can the power of tacit
   knowledge be activated for learning mathematics more easily? To this
   end, an innovative approach using storytelling as a knowledge management
   method to capture and share knowledge has been conceived and applied to
   high complexity subjects, such as mathematics. The approach's core
   characteristic lies in the idea of making use of collaborative story
   writing in online classrooms to enable learners to access highly
   abstract knowledge in a lively and memorable way. The didactic concept
   introduced in this paper has been developed within a pilot project which
   is run as part of an online course for mathematics at the Swiss Distance
   University of Applied Sciences. Its key findings will be introduced and
   discussed below as a current response to our research question. To this
   end, in the first part we describe the concept in its educational and
   theoretical context (chapter 1). In the second part, we illustrate its
   setting, components and practical application (chapter 2) before making
   reference to the next project milestones in the outlook (chapter 3).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we synthesize and discuss our findings on gender from two
   large-scale studies centered on the use of immersive virtual
   environments (IVEs) designed with game characteristics, River City and
   SAVE Science, across the past 12 years. The River City IVE was designed
   to engage small teams of students, 11-14 years old, in a collaborative
   scientific inquiry-based learning experience. River City students
   conducted their scientific investigations in a virtual historical
   town-populated by themselves, digitized historical artifacts, and
   computer agents-in order to detect and decipher a pattern of illness
   that was sweeping through the virtual community. Situated Assessment
   using Virtual Environments of Scientific Content and Inquiry (SAVE
   Science) is a study of an innovative system for evaluation of learning
   in science. SAVE Science consists of a series of virtual
   environment-based assessment adventures used for assessing both science
   content and inquiry in middle grades. We will discuss the implication of
   our findings on gender differences for design and for use of virtual
   worlds as platforms of learning and assessment in schools. In essence,
   what we have found is that while girls and boys interact differently
   with these learning and assessment environments, they both find equal
   opportunities for success. Our findings indicate that the use of games
   for learning or assessment does not introduce a gender bias in education
   as long as attention to design for both is carefully considered.}},

Abstract = {{The recent trend in digital games is tightly linked to the natural user
   interaction technologies that make use of the affordances of sensors
   like the Microsoft Kinect camera. The Kinect camera detects user's body
   movements and gestures, which means that the full body becomes the
   controller. Lately, there is a tremendous interest in developing Kinect
   educational games. In this paper, we present the innovative Kinems
   learning games which have been developed for helping children with
   learning disabilities such as autism, dyspraxia and ADHD improve their
   skills. The paper contains the outcomes of a recent study, which was to
   investigate and measure the Kinems learning effectiveness. The research
   hypotheses were examined through an educational intervention that lasted
   about one month and was implemented with 11 children with ADHD of 4-8
   years old. The study was conducted at the premises of the ADHD unit of
   the children's university hospital in Athens, Greece. The statistical
   analysis of pre \& post tests showed children' statistical significance
   improvement of their ``Non-verbal intelligence{''}. Furthermore, the
   results of an in-depth examination of learning and kinetic analysis of
   children's interaction that showed improvement of their executive
   functions and cognitive skills. Finally, based on the qualitative
   comments made by the behavior analysts and researchers, interest and the
   level children's motivation was high.}},

Abstract = {{Although student engagement has potential to enhance learning and
   student retention, the use of digital games to achieve this learning
   outcome remains a challenge in higher education. while the role of
   gamification is highly predicated in horizon reports to enter mainstream
   education, the popularity of game-based learning has remained marginal.
   in this paper we report on the use of game-based learning at a higher
   education institution where students are pre-disposed to play games
   outside formal educational settings. this is further compounded by the
   challenging nature of designing learning activities that fully exploits
   students' capacity to engage. this paper reports on a case study using
   game based learning as a tool to mediate engagement for students
   enrolled in health science education at a resource poor higher education
   institution in south africa. the aim of this study was to examine the
   role of a digital game to enhance student engagement within the
   classroom. by means of mixed methods, this study utilised a design-based
   enquiry using a case study of sport science curricula. design-based
   research was used as part of the design and implementation of an
   interactive learning environment using a technology (gaming) innovation
   within an education setting. sixty-four students from a sport science
   department volunteered to participate in this study. quantitative and
   qualitative data was collected. results indicate that even though 89\%
   if participants indicated that they have played digital games, only 46
   \% indicated that they have engaged with a digital game for the purpose
   of learning. baseline data prior to intervention suggested that students
   did not learn well in groups (70.3\%, m=1.91; sd=0.938). however, in
   post-intervention focus group interviews students expressed that the
   introduction of a digital game for learning in the classroom aided
   co-construction of knowledge in a fun and meaningful way. this study
   concludes that the use of digital games is a valuable mediating tool in
   sport science education as it strengthens collaborative learning and
   improves engagement. this paper recommends a strategy to improve
   engagement and ultimately student retention. this study offers new
   insight into understanding student engagement within a game based
   learning environment.}},

   methodology that we present consists of incorporating practical
   activities during the traditional lectures. One of the innovative
   aspects of this teaching methodology is that students apply the concepts
   and methods studied in class to real devices. For this, students use
   their own digital cameras, webcams, or cell-phone cameras in class.
   These activities provide students a better understanding of the

Abstract = {{Tandem-L is a proposal for an innovative interferometric radar mission
   to monitor the Earth system and its intricate dynamics. Important
   mission objectives are global inventories of forest height and
   above-ground biomass, largescale measurements of Earth surface
   deformations due to plate tectonics, erosion and anthropogenic
   activities, observations of glacier movements and 3-D structure changes
   in land and sea ice, and the monitoring of ocean surface currents. A
   detailed description of the mission goals can be found in {[}1]. The
   mission concept is based on co-flying two fully-polarimetric L-band SAR
   satellites in a close formation. Tandem-L employs new techniques and
   advanced technologies to achieve its ambitious mission goals. The
   feasibility of a joint DLR/JAXA mission is currently being investigated
   in the scope of a pre-phase A study.
   This paper provides an overview of the Tandem-L instrument design
   concept and its performance predictions. Innovative aspects like the
   employment of advanced digital beamforming techniques and operation in a
   variety of imaging modes are detailed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a CMOS monolithic digitized light detector for light
   monitoring applications is newly proposed. The proposed chip is
   attractive due to the fact that analog processing circuits and light
   sensor are integrated robustly and compactly. The output signal of the
   proposed chip is a pulse stream, it could be easily sent over a wide
   range of transmission media, such as PSN, radio, optical, IR,
   ultrasonic, and etc. Another innovation is that the light noise at low
   frequency band can be easily removed into high frequency band by
   following the characteristics of the proposed chip. All the functions
   and performance of the proposed monolithic digitized light detector for
   light monitoring applications are successfully tested and proven through
   measurements. The chip area is 1.998 x 1.616 mm(2). The proposed chip is
   suitable for light monitoring applications, such as car-backing
   monitoring applications.}},

Abstract = {{FPGA implementation of computation intensive signal processing
   algorithms for satellite onboard applications require careful
   considerations of FPGA resource utilization and power consumption. In
   this paper, we describe several strategies used for efficient
   implementation of the synthesis filter banks and digital spectrum
   processing modules on FPGA. Xilinx Virtex-5 series FPGA was chosen for
   implementation of design verification model. Even though FPGAs of this
   series have sufficiently large logic resources for most common
   applications, implementation of fairly large filter banks and spectrum
   processing requires innovative design of FPGA code, described in this
   paper to achieve required performance in speed \& power consumption. The
   paper also reveals important concept of digital implementation of post
   synthesis spectrum processing to avoid intermediate frequency subsystems
   \& combining it with synthesis filter bank implementation in the same
   FPGA.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soils is a serious
   environmental problem. The Campania region in southern Italy has higher
   levels of cancer risk, presumably due to the accumulation of geogenic
   and anthropogenic soil pollutants, some of which have been incorporated
   into organic matter. The aim of this study was to introduce and test an
   innovative, field-applicable methodology to detect heavy metal
   accumulation using drone-based photogrammetry and microrill network
   modelling, specifically to generate wetlands wetlands prediction indices
   normally applied at large catchment scales, such as a large geographic
   basin. The processing of aerial photos taken using a hexacopter equipped
   with fifth-generation software for photogrammetry allowed the generation
   of a digital elevation model (DEM) with a resolution as high as 30 mm.
   Not only this provided a high potential for the study of micro-rill
   processes, but it was also useful for testing and comparing the
   capability of the topographic index (TI) and the clima-topographic index
   (CTI) to predict heavy metal sedimentation points at scales from 0.1 to
   10 ha. Our results indicate that the TI and CTI indices can be used to
   predict points of heavy metal accumulation for small field catchments.}},

Abstract = {{Musical activity has grown significantly since the advent of the
   Internet, especially since the development of web 2.0 services.
   Undoubtedly, digital natives are the most active users of these new
   media. They experiment and innovate continually with new ways of
   producing and collectively enjoying Music on the Web.
   This paper evaluates the possibilities of educational integration of web
   2.0 services for the creation and consumption of music in Music
   classrooms of Secondary Education, analyzing what services and tools
   offer better possibilities to facilitate innovative strategies for
   musical learning. To do this: a) An extensive literature review of
   documentary sources related to the didactic potentialities of
   collaborative musical creation on the web was carried out; b) A corpus
   of services of musical creation and consumption on web 2.0 was
   developed; and c) A sample of these was analyzed to determine their
   specific characteristics and educational applications.
   The results show the opportunity of these services to improve the
   engagement and music readiness of students, stimulating musical creative
   processes, the development of the specific skills of composition and
   analysis and to improve critical and reflective thinking about the
   musical creative process and also about the musical product.}},

Abstract = {{There are three key aspects that define the current times, and of
   course, the world of education: learning, digital and open. Those
   general ideas give support to the Educational Innovation and lead us to
   propose the basic matrix of our model, which organizes the different
   elements of what we think an open education model must consider. The
   main objective of Open Education is autonomous learning and, to achieve
   it, it is crucial to provide the learners with contents and tools that
   allow them to conduct their carrier. In the first times of technological
   tools for education the tendency was to develop monolithic platforms.
   From our point of view, the key is not uniformity and closed access but
   integration and open access for heterogeneous information and tools: a
   technological ecosystem for open education. Following the current trends
   and the needs of the users, we propose an open, adaptable system, ready
   to deal with the different user needs (teachers and students) and to the
   available tools. We propose a technological ecosystem where a community
   of open educational methods, policies, regulations, applications, and
   people teams can coexist so that their processes are interrelated and
   their implementation is based on the physical factors of the
   technological environment. As an example of application of the proposed
   model, we analyze the case of the University of Alicante in the period
   2005-2012 and we show some indicators that prove the success of this
   proposal. Finally, some conclusions and proposals for the future are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Information and communication technologies are surfacing in every facet
   of contemporary human life. Development of gaming technologies is
   closely knitted with human practices and social innovations. Human
   society has been playing games to socialize and to gain satisfaction
   leading to a change in the interaction. Gamification has been used
   successfully to increase user engagement. The concept of fun in
   gamification is a major belief that is closely linked to human nature.
   However, there is an absence of understanding regarding the relationship
   between engagement in fun beliefs and human behavior. Therefore, the
   current study aims to fill in the conceptual gap by reporting the
   systematic review of recent literature addressing the different
   perspective on the experiences and impacts of playing games. It also
   examines the human behavior from cultural and social standpoint with
   regards to the beliefs. This review may challenge ethics, meaning and
   role of human values in our welfare. The understanding of the topic
   concepts is identified along with the essential outcomes analyzed using
   meta-analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative biomechanical energy harvesting system
   based on the regenerative braking concept applied to the human natural
   motion. To determine optimal braking profile previous studies used an
   off-line procedure based on constant external load to determine the
   optimal braking profile. The new concept of this study continuously
   optimizes the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted during
   human motion while minimizing the subject's effort (metabolic rate).
   This is achieved by an energy harvesting system equipped with a
   programmable braking profile and a unique power extraction algorithm,
   which adaptively changes the braking profile to obtain the optimal ratio
   of energy to effort. These are facilitated by a BLDC generator that is
   connected to boost converter. A digital current programmed control of
   the boost converter enables an adaptive torque variation according to
   bio (measure of effort) and electrical feedbacks. This study focuses on
   the human knee joint as the energy source since the most of this joint
   work during level walking is negative (muscles are acting as brakes).
   Since this work is preliminary and more oriented to the novel concept of
   adaptive profile and optimal power extraction, the operation of the
   energy harvester is demonstrated on a full-scale laboratory prototype
   based on a walking emulator. The results exhibit ultimate power
   extraction capabilities as well as adaptation to the walking pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic feature of Weapon equipments is one of important performance
   index for evaluating the performance of the whole weapon system. The
   construction of target range in our country in fire control dynamic
   testing is relatively backward; therefore, it has greatly influenced the
   evaluation on the fire control system. In order to solve this problem,
   it's urgent to develop a new testing instrument so as to adjust to the
   armament research process and promote weapon system working more
   efficiently and thereby meeting the needs of modernization in national
   defense.
   This paper proposes a new measure which is used to test the stability
   precision of the fire control system, and it is installed on the moving
   base. Using the method, we develop a testing system which can test the
   stability precision of the fire control system and achieve a high
   precision results after testing. The innovation of the system is we can
   receive the image not only by CCD, but our eyes. It also adopts digital
   image-forming and image processing technique for real-time measurement
   and storing of the target information; it simultaneously adopts the
   method adjusting the platform and the corresponding fixture mounted on a
   sample to measure the stable precision and the precision of corner of
   stabilizator. In this paper, we make a description on the construction
   of the system and the idea of the designing of the optical system.
   Finally, we introduce the actual application of the system and testing
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The RF power amplifier (PA) is typically the most power hungry and area
   consuming block in a wireless transceiver system. A viable RF PA
   solution should offer competitive power and area efficiency while
   maintaining high-performance large-signal RF operations. Fully
   integrated RF PA in CMOS has been an area of active research and
   development over the past years. Recently, there has been a surge of
   interest to leverage the mixed-mode, analog and digital, computational
   and signal processing capability in CMOS to radically enhance RF CMOS PA
   solutions and offer unique functionalities in parallel. This paper
   reviews several recently reported circuit design techniques of CMOS PAs.
   All of these techniques take advantage of computation and integration
   advantages of CMOS process and can potentially lead to competitive PA
   solutions compared to traditional III-V HBT PA solutions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a tile-able 16-kByte 6-T SRAM macro in a High-K
   Metal-Gate (HKMG) 28-nm bulk technology with an operating window from
   4.8 GHz at 1.12 V VDD down to 10 MHz at 0.5V, meeting almost all of the
   Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) requirements of Level-1 (L1)
   caches of a digital microprocessor SOC. It uses an unmodified
   technology-supported 0.156um(2) high-current (HC) SRAM cell. Innovative
   and carefully optimized circuit solutions provide the wide operating
   range measured in hardware.
   We also discuss two circuit improvements, a cross-coupled PMOS-pair for
   each bitline-pair with mux readout and an independently-controlled
   precharge-and-write driver (ICPW), which gives a wider DVFS operating
   window with reduced sensitivities to Process-Voltage-Temperature (PVT)
   variations. Improved SRAM macros with new circuits have been designed

Abstract = {{In the digital world, any conceptual assessment framework faces two main
   challenges: (a) the complexity of knowledge, capacities and skills to be
   assessed; (b) the increasing usability of web-based assessments, which
   requires innovative approaches to the development, delivery and scoring
   of tests. Statistical methods play a central role in such framework.
   Item response models have been the most common statistical methods used
   to address such kind of measurement challenges, and they have been used
   in computer-based adaptive tests, which allow the item selection
   adaptively, from an item pool, according to the person ability during
   test administration. The test is tailored to each student. In this paper
   we conduct a simulation study based on the minimum error-variance
   criterion method varying the item exposure rate (0.1, 0.3, 0.5) and the
   test maximum length (18, 27, 36). The comparison is done by examining
   the absolute bias, the root mean square-error, and the correlation.
   Hypotheses tests are applied to compare the true and estimated
   distributions. The results suggest the considerable reduction of bias as
   the number of item administered increases, the occurrence of ceiling
   effect in very small size tests, the full agreement between true and
   empirical distributions for computerized tests of length smaller than
   the paper-and-pencil tests.}},

Abstract = {{Competition for scarce clinical placements has increased requiring new
   and innovative models to be developed to meet the growing need. A
   participatory action research project was used to provide a community
   nursing clinical experience of involvement in parent education. Nine
   Hong Kong nursing students self-selected to participate in the project
   to implement a parenting program called Parenting Young Children in a
   Digital World. Three project cycles were used: needs identification,
   skills development and program implementation. Students were fully
   involved in each cycle's planning, action and reflection phase.
   Qualitative and quantitative data were collected to inform the project.
   The overall outcome of the project was the provision of a rich and
   viable clinical placement experience that created significant learning
   opportunities for the students and researchers. This paper will explore
   the student's participation in this PAR project as an innovative
   clinical practice opportunity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents our current efforts towards finalizing a complete
   workflow for mobile digital storytelling (mDS) supporting the concept of
   mobile seamless learning (MSL) in educational settings. Our purpose with
   the present study was twofold: to initiate the incorporation of
   complementary software solutions concordant with the mDS workflow
   proposed in this paper, and to try to consolidate the sustainability of
   technology enhanced learning efforts like these by encouraging the
   participating teachers to implement ideas, inspiration and routines from
   the mDS workflow into their everyday educational practices. However,
   even though the study outcomes from the pupil activity were rewarding
   for all stakeholders, exposing intensified motivational boost and
   dedication among the pupils, we still recognize a challenge in how to
   motivate and inspire teachers to dare launch and implement future
   similar efforts on their own.}},

Abstract = {{Dioscorea hispida is a poisonous plant normally found in forest where
   scientific studies have shown that its tuber contains toxic poison and
   can be consumed after its poison is removed. Traditionally the tubers
   were placed in flowing river water for several days. In the harvesting
   aspect, an innovative hand tool were conceptually designed to replace
   the traditional hoe or ``cangkul{''}. Using IMADA digital force gauge to
   measure the force required for pulling out the tuber and reverse
   engineering methods, an innovative hand tool were designed and
   developed. The results from experiments showed that the force required
   for harvesting the Dioscorea hispida tuber is found significant with its
   weight versus regression squared (R-2) of 0.86. The information of
   optimum force required from field experiment is used to model the
   simulation and practicality in Computer Aided Design (CAD) environment
   system. The finite element on stress distribution on selected material
   of hand tool was simulated by uploading the material characteristic on
   simulation program embedded in Solidworks software. The end result of
   the simulation is based on visualization of analysis in Solidworks while
   producing the hand tool for designing and fabrication from material
   which is lighter and stronger.}},

Abstract = {{The handwriting analysis is a field of great interest since supports the
   study of different personal characteristics of the human beings,
   including identity, character, and neurological disabilities. In
   particular, the handwriting identification area, which also includes the
   handwritten signature verification, is a topic continuously investigated
   since the freehand writing of a manuscript, as well as the appending of
   a personal signature on a paper document, are still the most widespread
   ways to certify documents in legal, financial and administrative fields.
   The rapid diffusion of devices that enable user interaction by means of
   freehand or capacity pen based writing, and the growing successes
   obtained in processing the digital handwriting, are allowing us to
   extend more and more the boundaries of this fascinating area. The
   automatic handwriting identification is an engaging matter that supports
   several application contexts including the personal identification. In
   this paper we present a novel on-line handwriting identification
   algorithm based on the computation of the static and dynamic features of
   the strokes composing an handwritten text. Extensive experiments have
   demonstrated the usefulness and the accuracy of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Based on in-depth qualitative interviews, this essay offers a portrait
   of media resisters-individuals who intentionally and significantly limit
   their media use and who have largely fallen outside the purview of
   communication research. I argue that attention to media resistance
   expands and enhances practice theory and research on new media use.
   Practice theory broadens by the acknowledgement that media resistance
   constitutes a significant set of behavioral responses to living in a
   media-saturated world. Similarly, recognition of the media resistance
   phenomenon can help address the pro-innovation bias of new media
   research. Media resisters articulate reasons for resistance that include
   (a) asserting boundaries between public and private life, (b) acting on
   concerns that technologies designed to facilitate human connection often
   undermine it, and (c) focusing on immediate experiences and thereby
   cultivating presence.}},

   Adolescents}},
Journal = {{International Journal of Communication}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{2240-2258}},
Abstract = {{Recent scholarly discourse about convergence and media developments
   related to transmedia phenomena has focused on economic and
   media-centered perspectives. Much work has been done by gathering data
   about and analyzing innovative marketing strategies in the media
   industry. These efforts have provided insights into processes of media
   production and distribution in the age of digitization and under the
   conditions of convergence and the social Web. Drawing on this research,
   I develop a perspective on how to examine adolescents' appropriation of
   popular media. This article focuses on the perspective of young people
   who turn toward the media according to their media preferences and
   content-related interests. It is about their transmedia appropriations,
   which means-in simplified terms-how they deal with media content that is
   provided by a converging and highly commercialized media system. The
   article presents an approach to research in this field as well as some
   initial findings of an empirical study with German young people related
   to the role of convergent media and transmedia storytelling for
   socialization processes in adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Digital contents, such as applications, ebooks, and video stream, etc.,
   are playing an increasingly significant role in the electronic commerce
   nowadays. System providers who sell both hardware platform and digital
   contents may strategically choose the the provisioning strategy for
   their digital contents in the competition of hardware market. This paper
   discusses the effectiveness of a novel strategy under which the system
   provider grants the access to her premium digital contents through the
   rival platform. I employ a stylized game-theoretical model by
   considering two competing systems providers who are
   vertically-differentiated in hardware market while one of them has
   advantages in the digital content offerings (i.e., premium contents).
   The results suggest that superior and inferior platforms largely differ
   in controls of premium contents: 1) It is always optimal for the
   inferior platform to sell the digital content through superior platform.
   Specifically, the inferior platform should target superior platform's
   market for content sales rather than extending the low-end market with
   premium contents; however, 2) the superior platform should consider a
   pure bundling strategy to further differentiate her platform when the
   premium is low. These implications are consistent with the practice of
   Amazon.com and Microsoft, while providing useful guidelines for
   decision-making process of system providers.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, securing against environmental threats was the main focus
   of critical infrastructure protection. However, the emergence of cyber
   attacks has changed the focus - infrastructures are facing a different
   danger that has life-threatening consequences and the risk of
   significant economic losses. Clearly, conventional security techniques
   are struggling to keep up with the volume of innovative and emerging
   attacks. Fresh and adaptive infrastructure security solutions are
   required. This paper discusses critical infrastructures and the digital
   threats they face, and provides insights into current and future
   infrastructure security strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The proposed work concerns the analysis of Remotely Piloted Aircraft
   Systems (RPAS), also known as drones, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) or
   UAS (Unmanned Aerial System), on hydrogeological contexts for civil
   protection purposes, underlying the advantages of using a flexible and
   relatively low cost system. The capabilities of photogrammetric RPAS
   multi-sensors platform were examined in term of mapping, creation of
   orthophotos, 3D models generation, data integration into a 3D GIS
   (Geographic Information System) and validation through independent
   techniques such as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). The RPAS
   used (multirotor OktoXL, of the Mikrokopter) was equipped with a GPS
   (Global Positioning System) receiver, digital cameras for photos and
   videos, an inertial navigation system, a radio device for communication
   and telemetry, etc. This innovative way of viewing and understanding the
   environment showed huge potentialities for the study of the territory,
   and due to its characteristics could be well integrated with aircraft
   surveys. However, such characteristics seem to give priority to local
   applications for rigorous and accurate analysis, while it remains a
   means of expeditious investigation for more extended areas. According to
   civil protection purposes, the experimentation was carried out by
   simulating operational protocols, for example for inspection,
   surveillance, monitoring, land mapping, georeferencing methods (with or
   without Ground Control Points - GCP) based on high resolution topography
   (2D and 3D information).}},

   harsh chapters which are difficult to be understood by the students,
   who, nevertheless already know. By means of this technique, each student
   can build up his own microprocessor which makes easier the understanding
   of the functionality of the electronic parts it is made of. This
   technique has two major advantages: on one hand, it creates a synergic

Abstract = {{In this paper, a CMOS CO2 concentration to frequency converter with

   proposed chip are directly digitized, they could be easily sent over a
   wide range of transmission media, such as PSN, radio, optical, IR,
   ultrasonic, and etc. Before performing the proposed calibration
   circuits, the maximum linear error is 21\%. After calibration, the
   maximum linear error is reduced to 1.47\%. The linear error is enhanced
   almost 14.28 times. The CO2 concentration range is 450 to 1140 ppm, and
   the corresponding output frequency range is 278 kHz to 250 kHz. The
   proposed chip is suitable for devices of detecting CO2 concentration in
   scene of a fire.}},

Abstract = {{Through the Project Development of a federated infrastructure network
   for the generation of virtualization services of workstation (FI4VDI,
   Infrastruture Federation - Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) is intended
   to establish joint initiatives of R\&D+i to reinforc the technological
   research system - strategic actions regarding innovation in the field of
   digital economy and society, and the development of a prototype VDI of
   management and formalization of health data through a Cloud Computing
   infrastructure based on case studies in different health specialties
   involved, in particular in the field of Surgical Oncology, on case
   studies of colorectal cancer - CRC. In Spain, the incidence of this
   disease in the region of Castilla y Leon reaches maximum values, with a
   high rate in the province of Leon, which implies an annual excess
   generation data (epidemiological and others), highlighting the need for
   a management system that allows them access, entry, modification and
   distribution, with the ultimate goal of creating a system for predicting
   and intelligent analysis of this disease. Further, genomic sequencing
   data of registered individuals will be imported, so there is the
   possibility of developing a future line of research which has the aim to
   clarify and determine all genetic variants that increase the risk of
   CRC.}},

Abstract = {{One of the key issues in the current information society is the easy and
   open availability of required resources. The concept of ``openness{''}
   covers several resource categories, such as data, software sources,
   services, innovation and education. Open Data is seen as a promising
   source of new business. The concept of open innovation is based on the
   idea of distributing ``useless{''} innovations for beneficial use in a
   new context. The role of open education has grown quickly at different
   education levels - especially university level. Open social networks are
   important platforms both for information distribution and as a source of
   information. There is a bidirectional influence between the availability
   of open resources and applications based on them: On the one hand, new
   applications create trends that demand open availability of resources,
   while on the other hand, the availability of resources creates
   opportunities for new applications. From the technology perspective,
   important change factors include mobility, big data technologies,
   digitalization, and context recognition. At the beginning of our paper
   we build a ``big picture{''} of the important phenomena in the modern
   information society; open resources are seen in the role of enabler.
   National (Finland) and regional (AVARAS Project) initiatives are used to
   concretize the overall discussion.}},

   Optimization (PSO)-Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) dedicated to the
   optimal tuning of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang PI-fuzzy controllers (T-S-K
   PI-FCs). The adaptive hybrid PSO-GSA is comprised from five stages,
   which support the solving of optimization problems with objective
   functions that depend on the control error and on the output sensitivity
   function, and the variables of the objective functions are the fuzzy
   controller tuning parameters. The adaptive hybrid PSO-GSA is included in
   the controller tuning to offer control systems with T-S-K PI-FCs that
   ensure a reduced process parametric sensitivity. Digital simulation and
   experimental results are given to validate the fuzzy controller tuning
   in a laboratory nonlinear servo system application.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced production engineering based on integrated intelligent systems
   through the use of modern technologies and smart metrology ensures
   sustainable production in the industry. This means that the integrated
   and intelligent systems in the production area play an essential role
   for the effective and efficient production and growth.
   Smart economic growth, which is based on high quality training and on
   the promotion of research and innovation as well as on building digital
   factories, sustainable growth as sustainable development, respectful of
   ecological aspects, based on green technologies and improves the working
   environment, and a growth in which all can participate, because new and
   better jobs are created and working life will be modernized, are most
   crucial and central to the future developments.
   The modern methods of quality management intelligently integrated with
   environmental management and energy management will be the main strategy
   developed and refined in manufacturing organizations where advanced
   metrology enable to perform industrial and technological developments by
   practicing high precise measurement tasks and essential measurement
   know-how within the sophisticated production systems.
   This paper proposes a strategic approach to develop a smart integrated
   system applicable in manufacturing industry using the intelligent
   networking for the digital factory by firstly modeling, generating and
   experimenting an inter-university network that accesses, cooperates and
   operates at distance in the laboratory of two distant research

Abstract = {{Nowadays, terrorism is the main threat ( technological or biological)
   that society is facing due to its capacity of producing human and
   material damages and its difficulty of prediction. Terrorist groups can
   use sophisticated methods which involve explosives, biological and
   radioactive agents, and also new threats involving ``digital{''}
   attacks. Ports represent significant challenges when implementing new
   security measures. They cover large geographical areas, they have very
   complex operations, they service large numbers of passengers and they
   process large volumes of goods. Maintaining high efficiency in the
   transportation of goods and passengers is vital to a port. As well as
   efficient surveillance and access control, this requires efficient
   organizational and technological interfaces, linking ports to border
   control authorities, the police, other intervention forces, and
   transport and logistics operators. Research and Innovation have also
   shown that the complexity and cost of port operations for intra-European
   freight is one of the major obstacles for shifting more freight from
   roads onto sea. The introduction of new security measures can easily
   make this situation worse and it is important to start to look at how
   one can improve security while, hopefully, reducing operational
   complexity and cost in European ports. In order to achieve that, new
   approaches on risk assessment are being considered through FP7 research
   cooperation projects such as SUPPORT or CONTAIN.}},

Abstract = {{For the delicate and complex process of knowledge acquisition in
   cultural heritage to be controlled and managed, it is necessary to plan
   and properly guide actions considering monuments from a holistic
   perspective. Thus, data and information should not be simply collected
   but they should be processed in order to highlight possible connections
   and implications and to define a correct knowledge base.
   This paper proposes and illustrates an innovative and original method
   that can be referred to with the acronym CMK (Coordination, Management,
   Knowledge). The method includes interconnected and multidisciplinary
   phases and aims at defining in detail the operational procedures which
   lead to the definition of the knowledge base and to the consequent
   identification of adequate and responsible proposals for actions.
   The method can be adapted to the level of detail or to the specific
   information required as well as to the needs emerged during its
   application.
   The main phase of the method, which is devoted to build the knowledge
   base also through the creation of an interactive and digital case sheet,
   is introduced by a preliminary phase, during which the monument is first
   approached in its broadest context. In its turn, it also supports a
   final more proactive phase devoted to the definition of the conservation
   and restoration actions to propose.
   Finally, an application to a real case is presented in order to clearly
   illustrate the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{With the construction of three coverings in the Valle dei Templi of
   Agrigento, the management of the Park Agency is carrying out an
   experimental action which can produce innovation in the context of
   archaeology. The ``Architecture X Acheology{''} workshop explored the
   state of the art in terms of works protecting archaeological landmarks,
   with the goal of identifying new modular and flexible types which are
   adaptable to the diverse needs of archaeological sites. The Park, which
   covers 1,300 hectares, preserves an extraordinary monumental and
   landscape patrimony. Though visited by millions of tourists, the
   archaeological sites are not appropriately equipped for tourist use. To
   better use this enormous cultural resource and to make it an active
   agent of the regional economy, it is of strategic importance to equip it
   with new facilities which are appropriate for today. For this purpose,
   the workshop has seen professors and students of Politecnico di Milano,
   Palermo University, and of Tokyo University involved in the construction
   of experimental prototypes for the protection of archaeological finds
   and excavation sites. The shelters produced during the workshop - other
   than having a functional and aesthetic value-form the first nucleus of a
   park of modern architecture within an archaeological park. The work
   shows the willingness to systematize the great potential value which the
   interdisciplinary prospect of integration between architecture and
   archaeology offer to both disciplines in terms of research and analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The survey techniques based on photo acquisition have nowadays regained
   importance thanks to three main aspects related to technological
   innovations: the cheapness of production of digital images; the
   evolution of capacity to compute, memorize and share data; the
   consequent development of recursive algorithms on massive data. In the
   last years many experimentations have been conducted on the acquisition
   of this data, but the way to display and communicate them - both for
   scientific and simply informative aims - is still uncertain and not
   sufficiently investigated.
   The experimentation we want to illustrate here concern the opportunity
   to realize an interactive and multimedia informative system of an
   architectural or archeological space, based on a progressive fruition of
   several multi-thematic spherical panoramas. The activities of study,
   experimentation and test have involved both technological aspects and
   communication problems, at the different levels of representation,
   fruition, interaction and characterization. The quality of the realized
   model and its structuration in an easily shareable format allow to
   investigate the properties in order to increase the knowledge of it,
   also in a remote way.
   The case study of our experimentation concern the paintings by Andrea
   Pozzo at St. Ignatius in Rome.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - An inquiry into the constitution of the experience of
   patienthood. It understands ``becoming a patient{''} as a production of
   a subjectivity, in other words as a process of individuation and milieu
   that occurs through an ontology of production. This ontology of
   production can, of course, also be understood as a political ontology.
   Therefore, this is, first of all, an inquiry into a mode of production,
   and, secondly, an inquiry into its relation to the issue of social
   justice - because of effects of digital divisions. In these terms, it
   also reflects on how expert discourses, such as in medical sociology and
   science studies (STS), can
   Approach - An integrative mode of discourse analysis, strongly related
   to discursive institutionalism, called semantic agency theory: it
   considers those arrangements (institutions, informal organizations,
   networks, collectivities, etc.) and assemblages (intellectual equipment,
   vernacular epistemologies, etc.) that are constitutive of how the issue
   of ``patient experience{''} can be articulated form its position within
   an ontology of production.
   Findings - The aim not being the production of a finite result, what is
   needed is a shift in how ``the construction of patient experience{''} is
   produced by expert discourses. While the inquiry is not primarily an
   empirical study and is also limited to ``Western societies,{''} it
   emphasizes that there is a relation between political ontologies
   (including the issues of social justice) and the subjectivities that
   shape the experiences of people in contemporary health care systems,
   and, finally, that this relation is troubled by the effects of the
   digital divide(s).
   Originality - A proposal `` to interrogate and trouble{''} some
   innovative extensions and revisions - even though it will not be able to
   speculate about matters of degree - to contemporary theories of
   biomedicalization, patienthood, and managed care.}},

   model in which Taiwan service providers participate through analyzing,
   testing, and verifying the largest KTV operator company, AA, as an
   empirical target. It examines how service industry comes up with an
   innovative service development model based on a service design created
   with accumulated encounter experiences with its customers. This new
   service model is produced through close scrutiny of customer behavior,
   preference, and recognition. Overall, the integrated service design
   procedure is applied to explore what type of methods and processes the
   KTV operator can adopt to digitalize its services.}},

Abstract = {{When a reforming technology company holding high valuable intellectual
   property tries to solve financial struggle by transferring patents, he
   needs to know who the right transferee is. Kodak was selected as
   research target. Ego patent citation network is formed by its core
   technology, `digital image', as an ego center. This study adopts
   knowledge redundancy analysis to identify the position of company in
   two-dimensional diagram of technology knowledge status and technology
   knowledge reliability. Moreover, this study selected nine important
   companies in order to understand the correlation of indicator variance
   with Kodak before and after patent transference. The results show: (a)
   The digital mobile communication device industry is most potential for
   Kodak to release digital image technology, (b) During the process of
   Kodak's reformation, Apple is the most suitable company for Kodak to
   release patent. (c) Apple's technology knowledge status increases after
   patents transference, but it does not shake the leadership of Kodak. (d)
   From the view of Kodak after patent release, Apple's common internal
   knowledge and common external knowledge with Kodak increase
   significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper presents a method that integrates digitization into
   the traditional Lean Six Sigma model for innovation processes. The
   method aims to adding value to the customers, improve effectiveness,
   eliminate waste, minimizing operating costs, and reducing time-to-market
   through the redesign of the innovation processes and their automation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The method described as the 6Ds (Define,
   Discover, Design, Develop, Digitize, and Deploy) is original and not
   presented before.
   Findings - This paper reports a certain number of cases where the
   approach has been very successful in helping all along the entire
   innovation processes.
   Research limitations/implications - The method has been demonstrated
   effective in a certain number of cases involving product innovation. It
   seems particularly important to extend its applications also to
   innovation in processes, organization, and business models.
   Originality/value - This paper presents an innovative method and a
   certain number of successful implementation of the Lean and Digitize
   approach to innovation.}},

Abstract = {{New approaches are required to guide social and economic systems in a
   context presenting a deep change in the meaning of value and in ways to
   generate it. Until now, policies and strategies, at macro as well as
   microeconomic level, have focused on closed systems (the great
   ``containers{''} of the industrial era), and on profits coming from the
   exchange of goods and services. Nonetheless, the growing misalignment
   between values on financial markets and volume of turnovers, clearly
   observed in the web companies, shows that important assets can be
   created through new dynamics (i.e. the number of relationships of a
   social network service). The fast digitalization of society suggests a
   next extension of this dynamics to the whole economy, or much of it.
   These developments are consistent with the vision of a sustainable
   prosperity of socioeconomic system based upon knowledge, but our society
   is not aware of conditions and factors enabling its generation and
   exploitation. Knowledge is an open, complex system, as well as the
   networks where it is created. Therefore, we should shift our focus from
   traditional, closed organizations to the emerging ``knowledge hubs{''};
   there is a wide array of them, and a lot to understand about how they
   could behave.
   This paper deals with these hubs, or nodes, and the way to accelerate
   their emergence and to increase their generative potential overall their
   potential. We call these cognitive super-hubs ``Knowledge Eyes{''}, not
   only for their eidetic ability, but also for their capability of gather
   progressively more and more energy moving in open environments (as
   ``cyclone eyes{''}). Experiences of global and local knowledge systems
   are shortly described, with the goal of a better understanding of their
   formation, exploitation and governance in our transitional age.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which
   academics are engaged with online communities for research purposes, and
   the research activities, platforms and tools associated with these
   communities. In addition, the paper aims to discover the benefits,
   disadvantages and barriers involved in the use of online communities,
   and especially in regard to the trust and authority issues, so important
   in scholarly communications.
   Designmethodologyapproach - A layered, mixed-methods approach was used
   for this complex research topic. Interviews were undertaken with social
   science and humanities researchers, followed up with focus groups in
   both the USA and UK. This qualitative work was then followed up with an
   online questionnaire that generated over 1,000 responses.
   Findings - Over half the sample had experience of an online research
   community and a majority of researchers are making at least occasional
   use of one or more Web 2.0 services for communicating their research
   activity; for developing and sustaining networks and collaboration; or
   for finding out what others are doing. Big differences exist in
   membership rates according to subject, but not really by age or other
   demographic factors. The biggest benefit to joining an online community
   is the ability to seek information in one's own specialism. Younger
   researchers are more engaged with online communities.
   Research limitationsimplications - The qualitative research was limited
   to the UK and USA. While use of online communities is now accepted by
   both established and younger researchers, the main ways of communicating
   research remain scholarly journals and books.
   Practical implications - The implications for learned societies and
   publishers are not clear. Journals are confirmed as the primary way of
   disseminating research. However, it would be easy for these stakeholders
   to miss how younger researchers expect to connect in digital
   communities.
   Social implications - With researchers of all ages accepting the
   existing and importance of online communities and connections, there are
   few technical or social barriers to using mainstream digital tools to
   connect professionally.
   Originalityvalue - There is little published research considering the
   role of online research communities, so the study is highly original. It
   is valuable to discover that researchers still prefer to share research
   findings primarily through journals, rather than through social
   technologies.}},

   teachers' reading: First iteration findings}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{533-546}},
Abstract = {{Preservice teachers of secondary English need sustained and confident
   experiences of the pedagogical affordances of information and
   communication technologies (ICTs), to overcome the constraints perceived
   by their secondary teaching colleagues. They also need to rapidly
   develop an extensive knowledge of adolescent fiction titles for
   progressing the reading engagement and success of their future students.
   Building on the students' acceptance of ICTs, this study examines the
   impact of using an interactive digital platform within preservice
   secondary English courses, for adolescent reading requirements. This
   paper reports results of the first iteration of the innovation. Data
   were collected via a questionnaire and results show that using an
   interactive digital platform with social networking characteristics for
   writing and reading book summaries, augmented knowledge of titles,
   increased motivation for reading, developed a repository of titles for
   use in the first year of teaching, and demonstrated how a digital
   platform might be successfully used in schools. Recommendations for the
   second iteration of the innovation are also reported.}},

Pages = {{898-922}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a tutorial and survey
   on recent advances in multimedia networking from an integrated
   perspective of both video networking and building digital video
   libraries. The nature of video networking, coupled with various recent
   developments in standards, proposals and applications, poses great
   challenges to the research and industrial communities working in this
   area.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents an insightful analysis
   for recent and emerging multimedia applications in digital video
   libraries and on video coding standards and their applications in
   digital libraries. Emphasis is given on those standards and mechanisms
   that enable multimedia content adaptation fully interoperable according
   to the vision of Universal Multimedia Access vision.
   Findings - The tutorial helps elucidate the similarities and differences
   among the considered standards and networking applications. A number of
   research trends and challenges are identified, and selected promising
   solutions are discussed. This practice would needle further thoughts on
   the development of this area and open-up more research and application
   opportunities.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper does not provide
   methodical studies of networking application scenarios for all the
   discussed video coding standards and Quality of Service (QoS) management
   mechanisms.
   Practical implications - The paper provides an overview of which
   technologies/mechanisms are being used broadly in networking scenarios
   of digital video libraries. The discussed networking scenarios bring
   together video coding standards and various emerging wireless networking
   paradigms toward innovative application scenarios.
   Originality/value - QoS mechanisms and video coding standards that
   support multimedia applications for digital video libraries need to
   become well-known by library managers and professional associations in
   the fields of libraries and archives. The comprehensive overview and
   critiques on existing standards and application approaches offer a
   valuable reference for researchers and system developers in related
   research and industrial communities.}},

Abstract = {{South African communities are constantly being developed through new ICT
   projects which are initiated by individuals, government and private
   organisations. The problem with these developments is that they are
   implemented in isolation. This isolation causes limited sharing of
   resources, duplication, poor-governance of the resources and in
   worse-case scenarios, failure of project initiatives. This paper
   proposes a model that could be used to address these problems by
   focusing on the SEIDET community centre using it as an example. The
   model follows a descriptive analysis of ICT related work spanning over
   two decades performed within the SEIDET context, including the ongoing
   SEIDET Digital Village. The benefits of the proposed smart community
   centre model include community and rural development through sharing of
   scarce ICT resources. It could further provide support for entrepreneurs
   through training interventions, action-based research for policy
   development as well as spawn local innovation and free-sharing of
   resources and services.}},

Abstract = {{Most communications in the new era are dependent on Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT). In addition, infrastructure is becoming
   increasingly interconnected. This not only makes lives easier, but also
   leaves technology users more vulnerable. Cybercrime, digital espionage
   and other cyber disturbances dictate the news reports on a daily basis.
   In general, cyber-attacks are no longer confined to small-scale rogue
   hackers. Cyber-attacks are now a part of organised crime and the
   underground economy, posing a real threat to critical infrastructure;
   possibly with state actors driving these actions. The responsibility to
   protect ICT stretches beyond individual companies, sectors and even
   beyond nations. The authors of this paper propose a Cybersecurity Centre
   Of Innovation (CCOI) as a central point for the South African
   government, business and academia to create a secure cyber space for the
   country: a cyber space without crime that is resilient and resistant to
   disruptions; a cyber space that promotes innovation, helps the economy
   and enhances national security. The key driver of the proposed CCOI is
   collaboration; solutions to cyber risks require a combined approach.
   This paper describes the organisational structure, functions, activities
   and benefits of a CCOI.}},

Abstract = {{We are witnessing and benefiting of advantages of the remarkable ICT
   evolution. A development hardly matched by any other technological
   advance both in depths as well as in the lateral dimension.
   In spite of all doomsday prophesies and prognosis ICT is moving ahead.
   Just over the last 20 years only, CPUs improved by a factor 2400, DRAM's
   by 1000 and NAND Flash by 32000, paralleled by an increase in network
   speed by a factor of 840 and Internet traffic by a an annual CGR of more
   than 30 \%. Can this continue?
   We shall review the status of R\&D in its quest for solutions, some of
   the challenges ahead, the desired innovations, and the economic
   consequences of this drive. Will future investments into technology be
   sufficiently rewarding and economically feasible?
   The advancements mentioned are inseparably from the R\&D efforts of the
   key players and their strategy, we will look at the changes now
   reshaping the scenario.
   A new generation of consumers and the first generation of digital
   natives has arrived and shaping future markets, applications, and
   reciprocally being shaped by them.
   ICT is penetrating, fertilizing and empowering new areas as energy,
   photonics, health, and medical applications creating by their weight
   future markets and R\&D directions.
   Finally we will complete our review be perusing the status of the
   development of ``more than Moore (MtM){''} as well long range options.}},

Abstract = {{Content industries go through a demanding time adjusting to the digital
   age, revamping their business processes when sales of paper documents
   are not an option any more. Formal standardisation is facing the same
   challenges as organisations like ISO and CEN see sales of publications
   as their core business. This paper presents a case study from European
   pre-standardisation. CEN Workshop on Learning Technologies was in 2013
   put on hold due to the threat the European standardisation body CEN sees
   to its business model. The conflict is centred on open work processes,
   and open and freely available documents. Standardisation experts in
   education claim that stakeholder engagement, input from research, and
   willingness to implement the developed standards will be harmed by
   following CEN's strict interpretation of their rules. Open Research,
   Open innovation, Open Data and a series of other open policies are now
   values that make up the foundation for driving the Innovation cycle
   underlying standardisation activities. Barriers to openness could hamper
   participation from research and restrict implementations and user
   engagement.}},

Abstract = {{It is particularly relevant the role of standardization in a complex and
   highly converging context. The pace of technology growth and the lack of
   comprehensive technology adoption programs and a sound regulatory
   environment present important challenges to take full advantage of the
   new world scenario of digitalization and global convergence. On the one
   hand, national ICT regulatory administrations of emerging economies are
   committed to consolidate and strengthen their standardization processes
   and policies. On the other hand, the national health institutions
   acknowledge the need of standards that include information technology
   elements in the medical practices. This paper delineates the basic
   elements for the development of a comprehensive framework for e-Health
   standardization in emerging economies taking into account the
   multidimensional and complex nature of the standardization process and
   the importance of the interactions among all the actors involved. Our
   proposal emerges from the establishment of a National Program for
   e-Health in Mexico as suggested by both WHO and ITU.}},

   avalanche diodes (SPADs), flipped and wafer-bonded on a standard CMOS
   wafer integrating the analog front-end circuit, in-pixel digital
   processing and readout electronics. Two major improvements are achieved:
   higher pixel density and fill-factor, since these detectors are placed
   on the top of the corresponding smart-pixel electronics, instead of
   being placed side-by-side (as in planar structures); enhanced spectral
   sensitivity in the near-infrared, up to 1 mu m wavelength, thanks to
   thicker active volume within the SOI detector wafer and to the backside
   illumination of the active area.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design of advanced physical layer for
   narrowband power line communications (NB-PLC) based on coded modulation.
   The coding modulation scheme is described and decoding process based on
   soft decoding is proposed. Using this innovative scheme, the decoder
   performs a gain of 3 dB at symbol error rate (SER) equal to 10-3 over
   traditional receiver with hard decoding. In the implementation analysis,
   both the digital signal processor (DSP) resources usage and the maximum
   data rate are considered. It is concluded that a transmission rate of
   2.4 kbps is reached for a robust NB-PLC and available resources can be
   used for full protocol stack implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional marketing has been using the Internet as a mean of transport
   for advertising, usually through the use of banners or sponsored links.
   However, new tendencies in digital marketing are focusing on added
   interactivity, where the use of games as a marketing tool is not new.
   Moreover, the portion of population engaged in social networks is
   quickly increasing, turning these into preferred targets for marketing
   actions, considering the potential of retrieving valuable personal,
   demographic and geographic data. Forwarding recent advances in data
   mining and knowledge extraction to this model would therefore turn it
   into a powerful tool to measure the impact of marketing and branding
   actions, while reinforcing marketing strategy. In this paper we present
   GameFoundry, a new online platform that aims at creating an innovative
   Web Game Engine and Game Distribution system, which will provide support
   for knowledge management and game activity monitoring based on simple
   network games. It is intended to give the users the possibility of
   playing games in several environments, platforms and social networks,
   and to provide the clients of this product the ability to create,
   independently, a set of games with proprietary contents, distribute them
   over the network and have constant access to game activity, statistics
   and advanced user profiling, collective behavior and predictive models.

Abstract = {{The digital industries cluster known as Silicon Roundabout has been
   quietly growing in East London since the 1990s. Rebranded Tech City, it
   is the focus of huge public and government attention. National and local
   policy makers wish to accelerate the local area's development: such
   cluster policies are back in vogue as part of a reawakened interest in
   industrial policy. Surprisingly little is known about Tech City's firms
   or the wider ecosystem, however, and cluster programmes have a high
   failure rate. We perform a detailed mixed-methods analysis, combining
   rich enterprise-level data with semistructured interviews. We track firm
   and employment growth from 1997 to 2010 and identify several distinctive
   features: branching from creative to digital content industries;
   street-level sorting of firms; the importance of local amenities and a
   lack of conventional cluster actors such as universities or anchor
   businesses. We also argue that the existing policy mix embodies a number
   of tensions, and suggest areas for improvement.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe how we combine active and passive user input
   modes in clinical environments for knowledge discovery and knowledge
   acquisition towards decision support in clinical environments. Active
   input modes include digital pens, smartphones, and automatic handwriting
   recognition for a direct digitalisation of patient data. Passive input
   modes include sensors of the clinical environment and/or mobile
   smartphones. This combination for knowledge acquisition and decision
   support (while using machine learning techniques) has not yet been
   explored in clinical environments and is of specific interest because it
   combines previously unconnected information sources for individualised
   treatments. The innovative aspect is a holistic view on individual
   patients based on ontologies, terminologies, and textual patient records
   whereby individual active and passive real-time patient data can be
   taken into account for improving clinical decision support.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation is by far the trendiest management issue nowadays and the
   rhetoric of innovation has reached every sector of the economy and
   society, as well. Increasing competitiveness implies economic change
   through the introduction of new technologies and new methods of
   production, as well as, the development of new skills. Innovation is the
   core of this process. Innovation management is focused on the systematic
   processes that organizations use to develop new and improved products,
   services and business processes. It involves development of creative
   ideas within the organization and the networked environment. Focusing on
   the management of innovation implies also the management of talents
   among the employees. The knowledge captured in new technologies and
   processes has led to growth and competitiveness. Developing
   knowledge-based society requires adequate levels of investment in
   research, development, education, as well as creating a favorable
   environment for innovation. Reengineering in terms of innovation has
   helped many companies to improve their productivity and consequently to
   grow in competitiveness. Hereby we discuss the management of innovation
   in the circumstances of market globalization, digital revolution, and
   dynamic development of technology, products and services. Management of
   innovation is a complex task of leadership that aims at a systemic
   process of change throughout strategic and operational approaches. In
   this paper we discuss a model of innovation management based on the
   analysis of the driving forces of change and a framework in which domain
   and problem definition play an important role. The paper presents also
   the National Innovation Systems with a special view of Romania's
   position within the European Union in terms of innovation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A built environment is ambiguous, because space can be understood in a
   Euclidean way, symbolically, socially as well as architecturally,
   image-scientifically or psychologically. This conference paper is
   dedicated to learning about the correlations of these perceptions in a
   wider sense with means to disclose time-dependent and functional layers
   related dynamically to the space.
   We have chosen our campus for the case study, which was a garrison
   beginning in the 1930s and served different armies before it was
   converted to a university in the 1990s. Our intention is to offer
   social, informative benefits and knowledge about the campus, which in
   turn contributes to participatory development of the campus and hence to
   identification with the place as well as with collective memory, for
   everyone on site.
   We are developing an app that facilitates innovative space perception.
   The digital tools in the app consist of geocaching, an interactive map,
   communication tools and various multimedia information components. This
   so-called ``geo-knowledge-caching{''} shall be used to expand a
   university campus to a complex knowledge construct with buildings in
   which knowledge is imparted and a library that houses knowledge and a
   place for discussion, encounters and leisure activities.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing plays a significant role in all economies and are the key
   generators of employment and income and the drivers of innovation and
   growth. The scope of the present study is to analyze the performance of
   the Greek manufacturing firms by sectors (NACE 2 digit sector
   classification) and by region, based on firm level data. We investigate
   the effect of certain factors, such as size, age and exports on the
   efficiency of all manufacturing sectors in Greece. The research is based
   on financial data of a large sample of 3600 Greek industrial firms, for
   a time span of 9 years (2003-2011). The empirical research with the use
   of DEA analysis attempts to rate the 13 Greek regions based on their
   firm efficiency and explain the reasons behind the differentiation in
   performance. Further, econometric modeling is used to investigate the
   effect of age, size and exports on firm level efficiency, for each
   region. We find that there is a negative effect of exports on efficiency
   scores, while a positive relation between size and efficiency scores is
   reported. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Abstract = {{In recent years, lattice-based cryptography has been recognized for its
   many attractive properties, such as strong provable security guarantees
   and apparent resistance to quantum attacks, flexibility for realizing
   powerful tools like fully homomorphic encryption, and high asymptotic
   efficiency. Indeed, several works have demonstrated that for basic tasks
   like encryption and authentication, lattice-based primitives can have
   performance competitive with (or even surpassing) those based on
   classical mechanisms like RSA or Diffie-Hellman. However, there still
   has been relatively little work on developing lattice cryptography for
   deployment in real-world cryptosystems and protocols.
   In this work we take a step toward that goal, by giving efficient and
   practical lattice-based protocols for key transport, encryption, and
   authenticated key exchange that are suitable as ``drop-in{''} components
   for proposed Internet standards and other open protocols. The security
   of all our proposals is provably based (sometimes in the random-oracle
   model) on the well-studied ``learning with errors over rings{''}
   problem, and hence on the conjectured worst-case hardness of problems on
   ideal lattices (against quantum algorithms).
   One of our main technical innovations (which may be of independent
   interest) is a simple, low-bandwidth reconciliation technique that
   allows two parties who ``approximately agree{''} on a secret value to
   reach exact agreement, a setting common to essentially all lattice-based
   encryption schemes. Our technique reduces the ciphertext length of prior
   (already compact) encryption schemes nearly twofold, at essentially no
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{The Indian education system is highly regarded in the world. The
   fundamentals have been very strong in our teaching system since Ancient
   Gurukul days. However education system is going through paradigm shift
   as we are living in digital era. Students aged between 5 to 15 years are
   the second generation of IT revolution in India where their parents are
   already either IT professionals or its end users. It is evident from the
   IT revolution that, there is a need for teaching the students in a
   better and innovating way to enhance their skills and knowledge. Today
   in urban cities, the schools are equipped with Smart systems to provide
   ``touch and teach{''} learning system. The study aims at analyzing
   consumer psychology in Bangalore in identifying the gap between today's
   trend and earlier research on Interactive Education and analysis of
   consumer behavior attitude of parents towards interactive education
   solutions at home through various media like TV, Internet, Tablet PC
   etc. It is expected that the research outcome would provide stepping
   stone for New age entrepreneurs and education service provider
   organizations to take this research forward and deep dive further to
   assess probable market size and understand customer expectations.
   To analyze whether the consumer seeks any values and benefits in
   educating their children.
   To explore the opportunities to bridge the gap between the supply and
   demand
   The outcome would provide stepping stone for entrepreneurs and education
   organizations.
   This would help them in clearly designing and defining their products
   and services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The empowerment of information resources with more innovative technique
   is absolutely necessary by a library in the digital age now a days, and
   3D e-book information package is one way that can be done, as in this
   research. The alternative primary food theme is taken since it is one of
   the national priority programs that have been declared by the government
   of the Republic of Indonesia. Alternative primary food in this study
   focused on rhizomes, such as cassava, sweet potatoes, and canna. The
   method used in this study is information repackaging through stages such
   as information gathering, analysis and synthesis makimg, design
   templates packaging, and information packaging in printed and electronic
   media (3-dimensional e-book). The result and benefit of this research is
   the creation of attractive, innovative, and appealing information
   packaging that can be used as a guide for the public insight knowledge

Abstract = {{Recent advances in microfluidics to generate and control picoliter
   emulsions of water in oil have enabled ultra-sensitive assays for small
   molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and cells. Unfortunately, the
   conventional fluorescence detection used to measure the outcome of these
   droplet-based assays has not proven suited to match the time and space
   multiplexing capabilities of microfluidic systems. To address this
   challenge, we developed an in-flow fluorescence detection platform that
   enables multiple streams of droplets to be monitored using only a single
   photodetector and no lenses. The key innovation of our technology is the
   amplitude modulation of the signal from fluorescent droplets using
   distinct micro-patterned masks for each channel. By taking advantage of
   the high bandwidth of electronics, our technique enables the
   velocity-independent recovery of weak fluorescent signals (SNR << 1)
   using only simple hardware, obviating the need for lasers, bulky
   detectors, and complex fluid control. We demonstrated a handheld-sized
   device that simultaneously monitors four independent channels with the
   capability to be scaled-up to more than sixteen, limited primarily by
   the droplet density.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is about the classroom use of digital literacies. It
   describes using a hypermedia-authoring program with middle-years
   students at an Australian secondary school. Classroom environments were
   created in which collaborative and innovative group work built on
   technical facilities and expertise developed by students outside of
   school. The teaching of non-linear hypermedia stories and instruction in
   software use to create such stories are represented as a case study. The
   author argues that the three-part model for understanding literacy as
   having an operational, a cultural and a critical dimension can be an
   effective way to deal with the occasionally intimidating experience of
   digital literacies in education.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the concept of modularity in financial services,
   discusses how new value chains are created and addresses emerging
   opportunities for innovative business models in the digital economy. We
   argue that innovation occurred in the banking sector despite the lagging
   adoption of new operational practices but due to technology drive for
   new ways to provide services. Banking innovation is commonly a matter of
   case facilitation vs. lock-in, in which the systemic effects of
   balancing delay vs. fast progress requires business model choices. In
   the banking sector, where there is little power stability among
   stakeholders, asymmetrical periods of dynamism are triggered by the
   modernization of the systems {[}13].
   The main argument of this paper is that we can use models of modularity
   and network integration to improve our understanding of sustainable
   emerging banking practices. This is fundamental when establishing the
   potential contribution of this sector to digital economy models.}},

Abstract = {{Exploratory empirical studies of the digital divide exist for various
   nations including the United States. The contribution of this paper is
   to enhance understanding of factors associated with availability and
   utilization of information and communication technologies (ICTs) at the
   state level in the US. In our conceptual model of technology
   utilization, eight dependent technology availability and utilization
   factors are posited to be associated with twelve independent
   socio-economic, demographic, innovation, and societal openness factors.
   Technology utilization variables are spatially analyzed to determine
   extent of agglomeration or randomness, and regression residuals are
   examined to eliminate spatial bias. We find that societal openness,
   urbanization, and ethnicities are significantly associated with higher
   ICT utilization. We report interesting findings for social media
   communication technologies of Facebook and Twitter. Implications for
   policymakers at both federal and state levels are discussed.}},

   are enabled by embedded technology. Digitalization with embedded
   technology in physical products has become a common phenomenon. In spite
   of growing instance of such digitalization, little is known about the
   architectural characteristics of embedded technology enabled digital
   services. Based on a research on vehicular remote diagnostics services,
   we characterize the architecture of such digital services. Following the
   framework on layered modular architecture continuum, our findings
   provide the following architectural characteristics: i) the architecture
   of the digital services spans along the layered modular architecture
   continuum, ii) the application program of the digital services is
   simultaneously de-coupled and partly coupled with the embedded devices,
   iii) there exist layers within layer of the digital services, iv)
   application program layer of the digital services is a closed innovation
   platform.}},

Abstract = {{Digital platforms are re-shaping organizations and markets. In
   particular, telecommunication companies are challenged to control
   digital platforms and to engage generative ecosystems. In order to
   provide a point of departure for future research, we conduct an
   explorative case study analysis to determine the state of the art of
   business models of telecommunication operators' developer platforms. The
   contribution of our study is three-fold, providing insights on business
   model design, platform control and competitive strategy. Specifically,
   we find that the business models provide the prerequisites for effective
   and efficient new product development and tend to leave the customer
   relationship to complementors. Further, we identify differentiating
   design decisions and demarcate capabilities that remain in control of
   operators. Finally, we highlight cooperation, particularly with
   aggregators, as a means to tackle the challenges of platform
   fragmentation and increase the platform's functional range. Based our
   findings we indicate promising aspects for future research in these
   fields.}},

Abstract = {{Business model innovation comprises many theoretical models, frameworks
   and methodologies; however, there is still little in the way of digital
   support for them using Computer Aided Design software. In this paper, we
   present an analysis of real-world usage data from the first generation
   of such tools that were designed to support the business model canvas.
   We first present how two artifacts implement features such as colors for
   grouping, custom attributes and positioning of elements. An examination
   of how digital support brings about new opportunities in business
   modeling allows us to compare this with a paper-based version. We then
   analyze how variations of these features have been used in the real
   world. Finally, we examine the implications of our observations for the
   next generation of tools and the advancement of research for dedicated

Abstract = {{Technological innovations such as Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   offer opportunities to improve collaborative work and integration in the
   architecture, engineering and construction industry. However, research
   to date has documented how many organizations struggle with how to work
   based on this new technology, and many implementations fail. In this
   paper we present a case study of a major healthcare construction project
   in which the use of BIM was paramount, and where designers claim to have
   succeeded in integrated design. The designers organized their digital
   collaboration by establishing 1) change agents; 2) a cloud computing
   infrastructure; 3) new roles and responsibilities; 4) BIM contracts; 5)
   an IS learning environment; and 6) by involving software developers.
   These factors have been identified as influential for the successful
   diffusion of BIM in this project, and may serve as an example for
   implementation of BIM in other projects for supporting integrated
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Incumbent manufacturing firms face challenges when expanding their
   product focus with digital services. Such expansion creates tensions in
   organizations in the servitization process. While management visions and
   conceptualizes new service oriented businesses, the actual practice of
   implementing these service concepts is influenced by the product
   paradigmatic way of thinking in the organization. This dominant thinking
   creates tensions between business visions and business practice. We use
   the case of remote diagnostics services to provide insights into a
   manufacturing firm's attempt to transform the dominant oriented business
   models into a new networked environment. We suggest that such acts that
   may or may not lead to transition are lingered by dominant logics
   related to the product focus. This indicates that firms are required to
   embed new logics into their existing practice in order to exploit the
   full potential of digital technology.}},

Abstract = {{Banpil Photonics (Banpil) has developed a low-cost high-performance
   multispectral camera system for Visible to Short-Wave Infrared
   (VIS-SWIR) imaging for the most demanding high-sensitivity and
   high-speed military, commercial and industrial applications. The 640x512
   pixel InGaAs uncooled camera system is designed to provide a compact,
   small-form factor to within a cubic inch, high sensitivity needing less
   than 100 electrons, high dynamic range exceeding 190 dB, high-frame
   rates greater than 1000 frames per second (FPS) at full resolution, and
   low power consumption below 1W. This is practically all the feature
   benefits highly desirable in military imaging applications to expand
   deployment to every warfighter, while also maintaining a low-cost
   structure demanded for scaling into commercial markets. This paper
   describes Banpil's development of the camera system including the
   features of the image sensor with an innovation integrating advanced
   digital electronics functionality, which has made the confluence of
   high-performance capabilities on the same imaging platform practical at
   low cost. It discusses the strategies employed including innovations of
   the key components (e. g. focal plane array (FPA) and Read-Out
   Integrated Circuitry (ROIC)) within our control while maintaining a
   fabless model, and strategic collaboration with partners to attain
   additional cost reductions on optics, electronics, and packaging. We
   highlight the challenges and potential opportunities for further cost
   reductions to achieve a goal of a sub-\$1000 uncooled high-performance
   camera system. Finally, a brief overview of emerging military,
   commercial and industrial applications that will benefit from this high
   performance imaging system and their forecast cost structure is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional photographs only record the sum total of light rays of
   each point on image plane so that they tell little about the amount of
   light traveling along individual rays. The focus and lens aberration
   problems have challenged photographers since the very beginning
   therefore light field photography was proposed to solve these problems.
   Lens array and multiple camera systems are used to capture 4D light
   rays, by reordering the different views of scene from multiple
   directions. The coded aperture is another method to encode the angular
   information in frequency domain.
   However, infrared light field sensing is still widely opening to
   research. In the paper, we will propose micro plane mirror optics
   together with compressive sensing algorithm to record light field in
   infrared spectrum. The micro mirror reflects objects irradiation and
   forms a virtual image behind the plane in which the mirror lies. The
   Digital Micromirror (DMD) consists of millions microscale mirrors which
   work as CCD array in the camera and it is controlled separately so as to
   project linear combination of object image onto lens. Coded aperture
   could be utilized to control angular resolution of infrared light rays.
   The carbon nanotube based infrared detector, which has ultra high signal
   to noise ratio and ultra fast responsibility, will sum up all image
   information on it without image distortion. Based on a number of
   measurements, compressive sensing algorithm was used to recover images
   from distinct angles, which could compute different views of scene to
   reconstruct infrared light field scence. Two innovative applications of
   full image recovery using nano scale photodetector and DMD based
   synthetic aperture photography will also be discussed in this paper.}},

   of Small Hybrid Wind Turbine Rotors}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel framework for the aerodynamic design and
   optimization of blades for small horizontal axis wind turbines (WT). The
   framework is based on a state-of-the-art blade element momentum model,
   which is complemented with the XFOIL 6.96 software in order to provide
   an estimate of the sectional blade aerodynamics. The framework considers
   an innovative nested-hybrid solution procedure based on two
   metaheuristics, the virtual gene genetic algorithm and the simulated
   annealing algorithm, to provide a near-optimal solution to the problem.
   The objective of the study is to maximize the aerodynamic efficiency of
   small WT (SWT) rotors for a wide range of operational conditions. The
   design variables are (1) the airfoil shape at the different blade span
   positions and the radial variation of the geometrical variables of (2)
   chord length, (3) twist angle, and (4) thickness along the blade span. A
   wind tunnel validation study of optimized rotors based on the NACA
   4-digit airfoil series is presented. Based on the experimental data,
   improvements in terms of the aerodynamic efficiency, the cut-in wind
   speed, and the amount of material used during the manufacturing process
   were achieved. Recommendations for the aerodynamic design of SWT rotors
   are provided based on field experience.}},

Abstract = {{Our article aims to reflect on some key concepts that have emerged in
   the recent literature on innovation. In particular, it will seek
   convergence between social and open innovation within the framework of
   Smart Cities. The Smart cities are embedded in the last 20 years
   processes of change that have altered conditions and modalities of
   innovation and knowledge generation. The city is still, like Robert Park
   in 1915, the ``social laboratory{''} par excellence for the study of
   human behavior in a modern urban environment. If we consider recent
   debate on Smart city definition, we can find that ICT can be a powerful
   tool for building the collaborative digital environment that enhances
   the intelligent capacity of localities {[}30]. In that sense we can
   consider use the most used definition: ``a city may be called smart when
   investments in human and social capital and traditional (transport) and
   modern (ICT) communication infrastructure fuel sustainable economic
   development and a high quality of life, with a wise management of
   natural resources, through participatory governance{''}. Early as at
   this definition we can find the pillars of our reflection: the
   innovation as social innovation, the new role of the 2.0 citizen-public,
   the issue of governance.}},

Abstract = {{The SPADnet FP7 European project is aimed at a new generation of fully
   digital, scalable and networked photonic components to enable large area
   image sensors, with primary target gamma-ray and coincidence detection
   in (Time-of-Flight) Positron Emission Tomography (PET). SPADnet relies
   on standard CMOS technology, therefore allowing for MRI compatibility.
   SPADnet innovates in several areas of PET systems, from optical coupling
   to single-photon sensor architectures, from intelligent ring networks to
   reconstruction algorithms. It is built around a natively digital,
   intelligent SPAD (Single-Photon Avalanche Diode)-based sensor device
   which comprises an array of 8x16 pixels, each composed of 4 mini-SiPMs
   with in situ time-to-digital conversion, a multi-ring network to filter,
   carry, and process data produced by the sensors at 2Gbps, and a 130nm
   CMOS process enabling mass-production of photonic modules that are
   optically interfaced to scintillator crystals. A few tens of sensor
   devices are tightly abutted on a single PCB to form a so-called sensor
   tile, thanks to TSV (Through Silicon Via) connections to their backside
   (replacing conventional wire bonding). The sensor tile is in turn
   interfaced to an FPGA-based PCB on its back. The resulting photonic
   module acts as an autonomous sensing and computing unit, individually
   detecting gamma photons as well as thermal and Compton events. It
   determines in real time basic information for each scintillation event,
   such as exact time of arrival, position and energy, and communicates it
   to its peers in the field of view. Coincidence detection does therefore
   occur directly in the ring itself, in a differed and distributed manner
   to ensure scalability. The selected true coincidence events are then
   collected by a snooper module, from which they are transferred to an
   external reconstruction computer using Gigabit Ethernet.
   We will detail the SPADnet core technologies as well as the latest
   project achievements in all project areas.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, several mobile devices with excellent performances have
   become accessible to people at affordable prices. The availability of
   this type of equipment, especially in the mobile sector, has encouraged
   research and development of increasingly complex applications
   ({''}Apps{''}) that require visualization of large-scale scene. However,
   large-scale 3D maps typically available through mobile version of
   so-called ``spinning globes{''} do not allow the use of high definition
   data, due to their hardware limitations. This kind of lack should not be
   considered as a limitation, but as an opportunity: there are a lot of
   possibilities, especially in the tourism domain, where it is not
   required to construct wide 3D environment. Instead only a little portion
   of a specific territory using high quality spatial data over high
   fidelity three dimensional geometry models of the environment is
   sufficient. A simple example of this domain could be the representation
   of a Mediterranean island: these islands are generally small, numerous,
   lacking infrastructure whilst impacted by seasonal tourism, being far
   from the definition of smart cities. The infrastructure of future cities
   needs to support vibrant, innovative and entrepreneurial communities
   such as the community of an island that takes advantage of the digital
   environment and realize their potential to become ``smarter{''}. In this
   context, this document presents the SMART-ISLANDS framework: a set of
   mobile and desktop applications for the seasonal tourism support, public
   sector and administration, private sector and university focused on the
   contest of the Mediterranean islands, using high fidelity 3D model for
   the environment representation and geographic information aiming at
   leveraging the concepts of smart-cities on the island context. After the
   presentation of the application, a study will be conducted to
   investigate how the user experience and usability will change if the
   same application is executed as an applet, using a custom web browser,
   or on a mobile device as an application, changing the input device
   (mouse and gestures). Results, obtained by using ISO 9241 guidelines
   will be analysed, summarized and commented.}},

Abstract = {{The industry of digital games is marked by innovation. Currently,
   augmented reality has been added to those games, to provide new
   experiences for players. However, those efforts have been focused on
   attracting players based on novelty devices. Digital games seem to have
   high potential for realizing novel interactive narratives. At the same
   time, there has been some academic discussion about narratives in
   augmented reality. In this paper, we discuss some relationships between
   interactive narratives, digital games and augmented reality. We then
   propose an approach and a specific technology setup for exploring
   augmented reality games as providers for innovative interactive
   narratives. In this augmented game space, new technology and devices are
   not the focus but rather the means for the realization of new
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Physical Optics Corporation (POC) developed the body-worn Integrated
   Soldier Power and Data System (ISPDS), a configurable node for plug-in
   wired or wireless server/client or peer-to-peer computing with
   accommodations for power, sensor I/O interfaces, and energy harvesting.
   The enabling technology increases the efficacy of uniformed personnel
   and first responders and provides an option for reducing force structure
   associated with the need for hardware network infrastructure to enable a
   mobile digital communications architecture for dismounted troops. The
   ISPDS system addresses the DoD's need for an ``intelligent{''} power
   control system in an effort to increase mission duration and maximize
   the first responders and warfighter's effectiveness without concern for
   the available energy resources (i.e., batteries). ISPDS maximizes
   durability and survivability, assesses influences that affect
   performance, and provides the network backbone and mobile node hardware.
   POC is producing two vest-integrated variants, one each for the U. S.
   Army PEO Ground Soldier and the Air Soldier, with each including
   state-of-the-art low-profile and robust wearable connectors, cabling,
   and harnesses, and an integrated low-profile power manager and conformal
   battery for data and power distribution. The innovative intelligent
   power controller (IPC), in the form of the ISPDS firmware and power
   sensing and control electronics, will enable ISPDS to optimize power
   levels both automatically and in accordance with manually set
   preferences. The IPC module is power dense and efficient, and adaptively
   provides lossless transfer of available harvested photovoltaic energy to
   the battery. The integrated systems were tested for suitable electrical,
   electromagnetic interference (EMI), and environmental performance as
   outlined in military standards such as MIL-STD-810G and MIL STD-461F.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the opportunity to introduce ``Not strictly TEM
   waves{''} Synthetic detection Method (NTSM), consisting in a Three Axis
   Digital Beam Processing (3ADBP), to enhance the performances of radio
   telescope and sensor systems. Current Radio Telescopes generally use the
   classic 3D ``TEM waves{''} approximation Detection Method, which
   consists in a linear tomography process (Single or Dual axis beam
   forming processing) neglecting the small z component. The Synthetic FEED
   ARRAY three axis Sensor SYSTEM is an innovative technique using a
   synthetic detection of the generic ``NOT strictly TEM Waves radiation
   coming from the Cosmo, which processes longitudinal component of Angular
   Momentum too. Than the simultaneous extraction from radiation of both
   the linear and quadratic information component, may reduce the
   complexity to reconstruct the Early Universe in the different requested
   scales. This next order approximation detection of the observed
   cosmologic processes, may improve the efficacy of the statistical
   numerical model used to elaborate the same information acquired.
   The present work focuses on detection of such waves at carrier
   frequencies in the bands ranging from LF to MMW. The work shows in
   further detail the new generation of on line programmable and
   reconfigurable Mixed Signal ASIC technology that made possible the
   innovative Synthetic Sensor. Furthermore the paper shows the ability of
   such technique to increase the Radio Telescope Array Antenna
   performances.}},

Abstract = {{Phase-based approaches can revolutionize X-ray imaging and remove its
   main limitation: poor image contrast arising from low attenuation
   differences. They exploit the unit decrement of the real part of the
   refractive index, typically 1000 times larger than the imaginary part
   driving attenuation. This increases the contrast of all details, and
   enables the detection of features classically considered ``X-ray
   invisible{''}. Following pioneering experiments dating back to the
   mid-sixties, X-ray phase contrast imaging ``exploded{''} in the
   mid-nineties, when third generation synchrotron sources became more
   widely available. Applications were proposed in fields as diverse as
   material science, palaeontology, biology, food science, cultural
   heritage preservation, and many others. Among these applications,
   medicine has been constantly considered the most important; among
   medical applications, mammography is arguably the one that attracted
   most attention. Applications to mammography were pioneered by the SYRMEP
   (SYnchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics) group in Trieste, which was
   already active in the area through a combination of innovative ways to
   do imaging at synchrotrons and development of novel X-ray detectors.
   This pioneering phase led to the only clinical experience of phase
   contrast mammography on human patients, and spawned a number of ideas as
   to how these advances could be translated into clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{The Project focuses on the resolution of decreased water supply as a
   result of continued water shortage. The water loss is the result of
   several causes, notably water losses in the water supply network pipes,
   the ineffective operation of pumping stations and design of the networks
   are some of the most important problems which need to be addressed to
   optimize the performance of the water networks and save both water and
   the energy consumed. The Project is innovative as it is the first time
   that several, state-of-the-art technologies, including Global
   Positioning System (GPS), Radar Scanners and Satellite Remote Sensing
   (SRS) will be combined to map the water networks. The data produced will
   be entered into a Geographic Information System (GIS), with the
   objective of developing a digital imprint and mapping of the network.
   Following, a representative section of the network will be selected and
   modeled in the new upgraded laboratory in order to conduct detailed
   experimental studies, which will be correlated with
   computational/mathematical studies. The main scientific challenge of the
   Project, which also characterizes its broader innovative aspect, lies in
   the possibility to optimize the design and also the operation of all the
   components of the network, through the combined use of hydraulic
   simulation models and multi-criteria evolution algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The beam from a laser resonator is determined by the optical elements it
   contains. Most commonly, these consist of two spherical mirrors, but
   phase- and amplitude-modulating elements can also be included to produce
   custom beams. For every custom beam new optics are required, and the
   resonator must be realigned, a process which can take several hours to
   days.
   The digital laser {[}1] is an innovation which allows the laser beam
   produced by a laser to be dynamically controlled by a computer.
   Essentially, one of the resonator mirrors is replaced by a spatial light
   modulator (SLM), which is a computer-controlled, pixellated,
   liquid-crystal device. While the concept is the device is simple, the
   implementation revealed subtle properties of spatial light modulators
   and the liquid crystals contained in them. These properties had to be
   well understood before their undesirable characteristics could be
   overcome, allowing the laser to function as conceived in the design.}},

Abstract = {{In the 21st century, with the advent of ultra high-speed broadband
   networks (1Gb per second), the Internet will offer new opportunities for
   innovators to design qualitative services and applications. Indeed, the
   challenge of such e-services is not only on the technological aspects of
   Internet with new infrastructures and architectures to conceive. The
   reality is also on its human and multimedia content delivery, with
   innovative philosophies of communication to apply in this digital and
   virtual age. In the context of Teaching and Learning as a human-centered
   design approach, we propose a new paradigm for thinking the Web, called
   the Web of Signs, rather than the Web of things. It focuses on the
   process of making knowledge by sharing signs and significations
   (Semiotic Web), more than on knowledge transmission with intelligent
   object representations (Semantic Web). Sign management is the shift of
   paradigm for education with ICT (e-Education) that we have investigated
   in such domains as enhancing natural and cultural heritage. In this
   paper, we will present this concept and illustrate it with two examples
   issued from La Reunion Island projects in instrumental e-Learning
   (@-MUSE) and biodiversity informatics (IKBS). This Sign management
   method was experimented in the frame of our Living Lab in Teaching and
   Learning at University of Reunion Island.}},

Abstract = {{Building energy efficiency technologies have to rely on capable control
   systems. The direct digital control (DDC) and proportional and integral
   (PI) control technologies provide an advanced approach to accomplish the
   complex controls of temperature, pressure and flow in the building
   chilled water systems. However, the PI controls are developed for
   linear, time-invariant systems. Since the chilled water systems are
   highly non-linear dynamic systems, a fine tuned PID control may become
   unstable when system loads change. The unstable control system will
   degrade the chilled water system energy and thermal performance and also
   reduce the control system life span. Therefore, superior control is
   required at the primary system level to link the control of the primary
   system with the nonlinearities of the secondary system. The conventional
   approach is to design special control valves to compensate nonlinear
   chilled water systems. Unfortunately the dynamic characteristics of HVAC
   systems cannot be compensated by the control valves with fixed
   characteristics. This paper presents the theoretical model and
   simulation on traditional control methods and an innovative integrated
   control linearization approach. The model integrates the primary chilled
   water pump head and water loop differential pressure under differing
   load distributions. Characterization of the secondary system was
   conducted through theoretical modeling and simulation to reveal the key
   control characteristics and the impacts of such characteristics on the
   control and energy performance of the integrated system. The study
   concludes that the differential pressure in the primary chilled water
   loop substantially impacts the control performance and stability of the
   secondary system. The nonlinear characteristics can be dynamically
   reduced through an integrated approach, resetting the water supply
   temperature and pressure control.}},

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{70}},

Pages = {{865-870}},
Abstract = {{We present a methodological example for quantifying the contributions of
   riverine total nitrogen (TN) from point, direct runoff and base flow
   sources by combining a recursive digital filter technique and
   statistical methods. First, we separated daily riverine flow into direct
   runoff and base flow using a recursive digital filter technique; then, a
   statistical model was established using daily simultaneous data for TN
   load, direct runoff rate, base flow rate, and temperature; and finally,
   the TN loading from direct runoff and base flow sources could be
   inversely estimated. As a case study, this approach was adopted to
   identify the TN source contributions in Changle River, eastern China.
   Results showed that, during 2005-2009, the total annual TN input to the
   river was 1,700.4 +/- 250.2 ton, and the contributions of point, direct
   runoff and base flow sources were 17.8 +/- 2.8\%, 45.0 +/- 3.6\%, and
   37.2 +/- 3.9\%, respectively. The innovation of the approach is that the
   nitrogen from direct runoff and base flow sources could be separately
   quantified. The approach is simple but detailed enough to take the major
   factors into account, providing an effective and reliable method for
   riverine nitrogen loading estimation and source apportionment.}},

   explores the relationship between early studios and the training of

   the 1950s, and the challenges created by nationalisation after 1963.
   Using extensive interviews with local photographers and archival

   term. In doing so, it argues that recent developments using digital
   media are part of a much longer tradition of local technical innovation
   than is usually considered the case.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with a description of the way in which a
   particular group of marginalized peoples in Palestine are using digital
   network technologies as part of a campaign of non-violent resistance to
   their conditions. It is an engaging story of what is a case study in the
   way communications technologies are becoming part of broader struggles
   for liberation not just in the `connected' centres, but also in more
   isolated areas. The aims of the international empowerment project called
   `Nonviolence 2.0' are to serve as a forum for developing peace,
   understanding and tolerance between groups engaged in a long and ongoing
   conflict. What is significant in it is the use of personal narratives
   that humanize both sides of the conflict, as well as of mobile
   technologies to record and reflect conflict by general citizens. The
   paper deploys some theoretical constructs (such as imagination actions)
   to frame its - purposefully in large parts rather descriptive than
   analytic - presentation of this ongoing project.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations in digital cultural communication for museums challenge us
   to develop appropriate methods for participation in curatorial processes
   and to rethink the role of audiences inside exhibitions. The article
   explores the potentials of scaffolding sites of dialogue and creative
   engagement through the design process and final exhibition. It draws
   upon experiences from an interactive exhibition project, Digital
   Natives, in which we combined principles from Participatory Design with
   issues of contemporary digital culture to explore possibilities for
   creating heritage innovation. We suggest three critical stages of the
   dialogic design process in which engagement between stakeholders,
   researchers, and audiences can be central to shaping and transforming
   future conceptions of digital cultural heritage, through process and
   final exhibition. In this way, we argue that a participatory design
   anthropological approach to digital culture can expand opportunities for
   heritage innovation through technological means of engagement in
   museums.}},

Abstract = {{The digitization project of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) was initiated as
   part of the Israel Antiquities Authority's (IAA) conservation efforts to
   preserve them for future generations. From the time of their discovery
   by a Bedouin shepherd in 1947, until the establishment of the IAA's
   unique conservation lab dedicated solely to the conservation and
   preservation of the scrolls in 1991, the scrolls were heavily damaged by
   the ravages of time, as well as previous handling and treatment. The
   task of conservation and preservation of the scrolls continues to be an
   ongoing mission due to their extreme fragility and the need to make use
   of the most up-to- date conservation methods known worldwide. We have
   been following a protocol drawn together with world experts, but since
   we have been practicing for about 20 years we decided it is time to
   reassess our work, and address unsolved issues. The idea to use spectral
   imaging for monitoring the wellbeing of the scrolls was first suggested
   a few years ago by a scientist from the Weitzman Institute. Eventually
   the project developed into an overall undertaking whereby we mean to
   monitor their physical condition on the one hand, and to expand and
   facilitate access to them, to scholars and the public worldwide, on the
   other. The digitization project will thus sustain the scroll's
   conservation and preservation by creating high-quality spectral images,
   using the most advanced and innovative technologies available. These
   will support and provide active conservation assessments, non-invasive
   testing and monitoring tools, and a better record and documentation of
   the state of the scrolls. Furthermore the IAA has decided to make these
   highest resolution images, accompanied by data including transcriptions,
   translations, commentaries and bibliography available and accessible via
   the Internet to all, as well as to provide for scholarship by supplying
   interactive tools within a supportive research framework. Uploading the
   images and data to the Internet and allowing diverse searches will be
   achieved with the assistance of Google-Israel.}},

Abstract = {{This essay gives an overview of some pertinent digital approaches to the
   research of the Septuagint (LXX), the Greek translation of the Hebrew
   Bible. Taking the pioneering Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint
   Studies (CATSS) project as a point of departure, it aligns each of the
   project's three modules to a seminal area of LXX research-in turn:
   lexicography, translation technique, and textual criticism. Using
   selected examples of the use of CATSS and comparable resources in LXX
   research and other relevant work, the essay takes advantage of hindsight
   to assess the prospects of digital LXX research in the context of said
   digital approaches. In doing so, the essay looks at two closely
   interrelated issues and asks what methodologically innovative approaches
   are facilitated by the refashioning of the LXX as digital data and,
   conversely, what kind of resources are desirable in order to facilitate
   approaches that cater to the advantages of digital research on the LXX.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction has always been highly valued in education, especially in
   distance education (Moore, 1989; Anderson, 2003; Chen, 2004a; Woo \&
   Reeves, 2007; Wang, 2013; Conrad, in press). It has been associated with
   motivation (Mahle, 2011; Wen-chi, et al., 2011), persistence (Tello,
   2007; Joo, Lim, \& Kim, 2011), deep learning (Offir, et al., 2008) and
   other components of effective learning. With the development of
   interactive technologies, and related connectivism learning theories
   (Siemens, 2005a; Downes, 2005), interaction theory has expanded to
   include interactions not only with human actors, but also with machines
   and digital artifacts. This paper explores the characteristics and
   principles of connectivist learning in an increasingly open and
   connected age. A theory building methodology is used to create a new
   theoretical model which we hope can be used by researchers and
   practitioners to examine and support multiple types of effective
   educational interactions. Inspired by the hierarchical model for
   instructional interaction (HMII) (Chen, 2004b) in distance learning, a
   framework for interaction and cognitive engagement in connectivist
   learning contexts has been constructed. Based on cognitive engagement
   theories, the interaction of connectivist learning is divided into four
   levels: operation interaction, wayfinding interaction, sensemaking
   interaction, and innovation interaction. Connectivist learning is thus a
   networking and recursive process of these four levels of interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Based on qualitative interviews with online media professionals
   conducted in several Spanish online newsrooms, this article explores the
   ethical issues that are debated by digital journalists, following the
   implementation of convergence and multiplatform production. Through the
   journalists' perceptions about the challenges of convergence and the
   demands of online news production, the main areas of ethical conflicts
   are examined. Building on Alasdair MacIntyre's theory about communities
   of practice, I argue that the standards and practices currently being
   developed in online newsrooms provide a valid framework for ethical
   decision making. Finally, the premises for constructing online
   journalism ethics in these communities of practice are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations in information and communication technologies have allowed
   people to actively author multimodal content and engage in new
   meaning-making practices. New Literacies research has gone some way to
   understanding new meaning-making behaviours. However, this research
   often derives its understandings from studies undertaken with students
   enrolled in formal educational settings. Mobile technologies are
   increasingly situated outside such domains; the informal use of these
   devices by adults remains on the periphery of scholarly focus. mStories
   is a creative participatory digital mobile storytelling project. Taking
   a multidimensional perspective, this article presents the in-depth case
   analysis of one participant and their mStory. A semiotic analysis found
   that the user-generated content demonstrated complex and sophisticated
   multimodal sense relations. However, control over the textual or
   compositional meta-function of the text was determined largely by the
   computer interface, with users habituated to relinquishing authorial
   control over this element. Within this study, mobile literacy praxis was
   characteristically ad hoc and contextually embedded, and though mobile
   technology invites such practices, users were neither determined nor
   limited by this, and happily turned to other devices where necessary.}},

   failure criteria for combined loading including residual stress,
   interface delamination, cracking and fatigue issues. So, the thermal
   expansion mismatch between copper and silicon leads to a stress
   situation in silicon surrounding the TSVs which is influencing the
   electron mobility and as a result the transient behavior of transistors.
   Furthermore, pumping and protrusion of copper is a challenge for
   Back-end of Line (BEoL) layers of advanced CMOS technologies already
   during manufacturing. These effects depend highly on the temperature
   dependent elastic-plastic behavior of the TSV-copper and the residual
   stresses determined by the electro deposition chemistry and annealing
   conditions. That's why the authors pushed combined
   simulative/experimental approaches to extract the Young's-modulus,
   initial yield stress and hardening coefficients in copper-TSVs from
   nanoindentation experiments, as well as the temperature dependent
   initial yield stress and hardening coefficients from bow measurements
   due to electroplated thin copper films on silicon under thermal cycling
   conditions. A FIB trench technique combined with digital image
   correlation is furthermore used to capture the residual stress state
   near the surface of TSVs. The extracted properties are discussed and
   used accordingly to investigate the pumping and protrusion of
   copper-TSVs during thermal cycling. Moreover, the cracking and
   delamination risks caused by the elevated temperature variation during
   BEoL ILD deposition are investigated with the help of fracture mechanics
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative sound transmission system which transmits sound wirelessly
   to ears without making any other noise outside is suggested. The system
   utilizes the human body as a sound transmission medium. The human body
   is a nonlinear medium and the nonlinear characteristic is the basis of
   the theorem for the system. When two ultrasonic waves with different
   frequencies are transmitted into the body, the difference frequency
   signal between the two original ultrasonic waves is generated during the
   propagation process and audible to a user. In this paper, single
   sideband amplitude modulation (SSB AM) method is used as a modulation
   scheme. SSB AM method can minimize the noise which occurs in the process
   of generating audible sound. To make a SSB AM modulator with a higher
   degree of accuracy, digital weaver modulation (DWM) method is adopted.
   DWM method enables a sharp cutoff filter to be implemented without
   increasing computational complexity in the DSP. An Equalizer filter
   which compensates the distortions in the ultrasonic transducer is also
   designed. The developed system was evaluated with a loaf of beef instead
   of the human body, and generation of full-bandwidth music sound in the
   beef was demonstrated. If the proposed system is applied to the human
   body, sound transmission may be possible without cable line required in
   conventional earphones.}},

Abstract = {{The aerodynamic roughness is one of the major parameters in describing
   the turbulent exchange process between terrestrial and atmosphere.
   Remote Sensing is recognized as an effective way to inverse this
   parameter at the regional scale. However, in the long time the inversion
   method is either dependent on the lookup table for different land covers
   or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) factor only, which
   plays a very limited role in describing the spatial heterogeneity of
   this parameter and the evapotranspiration (ET) for different land
   covers. In fact, the aerodynamic roughness is influenced by different
   factors at the same time, including the roughness unit for hard
   surfaces, the vegetation dynamic growth and the undulating terrain.
   Therefore, this paper aims at developing an innovative aerodynamic
   roughness inversion method based on multi-source remote sensing data in
   a semiarid region, within the upper and middle reaches of Heihe River
   Basin. The radar backscattering coefficient was used to inverse the
   micro-relief of the hard surface. The NDVI was utilized to reflect the
   dynamic change of vegetated surface Finally, the slope extracted from
   SRTM DEM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model) was
   used to correct terrain influence. The inversed aerodynamic roughness
   was imported into ETWatch system to validate the availability. The
   inversed and tested results show it plays a significant role in
   improving the spatial heterogeneity of the aerodynamic roughness and
   related ET for the experimental site.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to document the development path
   of a specific concept during its first 20 years.
   Design/methodology/approach - Evidence was extracted of the
   citation-counts of relevant articles, uses of the term in other articles
   that do not cite the original articles, and uses of terms with similar
   meanings. Examination of the data took into account insights from
   epidemiology, memetics and diffusion of innovations theory.
   Findings - The concept has had insufficient impact to overcome the
   weaknesses in theory and practice that it was intended to address. It
   has lacked champions. It has proven to be sufficiently fit to survive,
   but not to flourish.
   Research limitations/implications - Google Scholar has a wide catchment
   area, and hence provides a basis for tracking the path of development of
   new ideas. However, the tools remain fairly blunt, and do not, for
   example, enable efficient extraction of patterns of citation over time,
   or the nature of the uses made of terms by the citing articles.
   Practical implications - Neologisms take on a life of their own, losing
   the associations that they were intended to have with other ideas, and
   shedding their embedment in a body of theory. For a new term to
   successfully project a meme, its proponent must enthuse a critical mass
   of early adopters to apply it, and to generate a further round of
   adopters.
   Originality/value - Concepts are seldom tracked over time. This paper
   shows that a new term and its associated body of theory require more
   than publications in top-level journals if they are to have significant
   impacts on academic research and industry practice.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is the first systematic attempt to examine the role of
   time constraints in journalists' daily routines and practices, at the
   level of individual news items. Long-standing concerns about
   journalism's stopwatch culture and the negative impact of time pressures
   on newswork have been exacerbated in the digital age by growing demands
   for multi-platform technological proficiency, resulting in
   hamsterization of journalistic work. Through the step-by-step
   reconstruction of work processes underlying over a thousand discrete
   news items (N = 1023), this study traces statistical correlations
   between the amount of time at the reporters' disposal and the extent and
   complexity of journalistic work, across Israeli television, radio, print
   and online news outlets, outlining the implications of three temporal
   segments (pre-assignment, work duration, filing-to-publication) for all
   four media types. Consistent with the received wisdom among scholars we
   found, inter alia, that in cases of time shortage, newswork contained
   systematically less diversity and cross-checking, greater involvement of
   public relations, fewer senior sources and ordinary citizens, and fewer
   leaks. We conceptualize the reporters' time schedule as a
   meta-constraint, embodying developments such as dwindling workforce,
   homogenization of news content across media, and technological
   innovations which cause both necessary and unnecessary accelerations in
   news production.}},

Title = {{Semantic ontologies for multimedia indexing (SOMI) Application in the
   e-library domain}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{206-218}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The overwhelming speed and scale of digital media production
   greatly outpace conventional indexing methods by humans. The management
   of Big Data for e-library speech resources requires an automated
   metadata solution. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model called semantic
   ontologies for multimedia indexing (SOMI) allows for assembly of the
   speech objects, encapsulation of semantic associations between phonic
   units and the definition of indexing techniques designed to invoke and
   maximize the semantic ontologies for indexing. A literature review and
   architectural overview are followed by evaluation techniques and a
   conclusion.
   Findings - This approach is only possible because of recent innovations
   in automated speech recognition. The introduction of semantic keyword
   spotting allows for indexing models that disambiguate and prioritize
   meaning using probability algorithms within a word confusion network. By
   the use of AI error-training procedures, optimization is sought for each
   index item.
   Research limitations/implications - Validation and implementation of
   this approach within the field of digital libraries still remain under
   development, but rapid developments in technology and research show rich
   conceptual promise for automated speech indexing.
   Practical implications - The SOMI process has been preliminarily tested,
   showing that hybrid semantic-ontological approaches produce better
   accuracy than semantic automation alone.
   Social implications - Even as testing proceeds on recorded conference
   talks at the University of Tebessa (Algeria), other digital archives can
   look toward similar indexing. This will mean greater access to sound
   file metadata.
   Originality/value - Huge masses of spoken data, unmanageable for a human
   indexer, can prospectively find semantically sorted and prioritized
   indexing - not transcription, but generated metadata - automatically,
   quickly and accurately.}},

Pages = {{318-335}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the organizational and
   technological processes and strategic choices that led to the successful
   digitization project of the Albert Einstein Archives.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study of the major
   challenges that were associated with the project. These include: the
   integration of the archives in the academic environment; the management
   of a project of such magnitude within the university organization and
   between different stakeholders and the technological aspects of the
   project and user experience.
   Findings - A digitization project requires not only the archival staff
   expertise but also information specialists, IT staff, analysts and
   usually the digitization staff for processing the archival material.
   Finding the common language between all the professionals involved as
   well as building a good strategic plan are the keys to a successful
   project.
   Research limitations/implications - The planning and implementation of
   such a project requires a significant budget, manpower project
   management, hardware, software and intra-and inter-organizational
   cooperation and coordination.
   Originality/value - The phenomenon of digitizing unique and exclusive
   archival data by universities is becoming an innovative contribution of
   hidden goods to the public at large. This paper offers strategic
   insights for the planning of similar digitizing projects, particularly
   in an academic environment.}},

   library? A social network approach}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{529-545}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Based on the social capital theory, the authors assume that
   personal and professional experts are both relevant to people's
   competence development. However, to date, there is little empirical
   evidence of how professional experts can support, or impede, people in
   learning how to deal with social media. The purpose of this paper is to
   examine the role and position of social media experts in the
   distribution of information on social media within the library as
   organization.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws upon social network and
   qualitative methods, within three public libraries located in Belgium.
   Findings - The findings suggest that as the most central actors, social
   media experts in a library play a significant role in either supporting
   or constraining the distribution of information on social media.
   Research limitations/implications - While the sample size was chosen to
   conduct a mixed methods study that would explore how the position of a
   social media expert in an organization such as the library facilitates
   or prevents the exchange of social media information, the authors
   acknowledge the need for large-scale empirical studies that can
   substantiate the findings in larger and more diverse samples.
   Originality/value - This unique study explores how the role and position
   social media experts in Belgian public libraries can support, or impede,
   librarians in learning how to deal with social media. This study is
   useful for other public libraries who want to implement social media,
   establish a social media policy and/or provide social media training.}},

Title = {{Digital manufacturing-driven transformations of service supply chains
   for complex products}},
Journal = {{SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{421-430}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the forms that
   combinations of digital manufacturing, logistics and equipment use are
   likely to take and how these novel combinations may affect the
   relationship among logistics service providers (LSPs), users and
   manufacturers of equipment.
   Design/methodology/approach - Brian Arthur's theory of combinatorial
   technological evolution is applied to examine possible digital
   manufacturing-driven transformations. The F-18 Super Hornet is used as
   an illustrative example of a service supply chain for a complex product.
   Findings - The introduction of digital manufacturing will likely result
   in hybrid solutions, combining conventional logistics, digital
   manufacturing and user operations. Direct benefits can be identified in
   the forms of life cycle extension and the increased availability of
   parts in challenging locations. Furthermore, there are also
   opportunities for both equipment manufacturers and LSPs to adopt new
   roles, thereby supporting the efficient and sustainable use of digital
   manufacturing.
   Research limitations/implications - The phenomenon of digital
   manufacturing-driven transformations of service supply chains for
   complex product does not yet fully exist in the real world, and its
   study requires cross-disciplinary collaboration. Thus, the implication
   for research is to use a design science approach for early-stage
   explorative research on the form and function of novel combinations.
   Practical implications - Digital manufacturing as a general-purpose
   technology gives LSPs an opportunity to consolidate demand from initial
   users and incrementally deploy capacity closer to new users.
   Reengineering the products that a manufacture currently uses is needed
   to increase the utilization of digital manufacturing.
   Originality/value - The authors outline a typology of digital
   manufacturing-driven transformations and identify propositions to be
   explored in further research and practice.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to assess the effectiveness of social media to enhance
   teaching and learning in a team-based learning environment involving
   large classes. The use of digital technology via Facebook, enhanced
   team-based learning outside the classroom, complementing face-to-face
   lessons. Students were also exposed to several student-centered learning
   mechanisms including poster presentations and expert forums in an effort
   to provide them with a more holistic learning experience. The
   theoretical framework of the study is based on the educational theories
   of constructivism and social learning. The students' learning experience
   and motivation was assessed through content analysis of their reflective
   portfolios and their Facebook postings. The results clearly showed the
   positive impact that team-based strategy had on the students' learning
   experience and motivation. Facebook was indeed perceived as an
   innovative and effective tool in a student-centered learning environment
   that enriched students' educational experiences, increasing the
   relevance of the subject matter and encouraging students to collaborate
   effectively with their peers and faculty. From the perspective of the
   educator, the use of Facebook in a team-based pedagogy setting
   significantly enhanced the teaching and learning process as it allowed
   the educator to tap into the digital learning styles of the students and
   provided innovative ways of involving and motivating students in the
   learning process. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, highway bridge conditions have been monitored by visual
   inspection with structural deficiencies being manually identified and
   classified by qualified engineers and inspectors. The need for safer and
   more objective inspection methods calls for new innovations in bridge
   inspection technologies. One of major toll road operators in Japan has
   been working to develop efficient non-destructive highway bridge
   inspection methods using high quality digital image and Infrared (IR)
   thermography technologies. This paper describes the results of on-site
   applications of above technologies performed in conjunction with the
   joint research with University of Central Florida. In addition, highway
   bridges in Maryland were scanned from both top and underside of the
   beams, contributing significant reduction in on-site inspection time
   compared to the traditional approach. The created crack and delaminated
   area map provided useful information for bridge owners to make a good
   decision on prioritizing the bridge maintenance/rehabilitation projects.}},

   Technologies for Mass Storage Applications}},
Journal = {{CURRENT NANOSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{The global digital data has increased at an unprecedented rate during
   the last decade due to the digitization service of every industry as
   well as the rapid development of information technology. It is therefore
   timely to enhance the areal density of the mainstream storage devices in
   order to meet the current storage demand. In this paper, the development
   history of three major families of storage devices that consist of
   magnetic hard disk, magnetic tape, and optical disc has been reviewed
   associated with their respective strength and weakness when utilized for
   mass storage applications. Several emerging technologies that are likely
   to expand the areal density of the conventional recording forms beyond
   the physical limits are subsequently discussed in each case. The
   perspectives of these three devices used as next generation data storage
   memory are also compared with each other in terms of the areal density
   roadmap. According to the comparison, hard disk that is dominating the
   current mass storage market will still be the favorite candidate for
   next-generation storage device due to its ultra-high capacity and low
   cost, particularly with the help of several advanced technologies such
   as heat assisted magnetic recording and bit patterned media. In spite of
   much lower capacity than hard disk today, magnetic tape has exhibited an
   ample margin for booming the storage capacity, and its high stability
   and flexible removability render it a promising contender for data
   backup application. The prospect of optical disc seems to be somewhat
   pessimistic because of the rather slow progress on its capacity and the
   fairly high cost per GB. It is likely that optical disc will be
   superseded by the mass storage devices provided that no more innovative
   technologies than near-field recording and holographic storage emerge in
   the future. However, the potential merits of optical disc like long life
   time and portability may offer optical disc a new application that
   stores important data securely for long term such as official document
   and government legislation.}},

Abstract = {{Crowds and clouds contribute to what many consider to be the next big
   thing, as they support the analysis of big data, and their combination
   is itself an answer to how big data challenges current computing
   infrastructures. Once understood from the perspective of crowds and
   clouds, big data or big content becomes one of the main drivers for the
   change we are describing. Digital ecosystems are, in many ways, set up
   to deal with big data and make it work as an economic force for change.
   This chapter first attempts to define big data from its use. Big data is
   much older than current debates might suggest. Science data has been big
   for a long time and has also driven the innovation of new ecosystems
   that could make this big data work. Today, many big data challenges are
   still driven by the demands of extreme science, but also by other big
   data organisations in business and government. The chapter investigates
   mainly social media applications and some of the current limitations of
   applying big data analytics here, before concluding with some critical
   remarks regarding the Big Brother potential behind big data.}},

Abstract = {{Biometric technology deals with recognizing the uniqueness of
   individuals based on their exclusive Physical or behavioral
   characteristics. The developments in science \& technology have made it
   possible to use biometrics in application when it is required to
   establish (or) confirm the identity of persons. Amongst a range of
   method, Iris recognition is a hastily intensifying technique of
   biometric technology. A large range of identification methods is used
   either verify or decide the identity of person request their processes,
   This Paper provides the inspiration for image acquisition, segmentation,
   normalization standed on the human being Iris imaging. A combination
   method is used to fragment the eye's digital image. The mined Iris
   region was then standardized by using Image registration method. A phase
   correlation method is installed for this Iris image registration
   principle. Investigational consequences demonstrate that our system is
   reasonably efficient and gives hopeful performance.}},

Abstract = {{Comfort and safety of railway transport has become more important as
   train speeds continue to increase. In electrified railways, the
   electrical current of the train is produced by the sliding contact
   between the pantograph and catenary. The quality of the current depends
   on the reliability of contact between the pantograph and catenary. So,
   pantograph inspection is very important task in electrified railways and
   it is periodically made for preventing dangerous situations. This
   inspection is operated manually by taking the pantograph to the service
   for visual anomalies. However, this monitoring is impractical because of
   time consuming and slowness, as locomotive remains disabled. An
   innovative method based on image processing and pattern recognition is
   proposed in this paper for online monitoring of the catenary-pantograph
   interaction. The images are acquired from a digital line-scan camera.
   Data are simultaneously processed according to edge detection and Hough
   transform, and then the obtained features are provided to a D-Markov
   based state machine, and the pantograph related faults, such as
   overheating of the pantograph strip, bursts of arcing, and irregular
   positioning of the contact line are diagnosed. The proposed method is
   verified by real faulty and healthy pantograph videos.}},

Pages = {{559-572}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse and assess a
   government support programme for business innovation in a very
   peripherical European region: the Spanish region of Andalucia.
   Design/methodology/approach - Endogenous development approach is used to
   categorize the main public and private actions included in the
   government ICT support programme. Cross-time analysis has been carried
   out by using three territorial indicators of diffusion and effective use
   of ICT: the physical aspect, refereed to the infrastructures used as a
   base for the information society development (infrastructures,
   technology and equipment); the actors and their degree of organization
   (firms present on the internet and support organizations and
   institutions); and knowledge, refereed to the technological sprawl and
   the entrepreneurship capacity (fostering innovation and training among
   the general population and businesses).
   Findings - The study confirms that the public policies implemented are
   coherent with the endogenous development approach, where investment in
   physical and human capital have been accompanied by enabling measures of
   interaction between firms and other economical agents (universities,
   business associations, business centres and technology institutes,
   etc.), with a view to favouring the dissemination of innovations and
   knowledge among firms. Secondly, the research assess the impact of this
   ICT programme, both in terms of economic growth and per capita income,
   as well as on the main variables that reflect the degree of business
   participation in the Information Society. Results show that, during the
   period 1996-2010, this region has made important progress in terms of
   convergence with more advanced European regions.
   Research limitations/implications - The study has methodological
   implications in terms of designs of further ICT programmes in less
   developed European regions to broke the digital divide.
   Practical implications - Recent outlooks of the OECD call for more
   assessment research on ICT national and regional policies around the
   world, especially those that prove that it is possible to broke the
   international digital divide. The present study suggests that public
   policies following the directives laid down by the endogenous
   development approach can reach this economic and social target. The
   Andalucia Information Society Programme constitutes a real commitment
   and private-public partnership towards a structural change in the
   technological culture amongst businesses. Investment in physical capital
   and human capital has been accompanied by measures that enable the
   interaction of firms with other economic agents (university, business
   associations, technology centres, etc.), with a view to favouring the
   dissemination of innovation and knowledge among firms.
   Originality/value - The study uses for the first time the endogenous
   development approach applied to a less advanced region for evaluation of
   ICT policy and it improves a methodology based on this approach to
   assess its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current role of
   qualitative research in the analysis of the relations between brands and
   consumers in new market spaces, with particular reference to how it can
   be enhanced with quantitative techniques to study interactions in online
   communities.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews key scientific
   contributions in the area of qualitative marketing research. Drawing
   from this theoretical background, the authors then propose the
   integration of digital ethnography (a qualitative approach) with
   quantitative text mining as an innovative approach to gain insights into
   perceptions of brand associations among online consumers.
   Findings - The paper contributes to a greater awareness of both
   limitations and new perspectives in relation to qualitative market
   research, while suggesting innovative paths for future research.
   Practical implications - The new methodological approach described can
   be used to better understand brand knowledge based on consumer brand
   associations. These insights can then be applied towards developing and
   implementing effective branding strategies.
   Originality/value - The authors propose an interdisciplinary methodology
   to study consumer behaviour in online communities which incorporates
   digital ethnography and computer-assisted textual analysis. Particularly
   the latter technique (borrowed from the field of linguistics) has not
   yet been exploited extensively in marketing research, but is capable of
   offering new types of knowledge with important implications for
   strategic brand management.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional printing of freeform helical microstructures: a review}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{10470-10485}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a fabrication method that enables
   creation of structures from digital models. Among the different
   structures fabricated by 3D printing methods, helical microstructures
   attracted the attention of the researchers due to their potential in
   different fields such as MEMS, lab-on-a-chip systems, microelectronics
   and telecommunications. Here we review different types of 3D printing
   methods capable of fabricating 3D freeform helical microstructures. The
   techniques including two more common microfabrication methods (i.e.,
   focused ion beam chemical vapour deposition and microstereolithography)
   and also five methods based on computer-controlled robotic direct
   deposition of ink filament (i.e., fused deposition modeling,
   meniscus-confined electrodeposition, conformal printing on a rotating
   mandrel, UV-assisted and solvent-cast 3D printings) and their advantages
   and disadvantages regarding their utilization for the fabrication of
   helical microstructures are discussed. Focused ion beam chemical vapour
   deposition and microstereolithography techniques enable the fabrication
   of very precise shapes with a resolution down to similar to 100 nm.
   However, these techniques may have material constraints (e. g., low
   viscosity) and/or may need special process conditions (e. g., vacuum
   chamber) and expensive equipment. The five other techniques based on
   robotic extrusion of materials through a nozzle are relatively
   cost-effective, however show lower resolution and less precise features.
   The popular fused deposition modeling method offers a wide variety of
   printable materials but the helical microstructures manufactured
   featured a less precise geometry compared to the other printing methods
   discussed in this review. The UV-assisted and the solvent-cast 3D
   printing methods both demonstrated high performance for the printing of
   3D freeform structures such as the helix shape. However, the compatible
   materials used in these methods were limited to UV-curable polymers and
   polylactic acid (PLA), respectively. Meniscus-confined electrodeposition
   is a flexible, low cost technique that is capable of fabricating 3D
   structures both in nano-and microscales including freeform helical
   microstructures (down to few microns) under room conditions using
   metals. However, the metals suitable for this technique are limited to
   those that can be electrochemically deposited with the use of an
   electrolyte solution. The highest precision on the helix geometry was
   achieved using the conformal printing on a rotating mandrel. This method
   offers the lowest shape deformation after printing but requires more
   tools (e. g., mandrel, motor) and the printed structure must be
   separated from the mandrel. Helical microstructures made of
   multifunctional materials (e. g., carbon nanotube nanocomposites,
   metallic coated polymer template) were used in different technological
   applications such as strain/load sensors, cell separators and
   micro-antennas. These innovative 3D microsystems exploiting the unique
   helix shape demonstrated their potential for better performance and more
   compact microsystems.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the digital learning technology has evolved from
   E-Learning to M-Learning and U-Learning. However, most of these digital
   learning paradigms do not support the interactive teaching activities in
   class. With NFC (near field communication) technology, the interactions
   between teachers and students can be largely enhanced. In this work, an
   NFC U-learning platform is proposed with four innovative interactive
   teaching scenarios as well as several NFC learning interactive
   functions. Compared to traditional M-Learning or U-Learning models, the
   proposed NFC U-Learning model can enhance the interactive teaching
   activities in class.}},

Title = {{BeamMaker: an open hardware high-resolution digital fabricator for the

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{245-255}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The democratization of invention is a long lasting desire for
   the advancement of society. Having access to education and the means of
   production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this
   goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential
   to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of
   personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a
   reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the
   open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the
   development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these
   points.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed
   a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer
   is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing
   projector. This work details the design process and how improvements
   were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide
   public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list,
   user manual and STL and CAD files.
   Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface
   quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial
   photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a
   sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to
   other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering
   the low cost of the system.
   Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the
   system has not been measured to date. The system requires some
   improvements to produce large objects.
   Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five
   to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers
   available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal
   photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet
   producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues
   for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving
   these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal
   3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into
   the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as
   that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization
   of personal fabrication.
   Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other
   photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the
   authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D
   printer project which uses this technology.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in workflows and techniques for the integration and
   analysis of terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and
   conventional outcrop datasets are demonstrated through three case
   studies. The first study shows the power of three-dimensional (3D) data
   visualization, in association with an innovative surface-modelling
   technique, for establishing large-scale 3D stratigraphical frameworks.
   The second presents an approach to derive reliable geometrical data on
   sediment-body geometries, whereas the third presents a new technique to
   quantify the proportions, distributions and variability of sedimentary
   facies directly from outcrop. In combination, these techniques provide
   essential conditioning data for geocellular and stochastic facies
   modelling. Built upon robust, reproducible and quantitative data, the
   resultant models combine realistic 3D geological architectures with
   sufficient quantities of reliable numerical data required for stable
   statistical analysis and establishing uncertainty. Together this new
   information provides detailed understanding and quantification of the 3D
   complexity of the sedimentary systems in question, thus offering
   insights of value for predicting the subsurface anatomy of analogous
   petroleum systems. As such, use of LiDAR, when combined with
   conventional field geology, offers a powerful tool for quantitative
   outcrop analysis, tightly constraining 3D structural and stratigraphical
   interpretations, and effectively increasing the statistical significance
   of outcrop analogues for reservoir characterization.}},

Pages = {{968-986}},
Abstract = {{Technology probes were used to investigate what adolescents would find
   persuasive in digital devices supporting opportunistic
   (unstructured/unplanned) exercise. The probes comprised pedometers,
   handheld consoles with an exercise game and a customised social website
   with an exercise focus. Three groups of six adolescents participated in
   the field study. To contextualise the study their attitudes to exercise,
   and exercise behaviours, were collected at the start and end of the
   study. The participants logged their daily exercise and noted any
   barriers that they encountered over six weeks. They reflected on these
   experiences and took part in innovation activities to identify
   requirements for motivational exercise technology. Analysis of the
   results revealed that they desired individual customisation of devices
   that can capture a wide range of physical activity data. Moreover,
   social interaction is expected within digital media and positive
   messages reinforcing goal attainments are valued, whereas negative
   feedback demotivates. These findings support those reported in other
   studies of both children and adults. More specific to this age group was
   their openness to sharing information beyond their friendship groups,
   although this was counterbalanced by their lack of autonomy in the
   physical world. This highlights issues that could constrain the
   effective design of technology for this age group.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Although proliferation of mobile services in emerging economies like
   India has made it possible to provide a variety of services such as
   banking, health, education, etc. to low-income segments through mobiles,
   it is challenging to do so. This is due to a variety of factors,
   including low levels of digital infrastructure and literacy and poor
   propensity to pay. On the other hand, these networks offer a mechanism
   to improve this state. Therefore, start-ups that develop contextual
   business model innovations are important. Notwithstanding its
   importance, there is very little work on what factors contribute to
   business model innovation for low-income segments in emerging economies
   in this area. This study contributes to both empirical and theoretical
   knowledge by developing case studies on business model innovations using
   information and communications technology-based services in India. It
   identifies the dimensions of differences between developed countries and
   emerging economies with respect to (1) the factors that contribute to
   information and communications technology-based business model
   innovations for low-income segments and (2) the role of the start-ups in
   this situation. Further, it integrates two existing strands of theory:
   value creation through business model innovation in e-business and
   low-income segments in emerging economies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to compare productivity and technical efficiency (TE)
   between outsourcers and non-outsourcers with an empirical methodology
   that accounts for both heterogeneous production technologies and
   non-random sample separation. Using plant-level data on six two-digit
   manufacturing industries in Taiwan over the period 2002-2005, the
   endogenous switching regression and the stochastic metafrontier
   methodology enable us to generate TE scores that are comparable across
   production units that operate under different technologies without the
   standard assumption in the literature that the outsourcing status is out
   of the control of the plant and that outsourcers and non-outsourcers use
   the same technology. We find that outsourcers are, on average, more
   technically efficient and technologically advanced than non-outsourcers.
   Productivity differences account for the lion's share of the
   outsourcer-non-outsourcer output gap.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, it was examined whether transformative leadership
   influences the use of digital learning materials (DLMs) by teachers in
   their pedagogical practice. Earlier research on DLMs has shown that the
   Integrated Model of Behavior Prediction (IMBP) can be applied to explain
   or predict the intention of teachers to use DLMs. The research also has
   shown that self-efficacy and attitudes and, to a lesser extent,
   perceived subjective norm, influenced the intention to use DLMs. To gain
   more insight into how to promote the use of DLMs, it was examined
   whether school leaders through ICT policy and professionalization
   activities affect self-efficacy, attitude and subjective norm and, thus,
   the (intention) to use these. A questionnaire was administered by
   TNS/NIPO with a response of 543 teachers from primary, secondary and
   vocational education. Two relevant dimensions of transformative
   leadership emerged: vision and intellectual stimulation. These
   dimensions influenced teachers' attitude, subjective norm and
   self-efficacy via ICT policy and professionalization activities.
   Attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy were predictors of the use
   of DLMs in the pedagogical practice of teachers.}},

Abstract = {{Landowner education is the foundation of a broad suite of public
   investments designed to encourage sustainable forest management.
   Extension Forestry programs are the primary providers of landowner
   education in the United States. We report the results of a census of the
   50 state-level Extension Forestry Program Leaders on status, trends, and
   innovations in their programs. These programs employ 249 full time
   equivalent (FTE) state specialists, educators, and support staff.
   Reported cuts in base funding from public sources have led to reduced
   FTE capacity as vacated positions remain unfilled. A majority of
   state-level programs report increased use of digital communication tools
   compared to 5 years ago. Over half have increased instruction on forest
   health and invasive species, intergenerational land transfer, and the
   effects of climate change on forests. These trends and innovations

Abstract = {{In the digital age when there is unlimited information on the internet,
   knowledge management (KM) is important for management and generation of
   new knowledge. However, KM is not taught formally in learning
   institutions. There are few studies incorporating KM processes in
   learning, and even less with ICT tools. There is a need to determine
   suitable design for tasks to promote KM processes among undergraduates.
   In this study, a task was assigned for students to plan the use of an
   ICT tool in the field of counseling and display it on a wiki for their
   peers' comments. The task was shown to be beneficial as new knowledge
   was created. The results indicated that KM processes had occurred. This
   study is significant as a design for developing KM skills for generation
   of knowledge, innovation and creativity is required in learning
   institutions and at the workplace to create k-workers for the future.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to understand the innovation diffusion of
   new wood-based materials, ``from lab to market,{''} to identify the
   success factors and barriers to market introduction, and to reveal
   important factors for the success of commercialization. Examples are
   given from target markets in the furniture, appliance, and automotive
   sectors. This study is based on three qualitative interview studies in
   Sweden from 2010 to 2012. The analysis showed that the diffusion process
   of a new bio-based material normally takes up to 10 years or even more.
   There are only a few companies along the supply chain whose specialized
   function is finding new materials. However, the automotive industry
   regularly monitors the development of new materials. Industrial
   customers of materials generally obtain information about biobased
   materials from suppliers, exhibitions, conferences, professional
   contacts, industry magazines, digital media, customers, and partners in
   development projects. Different industry sectors apply specific material
   requirements. Regulations regarding safety issues have a high priority,
   and the interviewees believed that environmental considerations will
   increase with time. If the materials are equal in other quality
   dimensions, environmental performance may cast the deciding vote.
   Recommendations for a faster diffusion cover the right mix of
   competences, financing, regulations, creativity, and support from the
   leadership.}},

Abstract = {{Reflective electron-beam lithography (REBL) employs a novel device to
   impress pattern information on an electron beam. This device, the
   digital pattern generator (DPG), is an array of small electron
   reflectors, in which the reflectance of each mirror is controlled by
   underlying CMOS circuitry. When illuminated by a beam of low-energy
   electrons, the DPG is effectively a programmable electron-luminous image
   source. By switching the mirror drive circuits appropriately, the DPG
   can `scroll' the image of an integrated circuit pattern across its
   surface; and the moving electron image, suitably demagnified, can be
   used to expose the resist-coated surface of a wafer or mask. This
   concept was first realized in a device suitable for 45 nm lithography
   demonstrations. A next-generation device has been designed and is
   presently nearing completion. The new version includes several advances
   intended to make it more suitable for application in commercial
   lithography systems. We will discuss the innovations and compromises in
   the design of this next-generation device. For application in
   commercially-practical maskless lithography at upcoming device nodes,
   still more advances will be needed. Some of the directions in which this
   technology can be extended will be described.}},

Abstract = {{It is annually produced 400 thousand tons of solid waste in the city of
   Rostov-on-Don, which is taken for disposal to landfill at the Northwest
   industrial area of the city. Nearly 60 tons of waste enters Rostov
   Material Recovery Facility every year for the sorting, extracting
   commercially attractive factions, pressing, briquetting and subsequent
   transportation of ``residue tail{''} to the landfill. However, the
   percentage of recycling in Rostov (10\%) remains low, as a result of the
   shortcomings of the system.
   Recently, the Administration of Rostov-on-Don has produced a development
   strategy of integrated municipal solid waste management to create a new
   system of waste management in Rostov-on-Don. The strategy focuses mainly
   at Resource efficiency, which is a blend of good infrastructure,
   collection and design. with a dash of innovation and a strong policy
   framework to back it up. For the successful implementation of the
   strategy it is necessary to introduce an integrated system of municipal
   solid waste management using GIS. The methodology of integrated system
   with using GIS was developed by specialists of City Planning and
   Community Development Department of the Rostov State University of Civil
   Engineering. It includes implementation of collection and storage of
   waste and environmental data along with vehicle's navigation system
   through ArcGIS ESRI software. It helps to facilitate collection
   operations, to analyze optimal locations for transfer stations, to plan
   routes for vehicles transporting waste from residential, commercial and
   industrial customers to transfer stations and from transfer stations to
   landfills, to calculate amount of waste collection sites in accordance
   with the population density and volume of bins, to locate new landfills
   and to monitor the landfill. GIS is a tool that also provides a digital
   data bank for optimization of waste collection sites allocation
   according with implementation of General City Plan.
   The territory of Rostov-on-Don has been chosen for case study. GIS
   allowed to make situational (operational) decisions for implementing the
   strategic approach to the municipal solid waste management plan of the
   city and supported innovative accompaniment of the process of
   development and implementation of priority national projects, targeted
   programs of ecological reconstruction and strategic plans of
   socio-economic development of municipalities.}},

Abstract = {{In most wired and wireless systems, carrier tracking is an essential
   task that allows the receiver to precisely synchronize with the carrier
   of the incoming signal. Stringent carrier tracking requirements are
   imposed in systems that are sensitive to carrier mismatches, such as
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), digital communication
   receivers employing high-order constellations, and terrestrial- or
   satellite-based positioning systems, just to mention a few. In the
   recent years, even more critical requirements are being imposed due to
   the emergence of new applications and services that are pushing
   traditional systems to operate in much more challenging conditions than
   the ones for which they were originally designed. The presence of severe
   fading, signal outages, abrupt phase changes and high user dynamics, are
   currently compromising the validity of well-known and long-established
   traditional carrier tracking techniques, thus calling for the
   development of new robust carrier tracking algorithms. In this paper, we
   provide a detailed survey on the five main strategies that can be
   adopted to cope with the technical challenges of robust carrier
   tracking. These strategies range from some basic optimizations of
   current tracking loops, to the use of Kalman filter-based architectures,
   or the application of innovative carrier tracking techniques based on
   particle filters or compressive sensing. We will also review some
   open-loop techniques, which are widely adopted in burst-mode
   communications receivers, as an alternative and potential candidate
   solution for robust carrier tracking in harsh conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Mass customization has been regularly used as a growth strategy during
   the last decades. The strength of this approach stems from offering
   products adjusted to customers' individual needs, resulting in added
   value. The latter resides in the word `custom,' implying unique and
   utilitarian products allowing for self-expression of the consumer.
   Researchers and practitioners however predominantly focused on the
   company's internal processes to optimize mass customization, often
   resulting in market failure. As a response, a framework with five
   factors determining the success of mass customization was developed.
   Additionally, Living Lab methodologies have been used to improve
   innovation contexts that were too closed. This paper will fill a gap in
   the literature by demonstrating that the integration of the five-factor
   framework in the Living Lab methodology is well suited to determine the
   possible success or failure of a mass-customized product in the market
   by means of a single case study.}},

Abstract = {{Route recording is a key new feature of the Swiss Microcensus on
   Mobility and Transport 2010 (MCMT 2010). Whereas in previous
   micro-censuses information on distances was based on respondents'
   estimates, the MCMT 2010 for the first time supplemented these estimates
   with effective distances determined by means of routing. Given the far
   greater accuracy of routed distance data compared with subjective
   estimates, the routed distances were applied for all motorized
   distance-related analyses. It was found that route recording provided
   reliable and valid distance measures and was one way to overcome the
   difficulty with participants' distance estimates. But development work
   is needed on the routing of non-motorized travel regarding both digital
   networks and the survey method. The paper concludes by drawing on the
   findings of this examination and formulating opportunities for
   improvement and enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Community support is gaining more and more importance, especially in
   areas where peer-peer communication is a critical success factor. One
   important issue concerning community support is making the activities of
   the community visible to its members. Knowing better what other
   community members know and do can help to improve information supply by
   making information that is usually ``hidden{''} inside of today's
   information systems available to the community and to outsiders. In this
   chapter, we present an approach that helps to make community awareness
   information visible in a sociotechnically integrated, interactive way.
   The concept is based on large touch screens or interactive projections
   in semipublic places such as lobbies or break rooms that help people to
   see, touch, and experience digital content, and to find contextual and
   timely information easily without having to look for it explicitly.
   Intuitive presentation and interaction possibilities on these
   sociotechnical systems, called CommunityMirrors, improve the visibility
   of information and awareness of what is happening in the underlying
   systems and corresponding communities, and they generate appreciation
   for information providers. In addition, through integration into the
   social context, CommunityMirrors support interpersonal communication
   between users standing in front of the screens and enhance the
   motivation of information providers to generate new content.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the integration of advanced computational design
   and digital fabrication methods through the project Light-Vault, which
   addresses the development and execution of complex designs resulting in
   a performance based approach through optimization. The project shows the
   development of a vault which is made through an assemblage of customized
   multiple components, which are parametrically controlled and evaluated
   with respect to light and weight. Due to influence of multiple fitness
   parameters a genetic algorithm is created and new methodology is
   developed for the evolution of the form. Algorithms are developed to
   ensure design thinking and fabrication procedures are simultaneously
   developed in a non-linear, parallel performance based process. This
   logical approach investigates the various possibilities and optimizes
   the development and fabrication of ruled surfaces in the interior volume
   of the component using digital methods and translation of the form into
   reality using industrial robots for fabrication. In parallel, the
   project explores the potential of robotic technology and introduces
   innovations of personalized robotic tools, in generating quick shaping
   volumes through this process. The developed methodology is tested in
   creating multiple units of the vault which are analyzed against various
   evaluation criteria. This cumulative cohesive process between advanced
   digital and physical computation methods is translated through a
   full-scale built pavilion.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines mobile divide by gender, age, social economic status
   (SES), and social capital using a conceptual model of mobile divide.
   This model is composed of eight components of mobile divide which are
   divided into the following three groups: two antecedents of mobile use
   including innovativeness and competence, two types of actual mobile use
   (talk and non-talk), and consequences of mobile use including life
   management, resource use, network management, and personal identity
   display. Through a survey of 400 mobile users in Korea, our study
   verified the validity of the proposed model. In addition, this model
   enables us to examine mobile divide in two different approaches - at the
   level of each component and in the relations among the components.
   Mobile divides by gender, age, SES, and social capital existed at the
   level of various components. Age and SES even showed significant mobile
   divides in the relations between mobile uses and consequence-related
   components. Implications of the results in our study along with the two
   types of approaches to mobile divide are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{With the constant development of digital technology nowadays,
   architectural creation is undergoing great changes on design ideas and
   realization methods: With the international events held recent years,
   there comes more and more international design competition on large
   sports center, in which digital technology has become a major boost of
   design innovation. Meanwhile, digital design method has achieved a
   change from media reproduction to the body resulting. Based on the
   analysis of typical examples of large sports center design using digital
   technology, this paper makes a deep study of the application of digital
   technology in the international design competition of large sports
   center through digitized form, digital manufacturing and control
   processing.
   Over the years, large sports center international competition requires
   specific features such as mass body, complex body, regionality and so
   on. However, its gross amount of irregular shape always can not be
   accurately grasped by traditional software, and it is hard to solve
   multi-disciplinary problems with single software because of its complex
   type and its diverse design factors. However, in the context of the
   digital age, although sports architecture has large span, it also has
   strict form; although it has complex streamline, it also has clear
   function, all of which provide a good platform for the parameters on the
   application of digital technology in the sports center design. Logical
   relationship of form generation, many measurable parameters and
   multidisciplinary collaborative design have become the starting point
   that digital design integrates into traditional design logic. At the
   same time, digital software creates large span space which is different
   from the traditional one through its unique ``script design{''}, ``set
   theory{''} and ``shape linkage with parameter{''}, which provide
   architects greater degree of design freedom. Furthermore, the architects
   could continuously adjust and optimize by regulating the parameters in
   the digital software system, finally making the sports architecture get
   valuable experience and rapid development in a rational state.}},

   ICH online}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTANGIBLE HERITAGE}},

Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{69-82}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a new paradigm of safeguarding methods through
   digital platforms and technology. Since 2010, a group of researchers in
   Korea have been developing a new experimental methodology of
   inventorying intangible cultural heritage (ICH) utilising a new concept
   of collective intelligence and advanced information technologies. The
   research team established Ichpedia, a web-based ICH encyclopedia and
   archive. The purpose of Ichpedia is four fold. First, it functions as
   the most efficient digital ICH inventorying system available using
   modern information technologies. It is possible to record and retain the
   dynamic features of ICH through the use of multi-media resources.
   Secondly, Ichpedia can facilitate interactivity between information
   providers and users so that ICH communities, groups and individuals can
   directly access the system as information providers or editors. Using
   the functions of the system, their voices can easily be disseminated to
   the public. Such cooperative work will encourage more awareness and
   identification of the fragility of ICH. Ichpedia will therefore be
   instrumental in improving the understanding of ICH communities and
   individuals and finding better safeguarding methods. Thirdly, Ichpedia
   can reduce the economic burden of establishing a highly efficient
   database system. It is easy and simple to use but offers high efficiency
   compared to other web-based ICH encyclopedias worldwide. Ichpedia has
   the advantage of being the least expensive option for the development
   and maintenance of such a system. Lastly, it is hoped that Ichpedia will
   pave the way for digital innovation in the area of ICH recording with
   the free and open distribution of the digital platform and technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The current practice of radiotherapy examines target coverage solely
   from digitally reconstructed beam's eye view (BEV) in a way that is
   indirectly accessible and that is not in real time. We aimed to
   visualize treatment targets in real time from each BEV. The image data
   of phantom or patients from ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT)
   scans were captured to perform image registration. We integrated US, CT,
   US/CT image registration, robotic manipulation of US, a radiation
   treatment planning system, and a linear accelerator to constitute an
   innovative target visualization system. The performance of this
   algorithm segmented the target organ in CT images, transformed and
   reconstructed US images to match each orientation, and generated image
   registration in real time mode with acceptable accuracy. This image
   transformation allowed physicians to visualize the CT
   image-reconstructed target via a US probe outside the BEV that was
   non-coplanar to the beam's plane. It allowed the physicians to remotely
   control the US probe that was equipped on a robotic arm to dynamically
   trace and real time monitor the coverage of the target within the BEV
   during a simulated beam-on situation. This target visualization system
   may provide a direct remotely accessible and real time way to visualize,
   verify, and ensure tumor targeting during radiotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{In these early years of the twenty-first century, we must look at how
   the truly crosscutting information technology supports other
   innovations, and how it will fundamentally change the information
   positions of government, private sector and the scientific domain as
   well as the citizen. In those positions, location will be a prominent
   linking pin. The classical top-down system architectures of information
   exchange will be diluted by peer-to-peer and bottom-up channels, forcing
   us to rethink their designs. We should not only focus on better
   architectures, but need to attend to a different economy of information
   exchange, in which the `client' is not only the information sink, but
   has become an important source as well. The laws of this rising
   `infoconomy' have yet to be settled on. This special issue on `Digital
   Earth Applications: Technological design and organizational strategies'
   brings together a number of papers that shed light on this future
   information ecosystem in which location-specific information will be
   exchanged between stakeholders. The introduction presents a framework
   that combines geoinformation streams and organisations brokering between
   government, science, private sector and citizens. This novel framework
   helps us improve the appreciation of those papers.}},

Abstract = {{Science and policy increasingly request for sustainable development and
   growth. Similarly, Digital Earth undergoes a paradigm shift to an open
   platform that actively supports user engagement. While the public
   becomes able to contribute new content, we recognize a gap in
   user-driven validation, feedback and requirements capture, and
   innovative application development. Rather than defining Digital Earth
   applications top down, we see a need for methods and tools that will
   help building applications bottom up and driven by community needs.
   These should include a technology toolbox of geospatial and
   environmental enablers, which allow to access functional building blocks
   and content in multiple ways, but - equally important - enable the
   collaboration within partially unknown stakeholder networks. The
   validation and testing in real-life scenarios will be a central
   requirement when approaching the Digital Earth 2020 goals, which were
   articulated recently. We particularly argue to follow a Living Lab
   approach for co-creation and awareness rising in relation to
   environmental and geospatial matters. We explain why and how such a
   Digital Earth Living Lab could lead to a sustainable approach for
   developing, deploying, and using Digital Earth applications and suggest
   a paradigm shift for Virtual Globes becoming forums for research and
   innovation.}},

Title = {{Full-frame programmable spectral filters based on micromirror arrays}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICRO-NANOLITHOGRAPHY MEMS AND MOEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Rapidly programmable micromirror arrays, such as the Texas Instruments
   Digital Light Processor (DLP) digital micromirror device (DMD), have
   opened an exciting new arena in spectral imaging: rapidly
   reprogrammable, high spectral resolution, multiband spectral filters
   that perform spectral processing directly in the optical hardware. Such
   a device is created by placing a DMD at the spectral plane of an imaging
   spectrometer and by using it as a spectral selector that passes some
   wavelengths down the optical train to the final image and rejects
   others. Although simple in concept, realizing a truly practical
   DMD-based spectral filter has proved challenging. Versions described to
   date have been limited by the intertwining of image position and
   spectral propagation direction common to most imaging spectrometers,
   reducing these instruments to line-by-line scanning imagers rather than
   true spectral cameras that collect entire two-dimensional (2-D) images
   at once. Here, we report several optical innovations that overcome this
   limitation and allow us to construct full-frame programmable filters
   that spectrally manipulate every pixel, simultaneously and without
   spectral shifts, across a full 2-D image. So far, our prototype, which
   can be programmed either as a matched-filter imager for specific target
   materials or as a fully hyperspectral multiplexing Hadamard transform
   imager, has demonstrated over 100 programmable spectral bands while
   maintaining good spatial image quality. We discuss how
   diffraction-mediated trades between spatial and spectral resolution
   determine achievable performance. Finally, we describe methods for
   dealing with the DLP's 2-D diffractive effects and suggest a simple
   modification to the DLPs that would eliminate their impact for this
   application. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{With evasion of digital convergence {[}1], computing has by and large
   pervaded into our environment. WWW has enhanced day-to-day life by
   utilizing information such as Location awareness, User-context
   awareness; touch API, mutation observer {[}2], and many more. The future
   {[}3] trends in ubiquitous computing {[}4] provide a great scope for
   innovation and value-added services. With approach of ``computing being
   embedded,{''} the future sees its usage more pervasive and appealing.
   Web is evolving and so are supporting technologies (in terms of hardware
   technologies). Many real-life examples including augmented-reality,
   wearable technologies, gesture-based recognition systems, etc., are
   already in place illustrating its high-end usage. Such diverse future
   targeting billions of people and devices need streamlined approach. Some
   steps have already been taken care by World Wide Web consortium (W3C) to
   provide standards relating to API usage. In this paper, we highlight
   various aspects of web-ubiquitous computing and how they can be dealt
   w.r.t to their implementation.}},

Abstract = {{To place a few objects within limited space is a common issue for quite
   a few design tasks, such as the furnishings of the furniture, the
   collocation of dressings, or the design of the comic figures. Though
   there are many design elements shared on the Internet nowadays, it is
   still lack of search methods for design patterns. This makes it
   difficult for the designers to refer to similar patterns, or to compare
   and learn from them. In this paper, the architecture for representing,
   comparing, searching and analyzing the design patterns of digital
   contents were proposed. Through the approach, the designers can view
   similar patterns efficiently when learning, and see how similar elements
   are utilized differently and innovatively by other designers. In
   addition, the patterns can be clustered, analyzed and summarized
   automatically, which makes it easier to perform the style analysis. The
   proposed approach has been verified successfully on a design support
   system for the creation of comic figures. Experimental results show
   that, it not only appears promising in the domain of digital content
   creation, but exhibits great commercial potential in the era of design
   and education.}},

Abstract = {{The rate of sea level rise will roughly double over the next century
   with a conservative projection of 0.18-0.59m by 2100 (IPCC 2007).
   Inundation caused by sea level rise will likely disrupt the physical,
   economic, and social systems in coastal regions worldwide. All existing
   methods to assess the potential impacts of sea level rise could only
   delineate the inundation by a specific sea level rise. In addition to
   providing another inundation method based on the cost distance GIS
   function, this research developed an innovative method that calculated
   the minimum sea level rise needed to inundate each cell in a Digital
   Elevation Model (DEM). Both methods considered water connectivity and
   performed better than the simple bathtub approach, especially with sea
   level rises below 1m. Implementation data structures significantly
   affected the efficiency of the new method. Several data structures were
   proposed and compared. Our results indicated the combination of a binary
   heap and hash table data structure was the most efficient
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{High-contrast bone structures are a major noise contributor in chest
   radiographic images. A signal of interest in a chest radiograph could be
   either partially or completely obscured or ``overshadowed{''} by the
   highly contrasted bone structures in its surrounding. Thus, removing the
   bone structures, especially the posterior rib and clavicle structures,
   is highly desirable to increase the visibility of soft tissue density.
   We developed an innovative technology that offers a solution to suppress
   bone structures, including posterior ribs and clavicles, on conventional
   and portable chest X-ray images. The bone-suppression image processing
   technology includes five major steps: 1) lung segmentation, 2) rib and
   clavicle structure detection, 3) rib and clavicle edge detection, 4) rib
   and clavicle profile estimation, and 5) suppression based on the
   estimated profiles. The bone-suppression software outputs an image with
   both the rib and clavicle structures suppressed. The rib suppression
   performance was evaluated on 491 images. On average, 83.06\% (+/-
   6.59\%) of the rib structures on a standard chest image were suppressed
   based on the comparison of computer-identified rib areas against
   hand-drawn rib areas, which is equivalent to about an average of one rib
   that is still visible on a rib-suppressed image based on a visual
   assessment. Reader studies were performed to evaluate reader performance
   in detecting lung nodules and pneumothoraces with and without a
   bone-suppression companion view. Results from reader studies indicated
   that the bone-suppression technology significantly improved
   radiologists' performance in the detection of CT-confirmed possible
   nodules and pneumothoraces on chest radiographs. The results also showed
   that radiologists were more confident in making diagnoses regarding the
   presence or absence of an abnormality after rib-suppressed companion
   views were presented}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the possibilities of using non-contact 3D
   measurement systems for the digital capture and subsequent dimensional
   and shape analysis of multi-part forms. The paper illustrates a
   practical method of the 3D digitization of two-part moulds using a
   combination of TRITOP and ATOS optical systems. It introduces
   dimensional control of the cavity of a mould during its real closure and
   compares this method to traditional methods of measurement. The analyses
   carried out show the undeniable benefits of these innovative approaches
   in practice, because the appropriate use of optical methods often
   enables the detection of the errors of products and tools which would be
   impossible to detect using traditional approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Only nature can create, whereas humans can only re-create. This article
   is an exploration of synergies between art and science in digital
   holography in relation to art practice and the making of holograms as
   art works. This is achieved through involvement in the re-creation of a
   real object (a telescope) as a case study. A digital three-dimensional
   model suitable for holographic hard copy re-creation is produced. To
   explore special and immersive environment, real geographical landscape
   background from Google Earth is added to the model. After a brief
   introduction to visual art within the context of two and
   three-dimensional imaging in the form photography and holography, the
   whole process of producing the three-dimensional model and the
   environment in which it should be presented, ready for holographic
   printing is explained.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing complexity of products and consumer interests is facing
   more and more challenges to production planning. An innovative approach,
   which facilitates efficient planning, is represented by a model-based
   approach using the concept of the Digital Factory. In order to realize
   the vision of virtual production, modular solutions like simulations or
   optimization tools are merged into a holistic model that provides a
   digital mapping of the entire production process. In this work, a
   framework is described, which is capable to integrate planning modules
   by using an integrative information model. Based on intelligence
   approaches, multiple data is linked to reach a vertical integration of
   the information flow. These cross-linked data structures facilitate a
   consolidation of data from different levels of the production monitoring
   and management layers. The provided information is used to establish
   decision support systems, which enable an entirely holistic factory
   planning. The advantages of the approach are demonstrated by a process
   chain formation use case.}},

Abstract = {{Emotions play an important role in human interactions. Human Emotions
   Recognition (HER - Affective Computing) is an innovative method for
   detecting user's emotions to determine proper responses and
   recommendations in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This paper
   discusses an intelligent approach to recognize human emotions by using
   the usual input devices such as keyboard, mouse and touch screen
   displays. This research is compared with the other usual methods like
   processing the facial expressions, human voice, body gestures and
   digital signal processing in Electroencephalography (EEG) machines for
   an emotional-aware system. The Emotional Intelligence system is trained
   in a supervised mode by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support
   Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The result shows 93.20\% in accuracy
   which is around 5\% more than the existing methods. It is a significant
   contribution to show new directions of future research in this topical
   area of emotion recognition, which is useful in recommender systems.}},

Abstract = {{The GlobalSoilMap project is representative of a global consortium of
   scientific institutions involved in soil survey and soil science. The
   GlobalSoilMap group was formed as an outgrowth of the International
   Union of Soil Sciences Working Group for Digital Soil Mapping with the
   purpose of providing consistently produced soil property information at
   100 m resolution across the world. This information will aid in solving
   some of the key environment and societal issues of the day, including
   food security, global climate change land degradation and carbon
   sequestration. Data would be produced using mostly the storehouse of
   existing legacy soils data along with geographic information and a range
   of covariates. A range of modeling techniques is used dependant on the
   complexity of the background soil survey information. The key soil
   properties that would be most useful to the modeling community and other
   users are: organic carbon (g/kg), texture (sand \%, silt \%, clay \% and
   coarse fragments \%), pH, depth to bedrock or restrictive layer.
   Predictions are made at specified depths with uncertainty values
   assigned to each prediction. An innovative splining technique will be
   employed to provide a continuous prediction of soil property values
   throughout the depth of each profile. Maps have been produced at the
   country level in the Australia, Canada, Denmark, Nigeria, South Korea
   and the US and work is on-going in many other parts of the world.}},

Abstract = {{A good deal of digital data produced in academia, commerce and industry
   is made up of a raw, unstructured text, such as Word documents, Excel
   tables, emails, web pages, etc., which are also often represented in a
   natural language. An important analytical task in a number of scientific
   and technological domains is to retrieve information from text data,
   aiming to get a deeper insight into the content represented by the data
   in order to obtain some useful, often not explicitly stated knowledge
   and facts, related to a particular domain of interest. The major
   challenge is the size, structural complexity, and frequency of the
   analysed text sets' updates (i.e., the `big data' aspect), which makes
   the use of traditional analysis techniques and tools impossible. We
   introduce an innovative approach to analyse unstructured text data. This
   allows for improving traditional data mining techniques by adopting
   algorithms from ontological domain modelling, natural language
   processing, and machine learning. The technique is inherently designed
   with parallelism in mind, which allows for high performance on
   large-scale Cloud computing infrastructures.}},

Abstract = {{A novel human hand tracking algorithm based on a single-view camera is
   put forward. First, we remove the deformity gesture before tracking
   employing hand physical constraint and motion constraint. Second, we get
   data from digital glove in the process of hand grasping object, then we
   obtain the polynomial law of joint motion by analyzing the data to
   reduce the dimension. Finally, we fuse the behavioral model and
   optimized particle filter to improve the result of tracking. The
   innovation of this paper is to establish the behavioral model of
   grasping object. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm can
   track movement of hand accurately and quickly.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of machine tools in the blooming of several industrial
   domains is not to be demonstrated any more. However, during the last
   decade, the economic context imposed on this industry new standard of
   performance as regards the quality, the productivity, the costs and the
   delay of the production. The evolution of digitally operated modern
   machines drives integration of measurement and control in the cycle of
   manufacturing. The probe system brings an innovative solution to the
   improvement of CN machine tools efficiency and significantly expand its
   range of applications to improve the manufacturing process. The purpose
   of this article is to present our approach on the integration and the
   qualification of a metrology module associated with a software
   acquisition and analysis in relation to the digital control, a solution
   which we fulfilled and validated within our laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper provides a review related to online communication,
   cultural dimensions, and the role of English in intercultural
   communication that takes place in virtual environments facilitated by
   technological artefacts. The study aims at displaying a picture of the
   virtual environments and engagements that trigger intercultural
   communication. The study explores the differences in the pragmatic
   systems and linguistic tendencies of Eastern and Western cultures within
   the scope of the `high-context' and `low-context' framework proposed by
   Hall (1976), and the impact of online communication on these cultures.
   The study also discusses the pedagogical possibilities that the digital
   world offers in support of foreign language learning and teaching, in
   the light of innovative educational philosophies and approaches to
   foreign language education. The paper concludes that there is a basic
   need for societies to adopt a postmodern view in order to improve global
   tolerance and communication. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The ability to control the architecture and strength of a bone tissue
   engineering scaffold is critical to achieve a harmony between the
   scaffold and the host tissue. The scaffold attempts to mimic the
   function of the natural extracellular matrix, providing a temporary
   template for the growth of target tissues. The study of nanocrystalline
   calcium phosphate physical-chemical characteristics and, thereafter, the
   possibility to imitate bone mineral for the development of new advanced
   biomaterials is constantly growing. Scaffolds should have suitable
   architecture and strength to serve their intended function. Rapid
   prototyping (RP) technique is applied to tissue engineering to satisfy
   this need and to create a scaffold directly from the scanned and
   digitized image of the defect site. Design and construction of complex
   structures with different shapes and sizes, at micro and macro scale,
   with fully interconnected pore structure and appropriate mechanical
   properties are possible by using RP techniques. In this study we present
   a new biocompatible hybrid scaffold obtained through two different
   experimental methods and formed by synthetic biomimetic Hydroxyapatite
   (HA) nanocrystals with high surface reactivity which synergistically
   interacts with Poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and polylactic acid (PLLA).
   The aim of this pilot study is to test the adhesion and the
   proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) on both the
   scaffolds. MSC growth and distribution was evaluated 24 h and 7 days
   after in-vitro seeding. The results allowed the conclusion that these
   scaffolds are biocompatible and allow the colonization and proliferation
   of MSC, therefore, due to their mechanical properties, they are adequate
   for bone tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{It is an innovative design method in physics that product layout design
   is abstracted into convex hull plus rubber band simulation layout mode
   by setting up the optimized model. Based on the physics model of
   Newton's Second Law, this paper analyzed collision detection methods
   during the process of realizing reasonable layout, and it is founded
   that real-time collision detection and collision response during
   movement, produced component's within the given beat, appeared to be the
   key content of resolving digital model design. In this paper, Area
   Difference method was adopted to detect when the collision occurred
   during component movement and what kind of state the component tended to
   be in collision. At the same time, it also determined the interference

   generation time and related torque and force, which can confirm the
   component's continued movement model of rotation and sliding. Meanwhile,
   it employed the Judgment Matrix method to analyze collision response so
   as to confirm the collision interference relationship and collision
   action state, movement possessing mode(rotation, sliding and retraction,

Abstract = {{Contemporary teaching, research and process innovation is directly
   connected with most up-to-date information, solutions and testing
   opportunities. In process analysis, improvement or re-organization for
   production planning, supply chain engineering, production or transport
   logistics, knowledge-driven innovation derives from best opportunities
   of testing and simulations. In the era of information technology, the
   computer-based simulations are tools of teaching and planning. The
   cooperation of both academia and businesses are at the same time valuing
   the opportunity of hands-on practicing and visualizations, prototyping
   processes and having physical demonstrations of planned processes. The
   current research focuses on combining digital and hands-on approach
   towards interdisciplinary business-case-solutions in development of
   modern knowledge transfer organization for students delivering solutions
   of process simulations in Logistics and Supply Chain Engineering,
   Production Planning or Factory Development. The renewed environment
   providing input for knowledge-based supply process development and

Abstract = {{Internet, which covers all the network of information systems have
   changed the direction of digital communication with various
   communication protocols. Unquestionably these new innovations in
   information technologies affect Geographical Information Systems (GIS).
   Thus; GIS databases used to be shared and carried with compact discs but
   now with the help of desktop GIS (DGIS) applications can be shared more
   easily. On the other hand web based GIS (WebGIS) applications are able
   to reach their databases at servers with different internet protocols.
   This allows mobile users to access easily; as a result popularity of
   WebGIS has recently increased.
   WebGIS applications are able to share data requested by mobile users via
   HyperText Transfer Protocol (http) with the help of its dynamic content.
   This has caused the need for a different layer model and a work that
   shows compilation degree. This study explains how DIV layers are
   constructed with Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and laminated with
   Style sheet (CS S) codes. In this study it is explained how created
   layer will be shown on the place that we want of the x,y level, also the
   codes that are used to present with dynamic content with Active Server
   Pages (ASP) web programming language are explained. Sharing of the codes
   that are used in this simple application is not only important for
   avoiding dependence to GIS programs which are the monopoly but also for
   introduction of DIV layer model that is tried in WebGIS applications for
   the first time. Therefore, the obtained results will be helpful to
   researchers. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The society in which we live has become a digital society in recent
   years and architectural design has evolved greatly with the advent of

   These tools have endless design possibilities, but these techniques are
   still in an experimental phase, which links seamlessly with the ideal of
   ephemeral architecture, which despite its short duration in time, has
   always played, since baroque set design, an important role in the
   evolution of architecture. They shaped the innovative thinking of the
   time and the most advanced techniques available. Therefore, one route is
   to discover how the most famous architects coped with this type of
   situation, with particular emphasis on the project concept of 21st

Abstract = {{A method for 3D tracking has been developed exploiting Digital
   Holography features in Microscopy (DHM). In the framework of
   self-consistent platform for manipulation and measurement of biological
   specimen we use DHM for quantitative and completely label free analysis
   of samples with low amplitude contrast. Tracking capability extend the
   potentiality of DHM allowing to monitor the motion of appropriate probes
   and correlate it with sample properties. Complete 3D tracking has been
   obtained for the probes avoiding the amplitude refocusing in traditional
   tracking processes. Moreover, in biology and biomedical research fields
   one of the main topic is the understanding of morphology and mechanics
   of cells and microorganisms. Biological samples present low amplitude
   contrast that limits the information that can be retrieved through
   optical bright-field microscope measurements. The main effect on light
   propagating in such objects is in phase. This is known as
   phase-retardation or phase-shift. DHM is an innovative and alternative
   approach in microscopy, it's a good candidate for no-invasive and
   complete specimen analysis because its main characteristic is the
   possibility to discern between intensity and phase information
   performing quantitative mapping of the Optical Path Length. In this
   paper, the flexibility of DH is employed to analyze cell mechanics of
   unstained cells subjected to appropriate stimuli. DHM is used to measure
   all the parameters useful to understand the deformations induced by
   external and controlled stresses on in-vitro cells. Our configuration
   allows 3D tracking of micro-particles and, simultaneously, furnish
   quantitative phase-contrast maps. Experimental results are presented and
   discussed for in vitro cells.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering nanoparticles (ENPs) have been widely used in many areas in
   virtue of its special physical and chemical properties. And ENPs are one
   of the major innovative scientific and economic growth things, which may
   present a variety of questions for organisms and environment. This paper
   analyzed the ecotoxicological effect of the nanosized silicon dioxide
   (Nano-SiO2) and the normal sized silicon dioxide (Nor-SiO2) within 24
   hours as its bulk counterpart to Daphnia magna with different
   concentration. To assess the aquatic ecosystem safety, EC50 value for
   immobilization and LC50 value for mortality were measured respectively.
   The results show that the toxicity of Nano-SiO2 has obviously
   dose-dependent effect but the Nor-SiO2 has not, evidently. The optical
   microscope and digital camera also been used to observe and record the
   biological form of Daphnia magna during the exposure and in this study
   we found that D. magna can uptake and adsorb Nano-SiO2 but only
   apparently show uptaking to its bulk counterpart. The conclusions of
   results suggest that there is potential harm to aquatic environment in
   using Nano-SiO2, and it should deserve special concern.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter reviews past social media developments, examines current
   social media practices, and offers future projections regarding the role
   of social media in marketing theory and practice. In the process, it
   provides a comprehensive understanding of social media in all its
   facets. It also offers conceptual frameworks of past and present social
   media developments and practices, which include, among others, various
   applications, such as virtual game worlds; content communities, such as
   YouTube and other photo and video sharing communities; user generated
   content such as blogs and micro-blogs; digital video; social networking
   communities, such as Facebook; virtual worlds, such as Second Life, and
   virtual goods; ratings and reviews and other word-of-mouth communities;
   collaborative projects, such as Wikipedia; and mobile social media,
   among others. Subsequently, it is projected that the future social media
   technology will increasingly result from virtually endless interactions
   of company/company generated content and user/user generated content.
   Competition and information clutter is also projected to increase
   substantially in the future. Therefore the companies will have to tap
   into the lucrative social media platforms in order to effectively market
   to target consumers.
   The chapter will also address overall opportunities and challenges of
   social media including the inevitable life cycle scenarios where online
   social media as we know it will lose its potency and experience the
   fatigue and ineffective resonance we now observe in the case of
   telemarketing and other older media vehicles. In these scenarios, social
   media may lose its power and even its significance - already, consumers
   are defecting from social media communities where they perceive an
   overwhelming brand and/or company presence, or even at the mere
   possibility that domain owners might attempt to monetize their website.
   These scenarios make it very evident that true innovations rather than
   mere tweaking of technologies is necessary for success and survival of
   social media in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents the results of energy diagnosis of the structure of

   the Constant Interaction Force Vibroisolation (abbreviated as WoSSO) of
   a biomechanical system. Sample results refer to the demolition hammer of
   the weight of 15,6 kg and the frequency of working shocks of 20 Hz. The
   diagnostic research was to recognise and evaluate the energy and spatial
   impact of the innovative structure of the hammer provided with
   anti-vibration system upon human. 3D energy physical and mathematical
   models of the entire system human - demolition hammer with
   vibroisolation of 18 degrees of freedom were designed and the problem
   was solved with the digital simulation method. The forces enforcing
   three directions of vibrations were identified via experiments at the
   research stand on the model base compliant with the ISO standard and
   then entered in the simulation program. The obtained results of the
   energy diagnosis of the structure explained the phenomenon of the energy
   flow in the examined biomechanical system and confirmed the efficiency
   of the flow reduction of the energy of vibrations into the human body at
   all the reduction points in the three directions of vibrations.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this paper is to introduce the concept of
   next-generation of 3D and 4D imaging technology, which is capable of
   multi-source capture, multi-representation processing,
   multi-data-content mixing and provides a holographic content and display
   with ultrahigh resolution. The technology allows the generation and
   display of color holographic data content that is composed of real life
   and synthetic scenes. The diversity, complexity and extreme high
   resolution of this 3D/4D imaging system requires the development of
   tools that compose the holographic content captured from a multi-source
   system (dynamic objects of human sized dimensions, far distant
   backgrounds, and synthetic scene elements). In the area of capture
   technology the system includes a dynamic, high resolution, color
   holographic capture systems and multimodal 3D and 4D (3D+time)
   structured light systems. Progress in innovative data and content
   processing technology is going to be made as several methods and tools
   for processing 3D/4D holographic representations (amplitude-phase) and
   the composition of different data types (surface representation, 2D
   images) into a single extreme high resolution holographic video are
   introduced. In addition, the concept includes procedures for the
   generation of events that support interaction of both 4D surface and
   amplitude-phase data and introduce a 3D/4D data representation exchange
   format (surface to/from holographic).}},

Abstract = {{The last few years have seen a number of technical and clinical advances
   which give rise to a need for innovations in dose optimization and
   delivery strategies. Technically, a new generation of digital linac has
   become available which offers features such as programmable motion
   between station parameters and high dose-rate Flattening Filter Free
   (FFF) beams. Current inverse planning methods are designed for
   traditional machines and cannot accommodate these features of new
   generation linacs without compromising either dose conformality and/or
   delivery efficiency. Furthermore, SBRT is becoming increasingly
   important, which elevates the need for more efficient delivery, improved
   dose distribution. Here we will give an overview of our recent work in
   SPORT designed to harness the digital linacs and highlight the essential
   components of SPORT. We will summarize the pros and cons of traditional
   beamlet-based optimization (BBO) and direct aperture optimization (DAO)
   and introduce a new type of algorithm, compressed sensing (CS)-based
   inverse planning, that is capable of automatically removing the
   redundant segments during optimization and providing a plan with high
   deliverability in the presence of a large number of station control
   points (potentially non-coplanar, non-isocentric, and even
   multi-isocenters). We show that CS-approach takes the interplay between
   planning and delivery into account and allows us to balance the dose
   optimality and delivery efficiency in a controlled way and, providing a
   viable framework to address various unmet demands of the new generation
   linacs. A few specific implementation strategies of SPORT in the forms
   of fixed-gantry and rotational arc delivery are also presented.}},

Title = {{An innovative combined water ozonisation/O-3-atmosphere storage for
   preserving the overall quality of two globe artichoke cultivars}},

Abstract = {{Effects of ozonised water, gaseous ozone exposure, and their combined
   treatments on microbiological and qualitative parameters of two globe
   artichoke cultivars (Violet de Provence and Romanesco clone C3) were
   studied during storage at 4 degrees C. At the end of this period,
   microbial counts were significantly lowered. Considering the qualitative
   parameters, ozone can be successfully applied to cv. Romanesco clone C3
   without significantly increasing the respiration rate, while it could
   determine the acceleration of senescence in Violet de Provence heads.
   The storage under ozone-enriched atmosphere improved the initial
   polyphenol content in Violet de Provence, while for Romanesco clone C3
   it seemed to be opportune to interrupt the ozonisation within the 4th
   day of storage for preventing excessive losses of polyphenol content.
   The ascorbic acid reduction, for both cultivars, was significantly
   increased by postharvest treatments with gaseous ozone suggesting to
   reduce, also in this case, the exposure days to the gas.
   Industrial relevance: The globe artichoke is a herbaceous crop native to
   the Mediterranean basin, which gives an important contribution both to
   agricultural economy and to human health due to the high content of
   promoting nutrients. Unfortunately, globe artichoke heads are very
   perishable because of their high respiratory activity, susceptibility to
   weight loss, and microbial decay. In particular, fungal decay is one of
   the main factors affecting the postharvest quality of globe artichoke
   and, so far, it is controlled by the application of chemical fungicides.
   However, resistance phenomena in microbial populations, growing public
   health and environmental concerns are urging for the use of alternative
   treatments. Among them, ozone is one of the most promising technologies
   from the health and environmental points of view for its spontaneous
   decomposition to non-toxic product. In addition, it has emerged as a
   potential antimicrobial agent in the post-harvest treatment of fruits
   and vegetables and is able to decompose pesticides and chemical
   residues. On the other side, the effect of ozone treatments on other
   qualitative parameters, including the level of antioxidant compounds, is
   highly dependent on the commodity and storage conditions. In this view,
   the combined water ozonisation/O-3-atmosphere storage represents
   innovative and applicable postharvest treatments for globe artichoke,
   whose exposure time and concentrations need to be customized for each
   cultivar. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Within interorganizational cooperative innovation of construction supply
   chain system, the achievement of project valuea-dding could be reflected
   by several factors, such as project-based organizational effect level,
   and the relationship between project cooperative innovation objectives.
   In this paper, based on the assumption of equal cooperation between
   project-based organizations, we selected the knowledge cooperation
   between the owner and contractor in construction supply chain system as
   research object. From the perspective of maximizing project value-adding
   and the relationship of effort cost between knowledge input and
   innovation stage in consideration, we established the knowledge
   collaborative incentive model for interorganizational cooperative
   innovation of construction supply chain system and proposed the
   first-order and second-order approaches. Then we conducted the digital
   simulation and example analysis, its results showed that if the owner
   has the capability to achieve project value-adding in knowledge
   cooperation, he would adopt a part commissioned way. Otherwise, a fully
   commissioned way would be better.}},

Title = {{Climate change discourses: how UK airlines communicate their case to the
   public}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{750-767}},
Abstract = {{Whilst there are many arguments and counterarguments surrounding
   aviation's contribution to climate change, the sector is increasingly
   scrutinised, especially in regard to tourism mobility questions. This
   paper identifies, examines and analyses the discourses that airlines
   choose to communicate via their websites regarding their role,
   responsibility and their viewpoints about the issues involved in their
   relationship to climate change. Studying the web is of growing
   importance: corporate organizations increasingly use the Internet to
   communicate influential discourses, engage consumers, and inform the
   media, who themselves use digital systems to form opinions and influence
   decisions. Drawing on publicly available communications from six
   contrasting UK airlines, the study seeks to identify their perceived
   roles and responsibilities as producers. The data are analysed through
   content and frame analyses. The study concludes, inter alia, that the
   airlines under study make both justifiable and unjustifiable claims, and
   use polarised prioritisation, scepticism and uncertainty creation to put
   forward their case. Airlines are classified into one of six types: (1)
   continuous committed benchmarkers, (2) realistic technological
   innovators, (3) minimal practicalities, (4) low-cost innovators, (5)
   low- cost sceptics and (6) low cost opposers. The paper uses and adds to
   an emerging research method, netnography.}},

Title = {{Age-group differences in Near Field Communication smartphone}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{484-502}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper are twofold: first, develop a novel
   concept of a mobiquitous home application (Near Field Communication
   Smartphone Entertainment Systems (NFC SES)) with the use of photo
   interface and NFC smartphone. Second, examine age-group differences in
   relation to the influence of intuitive, convenience and perceived
   usefulness on users' behavioural intention to use NFC SFS.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using design science research, NFC SES is
   developed and a survey of 52 users is conducted to evaluate NFC SES.
   Findings - There are age differences in individual behavioural intention
   to use NFC technology. Convenience appears to be the primary factor for
   the youths. The adult cohort, in contrast emphasizes intuitive and
   perceived usefulness as two significant determinants of their
   behavioural intention to use NFC SES.
   Practical implications - This study offers a fresh insight for mobile
   device manufacturer and application developers to focus their design
   efforts around three aspects (intuitive, convenience and usefulness)
   that are desired by different age-group users.
   Social implications - The development of NFC SES bridges the gap of
   cyber-physical spaces by enabling users to automate multiple
   heterogeneous digital appliances without imposing undue technological
   effort and inconvenience. NFC SES, operating through a touch-driven
   interaction between NFC smartphone and photo interface, is likely to be
   useful for many home users, especially for people with disabilities.
   Originality/value - NFC SES contributes in itself as a novel innovation.
   Additionally, studies on mobile technology largely focus on students as
   users, and often neglect the adult segment. This study entails a new
   model for evaluation of NFC technology, by uncovering age differences
   impacts on new technology adoption.}},

Abstract = {{The Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) technique has reached
   a prominent position among analytical methods employed in a great
   variety of fields, from medicine and biology (fluorescence spectroscopy)
   to telemetry (laser ranging) and communication (quantum cryptography).
   Nevertheless the development of TCSPC acquisition systems featuring both
   a high number of parallel channels and very high performance is still an
   open challenge: to satisfy the tight requirements set by the
   applications, a fully parallel acquisition system requires not only high
   efficiency single photon detectors but also a read-out electronics
   specifically designed to obtain the highest performance in conjunction
   with these sensors.
   To this aim three main blocks have been designed: a gigahertz bandwidth
   front-end stage to directly read the custom technology SPAD array
   avalanche current, a reconfigurable logic to route the detectors output
   signals to the acquisition chain and an array of time measurement
   circuits capable of recording the photon arrival times with picoseconds
   time resolution and a very high linearity. An innovative architecture
   based on these three circuits will feature a very high number of
   detectors to perform a truly parallel spatial or spectral analysis and a
   smaller number of high performance time-to-amplitude converter offering
   very high performance and a very high conversion frequency while
   limiting the area occupation and power dissipation. The routing logic
   will make the dynamic connection between the two arrays possible in
   order to guarantee that no information gets lost.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the development of
   digitisation practices at the National Library of Australia Document
   Supply Service, its convergence with similar efforts in the Library's
   Digitisation and Photography Branch, and how the Library used Relais to
   manage and report on its digitisation activities.
   Design/methodology/approach - 7 The authors use a case study approach
   and their own personal experiences with implementing these services.
   Findings - Digitisation based on ILL/DD user demand contributes to
   building a library's digital collections and helps to preserve valuable
   collections. Libraries are encouraged to seize opportunities that help
   to achieve its strategic goals, experiment with new and different
   approaches and technologies, persevere in the face of obstacles or slow
   uptake of ideas and solutions, and never stop looking for opportunities
   to improve user services.
   Originality/value - This paper was originally presented at the IFLA

Journal = {{AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{282-290}},
Abstract = {{This paper is aimed to the investigation on innovative distributed
   negative group delay (DNGD) circuits for RF communication. Thanks to the
   analogy between the lumped and distributed circuits, NGD circuit
   topologies were identified. By using the S-parameter theory, analysis
   and synthesis methods of these topologies are proposed. The DNGD
   circuits developed are mainly comprised of a transistor combined with a
   series resistance ended by a stub. Then, synthesis relations enabling to
   determine the NGD circuit parameters from the desired NGD and gain
   values are established. As application, an active phase shifter (PS)
   operating independently with the frequency based on the cascade of PGD
   and NGD devices was synthesized. First, an NGD PS with transmission
   phase of (135 +/- 5)degrees around 2.56 GHz over the bandwidth of about
   1.02 GHz was obtained. Then, a two-stage DNGD PS exhibiting 90 degrees
   with +/- 10 degrees flatness from 4.1 GHz to 6.8 GHz was designed. The
   DNGD circuit presented can be used in various telecommunication areas
   notably for correcting RF/numerical signal delays in the RF-microwave
   analogue-digital devices. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Digital tomosynthesis is an innovative imaging technology for early
   breast cancer detection by providing three-dimensional anatomical
   information with fast image acquisition and low-dose radiation. Most of
   current breast tomosynthesis systems utilize a design where a single
   x-ray tube moves along an arc above objects over a certain angular
   range. The mechanical movement and patient motion during the scan may
   degrade image quality. With a carbon nanotube-based multibeam x-ray
   source, a new breast tomosynthesis modality is innovated, which will
   potentially produce better image quality with stationary beam sources
   and faster scan and it enables a variety of beam distributions. In this
   study, several beam distributions, such as beam sources spanning along a
   one-dimensional (1-D) parallel configuration and sources over a
   two-dimensional (2-D) rectangle shape are investigated based on computer
   simulations. Preliminary results show that 2-D rectangle shapes
   outperform 1-D parallel shapes by providing better Z-resolution,
   enhanced image contrast, reduced out-of-plane blur and artifacts and
   lower reconstruction noise. These benefits may expand tomosynthesis
   applications to diagnostic and interventional procedures. (C) 2014 SPIE

Abstract = {{Systematic incorporation of digital games in schools is largely
   unexplored. This case study explored the ecological conditions necessary
   for implementing a game-based learning course by examining the
   interaction between three domains (the innovator, the innovation, and
   the context). From January-April 2012, one in-service teacher learned
   and applied the Play Curricular activity Reflection Discussion (PCaRD)
   pedagogical model using the game RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 in a 5th and a
   6th, grade classroom to support student learning of systems thinking.
   Data sources included a knowledge test, interviews, and participant and
   video observations. The teacher (innovator) successfully adopted the
   PCaRD model (innovation) as a pedagogical guide for teaching systems
   thinking with the game in the school (context). Students had
   statistically significant gains in introductory systems thinking
   knowledge. Conclusions and implications are discussed for integrating
   games using our ecological approach.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{96-105}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The research issues of digital preservation have apparently
   moved from how to set up the digital archives to on-going business
   models. The aim of this paper is to investigate the key factors for
   digital archives' success. This paper provides a business model for the
   sustainability of digital archives.
   Design/methodology/approach - Both pricing strategies and business
   models related to digital archives are very important. From the point of
   archive preservation, how to preserve digital archives permanently and
   make them accessible are the most important research issues. This paper,
   based on a review of the academic literature, adopts the innovative
   pricing approach to develop the business models and pricing strategy.
   Findings - The research defines the different needs at start-up versus
   the on-going operations for digital preservation. Considering digital
   archives as information goods, this study adopts the TRIZ method to
   establish a pricing strategy for digital preservation. It discusses the
   pricing strategy for digital preservation using an innovative method of
   creative problem-solving theory from the perspectives of the archives
   institutes, materials providers and consumers.
   Originality/value - This study recommends the pricing strategies for the
   digital preservation programs and the government's price policy based on
   the TRIZ analysis method.}},

Abstract = {{A modified nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs
   (NARMAX) model-based state-space self-tuner with fault tolerance is
   proposed in this paper for the unknown nonlinear stochastic hybrid
   system with a direct transmission matrix from input to output Through
   the off-line observer/Kalman filter identification method, one has a
   good initial guess of modified NARMAX model to reduce the on-line system
   identification process time. Then, based on the modified NARMAX-based
   system identification, a corresponding adaptive digital control scheme
   is presented for the unknown continuous-time nonlinear system, with an
   input-output direct transmission term, which also has measurement and
   system noises and inaccessible system states. Besides, an effective
   state space self-turner with fault tolerance scheme is presented for the
   unknown multivariable stochastic system. A quantitative criterion is
   suggested by comparing the innovation process error estimated by the
   Kalman filter estimation algorithm, so that a weighting matrix resetting
   technique by adjusting and resetting the covariance matrices of
   parameter estimate obtained by the Kalman filter estimation algorithm is
   utilized to achieve the parameter estimation for faulty system recovery.
   Consequently, the proposed method can effectively cope with partially
   abrupt and/or gradual system faults and input failures by the fault
   detection. (C) 2013 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   procedure to represent some of the more important digital communications
   signals by using a simple mathematical tool. All new analytical concepts
   presented here can be used as definitions of these signals and the great
   improvement is the fact that we can manipulate all of them through some
   flexible as well as original mathematical operations. This theoretical
   technique permits us to represent all classic analogical waves by using
   periodic and non-periodic continuous functions such that they can be
   seen as a video color signal or a simple sequence of zeros and ones. By
   using a nonlinear operator, it is possible to define analytically a wide
   class of important electromagnetic waves.}},

Abstract = {{Successful intracellular delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics relies on
   multiaspect optimization, one of which is formulation. While there has
   been ample innovation on chemical design of polymeric gene carriers, the
   same cannot be said for physical processing of polymer-DNA nanocomplexes
   (polyplexes). Conventional synthesis of polyplexes by bulk mixing
   depends on the operators' experience. The poorly controlled bulk mixing
   process may also lead to batch-to-batch variation and consequent
   irreproducibility. Here, we synthesize polyplexes by using a
   three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing (3D-HF) technique in a
   single-layered, planar microfluidic device. Without any additional
   chemical treatment or postprocessing, the polyplexes prepared by the
   3D-HF method show smaller size, slower aggregation rate, and higher
   transfection efficiency, while exhibiting reduced cytotoxicity compared
   to the ones synthesized by conventional bulk mixing. In addition, by
   introducing external acoustic perturbation, mixing can be further
   enhanced, leading to even smaller nanocomplexes. The 3D-HF method
   provides a simple and reproducible process for synthesizing high-quality
   polyplexes, addressing a critical barrier in the eventual translation of
   nucleic acid therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{Combining the strong anti-interference advantages of OFDM technology and
   the time-frequency analysis features of fractional Fourier transform
   (FFT), we apply OFDM as the coding modulation technology for digital
   watermarking. Based on the Arnold scrambling and OFDM coding, an
   innovative DFRFT digital watermarking algorithm is proposed. First, the
   watermark information is subjected to the Arnold scrambling encryption
   and OFDM coding transform. Then it is embedded into the FFT domain
   amplitude. The three parameters of scrambling iterations number, t, FFT
   order, p, and the watermark information embedded position, L, are used
   as keys, so that the algorithm has high safety. A simulation shows that
   the algorithm is highly robust against noise, filtering, compression,
   and other general attacks. The algorithm not only has strong security,
   but also makes a good balance between invisibility and robustness. But
   the possibility of using OFDM technique in robust image watermarking has
   drawn a very little attention.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies show empirical evidence on the positive effect on
   students' performance from the adoption of innovations in the technology
   of teaching and learning. These innovations do not affect all teaching
   methods and learning styles equally. Rather, it depends on some
   variables, such as the strategy of a university towards adoption of
   Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), students' abilities,
   technology uses in the educational process by teachers and students, or
   the selection of a methodology that matches with digital uses. This
   paper provides answers to these questions with data from an experimental
   set-up performed within the eLene-EE project, and using an empirical
   model based on structural equations. Our results show that motivation is
   the main variable affecting performance of online students, confirming
   the importance of this factor as a source of educational efficiency.
   Motivation appears in our model as a latent variable receiving the
   influence of students' perception of efficiency, which is, in turn, a
   driver for the indirect positive and significant effect on students'
   performance from students' ability in ICT uses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Physicians clinically use laryngeal video stroboscope as an auxiliary
   instrument to test glottal diseases, and read vocal fold images and

   vocal fold image is different, making it impossible to directly estimate
   relevant glottis physiological parameters, such as the length, area,
   perimeter, and opening angle of the glottis. Hence, this study designs
   an innovative laser projection marking module for the laryngeal video
   stroboscope to provide reference parameters for image scaling
   conversion. This innovative laser projection marking module to be
   installed on the laryngeal video stroboscope using laser beams to

Abstract = {{Aim: To propose an innovative methodology for the monitoring of the
   evolution of induced subcutaneous tumors in mice. Materials and Methods:
   A new 3D scanner able to measure the tumor mass volume is presented. The
   scanner is based on the projection of a fringe pattern onto the sample
   surface (structured light). The lines are diffused by the sample and
   then collected by a digital camera. The obtained 2D-image is treated by
   the scanner's software that extracts the 3D information and evaluates
   the sample volume. Results: The 3D scanner has been successfully used in
   the measurement of subcutaneous HT-29 colorectal cancer xenografts
   treated with 5-fluorouracil, bevacizumab and their combination.
   Comparison with simple caliper measurements revealed important and
   significant differences between the two measurement techniques.
   Conclusion: The proposed methodology is more effective than the usual
   approach based on caliper measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) has been emerged recently as an
   innovative approach to full volume (i.e. internal) displacement and
   strain field measurement in materials and structures, particularly in
   conjunction with high resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT). As a
   relatively novel technique certain aspects of precision, accuracy and
   the breadth of application are yet to be fully established. This study
   has applied DVC to volume images of porcine trabecular bone assessing
   the effect of noise and sub-volume size on strain measurement. Strain
   resolutions ranging between 70 and 800 mu epsilon were obtained for the
   optimum sub-volume size of 64 voxels with a 50\% overlap for
   metrological studies conducted. These values allowed the mechanical
   behaviour of porcine trabecular bone during compression to be
   investigated. During compression a crushed layer formed adjacent to the
   boundary plate which increased in thickness as the specimen was further
   deformed. The structure of the crushed layer was altered to such an
   extent that it confounded the correlation method. While investigating
   this factor, it was found that for reliable strain calculations a
   correlation coefficient of 0.90 or above was required between the
   sub-volumes in the reference and the deformed volumes.
   Good agreements between the results and published bone strain failures
   were obtained. Using the full field strain measurements, Poisson's ratio
   was identified for each compression step using a dedicated inverse
   method called the virtual fields method (VFM). It was found that for a
   given region outside of the crushed zone the Poisson ratio decreased
   from 0.32 to 0.21 between the first and the final compression steps,
   which was hypothesised to be due to the bone geometry and its resulting
   deformation behaviour.

Abstract = {{Expansion of games industry came in modern life, accompanied with
   innovative features in a game controller. Nowadays mobile industry is
   booming with the expansion of the variety of novel technologies, such as
   the use of 3D accelerometer sensors, high resolution cameras, the
   capability of connecting to wireless networks and so on. Therefore, a
   smartphone can be added with the game control functions to become a
   mobile game controller. In this paper, we propose the design and
   implementation of making a mobile phone as a game controller using User
   Datagram Protocol socket programming. This system is developed by Java 2
   Standard Edition and Google Android Software Development Kits which has
   already provided sensor and multi-touch APIs. We successfully realize a
   reconfigurable mobile game controller on a mobile smartphone to interact
   with the existing digital games by mapping control functions on the
   server. Acceptable performance is shown to validate the effectiveness of
   our solution.}},

Title = {{Extended Interference Matrices for Exploded View of Assembly Planning}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{279-286}},

Abstract = {{One of the tasks in assembly planning is to create the exploded views
   for the visualization purpose and the verification of assembly plans. In
   this paper, we introduce how to generate exploded views automatically
   from an assembly model. To increase the level of automation, a new
   relational matrix called extended interference matrix (EIM) is used to
   represent the assembly relations among constitutive parts. Information
   in an EIM is used to create the exploded views. An innovative method is
   developed to generate the exploded views based on the assembly sequences
   and EIMs. The corresponding Application Programming Interface (API) to
   the Unigraphics software has been developed as an integration of the
   algorithm with the CAD software tool. The assembly model of a gear
   reducer is used as a case study.
   Note to Practitioners-Most of the existing methods for assembly planning
   are applicable to simple products with less number of parts, and still,
   the modeling processes usually need manual interventions. These methods
   are impractical to deal with the assembly planning for complex products.
   The primary purpose of this study is to propose a new approach applied
   to generate the exploded views of the assembly plans of complex
   products. The developed approach is in particular suitable to products
   with inclined assembly planes. The corresponding algorithm has been
   proven reliable and having better visualization performance in
   comparison with the results from existing algorithms and other
   commercial tools. It can be used as a standalone software tool or as an
   add-on tool to commercial CAD systems. As a part of the critical
   components of an integrated assembly planning system, the algorithm has
   been applied in assembly planning of aero-plane products including
   aero-engines.}},

Abstract = {{The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer operates in the
   L-band protected spectrum (1400-1427 MHz) that is known to be vulnerable
   to radio-frequency interference (RFI). Although transmissions are
   forbidden at these frequencies by international regulations,
   ground-based, airborne, and spaceborne radiometric observations show
   substantial evidence of out-of-band emissions from neighboring
   transmitters and possibly illegally operating emitters. The spectral
   environment that SMAP faces includes not only occasional large levels of
   RFI but also significant amounts of low-level RFI equivalent to a
   brightness temperature of 0.1-10 K at the radiometer output. This
   low-level interference would be enough to jeopardize the success of a
   mission without an aggressive mitigation solution, including special
   flight hardware and ground software with capabilities of RFI detection
   and removal. SMAP takes a multidomain approach to RFI mitigation by
   utilizing an innovative onboard digital detector back end with digital
   signal processing algorithms to characterize the time, frequency,
   polarization, and statistical properties of the received signals. Almost
   1000 times more measurements than what is conventionally necessary are
   collected to enable the ground processing algorithm to detect and remove
   harmful interference. Multiple RFI detectors are run on the ground, and
   their outputs are combined for maximum likelihood of detection to remove
   the RFI within a footprint. The capabilities of the hardware and
   software systems are successfully demonstrated using test data collected
   with a SMAP radiometer engineering test unit.}},

Abstract = {{The advances in technology, especially in the field of communication,
   cause mass media to constantly evolve- and thus not to perish. Indeed,
   this occurs in situations that are marked by a series of media
   transformations and changes that have affected journalism as a
   profession and mass media as a process. The studies that have resulted
   from these changes have been positive and negative. This paper analyses
   the digital media panorama in Ecuador, the characteristics of journalism
   culture and the specific usage of web content. It describes the trends
   of the main digital media in the country, which have been selected for a
   case study. The article takes as a core reference `ten digital trends in
   media communication' proposed by Cerezo-Gilarranz - a specialist in
   digital strategies. We then focus on the deficiencies of Ecuadorian mass
   media, which is mainly due to a lack of control over technological
   environments and the scarcity of links between business and journalism
   projects that have technological and innovative support, such as the
   usage of social networks and others. The final result is a detailed
   guide to the weaknesses and strengths of each digital medium that has
   been studied. Furthermore, this work highlights reliable trends so that
   the selected media can orientate towards digital environments. This is
   achieved by making use of technological tools for creating business and
   service opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{This study endeavors to shed some light on the notion of co-creation in
   the global context of new media user participation and its relationship
   with innovation. First, the different discourses surrounding the notion
   of co-creation will be discussed, which are mainly addressed to
   industry-oriented projects. Alternatively, a nondirected case study
   focused on digital photography will be presented, enabling an analysis
   of co-creation through the lens of the theories of creativity.
   Consequently, through connecting creativity with our fieldwork, we
   suggest that the transformation of a cultural field by means of
   co-creation can lead to innovations that affect the entire field.}},

Abstract = {{Single reference-phase-based methods have been extensively utilized in
   digital fringe projection systems, yet they might not provide the

   presents an innovative method to improve the measurement quality by
   utilizing two orthogonal phase maps. Specifically, two reference phase
   maps generated from horizontal and vertical (i.e., orthogonal) fringe
   patterns projected are combined into a vector reference phase map

Title = {{Shoreline extraction from light detection and ranging digital elevation
   model data and aerial images}},
Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There is an increased demand for understanding the accurate position of
   the shorelines. The automatic extraction of shorelines utilizing the
   digital elevation models (DEMs) obtained from light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR), aerial images, and multispectral images has become very
   promising. In this article, we develop two innovative algorithms that
   can effectively extract shorelines depending on the available data
   sources. The first is a multistep morphological technique that works on
   LiDAR DEM with respect to a tidal datum, whereas the second depends on
   the availability of training data to extract shorelines from LiDAR DEM
   fused with aerial images. Unlike similar techniques, the morphological
   approach detects and eliminates the outliers that result from waves,
   etc., by means of an anomaly test with neighborhood constraints.
   Additionally, it eliminates docks, bridges, and fishing piers along the
   extracted shorelines by means of Hough transform. The second approach
   extracts the shoreline by means of color space conversion of the aerial
   images and the support vector machines classifier to segment the fused
   data into water and land. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate
   the confidence interval for the error in shoreline position. Compared
   with other relevant techniques in literature, the proposed methods offer
   better accuracy in shoreline extraction. (C) 2014 Society of

Abstract = {{Background: Pentacyclic triterpenoids improve epidermal barrier function
   and induce collagen production. Here, their effects on cutaneous aging
   by means of objective instrumental measurements were elucidated.
   Methods: Reconstituted human epidermis, cultivated keratinocytes and
   fibroblasts were incubated with Terminalia arjuna triterpenes (T. arjuna
   bark extract), and mRNA and protein expression of various genes was
   determined using microarray analysis, qRT-PCR and ELISA techniques.
   Clinical efficacy of T. arjuna bark extract versus vehicle control cream
   was elucidated in 30 patients and transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin
   hydration and elasticity were measured. Another 30 female patients in
   their postmenopausal phase were treated with a similar regime, and skin
   sebum content, cutaneous blood microcirculation and skin
   density/echogenicity were assessed. Results: Incubation with T. arjuna
   triterpenes increased FGF-2, TSP-1, TGF-beta and CTGF expression, and
   VEGF secretion in vitro. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase release upon
   sodium dodecyl sulphate challenge was reversed by the application of T.
   arjuna bark extract. T. arjuna bark extract decreased TEWL, improved
   skin moisturization, reduced scaliness and led to significantly improved
   skin elasticity. Also, increases in blood microflow and skin sebum
   content as well as improved skin thickness/echogenicity were noted on
   postmenopausal skin, resulting in visible reduction of sagging skin on
   the jowls as demonstrated by digital photography. Conclusion: T. arjuna
   bark extract appears as an innovative active ingredient that exerts
   versatile antiaging properties in vitro and in vivo. (C) 2013 S. Karger

Abstract = {{Low-power applications, such as sensing, are becoming increasingly
   important and demanding in terms of minimizing energy consumption,
   driving the search for new and innovative interface architectures and
   technologies. Carbon nanotube FETs (CNFETs) are excellent candidates for
   further energy reduction, as CNFET-based digital circuits are projected
   to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in energy-delay product
   compared with silicon-CMOS at highly scaled technology nodes. However,
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to imperfections and
   variations such as those induced by mispositioned and metallic CNTs.
   These substantial imperfections and variations have prevented the
   demonstration of complex CNFET circuits until now. This paper presents
   the first demonstration of a subsystem, which is a complete capacitive
   sensor interface circuit, implemented entirely using CNFETs that can be
   fabricated reproducibly in a VLSI-compatible fashion. This is made
   possible by: 1) a digitally oriented interface architecture and 2) the
   imperfection-immune design paradigm, which combines design and
   processing techniques to successfully overcome CNT imperfections and
   variations. In addition to electrical measurements, we demonstrate
   correct operation of our CNFET circuitry by interfacing it with a sensor
   used to control a handshaking robot.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional task of the pathologist is to assist physicians in
   making the correct diagnosis of diseases at the earliest possible stage
   to effectuate the optimal treatment strategy for each individual
   patient. In this respect surgical pathology (the traditional tissue
   diagnosis) is but a tool. It is not, of itself, the purpose of pathology
   practice; and change is in the air. This January 2014 issue of Applied
   Immunohistochemistry and Molecular Morphology (AIMM) embraces that
   change by the incorporation of the agenda and content of the journal
   Diagnostic Molecular Morphology (DMP). Over a decade ago AIMM introduced
   and promoted the concept of molecular morphology, and has sought to
   publish molecular studies that correlate with the morphologic features
   that continue to define cancer and many diseases. That intent is now
   reinforced and extended by the merger with DMP, as a logical and timely
   response to the growing impact of a wide range of genetic and molecular
   technologies that are beginning to reshape the way in which pathology is
   practiced. The use of molecular and genomic techniques already
   demonstrates clear value in the diagnosis of disease, with treatment
   tailored specifically to individual patients. Personalized medicine is
   the future, and personalized medicine demands personalized pathology.
   The need for integration of the flood of new molecular data, with
   surgical pathology, digital pathology, and the full range of pathology
   data in the electronic medical record has never been greater. This
   review describes the possible impact of these pressures upon the
   discipline of pathology, and examines possible outcomes. There is a
   sense of excitement and adventure. Active adaption and innovation are
   required. The new AIMM, incorporating DMP, seeks to position itself for
   a central role in this process.}},

Abstract = {{The search for new business ideas-and models-is hit-or-miss at most
   firms. Tackling the problem systematically, of course, will improve your
   odds of success. Traditional ways of framing this search examine
   competencies, customer needs, and shifts in the landscape. This article
   proposes adding a new IT-based framework. It involves asking, How can
   data and analytic tools be used to create new value?
   The authors have explored that question with many clients. In their
   work, they've seen IT create new value in five patterns: using data from
   sensors in objects to improve offerings (think smart energy meters);
   digitizing physical assets (such as health records); combining data
   within and across industries (to, say, coordinate supply chains);
   trading data (as mobile providers do with information on users'
   where-abouts); and codifying best-in-class capabilities (such as online
   expense management) as services.
   Drawing on examples from their own experience and their clients', the
   authors walk readers through each of the five patterns and how to apply
   them. They also provide advice and questions that will help executives
   get started on their own searches.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years a rapid development in spaceborne SAR technology can be
   observed. This development is driven by a wide variety of applications
   like the generation of highly accurate digital elevation models, the
   measurement of Earth surface deformation and others, with simultaneously
   high spatial and temporal resolution. Especially the demand of high
   resolution SAR imagery challenges engineers to use available technology
   to full capacity. An antenna concept which finds more and more promotion
   in the SAR community are array-fed unfoldable mesh reflectors. This
   concept is supplemented by a trend towards digital radars, where the
   signal is brought to the discrete domain almost immediately after
   reception. This allows for new powerful SAR modes, exceeding present-day
   SAR overall capabilities in terms of sensitivity, resolution and swath
   width by two orders of magnitude. Needless to say that such innovative
   SAR sensors require a thorough investigation by means of dedicated
   concept studies. This paper presents first digital beamforming results
   with a reflector based multi-channel radar demonstrator. Emphasis is
   laid on the verification of selected beamforming techniques, which help
   to show the principal feasibility of digital multi-channel SAR systems.}},

Abstract = {{TanDEM-X is an innovative satellite mission, formed by two radar
   satellites that build a large synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   interferometer. As they simultaneously acquire images of the same place
   on the Earth's surface from slightly different positions (bistatic
   mode), high resolution digital surface models (DSMs) of the area of
   investigation can be generated. We use the bistatic TanDEM-X data to
   observe large topographic changes at active dome-building volcanoes by
   means of double differential InSAR. In the present study, we generate a
   time series of DSMs of Volcan de Colima, Mexico. To test the
   applicability of the TanDEM-X data for volcano monitoring we compare the
   received volcano dome changes to a study in which photographs were used
   to derive high resolution DSMs of the volcano summit.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with multiple transmit and receive
   channels (MIMO-SAR) has a higher flexibility and an improved efficiency
   compared to a conventional SAR system with a single channel. The
   multiple receive channels can be used, among other things, to increase
   the swath width at constant azimuth resolution or to suppress spatial
   interferences. However, multiple transmit channels, which transmit
   simultaneously in the same frequency band provide currently a challenge.
   The generation of a waveform which is orthogonal for distributed
   scatterers, proves to be excluded with conventional methods. Therefore,
   in this paper a modified chirp waveform is introduced which extends in
   combination with digital beam-forming (DBF) on receive the orthogonality
   condition to another degree of freedom, thus allowing perfect
   orthogonality. Furthermore, the hardware design of the MIMO-Radar
   Demonstrator, a multi-channel measurement system for radar and SAR
   applications is shown. This system developed at the German Aerospace
   Centre allows the metrological verification of the waveforms presented
   in this paper, and other innovative concepts for future spaceborne Earth
   observation missions.}},

Abstract = {{Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) compose a large portion of Sri
   Lankan economy due to their significant contribution in terms of
   employment, domestic resource usage, innovation, exports, regional
   development, and stimulating other economic activities. This sector is
   believed to be the `backbone' of both developed and developing
   economies. Therefore healthy performance of SME sector is paramount
   important in economy of any country.
   The businesses, irrespective of their scale of operation, are digitizing
   rapidly, to enhance their presence and delivery. The information systems
   have become a smart approach of exploiting in this digitization.
   However, necessitate of these `chief players' in the economy have been
   ignored by majority of Enterprise Information System (EIS) applications.
   The paper first identifies and prioritises factors that determine SMEs
   willingness and attractiveness towards EISs, using TOE
   (Technology-Organisation-Environment) Framework following
   recommendations EIS vendors, SME and IT policy makers can adapt to
   address the gap in current level and the potential for SME EIS adoption
   in Sri Lanka.
   The research findings will assist SMEs to create business opportunities

Abstract = {{Recently the theories of sparse representation (SR) and dictionary
   learning (DL) have brought much attention and become powerful tools for
   pattern recognition and computer vision. Due to the fact that images can
   be represented in a sparse and compressible way with respect to some
   dictionaries, these theories have shown successful applications in many
   different areas including face recognition, image denoising and
   inpainting, medical imaging, image classification and registration,
   motion estimation, and many more. Over a relatively short time, many
   improvements and innovative ideas using SR and DL have been developed.
   However, very little published work is found in the application of these
   theories on handwritten character recognition. One question comes to
   mind is whether these theories could produce good results for
   handwritten character recognition as in the case of other applications.
   In this paper, we would like to address this question by investigating
   various applications of the theories to handwritten character
   recognition. Experiments were conducted in both handwritten digits and
   alphabetical characters on three benchmark databases: MNIST, USPS, and
   CEDAR. The results showed that while this approach can achieve good
   results, it cannot beat the state of the art. The main advantage of this
   approach is that it does not require the choice of features and hence it
   may reduce computational cost.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of the digital technology, the Internet
   information technology, and the mobile communication technology promotes
   the rapid development of the new media era. The rapid development of the
   new media not only makes the university ideological and political
   education undergone profound changes, but also brings the severe
   challenges to the ideological and political education in colleges and
   universities. The ideological and political education in colleges and
   universities should keep pace with the times, and we should pay
   attention to the conveniences that the new media technology brings about
   to the college ideological and political education, and should regard it
   as the effective means for the ideological and political education, to
   promote the innovation of the means of the ideological and political
   education in colleges and universities, to adapt to the current new
   changes.
   With the rapid development of the modern science and technology, the new
   media with the Internet, the TV network, and the mobile phones as the
   representation is changing people's daily life, a way of thinking and
   values, and in particular, it has exerted a far-reaching influence on
   the contemporary college students. According to the statistics, the
   number of the university internet users now almost reached 100\% of the
   number of the university students, among whom 90.5\% of the college
   students will treat the Internet as an important channel to have access
   to the information. This kind of phenomenon has brought opportunities
   and challenges for college ideological and political education work.
   Faced with the new situation, we should give full play to the
   comprehensive effects of the old and new media. We should use the new
   media to innovate the means and the carriers in the ideological and
   political education work in colleges and universities, give full play to
   the positive roles of the new media, and strengthen the construction of
   the campus network cultures and the information literacy education, to
   implement the close combination between the new media and the
   ideological and political education of the students.}},

Abstract = {{Current innovations in electronics combine performance, size and cost
   criteria. Nevertheless, in the all-digital era, the 2D technology and
   the fabrication of CMOS Integrated Circuit are approaching their
   ultimate limits. As a result, the use of 3D technology in the
   fabrication of different Integrated Circuits becomes very appealing.
   Among the aspects of the 3D Integration we find the Through Silicon Vias
   (TSVs), short vertical interconnects that convey the different layers
   all kind of signals. 3D integration, first introduced for memory chips,
   has later found increasing application to other domains in
   microelectronics. The aim of this research is to investigate the
   electrical performances of MOS devices which have nearby such a type of
   interconnects (TSVs) in view of optimizing their behavior with the
   implementation of an analytical model able to describe the TSVs behavior
   at the circuit level in order to predict and optimize the performance of
   MOS devices with 3D-TSV interconnect. The accuracy of this model is
   eventually validated using numerical TCAD simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Flipping a classroom is an innovative teaching method in itself. This
   method faces additional challenges when the students are not actually
   engineering majors. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the
   development, implementation, and assessment of a flipped classroom for a
   thermal-fluids course for non-engineering majors.
   Problem solving is a critical component of engineering education; an
   engineering student cannot only read problem statements or solely attend
   a lecture. However, duration of student contact in the classroom is
   constrained by credit hours. In a local survey, most students indicated
   that they would not take the time to complete not-for-grade problems on
   their own after class. For many of these students, graded homework
   assignments are the first and only experience they have in solving
   complex engineering problems prior to exams. By only receiving lectures
   and struggling to work homework problems individually, it is arguable
   that few of these students are able to progress beyond the lower tiers
   of Bloom's taxonomy. Historical time survey data suggests that the
   students conduct little to no daily preparation when there are no graded
   requirements and conversely show extremely large time spikes when out of
   class assignments are due or prior to in-class evaluations. Finally,
   in-class lectures force an instructor to teach a certain amount of
   material in a limited timeframe irrespective of the rate at which each
   student can retain or comprehend that information regardless of the
   experience level of the student.
   Inspired by the pedagogical concept of `flipping the classroom,' Khan
   Academy online instructional videos, and the Thayer Method (whereby
   students prepare prior to class, recite the topic to their instructors
   and receive daily evaluations) the authors created a blended course.
   This blended course leveraged the digital age through video lectures
   before class and combined it with traditional engineering problem
   solving in class. The goals of this blended course are as follows:
   improve the quality and efficiency of student learning by conducting
   lectures outside of class and homework during class; allow
   non-engineering students to learn each lesson's material at their own
   pace and provide a valuable study tool for exam preparation; increase
   the time spent in classroom solving problems with instructors; leverage
   one-on-one time in the classroom where the instructor can better
   approach each individual's issues; encourage and enable non-engineering
   students to take more responsibility for their learning and become
   lifelong learners; and inspire intellectual curiosity in the field of
   engineering. The instructors developed a preliminary beta test for the
   initial third of an undergraduate introductory course in thermal-fluid
   systems and kept the remainder of the course unchanged from its
   traditional lecture method to gain student feedback. This feedback was
   used to develop a completely blended course consisting of
   non-engineering majors; the results of which are studied and presented
   in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{STEM disciplines, especially at research universities, have been
   measurably slow to integrate online modalities into undergraduate
   classes. Current and future students are now ``digital natives{''}
   interacting with the world and absorbing information in a very
   ``YouTube{''} style, characterized by short, on-demand, and entertaining
   chunks of information. Faculty have been reticent to adopt what they
   perceive to be unproven technologies while administrators often are
   unable to allow faculty extra time or budget to investigate the efficacy
   of new approaches to teaching. This paper describes the results of
   experiments designed to help improve this situation by accessing the
   effectiveness of two key online modalities that are often the easiest
   first steps for faculty to adopt and can be very effective in improving
   the operational effectiveness and learning outcomes of the course:
   Recorded lectures and Online Quizzes. Recorded lectures and Quizzes were
   integrated into two undergraduate engineering courses. The two courses
   were a sophomore level Dynamics class and a senior level Finite Element
   Analysis course. The Dynamics course is required and the enrollments
   range from 160-360, and the Finite Element Analysis course is an
   elective with enrollments between 60-80. In the Dynamics course,
   recorded lectures were often used in place of the live lecture and the
   in-class lecture time was often ``flipped{''} and used for discussion
   and interaction rather than a traditional one-way lecture. In the Finite
   Element Analysis course, the lectures were recorded and made available
   to the students prior to the in-class version of the lecture. Quizzes
   were designed as an assessment tool (rather than purely for grading)
   aimed at ``real time{''} feedback. This allowed both students and
   instructors to measure the learning achievements in the previous week of
   the course and let the instructor modify the subsequent week's lectures
   accordingly. The results show that student-reported learning efficiency
   improves when recorded lectures are utilized. This was the case whether
   the class period was subsequently used to teach a similar lecture or if
   lecture time was flipped to provide more interactive discussion based
   learning. The availability of recorded lectures prior to class did not
   affect students' decision to attend class. Students reported that having
   weekly ``low stakes{''} quizzes and reviewing them in class helped them
   understand key concepts better. These results provide more evidence of
   an ever increasing amount of data that supports the learning efficiency
   gains that can be attained using a variety of hybrid course pedagogy and
   online learning modalities.
   The debate over the need to adjust teaching methodologies based on the
   prominence of Digital Natives within undergraduate college courses has
   continued since the term originated (Presnky, 2001) early in this
   millennium. Recent studies have focused this debate away from the
   terminology and towards those activities that can help improve learning
   outcomes for students not easily described by a single term. It is
   important to consider the nature of how students interact with the world
   around them terms of behavior, learning styles, and use of technology.
   Students have indeed changed in the past two decades and adapting to
   those changes improves learning outcomes and student satisfaction.
   Regardless of the technology utilized, students still prefer
   Blended/Hybrid classes that employ a course website to compliment live
   class meetings. In a recent study of over 112,000 undergraduate
   students, a majority (57.7\%) indicated that their preferred type of
   courses were those that had some online components. Only 22.1 \% of
   these students preferred courses with no online components and a very
   small 7.8\% preferred online only courses (Allen, 2013). In the same
   study, students reported lecture capture as their number one priority
   for faculty to use more of in the future. Students also report that
   having some control of the pace of learning can help them be more
   effective (Wibee, 2011). This study was designed to address the changing
   needs of students and their stated preferences related to their use of
   recorded lectures and online quizzes in hybrid STEM classes. This paper
   summarizes some initial qualitative results that are part of a broader
   and more quantitative study that is planned for the 2014-2015 school
   years.
   There is still some variation in the use and definition of term such as
   ``blended{''} and ``hybrid{''} in related research. To be clear, in this
   study the term ``hybrid{''} is used to describe courses which have live,
   face-to-face meetings in a physical classroom each week and include a
   significant amount of additional materials as well as technical and
   procedural innovations available from the course website. This includes
   ``flipping{''} the classroom in which lectures are recorded but students
   still attend live class for discussion of the material and other active
   learning activities.}},

Abstract = {{According to many researchers, students learn best when they are
   actively engaged in the learning process. The more opportunities
   provided for students to participate and be involved, the better they
   ought to achieve from the course. In many cases, professors need to go
   beyond the institutional and technological barriers to deliver the best
   of class education. Many professors frequently use multimedia
   application such as PowerPoint, graphics, audio, video \& animation in
   courses to promote student involvement in their learning. PowerPoint
   supports hyperlinks and sound features that can easily create an
   interactive presentation that provides opportunities for students to
   employ higher cognitive strategies. Digital video and animation are
   invaluable tool for demonstrating processes such as automation. This
   paper highlights some uses of classroom tools and technology in a
   particular institution which were proven effective.
   Nowadays online course delivery is a popular concept, but it has some
   issues with engaging students. There are some very effective common
   tools that can be used in online classes to improve students'
   engagement. It is very unlikely that a single tool or technique is
   enough for online learning. Creative uses of a combination of tools
   serve better in this case. Some of these tools are: email, discussion
   boards, application sharing, selective release, podcasting, vodcasting,
   and mass texting. Email is a teacher's best friend. Students should be
   encouraged to use email and discussion board extensively. They need to
   be monitored for their discussions on course management site continually
   and guided constructively. Discussions generate ideas, help create a
   learning community in online classes, provide discussion transcripts,
   provide a means of online conference and collaboration, and get students
   thinking in writing as they write. It is shown that archived lectures
   with the PowerPoint slides helps student the most. Competitive group
   projects are common course requirements. Technology such as selective
   release can create work environment so that students within the group
   use their specific room as virtual communication platform. It makes easy
   for students to do brain storming and share files with their group
   members without revealing information to other groups.}},

Abstract = {{It is envisaged that end-user access bandwidth requirements will notably
   increase in the coming years; at the same time, the number of connected
   mobile devices will also exponentially grow as the fully-digital
   connected homes (Internet of Things) becomes an everyday reality. This
   article presents an active remote node (ARN) at an intermediate location
   between the central office and end-user premises, as a flexible and
   future-proofed infrastructure topology approach for solving the
   associated bandwidth and wired-wireless convergence issues. The ARN
   represents the key architectural design innovation of the SODALES
   (SOftware-Defined Access using Low-Energy Subsystems) network. The rise
   of mobile communications, and the trend for seamless convergence between
   fixed and wireless networks is tending to make the purely passive
   approaches (e.g. as exemplified by passive optical networking (PON)
   access architectures) too restrictive, considering the modularity and
   flexibility offered by an active remote node. We present a performance
   analysis of the ARN node, to support the cost-effectiveness of the
   proposed SODALES solution and to demonstrate the potential benefits in
   terms network performance, operational efficiency, and flexible
   functionality. Looking forward, future ARN capabilities can also be
   expected to include hierarchical caching, customer premises equipment
   (CPE) virtualization, and nearer to the end-user location of
   software-defined platforms supporting ubiquitous cloud services.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things is a vision that broadens the scope of the
   internet by incorporating physical objects to identify themselves to the
   participating entities. This innovative concept enables a physical
   device to represent itself in the digital world. There are a lot of
   speculations and future forecasts about the Internet of Things devices.
   However, most of them are vendor specific and lack a unified standard,
   which renders their seamless integration and interoperable operations.
   Another major concern is the lack of security features in these devices
   and their corresponding products. Most of them are resource-starved and
   unable to support computationally complex and resource consuming secure
   algorithms. In this paper, we have proposed a lightweight mutual
   authentication scheme which validates the identities of the
   participating devices before engaging them in communication for the
   resource observation. Our scheme incurs less connection overhead and
   provides a robust defence solution to combat various types of attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Exergames have become an important allied for many professionals of
   health field: physiotherapist, physical education teachers, physicians
   and many others. This new generation of video games has this special
   name because it combines exercise (with the prefix ``exer{''}) and
   games. Also, exergames can be used as a resource to support the
   development of motor skills, promotion of an active living and healthy
   lifestyle, sports skills learning or simply as a tool to increase
   caloric expenditure. Indeed, the entertainment features presented as in
   any other digital game can hold a very important role to make the users
   more active during their leisure activities, instead of sedentary
   lifestyle, commonly perceived in the modern society. Within this
   innovation perspective for video games, this study aims to present the
   evolution of different interfaces, prototypes and patterns where
   exergames were designed with the focus on an Active Living development
   against the typical sedentary style of the former video games in the
   past. Through the conception of promotion of Exercise in this type of
   digital games, this paper will also show as results, how conceptions
   were invented since the decade of 1980 until the current era of
   exergames.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering students show very little gain in high knowledge
   constructions that allows them to integrate and apply in real world
   situations especially to develop the competence and expertise in the
   engineering field {[}1]. In order to achieve the needs of today's
   engineering students in a digital or gadget world environment,
   instructional scaffolding needs to be embedded in the learning process.
   Scaffolding is a key strategy in cognitive apprenticeship {[}2], in
   which students can think critically about engineering and construct
   knowledge via work creatively in teams {[}3]. The aim of this paper is
   to understand the possibility of social interaction, knowledge
   construction and collaboration impact in an online collaborative
   learning environment among engineering students. The knowledge
   construction processes as defined by the instructional scaffolding
   factors will assist educators to redefine the roles and metacognitive
   activities of the lecturers and students in order to make learning
   process in the online collaborative learning environment more efficient,
   meaningful and can improve engineering students' knowledge construction
   process as well as innovative and creative thinking. The findings of
   this study could be used as a basis for further research in an online
   collaborative learning environment. This finding can be applied in a new
   environment, especially in the online collaborative learning environment
   alone, which indicates that educators can use the indicators of the
   instructional scaffolding factors to plan a curricula course.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)
   is one of the important Millennium Development Goal (MDG) {[} I] and
   many countries are working on it. In India, it is being addressed
   through National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Though Government is
   taking huge efforts, considering the vast geographic area and less
   Doctors: Patient ratio, there is a gap in health-care delivery. To
   address this challenge, mHEALTH-PHC - mobile based remote heal thcare
   delivery platform was developed and piloted. This platform enabled
   health workers to digitize the patient's data and ask questions to
   doctors. Doctors could see the questions along with the data and give
   appropriate answers. This experiment was conducted for more than a year
   for a set of approximately 300 expecting mothers in one of the most
   under-developed and remote regions of the state.
   Since this was one of the early initiatives in rural health-care
   delivery, it was a very good learning experience. There were excellent
   interactions and feedback from the ground level health workers. An
   innovative ``Participative Design{''} approach was used for this
   purpose.
   This paper captures the experience of designing a health care
   application for rural India, the tools and methodologies used, issues
   faced and how these were resolved. The paper also discusses the
   strategies used for optimizing the fairly large set of information to
   suit small form factor of mobile screens without losing data fidelity,
   categorization and prioritization. The design was then translated to
   mobile based application. Analysis of usage by the health workers, their
   experience and impact on overall health delivery process was also
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{A cyber physical system for smart cloud traffic control is proposed. It
   is an intellectual (smart) road infrastructure for monitoring and
   control of traffic in real-time through the use of global systems for
   positioning and navigation, mobile gadgets and the Internet in order to
   improve the quality and safety of vehicle movement, as well as for
   minimizing the time and costs when vehicles are moved at the specified
   routes. The main innovative idea is step-by-step transfer of traffic
   lights from the ground to a virtual cloud space for vehicle management,
   equipped with a mobile gadget or computer, which displays on the screen
   map, route, coordinates of the road user and real traffic signals. A set

Abstract = {{This paper is addressing the challenges of incorporating networking and
   security concepts into effective teaching and learning platform (PLab)
   that highlights real-world technical issues. PLab is an innovative
   portable learning platform that allows network applications to be safely
   tested. The isolated network without the need for a server promotes
   learning at anytime and anywhere. The strong connection between academic
   subjects and reality and digital-native students' everyday lives engages
   students in learning this emerging field, and better prepares students
   for the high industrial demands in mobile application development
   workforce. Moreover, this pedagogical model will help faculty develop
   expertise in the latest development of networking and security. The
   modular labware is designed to offer faculty the flexibility to
   implement it in many existing courses. Curricular materials will be
   delivered on Google cloud for its sustainability. This
   ``ready-to-adopt{''} model will greatly save resources and time for
   enhancing modern networking and security education to meet the emerging
   workforce.}},

Abstract = {{Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are constantly adopting Information
   and Communication Technologies (ICT) to improve and enhance the learning
   process. In this sense, constant evolution of assistive technologies
   helps users with disabilities to have a complete set of choices to
   access digital content while working with Virtual Learning Environments
   (VLE), but an intense training for stakeholders involved in curriculum
   design should be prepared to achieve an integral inclusive solution.
   This article proposes an innovative practice to implement, validate and
   promote a working methodology to produce an inclusive curriculum design,
   where teachers and staff administrators have a relevant role while
   designing, preparing and imparting accessible and inclusive courses.
   Teachers need to be instructed on how to generate accessible documents
   and how to provide truly accessible curriculum developments. This work
   presents an initiative promoted by ESVI-AL project, looking to improve
   accessibility in virtual higher education through the definition of
   systematic and replicable methodological processes for the design and
   implementation of accessible virtual curriculum developments. A first
   training experience for teachers in Latin-America is presented.}},

   using mobile devices for multimedia interaction. Users are not only
   viewing the contents, but also utilizing it as a medium for expressing
   their thoughts into a new way of storytelling. However, the way of
   creating contents via the mobile device is not novel, but simply follows
   the traditional media production approach. In this paper, we present
   EMVideo, which is a novel collaboration framework for creating
   multimedia contents through the mobile device. We believe that the
   proposed framework can be utilized as an innovative method for digital
   storytelling and a novel application for social networking.}},

Abstract = {{Resting on our experience of computational epidemiology in practice and
   of industrial projects on analytics of complex networks, we point to an
   innovation opportunity for improving the digital services to
   epidemiologists for monitoring, modeling, and mitigating the effects of
   communicable disease. Artificial intelligence and intelligent analytics
   of syndromic surveillance data promise new insights to epidemiologists,
   but the real value can only be realized if human assessments are paired
   with assessments made by machines. Neither massive data itself, nor
   careful analytics will necessarily lead to better informed decisions.
   The process producing feedback to humans on decision making informed by
   machines can be reversed to consider feedback to machines on decision
   making informed by humans, enabling learning machines. We predict and
   argue for the fact that the sensemaking that such machines can perform
   in tandem with humans can be of immense value to epidemiologists in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{The internet and Social Media have been playing a vital role in almost
   everyone's communication and interactions. The same holds true for a
   company's two-way communication with its consumers. This tremendous flow
   of information can drastically increase any company's exposure to its
   consumers and shoppers. Consequently, it can decisively affect
   consumers' opinion about products and services. Molloy College in
   Rockville Centre, New York is the home of GiF, the first worldwide,
   holistic ICT-based approach to managing the Big Data issue in Social
   Media Marketing.
   GlobaliFusion (GiF) aims at bringing together entrepreneurs and
   companies of all sizes with their consumers by aggregating insights from
   Social Media and online publications in order to translate them into
   return-on-investment (ROI) positive marketing strategies and to
   accelerate their growth, applying technologically innovative and
   efficient marketing practices.
   Over the last five years there has been a tremendous shift of
   investments by marketing departments of major corporations, focusing on
   Social Media and digital marketing solutions versus traditional media.
   Despite the abundance of Social Media marketing solutions, there is no
   concrete framework on how to actually listen to people interacting in
   Social Media and to use these insights to perform and monitor Integrated
   Marketing campaigns
   Furthermore, monitoring Social Media campaigns' impact on public opinion
   and decisions through Social Media channels, and assisting companies
   accelerate their growth accordingly with novel integrated tools and
   strategies has been an unexplored field.
   GiF is striving to be established as the global leading platform for
   increasing the intelligence of companies through social media management

Abstract = {{Amongst the various open source educational software, the Modular Object
   Oriented Developmental Learning Environment (MOODLE) seems to be the
   most user friendly having numerous features. This paper aims at
   investigating the usefulness of digital technologies imparted into a
   blended learning model for engineering education. The role of
   Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a wider role in
   teaching-learning activities like, content creation, administrative,
   formative-summative assessments, student's performance tracking,
   trainings, knowledge management and knowledge organization. In addition,
   the technical features of ICT allow us to customize to meet the demands
   of an institution. Considering the recent major shifts in the learning
   paradigm, these innovations were deployed in an ongoing, real time basis
   in our educational campus. Technology based virtual learning approach
   was aimed at stimulating students' interest in learning engineering
   curriculum; consequently its effectiveness was statistically evaluated.
   Finally, this research report is aimed at summarizing the ways in which
   ICT is used, and how it creates new learning opportunities both online
   and off line.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach of employing the reassignment method as a signal
   analysis technique for use in digital intercept receivers for the
   analysis of frequency shift keying (FSK) low probability of intercept
   (LPI) radar signals is taken. Digital intercept receivers are currently
   moving away from Fourier analysis techniques using the FFT as the basic
   tool for detecting and extracting parameters of LPI radar signals, and
   are moving towards classical time-frequency analysis techniques (e.g.
   spectrogram, Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)). These classical
   techniques, though an improvement over Fourier analysis techniques,
   suffer from a lack of readability, due to poor time-frequency
   localization and cross-term interference. This lack of readability can
   lead to inaccurate detection and parameter extraction of these signals,
   potentially threatening survivability of the intercept receiver
   environment in certain situations. The reassignment method, with its
   `squeezing' and `smoothing' qualities, is considered as an innovative
   and improved signal analysis technique for this scenario. The FSK signal
   is used for testing. Experimental modeling and simulation results are
   subjectively assessed and measured via seven different metrics
   (including time-frequency localization, a novel metric). Reassignment
   method results are compared to classical time-frequency analysis
   results. The results confirm the improved readability of the
   reassignment method, and consequently, more accurate signal detection
   and parameter extraction metrics. These results have the potential of
   improving timeliness of signal characterization, and as a result,
   increasing aircraft survivability in particular situations.}},

Abstract = {{Digital pulse processing (DPP) techniques are increasingly used in the
   development of modern spectroscopic systems. DPP systems, based on
   direct digitizing and processing of detector signals (preamplifier
   output signals), ensure higher flexibility, stability, lower dead time,
   higher throughput and better energy resolution than traditional pulse
   processing systems. In this work, we present our progress in the
   development of DPP systems for high-rate high-resolution radiation
   measurements. An innovative digital system, able to perform
   multi-parameter analysis (input counting rate, pulse height, pulse
   shape, event arrival time, etc.) even at high photon counting rates is
   presented. Experimental results with CdTe detectors (planar and pixel
   detectors) are presented, at both low and high counting rate
   environments (up to 2 Mcps).}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the development of a front-end integrated circuit
   (IC) targeting the readout of scientific Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs)
   for a wide range of applications in the field of X-ray imaging. The
   reference detector considered is a high-performance 20x480,
   back-illuminated, n-substrate, fully-depleted CCD developed at the
   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) MicroSystems Lab. The
   innovation of MARC (Millisecond ASIC for the Readout of CCDs) is to
   implement a current readout of the CCD, thus overcoming speed
   limitations of the most common voltage readout source-follower
   configurations related to the settling of capacitive nodes. By means of
   the switched-current technique the IC implements a trapezoidal weighting
   function. The front-end comprises a programmable bias current generator
   for the CCD output p-MOSFET and the cascade of an integrator and a
   subtractor stage for the correlated double sampling. MARC also
   integrates a programmable digital sequencer to drive the switches of the
   filter. Measurement results show excellent linearity with a maximum
   error of 0.3 \%, an almost ideal weighting function while the simulated
   ENC is equal to 2.6 h(rms)(+) at an equivalent speed of 200 fps and 9.1
   h(rms)(+) at 400 fps. The first prototype of MARC is implemented in a
   standard CMOS 0.13 mu m 1.2 V technology. Design challenges, simulation
   and preliminary measurement results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a CMOS digitized salinity transducer with calibration
   circuits for monitoring salinity of ocean environment and aquaculture is
   newly proposed. Another innovation is that the outputs of the proposed
   chip are directly digitized, they could be easily sent over a wide range
   of transmission media, such as PSN, radio, optical, IR, ultrasonic, and
   etc. Before performing the proposed calibration circuits, the maximum
   linear error is 8.02\%. After calibration, the maximum linear error is
   reduced to 0.95\%. The salinity ranges from 120 to 240 g/L, and the
   corresponding output frequency range is 515 to 546 kHz. The chip area is
   1.058 x 1.058 mm(2). The proposed chip is suitable for devices of
   measuring salinity, such as device of detecting salinity of sea water.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a high-precision sine quadrature oscillator based
   on single resistor-controlled oscillator configuration. It presents
   advantageous features such as independent control of the oscillation
   condition regarding to its oscillation frequency, a wide and precise
   frequency variation and amplitude stability in the whole operating
   range. To control frequency tuning, it includes an innovative technique
   which adds R-2R based Digital-to-Analog Converters as control elements.
   This new approach overcomes the frequency tuning limitation presented by
   single resistor-controlled oscillators due to tolerance limitations of
   passive elements. Experimental results validate the proposed
   configuration, confirming its enormous possibilities in a wide field of
   applications, such as our driving application, especially, in those
   related to lock-in amplifiers.}},

Abstract = {{We seek to extend the idea of technology for education beyond digital
   interfaces, to include the practice of building technological devices in
   the classroom, to integrate complex concepts, and values such as
   sustainability. We provide a brief overview of the discipline of Design
   and Technology Education, where the process of designing and building of
   technological artifacts is a pedagogical approach, for learning concepts
   and values, particularly in an integrated fashion. It is increasingly
   recognized that engineering education, while focusing on design and
   building of artifacts, does not seek to provide such integration of
   concepts and values. One serious effect of the lack of integration of
   values is the tendency to ignore, or not recognize, pressing real-world
   problems in the students' immediate environment, and focus only on toy
   problems, especially for project work. We suggest that case studies,
   particularly ones capturing how grassroots innovators with no formal
   training develop technological artifacts to solve rural problems, can
   supplement the engineering curriculum, and help integrate real world
   problems and sustainability values into project work. Exploring the
   practices of grassroots innovators can present novel and relevant design
   principles, values, and role models to engineering students, for meeting
   the challenges of the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the effectiveness of various video-based learning
   methods. In recent years the flipped classroom has emerged as an
   innovative teaching-learning process. In a flipped classroom, study
   materials are made available to students for self-learning before class
   starts and class hours are utilized for student-teacher interaction in a
   variety of ways. In this research work we experiment with three broad
   scenarios to facilitate learning: a) delivering the lecture live and
   providing the entire recorded video of the class to the students, b)
   delivering the lecture live and providing short videos of the main
   concepts discussed in that class, c) recording lecture videos and making
   them available prior to the actual class (flip classroom model). We
   evaluate the impact of these three scenarios. For that we use
   observations, questionnaires, and interviews of both instructor and
   students for a semester course in Digital Image Processing. The results
   show that recorded videos are useful for students. Among these scenarios
   the students find the methodology of the delivery of the live lecture
   followed by short recorded video summary as the most effective way for
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, smartphone has become the popular gadgets among many
   people. It gives a way for innovating new things in computation and
   communication technology and provided a value added service for users.
   At present, the digital advertisement system has chosen the smartphone
   apps instead of world wide web(www) because of its futures like
   mobility, portable and its rich content display device. But the mobile
   advertisement system lacks in publishing right advertisement to the
   right people at right location. After analyzing the various difficulties
   in mobile advertising which does not reach the customer efficiently, we
   propose an efficient and high scalable digital advertisement system on
   cloud for location based mobile advertising, which enable the mobile
   users to get the push type advertisement which are local to them or even
   some times the advertisement which are relevant to them based on the
   user profile and location coordinates of the mobile base station (MBT).
   By this approach the advertisement cost is low compared to the
   traditional advertisement made through web and mass media. The
   performance of the digital advertisement system in terms of search cost
   and throughput is done and we estimate the product demand based on
   advertisement ratings or click ratings made by users.}},

Abstract = {{The Energy storage is required to support spacecraft loads during
   eclipse and also when the demand is more than power generation at any
   time. The most widely used energy storage technology is the battery,
   which stores energy in an electrochemical form. There is a need for
   highly efficient and long life battery systems for spacecrafts at
   various power levels. Li-ion based battery technology has better
   performance over traditional battery technologies. The battery system
   comprises of protection, management and balancing. Of these, balancing
   is most important that ensures the better performance and life of the
   battery system.
   A novel energy converter based active/non dissipative cell equalization
   method is implemented. This method comprises of digitally controlled
   resonant reset forward converter for individual Li-ion cells connected
   in series. This converter is used to transfer the energy from the higher
   voltage cell to the lower voltage cell. The main objective is to
   maintain cells in a battery at the same state of charge (SOC), and the
   voltage. The most innovative and attractive aspects of the system are
   efficient converter, filter and the discrete digital controller. This
   paper mainly concentrates on various control techniques that can be
   implemented to achieve effective cell balancing and to compensate the
   temperature, component aging and radiation effects for space
   applications. The performance of the system is inferred from the
   analysis of the simulation and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Digital communication is under risk due to different types of attacks on
   its confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. Copyright information
   need to be protected to preserve owner's information over untrusted
   network. Innovation in technology is also bringing challenges to secure
   the originality of owner information. Digital watermarking comes as a
   solution to protect and secure the owner's information through the means
   of different embedding technique to avoid security risks and threats.
   Our paper proposed a technique to embed fractal images in Discrete
   Wavelet Transform (DWT). The binary watermark image is generated from
   fractal codes. The color cover image is decomposed to its grayscale
   equivalents. The grayscale equivalents of color image are used to embed
   the watermark image which is generated from fractal codes in mid
   frequency blocks to protect the codes from attacker. Same watermark
   images are embedded into grayscale equivalents separately to increase
   the robustness and security of the scheme. The result analysis shows the
   robustness and imperceptibility of the algorithm.}},

   of any growing and successful businesses, as they utilize ICTs for
   business value creation. The key motivation for the huge investment in
   IT infrastructures is to ensure an upsurge in revenue and retention of
   sizeable market share. Computer Usage policy is a document that provides
   guidelines that regulates the acceptable usage of these systems by
   end-users. The provision of these guidelines also serve as benchmark
   metrics in assessing the abuse or misuse of corporate information
   systems. These misuse and/or abuse are referred to as violations of
   computer usage in this study. 10 users, selected randomly from within
   each unit of a multi-lateral company, were observed for violations. Live
   computer forensics techniques utilizing EnCase, Microsoft reporting
   tools, WinHex, etc., were employed to investigate these violations.
   Notwithstanding the strict corporate policies, the study revealed that
   end-users virtually violated all computer usage policies. This paper
   further analyses and addresses the causes, effects and offers measures
   to mitigate computer usage violations.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, digital communication and telecommunication have gained
   immense usage and introduced several innovative services (e.g. video
   conferencing, online banking, e-Health, etc) that change the life of
   people. By 2020, some telecommunication providers expect to have 50
   Billion devices connected to each others. The whole world is getting
   closely connected with the new telecommunication technologies especially
   the Mobile broadband technology. The expectations indicate that not only
   human will be connected but also devices and machines will be connected
   communicating altogether through the Mobile broadband technology. These
   tremendous improvements in telecom will introduce new and innovative
   services that touch every small detail of people's life. Consequently,
   telecom networks will become more complex, involve more resources, and
   demand more requirements. Thus, network optimization will be crucial to
   avoid wasting the resources and ensure service availability and network
   efficiency. To help achieving that, network operators require
   intelligent methods to understand the ongoing traffic and services
   characteristics in order to control and forecast the live/ongoing
   traffic. In LTE networks, video traffic makes up the largest segment of
   data traffic. This paper discusses the video traffic characteristics in
   LTE networks, checks the stationarity status of the LTE video traffic
   and presents a method to transform the non-stationary LTE video traffic
   to stationary data.}},

   controlled in order optimize them to achieve maximum plant growth and
   yield. The controller communicates with the various sensor modules in
   real-time in order to control the light, aeration and drainage process
   efficiently inside a greenhouse by actuating a cooler, fogger, dripper
   and lights respectively according to the necessary condition of the
   crops. The environmental is the important resource that guides the
   environmental development of embedded system, and an important guarantee
   that makes the embedded system develop and innovate along healthy,

Abstract = {{With the increasing popularity of battery-driven portable electronics,
   there is a growing demand for low-power circuit designs. In a typical
   CMOS digital circuit, power dissipation can be categorized into the
   dynamic power dissipation, leakage power dissipation, and short-circuit
   power dissipation. While dynamic power dissipation remains to be the
   most dominant in many digital circuits, leakage power dissipation has
   become increasingly more significant especially when the fabrication
   process enters into deep-sub-micro- or nano-meter-scaled ranges.
   Asynchronous circuits are well-known for their benefits in terms of
   dynamic power savings, because asynchronous logic does not switch when
   inactive. Nevertheless, in deep submicron technologies, leakage currents
   have become an increasing issue, and thus asynchronous circuits need to
   focus on reducing power consumption. The project proposed method is an
   innovative way to reduce power consumption by low-power logic family,
   called asynchronous fine-grain power-gated logic (AFPL). Here the
   comparison of power consumption of the proposed system with conventional
   system was also done.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a CMOS digitized wind transducer implemented by wind
   speed to frequency converter with calibration circuits is newly
   proposed. A calibration technique is proposed in this work. Another
   innovation is that the outputs of the proposed chip are directly
   digitized, they could be easily sent over a wide range of transmission
   media, such as PSN, radio, optical, IR, ultrasonic, and etc. Before
   performing the proposed calibration circuits, the maximum linear error
   is 71.6\%. After calibration, the maximum linear error is reduced to
   4.87\%. The wind speed range is 2.5 to 3.8 m/s, and the corresponding
   output frequency range is 27.87 kHz to 139.2 kHz. The chip area is 1.08
   x 1.08 mm(2). The proposed chip is suitable for devices of measuring
   wind speed.}},

Abstract = {{Change management in modern companies is usually complexity management.
   The economic environment of companies developed more and more complex
   over the last years. Technological innovations, especially in the field
   of e-business, have reinforced the globalization process and have
   threatened the domestic market with a strong competition by competitors
   from abroad.
   Actually the e-business strategies provide the most promising solutions
   to survive in global competition, but companies show resistance against
   the necessary restructuring processes and strategies. This problem has
   been identified as inertia and it is often discussed in research papers
   nowadays.
   The authors have thought about a solution how to manage this problem by
   a solution that is suitable especially for SME. In the worldwide
   economic crisis SME do not have the necessary resources (money) and the
   time to do a restructuring that can therefore fail or they catapult
   themselves out of the market. So the e-business perspective is a chance
   to be used as an interim step on the way to digital economy and
   complexity management by innovations and new media.}},

   sharing of computing resources among mobile devices such as notebook,
   smart phones and Personal Digital Assistant (PDAs) without any
   pre-existing infrastructure. Mobile computing includes a number of
   technologies and devices. The state of the user, static or mobile, does
   not affect the information management capability of the mobile platform.
   A user can continue to access and perform data manipulation during the
   state of mobility by using mobile computing devices. Delivering data
   packets between pair of processors is a primary responsibility of any
   mobile computing network This activity is performed using a routing
   strategy Maximize reliability of the data packets always a major concern
   while transmitting the data from one point to another point. In mobile
   computing it is the process of determining the data path through the
   network that data packets will move from the one computing device to
   another computing device. Routing strategy for data transmission is an
   important factor for achieving high degree of reliability. Multiple data
   packets are move within a network from source to destination in order to
   execute on available processing units with the objective of getting
   maximum reliability of data packets. This research paper present a
   routing strategy to achieve maximum data packets transmission
   reliability in mobile computing network during the data transmission.}},

Abstract = {{In our days the use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT)
   for teaching is widely recognized that promotes the innovation and the
   effectiveness within all academic levels and in all teaching and
   training sectors. One of the main obstacles for the further penetration
   of e-learning is the existence of the Digital Divide across nations or /
   and communities. Digital Divide is defined as the different level of
   ICT's adoption between nations or / and communities. In this paper the
   historic evolution of the Digital Divide across the Member States of the
   European Union is analyzed, in order on one hand to examine the
   effectiveness of the relevant policies in relation to Digital Divide
   elimination and on the other hand to examine whether European citizens
   have the same level of opportunities in relation to e-learning. To do
   so, indicative quantitative indicators have been selected, related to
   Information and Communications Technologies penetration and more
   specifically related to the existence of broadband infrastructure and
   the penetration of broadband services. The analysis of the selected
   indicators reveals the progress that has been achieved in relation to
   the elimination of the Digital Divide across EU countries, during the
   last few years. The results of analysis show that in some cases, like in
   the case of the existence of broadband infrastructure in rural areas, a
   clear improvement has been achieved. On the other hand the analysis of
   other indicators, like the fixed and mobile broadband penetration,
   indicates that despite the adopted relevant policies, slight or no
   improvement in relation to the elimination of the Digital Divide across
   EU 27 has been made.}},

Abstract = {{The HCI (Human-Computer Interface) technology development has been an
   important topic because of the popularity of digital technology and the
   innovation of 3C product. The product of the NUI (Natural User
   Interface) is more popular than the design of HCI base on a joystick,
   mouse, keyboard and touch. It always uses the body movements to achieve
   the interactive in recently years. After ``Kinect{''} controller was
   announced by the Microsoft Corporation, it open an innovative
   technologies in the natural user interface, which allows users to get
   more natural, more diverse ways to interact with machine. In this paper,
   the Kinect controller can complete a future digital home ITV
   (Interactive TV) and interactive multimedia software of control that
   allows users to achieve the visual and interactive operation with a more
   intuitive and user-friendly operation. It differs from the traditional
   button control. And this paper can achieve the effect of interaction HCI
   by Kinect. The interactive control system of this paper is included both
   of dynamic and handwriting recognition. The dynamic gesture uses the
   Kinect Sensor to achieve the real-time interaction. The handwriting
   digital character could be used to select TV channel. The digital
   character use the BPNN (Back Propagation Neural Network) to achieve the
   recognition and it also has a good performance in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of perceptual encryption schemes have been studied to generate
   visually encrypted images for protecting visual secrecy and privacy
   while supporting ongoing innovation and growth in the applications of
   digital imagery. However, typical image quality metrics such as PSNR and
   SSIM are not suitable to evaluate the invisibility of visually encrypted
   images. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel
   full-reference invisibility index, referred to as the Triple feature
   similarity index (TFSI), for visually encrypted images. The TFSI is
   computed through four steps: 1) edge extraction as preprocessing, 2)
   extracting the Triple feature based on the Trace transform, 3)
   normalization of resolution, and 4) TFSI is computed between the
   reference and visually encrypted images. Experimental results show that
   the TFSI measures the invisibility of visually encrypted images.}},
