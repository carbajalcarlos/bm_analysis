Abstract = {{Clinical guidelines are a major tool in improving the quality of medical
   care. However, to support the automation of guideline-based care,
   several requirements must be filled, such as specification of the
   guidelines in a machine-interpretable format and a connection to an
   Electronic Patient Record (EPR). For several different reasons, it is
   beneficial to convert free-text guidelines gradually, through several
   intermediate representations, to a machine-interpretable format. It is
   also realistic to consider the case when an EPR is unavailable. We
   propose an innovative approach to the runtime application of
   intermediate-represented Hybrid-Asbru guidelines, with or without an
   available EPR. The new approach capitalizes on our extensive work on
   developing the Digital electronic Guideline Library (DeGeL) framework.
   The new approach was implemented as the Spock system. For evaluation,
   three guidelines were specified in an intermediate format and were
   applied to a set of simulated patient records designed to cover
   prototypical cases. In all cases, the Spock system produced the expected
   output, and did not produce an unexpected one. Thus, we have
   demonstrated the capability of the Spock system to apply guidelines
   encoded in the Hybrid-Asbru intermediate representation, when an EPR is
   not available. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Determining the prevalence and treatment success of surgical
   lymphedema requires accurate and reproducible measurement. A new method
   of measurement of limb volume is described.
   Methods: A series of inanimate objects of known and unknown volume was
   measured using digital laser scanning and water displacement. A similar
   comparison was made with 10 human volunteers. Digital scanning was
   evaluated by comparison to the established method of water displacement,
   then to itself to determine reproducibility of measurement.
   Results: (1) Objects of known volume: Laser scanning accurately measured
   the calculated volume but water displacement became less accurate as the
   size of the object increased. (2) Objects of unknown volume: As average
   volume increased, there was an increasing bias of underestimation of
   volume by the water displacement method. The coefficient of
   reproducibility of water displacement was 83.44 ml. In contrast, the
   reproducibility of the digital scanning method Was 19.0 ml. (3) Human
   data: The mean difference between water displacement volume and laser
   scanning volume was 151.7 ml (SD +/- 189.5). The coefficient of
   reproducibility of water displacement was 450.8 ml whereas for laser
   scanning it was 174 ml.
   Conclusion: Laser scanning is an innovative method of measuring tissue
   volume that combines precision and reproducibility and may have clinical
   utility for measuring lymphedema.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple factors affect the specific condition and overall clinical
   profile of individuals at risk for chronic wounds. The complexity of the
   pressure ulcer problem lends itself to the application of the National
   Institute of Health Roadmap Initiative that encourages interdisciplinary
   research and new organizational models. An overview of research studies
   relevant to telemedicine and neuromuscular electrical stimulation in the
   care and prevention of pressure ulcers as well as preliminary results of
   an innovative multidisciplinary skin care team approach to the primary
   and tertiary prevention of pressure ulcers are encouraging. The team's
   pilot study results indicate that patients are satisfied with telehealth
   provision of care; however, literature and experience also suggest that
   discrepancies in the inter-rater assessment of wounds using digital
   photography remain, particularly with regard to wound dimension
   variables assessed (P < 0.01). In another endeavor, the skin care team
   developed a Longitudinal Analysis with Self-Registration statistical
   algorithm to assess the effects of electrical stimulation; in a
   preliminary study, this tool documented improvement in gluteus maximus
   health and resultant ability to withstand pressure. As the number of
   groups pursuing multidisciplinary research and care increases, so, too,
   will the evidence base required to address these common, and complex,
   chronic wounds.}},

Abstract = {{Spacecraft for deep space come in a variety of sizes as befits their
   missions, from the large, flagship-class spacecraft such as cassini or
   Galileo to smaller craft such as New Horizons (Pluto) or Lunar and
   Martian landers classified by NASA as Discovery or New Frontiers
   missions. All missions are constrained in mass, power, or cost, or
   frequently all three. A communications system that reduces demands on
   these resources enables, for example, either increased science return
   (by devoting more resources to the payload) or more such missions to be
   flown (by helping to meet critical mass or power margins). in this
   paper, we review the evolution and current capabilities of deep-space
   transponders and transceivers, noting the differences that lend
   themselves to particular classes of missions. We report on the
   development of a flexible, low-power, low-cost, deep-space transceiver
   architecture for competed mission sets such as Discovery, Mars Scout,
   and New Frontiers, one that possesses unique communications and radio
   science capabilities. This state-of-the-art transceiver architecture
   leverages from high- performance commercial integrated circuit
   technology and frequency synthesis and digital signal-processing
   techniques, lending itself to integration, miniaturization, and further
   power reduction. A transceiver based on this architecture, developed for
   the space-borne New Horizons spacecraft's primary communications link
   and uplink radio science experiment, is reviewed in this paper. We
   conclude discussion of the modern deep-space transceiver architecture
   with a description of near-term and long-term future functional and
   performance communications and radio science enhancements to the
   transceiver.}},

Abstract = {{This empirical study analyzes the patterns of innovation within and
   across industries using firm-level survey data from Finland and Denmark.
   The theoretical starting point is evolutionary theory with its premise
   that firms in different technological regimes pursue different paths to
   innovation. Similar modes of behaviour are found in the two datasets,
   and they closely correspond to those found in earlier studies. Contrary
   to prevailing assumptions, however, the results show that industries are
   not at all uniform in terms of how firms innovate; in almost all four-
   or five-digit NACE industries, three or more different modes of
   innovation can be identified. This suggests that firms' strategic
   differentiation or local search activities overcome pressures in the
   technological environment towards homogenous behaviour, at least in the
   short term. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Germany, provides a unique opportunity of matching late Paleozoic
   trackways with their trackmakers. Here the track-trackmaker association
   is firmly established between two species of the ichnogenus
   Ichniotheriun, Ichniotherium cottae and Ichniotherium sphaerodactylum,
   and the skeletal fossils of the closely related diadectids Diadectes

   well-documented species-level identifications of the trackmakers of
   Paleozoic trackways. The Ichniotherium ichnospecies are principally
   separated by the relative lengths of the digits of the pes imprint and
   the degree of overstepping of the pes and manus imprints. Both
   characters are shown to be clearly due to differences in the number and
   lengths of phalangeal elements and the number of presacral vertebrae of
   the diadectid species. The unique methods employed here in establishing
   the track-trackmaker associations provide not only an innovative data
   source for studying the evolutionary biology, paleo-biogeography. and
   locomotor behaviour of the trackmakers, but also a valuable methodology
   for evaluating taxonomic concepts in vertebrate ichnology.}},

Abstract = {{The growing demand on geospatial services requires an intensified study
   of geoinformation from various sources covering the same geographic
   space. Data matching is one of the fundamental measures that help make
   different datasets interoperable. This paper reports a special case of
   data matching between the road layer from the digital landscape model
   ``Basis DLM{''} maintained by German surveying and mapping agencies and
   the road database supplied by TeleAtlas Corp. The authors put forward a
   generic approach which is able to handle three unfavorable matching
   conditions: (1) missing values of essential road attributes, e.g. street
   names are only sporadically available in Basis DLM, (2) unsystematic
   geometric discrepancies between the corresponding road objects, and (3)
   unknown extent of geometric discrepancies between the two datasets. The
   proposed approach is implemented in Arc GIS 9.0 as a tool used to match
   street networks as well as transfer of information between the matched
   datasets. By means of an innovative matching algorithm termed as
   ``unsymmetrical buffer growing{''}, this matching approach has gained
   some self-learning abilities and yielded high matching performance
   indicated by an average matching rate of 96.1\% on large data sets of
   road networks. Meanwhile, a measurement of matching certainty on the
   basis of geometrical and topological similarity is introduced, which
   supports the human operator to judge the quality of matching results and
   easily detect possible matching errors. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{During the past few years, several innovative IT- based applications
   have emerged around the world that promise to bridge the proverbial ``
   digital divide'' by linking growers directly to domestic and
   international markets through the Internet. Online commodity auctions
   are an example of such initiatives and have the potential to impact the
   livelihood of millions around the world. However, an important factor
   that a. ffects the benefits obtained by growers is the supply chain
   structure that results from the introduction of the online platform. In
   this paper, we provide a case study of an online coffee auction
   established in India for selling various grades of coffee beans. The
   focus of the case study is on the supply chain structure that is likely
   to evolve under various product and supplier characteristics. We argue
   that the online direct selling of commodities by growers is likely to
   evolve only under a certain set of conditions. We also argue that
   governments and platform providers can facilitate online direct selling
   by growers through initiatives that increase the bargaining power of the
   growers and increase the confidence of the buyer to directly procure
   from lesser known growers. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the characteristics of a simple shear apparatus capable of
   applying realistic multidirectional earthquake loading to soil
   specimens. This device, herein termed the Digitally Controlled Simple
   Shear (DC-SS) apparatus, incorporates features such as servohydraulic
   actuation and true digital control to overcome control limitations of
   some previous dynamic soil testing machines. The device is shown to be
   capable of reproducing sinusoidal and broadband command signals across a
   wide range of frequencies and amplitudes, although the device has
   limited control capabilities for very small command displacements (less
   than approximately 0.005 mm). The small deformation limitation results
   from noise introduced to the control system from analog-to-digital
   conversion of feedback signals. We demonstrate that bidirectional
   command signals can be accurately imparted with minimal cross coupling,
   which results from an innovative multiple-input, multiple-output digital
   control system. The capabilities of the device are demonstrated with a
   series of broadband tests on unsaturated soil specimens subjected to
   uni- and bidirectional excitation.}},

Abstract = {{The receiver architecture, proposed in this brief seizes the subsampling
   properties of continuous-time sigma-delta (Sigma A) modulators based on
   distributed resonators to construct a quadrature receiver. The proposed
   architecture is based on a low-pass. Sigma A modulator that subsamples
   an intermediate frequency signal around the sampling frequency and does
   not require quadrature mixers. Instead, the quadrature mixing is
   replaced by suitably choosing the sampling instants inside the loop. Two
   practical circuit implementations are proposed. The first one uses
   separate circuitry for the I and Q paths. The second architecture
   introduces an innovative way to produce the I and Q outputs that is
   immune to path mismatch due to the sharing of all the analog circuitry
   for both paths. The proposed modulator may be feasible for the typical
   IF frequencies used in cellular base stations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews our recent antennas and propagation studies for MIMO
   systems. First we introduce a MIMO propagation channel model in which an
   interesting nature can be found in eigenvalue statistics from a
   practical viewpoint. Then we introduce multi-keyhole model which is an
   efficient tool for designing a MIMO repeater systems, or MIMO
   radio-relay systems. For realization of compact MIMO antenna systems,
   effectiveness of using multiple polarizations such as dual polarizations
   and triple polarizations is demonstrated in multipath-rich propagation
   environments. With application of MIMO to OFDM systems, we focus our
   analysis on relation between propagation and digital transmission
   characteristics under a severe multipath-rich environment where the
   delay profile exceeds the guard interval. Finally, we discuss
   transmission characteristics of MIMO-OFDM with maximal ratio combining
   (MRC) diversity in the environment.}},

Title = {{Leveraging standard electronic business interfaces to enable adaptive
   supply chain partnerships}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive supply chain partnerships are a key factor in driving the
   ability of extended enterprise partners to achieve long-term goals in an
   environment characterized by disruptive environmental shifts. Adaptive
   extended enterprise arrangements allow participating enterprises to
   leverage their combined assets for collective exploration and
   exploitation. In the context of extended enterprises, where significant
   investments have been directed toward instituting common interfaces,
   this study examines the question: How does the use of standard
   electronic business interfaces (SEB1s) enable supply chain partnerships
   to become more adaptive?
   This study conceptualizes the use of SEBIs as a boundary-spanning
   mechanism that helps overcome boundaries that impede knowledge transfer
   between enterprises in supply chains. SEBIs enables partners to gain
   insight into their broader environments, enriching each partner's
   perspective (enhanced bridging). SEBIs also help strengthen the
   cooperative ties between partners, motivating each partner to adapt for
   collective gain (enhanced bonding).
   Our research model is empirically tested using data collected from 41
   demand-side supply chain partnerships (between original equipment
   manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, and retailers) in the information
   technology (IT) industry. The results show that collaborative
   information exchange (CIE) between supply chain partners mediates the
   relationship between use of SEBIs and mutual adaptation (MA) and
   adaptive knowledge creation between supply chain partners.
   Interestingly, the use of SEBIs is found to be directly associated with
   MA but only indirectly associated with adaptive knowledge creation.
   The study points out that the strategic impacts of SEBIs go well beyond
   the exchange of transaction information and process integration. It also
   shows that multilateral, quasi-open, and information exchange-and
   process linkage-oriented SEBIs can result in both bonding and bridging
   across supply chain partners without binding them inflexibly to specific
   partners. Based on the model and results, the study offers practical
   implications for how SEBIs should be developed, adopted, and used.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a unique medical technical application for
   illustrating the success and/or failure of the physiological healing
   process as a dynamically morphed video. Two examples used in this report
   include the healing of a severely fractured humerus from an explosion in
   Iraq and the other of dramatic tissue destruction from a poisonous
   spider bite. For the humerus, several sequential x-rays obtained
   throughout orthopedic surgical procedures and the healing process were
   morphed together representing a time-lapsed video of the healing
   process. The end result is a video that demonstrates the healing process
   in an animation that radiologists envision and report to other
   clinicians. For the brown recluse spider bite, a seemingly benign skin
   lesion transforms into a wide gaping necrotic wound with dramatic
   appearance within days. This novel technique is not presented for
   readily apparent clinical advantage, rather, it may have more immediate
   application in providing treatment options to referring providers and/or
   patients, as well as educational value of healing or disease progression
   over time. Image morphing is one of those innovations that is just
   starting to come into its own. Morphing is an image processing
   technology that transforms one image into another by generating a series
   of intermediate synthetic images. It is the same process that Hollywood
   uses to turn people into animals in movies, for example. The ability to
   perform morphing, once restricted to high-end graphics workstations, is
   now widely available for desktop computers. The authors describe how a
   series of radiographic images were morphed into a short movie clip using
   readily available software and an average laptop. The resultant video
   showed the healing process of an open comminuted humerus fracture that
   helped demonstrate how amazingly the human body heals in a case
   presentation in a time-lapse fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Defined as the differential extent to which rich countries and poor
   countries benefit from various forms of information technology ( IT),
   the global digital divide has been extensively measured and described in
   national as well as international debates. The problem, however, is that
   the topic is highly fragmented in the literature, with few attempts to
   put the parts into a coherent analytical framework. More precisely,
   there has been no specific attempt to pinpoint the main issues that
   influence one's view of the importance of the digital divide and the
   policies demanded by the different points of view. The goal of this
   paper, accordingly, is to fill this important gap in the literature in
   an analytical schema that recognizes the ways in which the impact of
   innovations depends heavily on how they are generated and diffused. At
   each stage of this sequential process are key issues that influence
   one's view of the digital divide. It matters a great deal for instance
   on whether the divide is in some sense unique, or just another
   manifestation of the general technological relationship between rich and
   poor countries. It is also the case that the size of the divide depends
   heavily on how it is measured. Yet another example is that the extent of
   the potential impact of IT will influence our view of the foregone
   opportunities associated with limited uptake of this technology in
   developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines new forms of collaboration between producers and
   consumers that are emerging in the digital entertainment space. Taking
   the case of the video game industry, we show how some firms have opened
   a portion of their proprietary content for transformation by consumers
   and allowed the development of consumer-designed and
   consumer-implemented derivative products. By reappropriating these
   derivatives, video game firms are successfully outsourcing parts of
   their game design and development process to digital consumer networks.
   Applying economic analysis, we explore the potential benefits and risks
   associated with outsourcing to networks of consumers. We also derive the
   optimal combination of copyright enforcement and consumer compensation.
   Our results suggest that profit-maximizing producers of video games have
   incentive to partially open game content to their users and to
   remunerate the most innovative ones, under the condition that the
   derivatives constitute complements to, and not substitutes for, the
   original product. We discuss the implications on firm strategy for
   innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of arthroscopic view with technological innovation. To
   formulate objective measures for arthroscopic image quality. This is
   achieved by defining uniquely interpretable descriptions of disturbances
   of the arthroscopic image. Disturbances in the arthroscopic view were
   defined focusing on the size of the disturbance area, and the duration
   of a disturbance. They were categorized as Bleeding, Turbidity, Air
   Bubbles, Loose Fibrous Tissue, Attached Fibrous Tissue, Tissue too
   Close, and Instrument too Close. Ten arthroscopic knee procedures were
   recorded on digital film with a frame rate of 25 images per second (
   almost 5 h in total). Using time-action analysis, two investigators
   individually scored the presence and type of each disturbance in all 5 h
   of the ten arthroscopies. The kappa statistic was used to assess
   agreement between the investigators. Additionally, five other observers,
   who had no prior training, scored 1 min of each of the ten arthroscopies
   ( total of 10 min) to evaluate the definitions for unique
   interpretability. The adjusted kappa statistic ( kappa is corrected for
   high prevalence) shows good tester agreement for all disturbances (range
   0.71-0.96), also for the observers who had no prior training. Only
   Turbidity shows a moderate agreement (0.59 and 0.44). This is due to the
   difficulty to assess the exact start and end time of Turbidity. We
   succeeded in describing uniquely interpretable definitions for seven
   disturbances. This allows objective and quantitative determination of
   arthroscopic image quality, which is required to improve future
   arthroscopic equipment and training facilities.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The release of results of International Subarachnoid Aneurysm
   Trial in 2003 caused a shift in the paradigm of management of ruptured
   intracranial aneurysms. The cases selected for microsurgical clipping
   nowadays are usually those patients with aneurysms that are not suitable
   for embolization, and are often complex and difficult. We devised an
   innovative application of operative planning and training for craniotomy
   and microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms in a stereoscopic
   virtual reality environment.
   METHODS: Patient-specific Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
   data from computed tomographic angiography of the intracranial
   circulation and cranium were transferred to the workstation
   (Dextroscope; Volume Interactions Pte. Ltd., Singapore, Singapore). An
   aneurysm clip database was loaded into the patient data set. Three
   dimensional volume rendering was followed by data coregistration and
   fusion.
   RESULTS: Virtual head positioning and craniotomy were carried out to
   simulate the microscopic visualization. Clip selection could be carried
   out with reference to the angle of application. This allows one to see
   the exposure and degree of obliteration of an aneurysm with the various
   angles of approach.
   CONCLUSION: The virtual craniotomy and microsurgical clipping
   application simulated the operative environment. Its role in
   neurosurgical training is encouraging and}},

Abstract = {{We present an innovative method for quantitative and/or qualitative flow
   visualization by fringe projection through a test section with

   Information about the temperature gradient, encoded in the deformed
   fringe pattern, is demodulated by Fourier transform algorithms. The main
   advantages of the proposed procedure are flexibility in suiting to
   different heat transfer phenomena; full digital and automated data
   processing to provide both qualitative visualizations and quantitative
   maps of the temperature gradient field; full-field visualization; and
   low cost compared to interferometric equipment. The main disadvantages
   are reduced investigation area with low-cost TV cameras; sensitivity (i.
   e., smallest detectable temperature gradient); and lower accuracy than
   that of conventional interferometric and Schlieren techniques. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{We introduce an innovative method that uses personal digital assistants
   (PDAs) equipped with global positioning system (GPS) units in household
   surveys to select a probability-based sample arid perform PDA-based
   interviews. Our approach uses PDAs with GPS to rapidly map all
   households in selected areas, choose a random sample, and navigate back
   to the sampled households to conduct an interview. We present recent
   field experience in two large-scale nationally representative household
   surveys to assess insecticide-treated bed net coverage as part of
   malaria control efforts in Africa. The successful application of this
   method resulted in statistically valid samples; quality-controlled data
   entry; and rapid aggregation, analyses, and availability of preliminary
   results within days of completing the field work. We propose this method
   as an alternative to the Expanded Program on Immunization cluster sample
   method when a fast, statistically valid survey is required in an
   environment with little census information at the enumeration area

Abstract = {{Virtual prototyping (VP) technology has been regarded as a
   cost-effective way of envisaging real circumstances that enhance
   effective communication of designs and ideas, without manufacturing
   physical samples. In the construction field, although a large number of
   digital technologies have been developed to visualize the innovative
   architectural design, few VP systems have been developed to facilitate
   integrated planning and visualization of construction plans of the
   building projects. This paper describes a virtual prototyping system,
   called the Construction Virtual Prototyping (CVP) system, which is
   developed for modeling, simulation, analysis and VP of construction
   processes from digital design. The CVP system allows project teams to
   check constructability, safety and to visualize 3D models of a facility
   before the commencement of construction works. The real-life case study
   presented in the study shows that the CV-P system is effective in
   assessing the executability of a construction planning including site
   layout, temporary work design, as well as resource planning. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{We describe an electronic injury surveillance system that provides data
   for improving patient care and monitoring injury incidence and
   distribution patterns. Patients with injuries visiting a rural Kenyan
   primary care center were enrolled consecutively over 14 months. Injury
   information was added onto an existing medical record database that
   captures data for each patient visit. A new injury data encounter form
   and entry screen were created that included geographical coordinates of
   the injury site. These coordinates were obtained using a handheld global
   positioning system (GPS) device, and data were downloaded to the
   database and linked to each patient. We created digital maps of injury
   spatial distribution using geography information systems (GIS) software
   and correlated injury type and location with patients' clinical data. A
   computerized medical record system, complemented by GIS technology and
   an injury-specific component, presents a valuable tool for injury
   surveillance, epidemiology, prevention and control for communities
   served by a specific health facility. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   two of these tools. The MAFIA tool is especially attractive for first,
   year students and helps them to understand the basic concepts of logic
   in an interactive way rising sematic tableaux. It also allows them to
   solve the crazy cases in Mafia which their fellow students from previous
   years proposed. The Modelos de Kripke tool, oriented to a more advanced
   level, serves for understanding the link between the properties of the
   accessibility relation and the modal formulas, which is at the basis of
   the current developments of modal logic.}},

Abstract = {{Trust negotiation is a promising approach for establishing trust in open
   systems, in which sensitive interactions may often occur between
   entities with no prior knowledge of each other. Although, to date
   several trust negotiation systems have been proposed, none of them fully
   address the problem of privacy preservation. Today, privacy is one of
   the major concerns of users when exchanging information through the Web
   and thus we believe that trust negotiation systems must effectively
   address privacy issues in order to be widely applicable. For these
   reasons, in this paper, we investigate privacy in the context of trust
   negotiations. We propose a set of privacy-preserving features for
   inclusion in any trust negotiation system, such as the support for the
   P3P standard, as well as a number of innovative features, such as a
   novel format for encoding digital credentials specifically designed for
   preserving privacy. Further, we present a variety of interoperable
   strategies to carry on the negotiation with the aim of improving both
   privacy and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Recently, there has been much debate in the US concerning
   drug importation from Canadian Internet pharmacies. The Food and Drug
   Administration and US drug manufacturers assert that drugs obtained from
   international markets via the Internet present a health risk to
   consumers from substandard products. The public's perception is that
   drugs from Canada are as safe as those from the us.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether simvastatin tablets obtained via the
   Internet from Canadian generic manufacturers are comparable in blend
   uniformity, a major attribute of tablet quality, with the US innovator
   product.
   METHODS: Generic simvastatin tablets from 4 Canadian Internet pharmacy
   Web sites and the US innovator product were obtained for pharmaceutical
   analysis. Tablet samples were analyzed using near-infrared spectroscopic
   imaging techniques, which are designed to detect formulation defects of
   drug products during the manufacturing process. Digital images were
   created, revealing the tablets' internal structures.
   RESULTS: The blend uniformity of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in
   the tablet samples from Canada was determined and compared with that of
   the US innovator product. Results indicated that there is little
   significant difference in blend uniformity among US innovator and
   Canadian generic tablets.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest comparable quality assurance
   manufacturing standards for the US innovator product and the Canadian
   generic drug products tested. These findings have clinical, legal, and
   economic implications that should be addressed by policy makers to
   safeguard consumers who choose to purchase Canadian-manufactured drugs
   via the Internet.}},

Abstract = {{Funding from the University of Massachusetts president's office allowed
   two campuses of the University of Massachusetts system to offer nursing
   faculty and students PDAs containing medical/nursing databases for use
   during their clinical rotations. A study was designed to explore
   student's attitudes toward the use of PDAs in a clinical setting and to
   determine if the manner in which the technology was introduced affected
   the formation of these attitudes. During the fall and spring semesters
   of 2005 to 2006, both sites used and evaluated the effectiveness of PDAs
   at the point of care, but the clinical course, faculty experience with
   PDAs, and method and stage of introduction varied on each campus. The
   University library acted as the public point of access for borrowing and
   technical support of the PDAs. All students were asked to complete a
   21-question survey that collected quantitative and qualitative data
   about their attitudes toward the use of PDAs at their clinical agency.
   Results of questionnaires relating to students attitudes to the PDA as a
   learning tool showed that there were differences in the student's
   perceptions and acceptance of the PDA as a learning tool. The results
   from the analysis of the data and suggestions for the possible reasons
   for the differences are explored.}},

Abstract = {{Business projects with very long time horizons - such as those involving
   product R\&D, workplace design, and total compensation planning - have
   to contend with a crucial question: What will be the needs, demands, and
   desires of consumers and employees decades from now? If you think the
   answer is ``Just more of the same,{''} you're in for a surprise.
   Howe and Strauss, the authors of Generations, The Fourth Turning,
   Millennials Rising, and other books, have studied the differences among
   generations for some 30 years. Their extensive research has revealed a
   fascinating pattern-one so strong that it supports a measure of
   predictability. On the basis of historical precedent, they say, we can
   foresee how the generations that are alive today will think and act in
   decades to come.
   Three of those generations will still be vital forces in American
   society 20 years from now: Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials. Their
   attitudes and behaviors will have profound effects on the economy, the
   workplace, and social institutions in general. For example, as aging
   Boomers eschew high-tech medicine in favor of holistic self-care,
   natural foods, and mind-body healing techniques, some hospitals are
   opening new wings featuring alternative medicine and spiritual
   counseling. Gen Xers, having grown up in an era of failing schools and
   marriages, will remain alienated, disaffected, and pragmatic as they
   enter midlife. Already the greatest entrepreneurial generation in U.S.
   history, they will be highly effective at pushing innovation,
   efficiency, and mass customization. In contrast, young adult Millennials
   will favor teamwork, close family relationships, job security, and a
   bland popular culture. Their unprecedented digital empowerment and
   talent for organizing will create a political powerhouse and may even
   revitalize the union movement.}},

Title = {{Promise and problems with supply chain management approaches to health
   care purchasing}},
Journal = {{HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT REVIEW}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{192-202}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Double-digit health care inflation, coupled with widespread
   reports of poor care quality and deadly medical errors, has caused
   private sector employers to reevaluate their health benefits purchasing
   strategies, with a focus on supply chain management approaches. In other
   industries, this strategy has proven to be an effective method for
   simultaneously reducing costs and increasing quality. \textbackslash{}
   Purpose: This article describes four current applications of supply
   chain management network methodologies to health care systems and
   identifies potential ways to improve purchasers' return on investment.
   In particular, information exchanges, purchase decision, and payment
   agreement components of integrated, supply chains are described.
   Approach: First, visual depictions of the health care supply chain are
   developed from a purchaser's, perspective. Next, five nationwide
   programs designed to realign incentives and rewards across,the health
   care supply chain are described.
   Findings: Although several nationwide efforts are gaining traction in
   the marketplace, at this time, no cost reduction and quality improvement
   program initiative appears to systematically align the entire health
   care supply chain from providers to purchasers, raising doubt about the
   ability of supply chain management network techniques to significantly
   impact the health care marketplace in the short run.
   Practice Implications: Current individual efforts to coordinate the
   health care supply chain do not act on all of the actors necessary to
   improve outcomes, promote safety, and control costs. Nevertheless there
   are indications that several of the individual efforts are coming
   together. If national efforts touching on all critical elements can
   coordinate with purchasers, then the health care supply chain's
   performance may improve significantly.}},

Abstract = {{The use of persimmon peel gel for the recovery of Au(III) from aqueous
   chloride medium was investigated. By comparing with the adsorption of
   some other metal ions, the gel was found to be selective only for
   Au(III). The XRD analysis and the digital micrograph of the get taken
   after adsorption supported the formation of gold particles during
   adsorption process. High selectivity and capacity of the gel for Au(III)
   is associated with the reduction of Au(III) to elemental form.
   Comparative study of reduction of Au(III) by typical tannin rich
   materials, green tea and oolong tea, and by various organic acids
   clarified the involvement of polyphenolic groups in the reduction of
   Au(III) during adsorption. Innovative use of this novel adsorption gel
   can fulfill the need of cost effective and environment friendly mean for
   the recovery of valuable metals. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper describes a course in Smart Power based on the introduction
   of an innovative educational tool-a preprocessed Smart Power integrated
   circuit. The methodology used to introduce students to the issue of
   Smart Power design, resorting to low cost standard CMOS technology is
   presented. The theoretical support is envisaged to provide the required
   knowledge to specify characteristics and performance of the most common
   blocks used in Smart Power and to develop skills for monolithic
   integration. Through design, simulation, and experimental
   characterization, the students were able to experience the different
   steps of a Smart Power project, from the power device basic switching
   cell mask layout to the final system prototype, in 60 hours of a one
   semester course. The referred Smart Power Integrated Circuit (IC)
   embedding analog and digital basic blocks and high-voltage transistor
   arrays is the key idea to the presented pedagogical methodology. Based
   on this Smart Power IC, different topologies required by power
   electronics and power management systems were implemented. A complete
   system illustrative example-a step-down hard-switching dc-de regulator
   (buck regulator)-implemented by the students is shown and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines market acceptance for the satellite digital
   multimedia broadcasting (DMB) service, one of the touted new business
   models in Korea's next-generation mobile communications service market,
   using adoption and diffusion of innovation as the theoretical framework.
   Market acceptance for the satellite DMB service was assessed by
   predicting the demand of the service using the Bass model, and the
   demand variability over time was then analysed by combining the
   innovation adoption model proposed by Rogers (Diffusion of Innovations
   (5th edn). The Free Press: New York, 2003). In our estimation of the
   Bass model, we derived the coefficient of innovation and the coefficient
   of imitation using actual diffusion data from the mobile telephone
   service market. We also reorganized the demand data along the diffusion
   timeline according to Rogers' innovation adoption model, using the
   responses by survey subjects concerning their respective projected time
   of adoption. The demand prediction model revealed that diffusion for
   both took place forming a classical S-curve. Concerning variability in
   demand for the satellite DMB service, our findings, much in agreement
   with Rogers' view, indicated that demand was highly variable over time
   and depending on the adopter group. This study, as an attempt to measure
   the market acceptance for the satellite DMB service, a leading
   next-generation mobile communications service product, stands out from
   related studies in that it estimates the nature and level of acceptance
   for specific customer categories, using theories of innovation adoption
   and diffusion and survey results conducted through one-to-one
   interviews. The findings and theoretical application procedures provide
   practical insights into further research on market analysis of new
   mobile communications service-related products. Copyright (C) 2007 John

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel algorithmic and architectural solutions for
   real-time and power-efficient enhancement of images and video sequences.
   A programmable class of Retinex-like filters, based on the separation of
   the illumination and reflectance components, is proposed. The dynamic
   range of the input image is controlled by applying a suitable non-linear
   function to the illumination, while the details are enhanced by
   processing the reflectance. An innovative spatially recursive rational
   filter is used to estimate the illumination. Moreover, to improve the
   visual quality results of two-branch Retinex operators when applied to
   videos, a novel three-branch technique is proposed which exploits both
   spatial and temporal filtering. Real-time implementation is obtained by
   designing an Application Specific Instruction-set Processor (ASIP).
   Optimizations are addressed at algorithmic and architectural levels. The
   former involves arithmetic accuracy definition and linearization of
   non-linear operators; the latter includes customized instruction set,
   dedicated memory structure, adapted pipeline, bypasses, custom address
   generator, and special looping structures. The ASIP is synthesized in
   standard-cells CMOS technology and its performances are compared to
   known Digital signal processor (DSP) implementations of real-time
   Retinex filters. As a result of the comparison, the proposed
   algorithmic/architectural design outperforms state-of-art Retinex-like
   operators achieving the best trade-off between power consumption,
   flexibility, and visual quality.}},

Abstract = {{Venous obliteration using foam sclerosant is a relatively new procedure
   that holds great promise and may prove to be as effective as
   conventional surgical treatments in obliteration of the great saphenous
   vein. Foam sclerotherapy can have minor and major complications, most of
   which occur as a result of gas or sclerosant leakage into the systemic
   venous system. Conventionally, the saphenofemoral junction is occluded
   by digital pressure to prevent escape of sclerosant foam into the deep
   venous system. We propose balloon control of the saphenofemoral junction
   to prevent sclerosant leakage. This also promotes foam contact with the
   endothelium in a prolonged, controlled fashion. This method requires no
   anesthesia, is suitable for ambulatory care, and has been safe and
   successful in all five cases. Duplex examinations at 1 week and 3 months
   have shown complete obliteration of the great saphenous vein using this
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the technologies of representation in a heterogeneous,
   distributed sociotechnical system, such as a large construction project,
   can instigate a complex pattern of innovations in technologies,
   practices, structures, and strategies. We studied the adoption of
   digital three-dimensional (3-D) representations in the building projects
   of the architect Frank O. Gehry, and observed that multiple,
   heterogeneous firms in those projects produced diverse innovations, each
   of which created a wake of innovation. Together, these multiple wakes of
   innovation produce a complex landscape of innovations with unpredictable
   peaks and valleys. Gehry's adoption of digital 3-D representations
   disturbed the ecology of interactions and stimulated innovations in his
   project networks by: providing path-creating innovation trajectories in
   separate communities of practice, creating trading zones where
   communities could create knowledge about diverse innovations, and
   offering a means for intercalating innovations across heterogeneous
   communities. Our study suggests that changes in digital representations
   that are central to the functioning of a distributed system can engender
   multiple innovations in technologies, work practices, and knowledge
   across multiple communities, each of which is following its own
   distinctive tempo and trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the development of a multi-frequency electrical impedance
   tomography (EIT) system (KHU Mark1) with a single balanced current
   source and multiple voltmeters. It was primarily designed for imaging
   brain function with a flexible strategy for addressing electrodes and a
   frequency range from 10 Hz-500 kHz. The maximal number of voltmeters is
   64, and all of them can simultaneously acquire and demodulate voltage
   signals. Each voltmeter measures a differential voltage between a pair
   of electrodes. All voltmeters are configured in a radially symmetric
   architecture in order to optimize the routing of wires and minimize
   cross-talk. We adopted several techniques from existing EIT systems
   including digital waveform generation, a Howland current generator with
   a generalized impedance converter (GIC), digital phase- sensitive
   demodulation and tri-axial cables. New features of the KHU Mark1 system
   include multiple GIC circuits to maximize the output impedance of the
   current source at multiple frequencies. The voltmeter employs contact
   impedance measurements, data overflow detection, spike noise rejection,
   automatic gain control and programmable data averaging. The KHU Mark1
   system measures both in-phase and quadrature components of
   trans-impedances. By using a script file describing an operating mode,
   the system setup can be easily changed. The performance of the developed
   multi-frequency EIT system was evaluated in terms of a common-mode
   rejection ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, linearity error and reciprocity
   error. Time-difference and frequency-difference images of a saline
   phantom with a banana object are presented showing a frequency-dependent
   complex conductivity of the banana. Future design of a more innovative
   system is suggested including miniaturization and wireless techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to make a critical analysis of the
   construction of a society that is considered innovating, as it is
   sustained by information digital technologies (IT). Certainly, It have
   considerable effects upon the social, the political and the economic,
   however, the results are overestimated as innovating and with no
   connection to the past. Our premise is that I here is no need to
   eliminate the proposals made by diverse pioneers of the commonly called
   Information Society (IS), to analyze its consequences. Therefore, it
   makes a revision of some IS pioneers, hoping to demarcate a line between
   the private and the public spheres of the IS and their effects upon the
   construction of a farewell State. It makes a critical analysis of the
   policies instrumented in the construction of an IS in the frame of the
   global processes. Finally, it draws some conclusions regarding the
   experienced social processes that are derived from the development of
   the incorporation to the society of new informational technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Even as geographic disparities in high speed Internet access narrow, an
   urban-rural broadband gap persists, pointing to the importance of
   individual differences in motivations to adopt broadband as the key to
   closing the gap. Diffusion of innovation is reconceptualized through
   contemporary perspectives of the digital divide and social cognitive
   theory and tested on a survey sample drawn from four rural communities.
   Path analysis was used to examine the factors that cause broadband
   Internet service adoption in rural communities. Prior experience with
   the Internet, the expected outcomes of broadband usage, direct personal
   experience with broadband, and self-efficacy had direct effects on
   broadband intentions. Age and income, but not education or ethnicity,
   also had direct impacts. Efforts that promote the personal benefits of
   broadband and advanced ICT literacy skills among Internet users are
   recommended. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The prototype presented in this paper is based on GaAs pixel detectors
   read-out by the PCC/MEDIPIX I circuit. The active area of a sensor is
   about 1 cm 2 therefore to cover the typical irradiation field used in
   mammography (18 x 24 cm), 18 GaAs detection units have been organized in
   two staggered rows of nine chips each and moved by a stepper motor in
   the orthogonal direction. The system is integrated in a mammographic
   equipment which comprehends the X-ray tube, the bias and data
   acquisition systems and the PC-based control system. The prototype has
   been developed in the framework of the Integrated Mammographic Imaging
   (IMI) project, an industrial research activity aiming to develop
   innovative instrumentation for morphologic and functional imaging. The
   project has been supported by the Italian Ministry of Education,
   University and Research (MIUR) and by five Italian High Tech companies,
   Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS), CAEN, Gilardoni, LABEN and Poli.Hi.Tech.,
   in collaboration with the universities of Ferrara, Roma ``La
   Sapienza{''}, Pisa and the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN).
   In this paper, we report on the electrical characterization and the
   first imaging test results of the digital mammographic system. To assess
   the imaging capability of such a detector we have built a phantom, which
   simulates the breast tissue with malignancies. The radiographs of the
   phantom, obtained by delivering an entrance dose of 4.8 mGy, have shown
   particulars with a measured contrast below 1\%. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{New media technologies, such as the internet and email, have been seen
   as providing opportunities to reinvigorate representative democracy and
   parliamentary institutions. This article examines the use of new
   technologies by Australian Members of Parliament (MPs). It looks at the
   growth and function of MPs' websites and assesses how far such
   technologies might facilitate changes in their electorate, party and
   parliamentary roles. We analyse what factors persuade MPs to move online
   and how they then use the technologies. The results indicate that while
   websites amongst legislators are growing, they are used primarily as
   supplementary, administrative tools. Overall, technological innovation
   in the Australian Parliament is still relatively rare and it appears
   there are systemic barriers that limit the potential of information
   communication technologies (ICTs) in the representative process.}},

Journal = {{BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{3-18}},
Month = {{SUM}},
Abstract = {{Base station costs are dominated by the cost of radio frequency (RF)
   units, that is, the duplexers, the power amplifiers, and the radio
   cards. But Moore's law is not applicable to these components. It only
   applies to the digital processing units of a base station, such as the
   baseband processing, line interface, and central control cards. The
   continuous size reduction of features at the chip level allows for
   increasingly higher integration of digital functionality. But in RF
   units, form factor is often a function of wavelength, which prevents a
   higher level of integration. Significant form factor and cost reductions
   in RF, therefore, will not arise from ongoing incremental improvements.
   They will result only through architectural innovation. However, changes
   in architecture predominantly require certain key technologies that are
   not yet available. Within the context of European Union (EU) research
   funding, the key technologies that are necessary to turn future RF
   system architectural visions into reality are being developed. This
   paper elaborates on the RF system vision and the research framework into
   which Bell Labs Europe is embedded, for conducting collaborative
   research to acquire the missing technological assets. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{The Internet goose has laid countless golden eggs, along with a growing
   number of rotten ones. But it's the rotten ones that now tempt
   commercial, governmental, and consumer interests to threaten the
   Internet's uniquely creative power. The expediently selected, almost
   accidentally generative properties of the Internet - its technical
   openness, ease of access and mastery, and adaptability - have combined,
   especially when coupled with those of the PC, to produce an unsurpassed
   environment for innovative experiment. Those same properties, however,
   also make the Internet hospitable to various forms of wickedness:
   hacking, porn, spam, fraud, theft, predation, and attacks on the network
   itself. As these undesirable phenomena proliferate, business,
   government, and many users find common cause for locking down Internet
   and PC architecture in the interests of security and order.
   PC and Internet security vulnerabilities are a legitimate menace.
   However, the most likely reactions - if they are not forestalled - will
   be at least as unfortunate as the security problems themselves. Consider
   the growing profusion of ``tethered appliances{''} - devices whose
   functions cannot readily be altered by their owners (think TiVo). Such
   appliances take Internet innovations and wrap them up in a neat,
   easy-to-use package, which is good - but only if the Internet and PC can
   remain sufficiently in the center of the digital ecosystem to produce
   the next round of innovations and to generate competition. People buy
   these devices for their convenience or functionality and may appreciate
   the fact that they are safer to use (they limit the damage users can do
   through ignorance or carelessness). But the risk is that users, by
   migrating to such appliances, will unwittingly trade away the future
   benefits of generativity - a loss that will go unappreciated even as
   innovation tapers off.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments in nuclear physics, biomedicine and astronomy often require
   pulse-counting electronics for large numbers of channels. This paper
   describes an event-counting system attached to 60 channels of an
   innovative monolithic array of SinglePhoton Avalanche Diodes (SPADA)
   intended for astronomical use. The system can capture events with
   pulse-counting rates of up to 20 MHz, a minimum integration time of 10
   tts, which results in a data acquisition rate of 100 000 frames per
   second. It can also store several hours' worth of data. This performance
   is achieved in a system that offers a high degree of flexibility, is
   small in size and has a low cost. The implementation is based on a
   Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) single board, fitted with an FPGA and a
   DSP. This board is connected to a PC by means of an IEEE 1394 high-speed
   serial link which stores the collected data and functions as a TCP/IP
   server. The data acquisition parameters, as well as the collected data,
   can be accessed by means of a custom-designed interface running on a
   TCP/IP client. A proof-of-concept system has been assembled and some
   test stand results are presented and discussed.}},

   that highlights dynamic and highly interdependent relationships among
   multiple technologies. We argue that, instead of considering
   technologies in isolation, technology evolution is best viewed as a
   dynamic system or ecosystem that includes a variety of interrelated
   technologies. By considering the interdependent nature of technology
   evolution, we identify three roles that technologies play within a
   technology ecosystem. These roles are components, products and
   applications, and support and infrastructure. Technologies within an
   ecosystem interact through these roles and impact each others'
   evolution. We also classify types of interactions between technology
   roles, which we term paths of influence. We demonstrate the use of our
   proposed model through examples of wireless networking (Wi-Fi)
   technologies and a business mini-case on the digital music industry.}},

Abstract = {{For more than six years, the automated ultrasonic and eddy current
   systems for the inspection of railroad wheel sets developed by
   Fraunhofer IZFP and Fraunhofer TEG have been field-hardened through
   daily operation at various maintenance facilities of the Deutsche Balm
   (DB). The testing stations are equipped with IZFPs multi-channel
   electronics, a modular PC integrated system operating inside 19{''}
   rack-mounted industrial computers.
   Special requirements for new installations of stationary systems (AURA)
   and underfloor testing stations (UFPE) called for the development of
   state-of-the-art miniaturised front-end ultrasonic and eddy current test
   instrumentation. This innovation offers new dimensions for the concept
   and design of such systems, including features providing effortless
   maintenance of the inspection systems.
   Due to the small size of the electronic modules they can be placed in
   close proximity to the transducer assembly. Highspeed networking
   techniques ensure the transfer of all the acquired digital ultrasonic
   and eddy current data from the front-end modules to the workstation
   responsible for data acquisition and analysis. The new front-end
   technology is applied for the testing stations of the latest generation.
   One example is a system installed at the DB plant, Krefeld, specifically
   designed for the ultrasonic testing of Inter-City Express (ICE) train
   drive wheels. The transducer assembly for wheel rim and disk inspection
   includes hot-swap modules with integrated UT front-end modules adapted
   to inspect specific wheel disk configurations.
   A second example represents testing equipment operating at the
   Suddeutsche Rail Service GmbH, Kaiserslautern. Ultrasonic and eddy
   current front-end modules are responsible for the inspection of the
   wheel rim of disassembled wheel sets of freight cars. In addition to the
   wheel rim, the solid axle is inspected in the same test stand using GE's
   phased array system.
   Miniaturised front-end modules are also advantageous for the inspection
   with the wheel sets installed at the train. The concept of such an
   underfloor testing system is outlined.}},

Abstract = {{After 5 years working with a fully integrated RIS-PACS solution, we had
   to upgrade core and peripheral systems to get up-to-date technologies.
   The upgrade had to be done during normal daily work with no or only
   minimized shut down time. The goal was to perform the upgrade with a
   ``Near Zero Downtime''. Together with our RIS/PACS vendor, the following
   plan was developed. The upgrade of peripheral RIS-PACS workstations was
   done separately. The prepared workstations were put on place before the
   final migration took place. The most important aspect of this upgrade,
   migration of the core database, was done on two extra database servers
   simultaneously. Image distribution to clinicians was secured by paper
   prints and peripheral film reading possibilities, e. g. CR systems on
   intensive care units. With these ideas and precise project management we
   decreased the shut down time to less than 14 h. After this time, the
   webserver was able to do image delivery and modalities could send their
   images to the PACS System. The clinicians could use their known Viewer
   Applet to access images from the PACS. The peripheral update could be
   done with a more stressless timetable. Technology migration is a
   repeating problem with forthcoming digitalisation in medical imaging.
   The primary IT solutions are often not practicable in a working
   environment due to long shut down times. Innovative solutions and a
   precise project management helped us to minimize shut down time.}},

   road network model of the real-world congestion hot spot to determine
   the `cap' of the system in terms of vehicle volumes at which traffic
   efficiency deteriorates and the environmental externalities take off
   exponentially. (ii) Road users submit bids with the market-clearing
   price at the fixed `cap' supply of travel slots in a given time slice
   (peak hour) being determined by an electronic sealed bid uniform price
   Dutch auction. (iii) Cross-sectional demand data on car users who
   traverse the cordon area is used to model and calibrate the
   heterogeneous bid submission behaviour in order to construct the inverse
   demand function and demand elasticities. (iv) The willingness to pay
   approach with heterogeneous value of time is contrasted with the
   generalized cost approach to pricing congestion with homogenous value of

Abstract = {{A videogrammetric technique is proposed for measuring three-dimensional
   structural vibration response in the laboratory. The technique is based
   on the principles of close-range digital photogrammetry and computer
   vision. Two commercial-grade digital video cameras are used for image
   acquisition. To calibrate these cameras and to overcome potential lens
   distortion problems, an innovative two-step calibration process
   including individual and stereo calibration is proposed. These
   calibrations are efficiently done using a planar pattern arbitrarily
   shown at a few different orientations. This special characteristic makes
   it possible to perform an on-site calibration that provides flexibility
   in terms of using different camera settings to suit various application
   conditions. To validate the proposed technique, three tests, including
   sinusoidal motion of a point, wind tunnel test of a cross-section bridge
   model, and a three-story building model under earthquake excitation, are
   performed. Results indicate that the proposed videogrammetric technique
   can provide fairly accurate displacement measurement for all three
   tests. The proposed technique is shown to be a good complement to the
   traditional sensors for measuring two- or three-dimensional vibration
   response in the low-frequency range.}},

Journal = {{SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ONLINE}},
Year = {{2007}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores some of the implications for qualitative researchers
   within sociology of developments in Grid technology and thereby aims to
   contribute to the debate on the future of sociological research in an
   increasingly digitised world. The well-established field of humanities
   computing provides an interesting counterpoint.
   We use the methodological techniques of `secondary analysis' and `visual
   research', two currently marginal approaches within sociological
   research but with huge potential within e-environments, as lenses
   through which the potentials and pitfalls of Grid-supported qualitative
   work might be anticipated. Rather than a concern with the technical
   however, we argue for a concurrent attention to the methodological in
   relation to technological developments.
   We find that current developments in the qualitative field are more in
   line with the interests of the humanities and this may shape and
   constrain the research that sociologists could do. Also, that the
   conditions to support innovative sociological developments for
   qualitative Grid computing are not currently well developed or
   supported. We conclude that in order for a more progressive e-social
   science agenda to emerge, a broader constituency of sociological
   researchers should engage with the technological debate, otherwise we
   risk missing out on opportunities to shape emerging technologies to our
   research needs.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives. Recent reports on advances in computer-aided
   detection (CAD) indicate that current schemes miss early-stage breast
   cancers and result in a relatively large false-positive detection rate
   in order to achieve a high sensitivity rate for mass detection. This
   paper is inspired by the interpretation procedure from mammographers.
   The abnormal diagnosis can be derived from multiple views but is not
   available through single-view image analysis.
   Materials and Methods. A new multiview CAD system for early-stage breast
   cancer detection, which is based on modifying the optimized CAD
   algorithms from our prior single-view CAD system for constructing an
   adaptive ipsilateral multiview concurrent CAD system, is presented in
   this paper. The selection and design for the training and testing
   ipsilateral multiview mammogram databases are described here. Results.
   The performance evaluation of the developed ipsilateral multiview CAD
   system using free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis
   and computerized receiver operating characteristic experiments are
   presented. The results indicated that the proposed multiview CAD system
   is significantly superior to the single-view CAD systems based on
   statistically standard P-values.
   Conclusion. This paper addresses a very important and timely project. It
   is related to two main problems regarding the development of breast
   cancer detection and diagnosis: early-stage detection and diagnosis of
   breast cancer with digital mammogram, and overall improvement of CAD
   system performance for clinical implementation. In order to improve the
   efficacy, accuracy, and efficiency of the current CAD scheme, an
   entirely new class of CAD method is required. This paper is unique in
   that a comprehensive and state-of-the-art approach is proposed for the
   CAD scheme of digital mammography. From the design aspect of the CAD
   scheme, the proposed ipsilateral multiview CAD method is innovative and
   quite different from current single-view CAD methods.}},

Abstract = {{Consider the problem of sampling signals which are not bandlimited, but
   still have a finite number of degrees of freedom per unit of time, such
   as, for example, nonuniform splines or piecewise polynomials, and call
   the number of degrees of freedom per unit of time the rate of
   innovation. Classical sampling theory does not enable a perfect
   reconstruction of such signals since they are not bandlimited. Recently,
   it was shown that, by using an adequate sampling kernel and a sampling
   rate greater or equal to the rate of innovation, it is possible to
   reconstruct such signals uniquely {[}34]. These sampling schemes,
   however, use kernels with infinite support, and this leads to complex
   and potentially unstable reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we
   show that many signals with a finite rate of innovation can be sampled
   and perfectly reconstructed using physically realizable kernels of
   compact support and a local reconstruction algorithm. The class of
   kernels that we can use is very rich and includes functions satisfying
   Strang-Fix conditions, exponential splines and functions with rational
   Fourier transform. This last class of kernels is quite general and
   includes, for instance, any linear electric circuit. We, thus, show with
   an example how to estimate a signal of finite rate of innovation at the
   output of an RC circuit. The case of noisy measurements is also
   analyzed, and we present a novel algorithm that reduces the effect of
   noise by oversampling.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative current control scheme for a permanent magnet synchronous
   motor using a single current sensor placed at a low potential, in the DC
   return line of the inverter is proposed. The feedback mechanism employs
   a digital asymptotic sinusoidal curve-fitting observer implemented in a
   single field programmable gate array chip. The observer, activated by
   firing pulses, reconstructs the three-phase feedback signals. The
   asymptotic observer does not require the parameters of the motor or the
   load and it is robust under dynamic conditions. The development of the
   algorithm, implementation and experimental verification of the proposed
   control scheme are presented in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation of innovative Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI) provides
   a challenge for future interaction research and development. Brain
   Computer Interfaces (BCIs) exploit the ability of human communication
   and control bypassing the classical neuromuscular communication
   channels. In general, BCIs offer a possibility of communication for
   people with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis (ALS) or complete paralysis of all extremities due to high
   spinal cord injury. Beyond medical applications, a BCI conjunction with
   exciting multimedia applications, e.g., a dexterity discovery, could
   define a new level of control possibilities also for healthy customers
   decoding information directly from the user's brain, as reflected in EEG
   signals which are recorded non-invasively from the scalp.
   This contribution introduces the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI)
   and presents set-ups where the user is provided with intuitive control
   strategies in plausible interactive bio-feedback applications. Yet at
   its beginning, BBCI thus adds a new dimension in HCI research by
   offering the user an additional and independent communication channel
   based on brain activity only. Successful experiments already yielded
   inspiring proofs-of-concept. A diversity of interactive application
   models, say computer games, and their specific intuitive control
   strategies are now open for BCI research aiming at a further speed up of
   user adaptation and increase of learning success and transfer bit rates.
   BBCI is a complex distributed software system that can be run on several
   communicating computers responsible for (i) the signal acquisition, (ii)
   the data processing and (iii) the feedback application. Developing a BCI
   system, special attention must be paid to the design of the feedback
   application that serves as the HCI unit. This should provide the user
   with the information about her/his brain activity in a way that is
   intuitively intelligible. Exciting discovery applications qualify
   perfectly for this role. However, most of these applications incorporate
   control strategies that are developed especially for the control with
   haptic devices, e.g., joystick, keyboard or mouse. Therefore, novel
   control strategies should be developed for this purpose that (i) allow
   the user to incorporate additional information for the control of
   animated objects and (ii) do not frustrate the user in the case of a
   misclassification of the decoded brain signal.
   BCIs are able to decode different information types from the user's
   brain activity, such as sensory perception or motor intentions and
   imaginations, movement preparations, levels of stress, workload or
   task-related idling. All of these diverse brain signals can be
   incorporated in an exciting discovery scenario. Modern HCI research and
   development technologies can provide BCI researchers with the know-how
   about interactive feedback applications and corresponding control
   strategies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The French National Blood Transfusion Institute received
   approval from the French National Health Authority to organize a
   nationwide program for the evaluation of professional practices in the
   area of blood transfusion. Major issues of the project were: (1)
   managing numerous physicians spread nationwide; (2) tracking and storing
   the physician's entire process (from his/her enrolment to his/her
   lifelong follow-up); (3) creating a collaborative technique for
   processing an evaluation program; (4) enhancing exchanges between
   participants; (5) proposing effective implementation of the assessment.
   Methods: As faculty members with experience in distance learning, we
   considered the digital/electronic portfolio to be one of the most
   suitable techniques to support such a project. Due to the lack of
   methods and tools to meet users' expectations, the decision was made to
   prototype a new and innovative assessment environment. A team was formed
   to complete the design phase within 6 months (information content, roles
   and functions). Implementation of the prototype, which includes tests,
   was also planned over a 6-month period. The methodology involves two
   approaches: one concerns business process modelling; the other is
   related to object-oriented methods for design and implementation.
   Results: This primary work was aimed at describing a specific object,
   the evaluation program, which can be shared between players within a
   web-based collaborative platform. Four types of players were identified:
   (1) physicians enrolled into the assessment program; (2) tutors assigned
   to follow physicians' assessment process; (3) program directors who
   manage the content of the assessment program and the application of
   follow-up rules; (4) supervisors who administrate the global system. The
   evaluation program is composed of a set of actions, which has to be
   performed by the physicians. These actions are directly related to the
   activities of the business processes to which the candidate belongs. For
   each action, elements of proof have to be uploaded by the physician,
   according to a predefined schedule. The status of this object and its
   changes are followed and managed by a workflow engine. Implementation of
   the system required an object-oriented content management system
   (Zope/Plone).
   Conclusion: The object-oriented approach helped us to focus on the topic
   of interest, the assessment program, without being concerned by the
   whole environment. The assessment}},

Abstract = {{JRC has developed the Scrap Neutron Multiplicity Counter (SNMC): an
   advanced neutron multiplicity counter for the verification of
   inhomogeneous Pu samples, such as scrap material in MOX fuel fabrication
   plants. The innovative features of this counter with respect to existing
   ones rely on two aspects: (i) an optimised design based on Monte Carlo
   calculations in order to select the most appropriate materials, geometry
   and detector disposition for maximum efficiency and (ii) novel
   electronics based on digital signal processing (DSP) reducing the system
   dead time. The paper recalls the design process, the electronics, the
   construction and assembly of the counter. Then the results of the first
   experimental tests will be reported. We will show the characterization
   of the main physical parameters of the counter, the calibration and the
   verification of a wide variety of plutonium bearing samples available in
   the PERLA laboratory at JRC Ispra. This will include pure homogeneous
   samples (Pu dioxide powders, metal Pu, MOX powders and pellets) and some
   tests on heterogeneous samples representative of scrap material. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an innovative architecture to segment a news
   video into the so-called ``stories{''} by both using the included video
   and audio information. Segmentation of news into stories is one of the
   key issues for achieving efficient treatment of news-based digital
   libraries. While the relevance of this research problem is widely
   recognized in the scientific community, we are in presence of a few
   established solutions in the field. In our approach, the segmentation is
   performed in two steps: first, shots are classified by combining three
   different anchor shot detection algorithms using video information only.
   Then, the shot classification is improved by using a novel anchor shot
   detection method based on features extracted from the audio track. Tests
   on a large database confirm that the proposed system outperforms each
   single video-based method as well as their combination.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological sieves are capable of classifying objects in images
   according to their size. They yield a granulometry, which describes the
   imaged structure. The discrete sieve has some disadvantages that its
   continuous-domain counterpart does not have: sampled disks (used as
   isotropic structuring elements) are rather anisotropic, especially at
   small scales, and their area, as a function of the size in the
   continuous domain, shows jumps at apparently arbitrary locations. These
   problems cause a severe bias and low precision of the derived size
   distribution. Therefore we propose a new digitization scheme for
   implementing continuous sieves. First we increase the sampling density
   of the structuring element and the image. This does not add new detail
   to the image, but yields a sampled structuring element that is a much
   better approximation to its continuous counterpart, and thereby
   substantially reduces the discretization error. The second innovation is
   to shift the structuring element with respect to the sampling grid; this
   makes the size increments smoother, and further reduces the
   discretization errors. These ideas are validated on synthetic images. We
   also show that the proposed improvements allow for a finer scale
   sampling. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we estimate New Keynesian Phillips curves (NKPC) for U.S.
   manufacturing industries defined at the SIC two digit level over the
   period 1959 to 1996. This enables us to measure the extent of nominal
   inertia across industrial sectors. A key innovation in this research is
   the use of intermediate-goods costs rather than labor costs as a measure
   of marginal costs. Intermediate-goods costs are a more significant
   element of costs for the firms populating our sample and are not subject
   to the criticism that wage rates are nonallocative. We find that there
   is statistically significant variability in estimates of price
   stickiness, ranging from eight months to two years. We also find that
   estimates of backward-looking price-setting behavior vary, with some
   industries characterized by 81\% of pricing decisions made in a purely
   forward-looking manner, while in others only 52\% of pricing decisions
   are made that way. Market concentration (as captured by the
   Herfindahl-Hirschman index) appears to be associated with increased
   price stickiness, but reduced rule-of-thumb behavior, in setting prices.
   Finally, firms are also more likely to follow simple rules of thumb when
   output in their industry is more volatile.}},

Abstract = {{The retroconversion of the traditional catalogues of the Bavarian State
   Library (BSB) began in the 1980s and was completed with the conversion
   of its Alphabetical Catalogue 1841-1952, the so-called >> Ouartkatalog
   <<. For the 3.5 million titles which were converted into
   machine-readable form within less than 25 years, different conversion
   methods were carefully designed based on the latest available technology
   and the needs of the original catalogues. This article looks first at
   the conversion of the Book Catalogue (1501-1840) and Alphabetical
   Catalogue (1953-1981). The experiences gained from these projects helped
   in the planning of an optimized conversion of the Quartkatalog. Of
   primary importance for defining the parameters and ensuring the
   continued success of the conversion process is the exact analysis of the
   original catalogue, which was established over a period of 110 years.
   The analysis remains interesting as the catalogue continues to be
   available as an image catalogue on the Internet. This article further
   describes how innovative procedures in data selection, record reuse,
   rationalisation, cost-effective high-speed keyboarding and automated
   quality control processes were established in close cooperation between
   the library and the service provider. Of the 1.6 million records
   created, 58.55\% are reused records and 41.45\% made from scratch. The
   integration of these records into the Bavarian Union Catalogue (BVB) and
   the local catalogue of the Bavarian State Library ensures that they
   remain available in a living and active cataloguing context, which,
   however, is still to be supplemented by the remaining
   non-machine-readable catalogues of special collections in the Bavarian
   State Library. The successful retroconversion and the modernisation of
   bibliographic retrieval and cataloguing form the basis for an ongoing
   upgrade of the records, especially through the integration of links to
   digital images which will be created in the years to come. The methods
   applied here can serve as a model for similar large-scale conversion
   projects in other libraries.}},

Abstract = {{Information-sharing projects are becoming increasingly important in both
   public and private organizations. Generally, organizations base their
   decision to move forward with an information-sharing project on the
   project's expected benefits such as better services, operational
   savings, and increased program effectiveness. Clearly, potential
   impediments particular to the government environment could limit the
   attainment of benefits, jeopardizing the project's business case and
   even the project itself. Yet, we know very little about how users'
   perceived impediments affect a project's expected benefits in
   collaborative digital government initiatives. Using data from six public
   sector information-sharing projects, this paper reveals how some
   managerial and cultural impediments ( e. g., control-oriented
   management) limit perceptions of expected benefits. Surprisingly,
   political impediments were not found to significantly affect the
   expectations of benefits. Additionally, the paper provides managers with
   specific advice on how to better understand users' perceptions and
   expectations. The paper should be of interest to both academicians and
   practitioners who are interested in government information technology
   implementation, in general, and collaborative e-Government, in
   particular.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a speech-and-speaker (SAS) identification system
   based on spoken Arabic digit recognition. The speech signals of the
   Arabic digits from zero to ten are processed graphically (the signal is
   treated as an object image for further processing). The identifying and
   classifying methods are performed with Burg's estimation model and the
   algorithm of Toeplitz matrix minimal eigenvalues as the main tools for
   signal-image description and feature extraction. At the stage of
   classification, both conventional and neural-network-based methods are
   used. The success rate of the speaker-identifying system obtained in the
   presented experiments for individually uttered words is excellent and
   has reached about 98.8\% in some cases. The miss rate of about 1.2\% was
   almost only because of false acceptance (13 miss cases in 1100 tested
   voices). These results have promisingly led to the design of a security
   system-for SAS identification. The average overall,success rate was then
   97.45\% in recognizing one uttered word and identifying its speaker, and
   92.5\% in recognizing a three-digit password (three individual words),
   which is really a high success rate because, for compound cases, we
   should successfully test all the three uttered words consecutively in
   addition to and after identifying their speaker; hence, the probability
   of making an error is basically higher. The authors' major contribution
   to this task involves building a system to recognize both the uttered
   words and their speaker through an innovative graphical algorithm for
   feature extraction from the voice signal. This Toeplitz-based algorithm
   reduces the amount of computations from operations on an n x n matrix
   that contains n(2) different elements to a matrix (of Toeplitz form)
   that contains only n elements that are different from each other.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the skill preservation of an expert has been a serious
   problem in various fields. If digital skill preservation like a haptic
   database. is attained, it may become an innovative solution of this
   problem. This paper proposes abstraction and reproduction methods on
   bilateral control of force sensation from the real environment and
   reconstruction of the real environment as well. In the abstraction mode,
   which is based on bilateral control with disturbance observer, ``the law
   of action and reaction{''} is attained. Later, the environmental
   dynamical information is estimated and obtained. In the reconstruction
   mode, an environmental model is reconstructed based on the obtained data
   from the real environment. Then, in the reproduction mode, the operator
   would feel the force sensation from the obtained environmental model as
   if from the real environment. As a result, the proposed system is able
   to store the bilateral force sensation to a force sensation recorder. In
   this paper, some environmental models for the reproduction of vivid
   force sensation are compared experimentally. Finally, the viability of
   the proposed methods is shown by the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Demands for the low power VLSI have been pushing the development of
   aggressive design methodologies to reduce the power consumption
   drastically. To meet the growing demand, we propose low power adders
   that adaptively select supply voltages based on the input vector
   patterns. First, we apply the proposed scheme to the Ripple Carry Adder
   (RCA). A prototype design by a 0.18 mu m CMOS technology shows that the
   Adaptive VDD 32-bit RCA achieves 25\% power improvement over the
   conventional RCA with similar speed. The proposed adder cancels out the
   delay penalty, utilizing two innovative techniques: carry-skip
   techniques on the checking operands, and the use of Complementary Pass
   Transistor Logic (CPL) with dual supply voltage for level conversion. As
   an expansion to faster adder architectures, we extend the proposal to
   the Carry-Select Adders (CSA) composed of the RCA sub-blocks. We
   achieved 24\% power improvement on the 128-bit CSA prototype over a
   conventional design. The proposed scheme also achieves stand-by leakage
   power reduction-for 32-bit and 128-bit Adaptive RCA and CSA,
   respectively, 62\% and 54\% leakage reduction was possible.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation of innovative Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI) provides
   a challenge for future multimedia research and development.
   Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) exploit the ability of human
   communication and control bypassing the classical neuromuscular
   communication channels. In general, BCIs offer a possibility of
   communication for people with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as
   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or spinal cord injury. Beyond
   medical applications, a BCI conjunction with exciting multimedia
   applications, e. g., a dexterity game, could define a new level of
   control possibilities also for healthy customers decoding information
   directly from the user's brain, as reflected in electroencephalographic
   (EEG) signals which are recorded non-invasively from user's scalp. This
   contribution introduces the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) and
   presents setups where the user is provided with intuitive control
   strategies in plausible gaming applications that use biofeedback. Yet at
   its beginning, BBCI thus adds a new dimension in multimedia research by
   offering the user an additional and independent communication channel
   based on brain activity only. First successful experiments already
   yielded inspiring proofs-of-concept. A diversity of multimedia
   application models, say computer games, and their specific intuitive
   control strategies, as well as various Virtual Reality (VR) scenarios
   are now open for BCI research aiming at a further speed up of user
   adaptation and increase of learning success and transfer bit rates.}},

Abstract = {{By bringing together various parties and multidisciplinary
   contributions, digitalized art parcelizes the act of creation with, as a
   consequence, various ways for referring to the ``work{''} of art. The
   outcome of this joint, polyphonic production process might be a piece of
   software, separate from the work itself, or an artwork, which might or
   might not incorporate the computer program. What arrangements ultimately
   redistribute these multicentric externalities between the cooperating
   parties? How are the results of this coordination exploited depending on
   the market (academic or industrial) of destination? By emphasizing the
   arrangements necessary for finishing a co-production whose social career
   is described, this article draws attention to the changes introduced
   through digitalized innovations and explains the new arrangements for
   giving credits and promoting partnerships between art, science and
   technology. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tons droits reserves.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is essential to measure the skin dose of
   radiation received by patients during interventional neuroradiologic
   procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance, such as embolization
   of cerebral aneurysms, which is regarded as a high-dose interventional
   radiology procedure. In this study, we report a method for evaluating
   maximum skin dose (MSD), an ideal marker of radiation-induced effects,
   based on an innovative use of radiochromic films.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight procedures were studied in 42
   patients undergoing embolization of cerebral aneurysms. Fluoroscopic and
   digital dose-area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time, and total number of
   acquired images were recorded for all procedures. The MSD was measured
   using Gafchromic XR type R films.
   RESULTS: The MSD was measured in one group of 21 procedures. The
   coefficient (K) of the interpolation line between the skin dose and the
   DAP (K = 0.0029 cm(-2)) was determined. An approximate value of MSD from
   the DAP for the remaining 27 procedures was estimated by means of an
   interpolation line. The mean MSD was found to be 1.16 Gy (range,
   0.23-3.20 Gy).
   CONCLUSION: The use of radiochromic XR type B films was shown to be an
   effective method for measuring MSD. These films have the advantage of
   supplying information on both the maximum dose and the distribution of
   the dose: this satisfies the most stringent interpretation of Food and
   Drug Administration, American College of Radiology, and international
   recommendations for recording skin dose.}},

Abstract = {{Government support for the production and consumption of educational
   software is now a key element of New Labour's education technology
   drive. At present much attention is being directed towards marketing
   `digital learning' to an educational sector traditionally wary of
   technological innovation. In an effort to understand the social shaping
   of this current phase of policy-making, the present paper examines the
   political and commercial discourses surrounding digital learning and
   associated initiatives such as Curriculum Online and the Digital
   Curriculum. After analysing a range of political and commercial texts
   produced from 2000 to 2005, the paper explores the dominant themes
   emerging from these discursive constructions-considering in particular
   the limitations of the often ambiguous yet structured ways in which
   digital learning is being shaped by its key actors.}},

Abstract = {{Most firms struggle to adapt to discontinuous changes in their
   environment - witness Lego's very slow adaptation to the world of
   digital devices and online games. One key reason for this is that they
   get locked into established networks of relationships and struggle to
   break out of these relationships and establish new ones. This article
   examines the approaches firms can use to build relationships with new
   prospective partners that are more suited to the opportunities and
   threats they face in new competitive environments. it identifies the key
   barriers that prevent firms from accessing these networks for
   discontinuous innovation{''} and presents specific strategies that firms
   can adopt to overcome them. The challenge involves three steps: finding
   the right partners to engage with, forming relationships with them, and
   then building high-performing networks. By following the guidelines
   proposed in this article, firms will be more likely to create
   high-performing networks for discontinuous innovation.}},

Abstract = {{While terrestrial mobile multimedia broadcasting presents an exciting
   opportunity for both innovation and convergence to provide multimedia
   services in new operating environments, it remains a challenge to locate
   frequency spectrum in which to deploy these applications. The fact is
   that the frequencies suitable for such applications in a mobile
   environment are already heavily encumbered, and it is difficult to
   locate bands that are harmonized, even on a regional basis. Nonetheless,
   there are also opportunities for new mobile multimedia broadcasting
   applications, given the transition to technologies that more efficiently
   utilize spectrum, such as in the case of the analog to digital
   television transition.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the modified state-space self-tuning control (STC), a novel
   low-order tuner via the modified observer/Kalman filter identification
   (OKID) is proposed for stochastic fractional-order chaotic systems. The
   OKID method is a time-domain technique that identifies a discrete
   input-output map by using known input-output sampled data in the general
   coordinate form, through an extension of the eigensystem realization
   algorithm (ERA). First, the estimated system in the general coordinate
   based on the conventional OKID method is transformed to the one in an
   observer form to fit the state-space innovation form for the STC. Then,
   in stead of the conventional recursive least squares (RLS)
   identification algorithm used for STC, the Kalman filter as a parameter
   estimator with the state-space innovation form is presented for
   effectively estimating the time-varying parameters. Besides, taking the
   advantage of the digital redesign approach, the derivation of the
   current-output-based observer is proposed for the modified STC. As a
   result, the low-order state-space self-tuner with the high-gain
   controller property is then proposed for stochastic fractional-order
   chaotic systems, which the fractional operators are well approximated
   using the standard high integer-order operators. Finally, the
   fractional-order Chen and Rossler systems with stochastic system process
   and measurement noises are used as illustrative examples to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations to control interfaces for electric powered wheelchairs
   (EPWs) could benefit 220 000 current users and over 125 000 individuals
   who desire mobility but cannot use a conventional motion sensing
   joystick (MSJ). We developed a digital isometric joystick (IJ) with
   sophisticated signal processing and two control functions. In a prior
   study, subjects' driving accuracy with our IJ was comparable to using an
   MSJ. However, we observed subjects using excessive force on the IJ
   possibly because its rigid post provides no positional feedback. Thus,
   this paper examines the time-series data recorded in the previous study
   to characterize subjects' force control strategies since weakness is a
   concern. Eleven EPW users with upper limb impairments drove an EPW using
   an IJ with two different control functions and an MSJ in a Fitts' law
   paradigm. Subjects relied upon positional feedback from the MSJ and used
   appropriate force. In contrast, subjects using the IJ with either
   control function applied significantly higher force than necessary (p <
   0.0001 and p = 0.0058). Using higher average force was correlated with
   quicker trial times but not associated with accuracy. Lack of positional
   feedback may result in use of excess isometric force. Modifying control
   functions, adjusting gain, or providing additional training or feedback
   might address this problem.}},

Abstract = {{Due to a need for security screening instruments capable of detecting
   explosives and nuclear materials there is growing interest in neutron
   generator systems suitable for field use for applications broadly
   referred to as active neutron interrogation (ANI). Over the past two
   years Thermo Electron Corporation has developed a suite of different
   compact accelerator neutron generator products specifically designed for
   ANI field work to meet this demand. These systems incorporate
   hermetically-sealed particle accelerator tubes designed to produce fast
   neutrons using either the deuterium-deuterium (E (n) = 2.5 MeV) or
   deuterium-tritium (E (n) = 14.1 MeV) fusion reactions. Employing
   next-generation features including advanced sealed-tube accelerator
   designs, all-digital control electronics and innovative housing
   configurations these systems are suitable for many different uses. A
   compact system weighing less than 14 kg (MP 320) with a lifetime
   exceeding 1000 hours has been developed for portable applications. A
   system for fixed installations (P 325) has been developed with an
   operating life exceeding 4500 hours that incorporates specific
   serviceability features for permanent facilities with
   difficult-to-access shield blocks. For associated particle imaging (API)
   investigations a second-generation system (API 120) with an operating
   life of greater than 1000 hours has been developed for field use in
   which a high resolution fiber-optic imaging plate is specially
   configured to take advantage of a neutron point-source spot size of
   similar to 2 mm.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the use of a LISST-100 device to monitor the
   effective particle size characteristics of suspended sediment in situ,
   and at a quasi-continuous temporal resolution. The study site was
   located on the River Exe at Thorverton, Devon, UK. This device has not
   previously been utilized in studies of fluvial suspended sediment at the
   storm event scale, and existing studies of suspended sediment dynamics
   have not involved such a high temporal resolution for extended periods.
   An evaluation of the field performance of the instrument is presented,
   with respect to innovative data collection and analysis techniques. it
   was found that trends in the effective particle size distribution (EPSD)
   and degree of flocculation of suspended sediment at the study site were
   highly complex, and showed significant short-term variability that has
   not previously been documented in the fluvial environment. The
   collection of detailed records of EPSD facilitated interpretation of the
   dynamic evolution of the size characteristics of suspended sediment, in
   relation to its likely source and delivery and flocculation mechanisms.
   The influence of measurement frequency is considered in terms of its
   implications for future studies of the particle size of fluvial
   suspended sediment employing in situ data acquisition. (C) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The recent decline in the condition of coral reef communities worldwide
   has fueled the need to develop innovative assessment tools to document
   coral abundance and distribution rapidly and effectively. While most
   monitoring programs rely primarily on data collected in situ by trained
   divers, digital photographs and video are used increasingly to extract
   ecological indicators, provide a permanent visual record of reef
   condition, and reduce the time that divers spend underwater.
   In this study, we describe the development and application of a
   video-based reef survey methodology based on an algorithm for image
   registration and the estimation of image motion and camera trajectory.
   This technology was used to construct two-dimensional, spatially
   accurate, high-resolution mosaics of the reef benthos at a scale of up
   to 400 m(2). The mosaics were analyzed to estimate the size and percent
   cover of reef organisms and these ecological indicators of reef
   condition were compared to similar measurements collected by divers to
   evaluate the potential of the mosaics as monitoring tools.
   The ecological indicators collected by trained divers compared favorably
   with those measured directly from the video mosaics. Five out of the
   eight categories chosen (hard corals, octocorals, Palythoa, algal turf,
   and sand) showed no significant differences in percent cover based on
   survey method. Moreover, no significant differences based on survey
   method were found in the size of coral colonies. Lastly, the capability
   to extract the same reef location from mosaics collected at different
   times proved to be an important tool for documenting change in coral
   abundance as the removal of even small colonies (< 10 cm in diameter)
   was easily documented.
   The two-dimensional video mosaics constructed in this study can provide
   repeatable, accurate measurements on the reef-plot scale that can
   complement measurements on the colony-scale made by divers and surveys
   conducted at regional scales using remote sensing tools.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an important image
   technique for oral surgery (dentoalveolar surgery and dental
   implantology) and maxillofacial applications. This technique requires
   compact sized scanners with a relatively low radiation dosage, which
   makes them suitable for imaging of the craniofacial region. This article
   aims to present the concept and the preliminary findings obtained with
   the prototype of a new CBCT scanner with dedicated 3D software,
   specifically designed for dental imaging.
   Methods The prototype implements an X-ray tube with a nominal focal spot
   of 0.5 mm operating at 70-100 kVp and 1-4 mA. The detector is a 6 in.
   image intensifier coupled with a digital CCD camera. Dosimetry was
   performed on a RANDO anthropomorphic phantom using Beryllium Oxide
   thermo-luminescent dosimeters positioned in the phantom in the following
   site: eyes, thyroid, skin (lips, cheeks, back of the neck), brain,
   mandible, maxilla and parotid glands. Doses were measured using four
   configurations, changing the field-of-view (4'' and 6'') and acquisition
   time (10 and 20 s) of the CBCT. Acquisitions were performed with
   different parameters regarding the x-ray tube, pixel size and
   acquisi-tion geometries to evaluate image quality in relation to
   modulation transfer function (MTF), noise and geometric accuracy.
   Results The prototype was able to acquire a complete maxillofacial scan
   in 10-15 s. The CT reconstruction algorithm delivered images that were
   judged to have high quality, allowing for precise volume rendering. The
   radiation dose was determined to be 1-1.5 times that of the dose applied
   during conventional dental panoramic studies.
   Conclusion Preliminary studies using the CBCT prototype indicate that
   this device provides images with acceptable diagnostic content at a
   relatively low radiation dosage, if compared to systems currently
   available on the market.}},

Abstract = {{Adopting the Internet for advanced marketing operations opens up
   challenging opportunities for firms of all sizes. However, such adoption
   might destroy investments in present market channels and thus has the
   characteristics of radical innovation. In this article, we draw on the
   literature on innovation to investigate what differentiates adopters of
   advanced Internet-based marketing operations from non-adopters in firms
   of different sizes. The conceptual model for this study is centred on
   the set of internal and external factors-size, willingness to
   cannibalize, entrepreneurial drivers, management support, and market
   pressure. Our analysis is built on survey data from 379 Swedish
   manufacturing firms. The results of analysis show that composition of
   factors on which firms base their decision to adopt advanced
   Internet-based marketing operations varies significantly with firm size.
   A number of implications for further research as well as for managers
   and educators are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The latest SRAM-based FPGA devices are making the development of
   low-cost, high-performance, re-configurable systems feasible, paving the
   way for innovative architectures suitable for mission- or
   safety-critical applications, such as those dominating the space or
   avionic fields. Unfortunately, SRAM-based FPGAs are extremely sensitive
   to Single Event Upsets (SEUs) induced by radiation. SEUs may alter the
   logic value stored in the memory elements the FPGAs embed. A large part
   of the FPGA memory elements is dedicated to the configuration memory,
   whose content dictates how the resources inside the FPGA have to be used
   to implement any given user circuit, SEUs affecting configuration memory
   cells can be extremely critics. Facing the effects of SEUs through
   radiation-hardened FPGAs is not cost-effective. Therefore, various
   fault-tolerant design techniques have been devised for developing
   dependable solutions, starting from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)
   SRAM-based FPGAs. These techniques present advantages and disadvantages
   that must be evaluated carefully to exploit them successfully. In this
   paper we mainly adopted an empirical analysis approach. We evaluated the
   reliability of a multiplier, a digital FIR filter, and an 8051
   microprocessor implemented in SRAM-based FPGA's, by means of extensive
   fault-injection experiments, assessing the capability provided by
   different design techniques of tolerating SEUs within the FPGA
   configuration memory. Experimental results demonstrate that by combining
   architecture-level solutions (based on redundancy) with layout-level
   solutions (based on reliability-oriented place and route) designers may
   implement reliable re-configurable systems choosing the best solution
   that minimizes the penalty in terms of area and speed degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The X-ray pixel chip with adaptable dynamics (XPAD3) circuit is the next
   generation of 2D X-ray photon counting imaging chip to be connected to a
   pixel sensor using the bump and flip-chip technologies. This circuit,
   designed in IBM 0.25 mu m technology, contains 9600 pixels (130 mu m x
   130 mu m) distributed into 80 columns of 120 elements each. Its features
   have been improved to provide high-counting rate over 10(9)
   ph/pixel/mm(2), high-dynamic range over 60 keV, very low-noise detection
   level of 100e(-) rms, energy window selection and fast image readout
   less than 2 ms/frame. An innovative architecture has been designed in
   order to prevent the digital circuits from bothering the very sensitive
   analogue parts placed in their neighbourhood. This allows to read the
   chip during acquisition while conserving the precise setting of the
   thresholds over the pixel array. Finally, the aim of this development is
   to combine several XPAD3 to form the PIXSCAN detector. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Title = {{A distributed monthly hydrological model for integrating spatial
   variations of basin topography and rainfall}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{242-252}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Hydrological models at a monthly time-scale are important tools for
   hydrological analysis, such as in impact assessment of climate change
   and regional water resources planning. Traditionally, monthly models
   adopt a conceptual, lumped-parameter approach and cannot account for
   spatial variations of basin characteristics and climatic inputs. A large
   requirement for data often severely limits the utility of physically
   based, distributed-parameter models. Based on the variable-source-area
   concept, we considered basin topography and rainfall to be two major
   factors whose spatial variations play a dominant role in runoff
   generation and developed a monthly model that is able to account for
   their influences in the spatial and temporal dynamics of water balance.
   As a hybrid of the Xinanjiang model and TOPMODEL, the new model is
   constructed by innovatively making use of the highly acclaimed
   simulation techniques in the two existing models. A major contribution
   of this model development study is to adopt the technique of implicit
   representation of soil moisture characteristics in the Xinanjiang model
   and use the TOPMODEL concept to integrate terrain variations into runoff
   simulation. Specifically, the TOPMODEL topographic index In(a/tan beta)
   is converted into an index of relative difficulty in runoff generation
   (IRDG) and then the cumulative frequency distribution of IRDG is used to
   Substitute the parabolic curve, which represents the spatial variation
   of soil storage capacity in the Xinanjiang model. Digital elevation
   model data play a key role in the modelling procedures on a geographical
   information system platform, including basin segmentation. estimation of
   rainfall for each sub-basin and computation of terrain characteristics.
   Other monthly data for model calibration and validation are rainfall,
   pan evaporation and runoff. The new model has only three parameters to
   be estimated, i.e. watershed-average field capacity WM, pan coefficient
   eta and runoff generation coefficient a. Sensitivity analysis
   demonstrates that runoff is least sensitive to WM and, therefore. it can
   be determined by a prior estimation based on the climate and soil
   properties of the study basin. The other two parameters can be
   determined using optimization methods. Model testing was carried out in
   a number of nested sub-basins of two watersheds (Yuanjiang River and
   Dongjiang River) in the humid region in central and southern China.
   Simulation results show that the model is capable of describing spatial
   and temporal variations of water balance components, including soil
   moisture content, evapotranspiration and runoff, over the watershed.
   With a minimal requirement for input data and parameterization, this
   terrain-based distributed model is a valuable contribution to the
   ever-advancing technology of hydrological modelling. Copyright (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Virtual Manufacturing (VM) applies Virtual Reality (VR) technology to
   provide a digital manufacturing solution in both 3D visual and
   interactive ways. It makes VR no longer a state-of-the art but rather an
   innovation technology to support modern industry. With the rapid growth
   of network technology and Web 3D graphics techniques, we propose a
   cost-effective distributed VM system for Small and Medium-sized
   Enterprises (SMEs) with limited equipment, funds and technical
   capabilities. The system enables SMEs to perform collaborative tasks
   including product design, manufacturing and resources sharing through
   the World Wide Web (WWW) in lower cost. This paper describes the design
   and critical integration issues of the system and the use of the Web 3D
   technology - X3D. It also evaluates the distributed VM system by
   comparing it to the conventional stand-alone CAD/CAM system.}},

Abstract = {{The NSROC Program (NASA Sounding Rocket Operations) was privatized in
   February 1999 at NASA Wallops Island, Virginia, USA. NSROC Teammates
   Northrop Grumman and Orbital Sciences Corporation continue to
   successfully implement the NASA Sounding Rocket Program. NSROC provides
   the cradle-to-grave program for the worldwide scientific community. As
   of 15 February 2007, NSROC has performed 181 Sounding Rocket flights at
   launch ranges around the globe. These missions have supported various
   science disciplines including Geospace, Solar/Heliospheric, High Energy
   Astrophysics, UV/Optical Astrophysics, Solar System Exploration, Student
   Outreach and Technology Innovation.
   Recovery of sounding rocket payloads is typical for many of the NSROC
   launches at both land and coastal launch ranges. A payload's reentry
   characteristics, thermal distribution and dynamic stability though the
   atmosphere are critical for the proper positioning and preparation for
   the recovery phase. A certain Black Brant IX mission from White Sands
   Missile Range in the summer of 2006 noted peculiar reentry dynamics that
   led to an atypical recovery. Details of this mission and its recovery
   will be shared.
   NSROC is developing the Mesquito sounding rocket vehicle for lower
   mesosphere scientific investigations. The two-stage vehicle includes a
   high thrust, short duration first stage motor and a non-propulsive
   second stage that also allows for rapid reload capability. The
   streamlined processing allows for the ability to launch a series of
   vehicles that can provide both temporal and spatial measurements and is
   planned for 30 minute interval launches. The Mesquito is a low cost
   sounding rocket that can contain a user specified payload or can
   interface with a small suite of avionics and instrument(s). A full
   telemetry suite is available to transmit 2 mbit/sec of payload data. The
   data can include analog, digital, parallel, synchronous, asynchronous
   and/or video data. System details and the qualification status will be
   shared.}},

Abstract = {{Media players, Personal Digital Assistants and Cell Phones are rapidly
   becoming more adept at rendering media files. Support for a plethora of
   CODECS can be found even in fairly inexpensive devices. While these
   devices are becoming increasingly capable of rendering media, the media
   itself has largely been relegated to prerecorded music, radio and
   television excerpts, and pay per download entertainment content. This
   paper is intended to introduce both the concept and the system
   surrounding digital media in the enterprise realm. This digital media is
   created dynamically, from enterprise resources, databases, XML data and
   other repositories. In addition to our innovations that will give
   corporate users access to enterprise media in a handheld form factor,
   our research is also focused on globalization, investigating ways in
   which products can be transformed into multi-lingual offerings to serve
   a new generation of global business needs.}},

Abstract = {{TerraSAR-X is a multi-role SAR Satellite with active phased array
   antenna technology which will be the backbone of the next German
   national radar Earth observation mission. With its large variety of
   different SAR imaging modes and its high operational flexibility,
   TerraSAR-X will ideally serve both the scientific community and users
   from the industrial sector. The innovative satellite system design is
   based on the rich experience from past German and European SAR space
   missions like X-SAR, SRTM, ERS 1\&2 and Envisat combined with
   state-of-the-art Earth Observation Bus technology as used e.g. on the
   CHAMP and GRACE satellites. In a preparatory effort co-funded by the
   national agency DLR and its industrial partner EADS Astrium, the main
   new, performance critical SAR features of TerraSAR-X were thoroughly
   studied, and a sound market analysis was undertaken to define individual
   system requirements concerning image product characteristics and
   availability.
   The paper describes the TerraSAR-X system design and performance, with
   emphasis on the SAR instrument and SAR-relevant features of the
   satellite bus. SAR product performance relevant elements of the
   satellite system architecture are discussed in particular. Also the
   additional payloads flying on TerraSAR-X-the Tracking, Occultation and
   Ranging experiment (TOR) furnished by the GeoForschungszentrum Potsdam
   (GFZ) and the Laser Communication Terminal (LCT) furnished by DLR with
   the industrial prime contractor Tesat-are briefly introduced. Moreover,
   a short description on the TanDEM-X mission is given to generate a
   global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with an unprecedented accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting proteins in human blood holds the promise of a revolution in
   cancer diagnosis. Also, the ability to perform laboratory operations on
   small scales using miniaturized (lab-on-a-chip) devices has many
   benefits. Designing and fabricating such systems is extremely
   challenging, but physicists and engineers are beginning to construct
   such highly integrated and compact tabs on chips with exciting
   functionality.
   This paper focuses on the presentation of the requirements of the
   information technology layer in such an integrated platform been
   developed in the LOCCANDIA project. LOCCANDIA is a Specific Targeted
   Research project (STREP) funded under the 6th Framework program of the
   EC. Its ultimate objective is to develop an innovative nanotechnology
   based (lab-on-a-chip) platform for the medical-proteomics field.
   The paper presents the main engineering aspects, challenges and
   architecture for creating an Integrated Clinico-Proteomic Environment.
   The environment will be used to monitor and document the analysis and
   discovery chain and to allow the physician to interpret the digital
   spectrogram data delivered by the mass spectrometer, for diagnostic
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presented the development an innovative system to determine
   the Prayer Times and the current digital Qiblat (Ka'bah) direction in
   real time using Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)/ Pocket PC with

   been developed to help users determine their current Prayer Times and
   Qiblat direction automatically even if they are on the move or in any
   type of vehicles such as in airplanes, ships, trains etc. The GPS
   receiver will capture information with regards to the user's current

   This is done in compliance with the IEC 61508, an international norm for
   the functional safety of electronic safety-related systems, of which an
   overview is given in the paper. The Methodology is based on a theory to
   decompose a digital circuit in ``sensible zones{''} and a tool that
   automatically extracts these sensible zones from the RTL description. it
   includes as well a spreadsheet to compute the metrics required by the
   IEC norm such Diagnostic Coverage and Safe Failure Fraction. The FMEA
   results are validated by using another tool suite including a fault
   injection environment. The paper explains how to take benefits of the
   information provided by such approach and as example it is described how
   the methodology has been applied to design memory sub-systems to be used
   in fault robust microcontrollers for automotive applications. This
   methodology has been approved by TUV-SUD as the flow to assess and
   validate the Safe Failure Fraction of a given SoC in adherence to IEC

Abstract = {{The recent advances made in MEMS and particularly in RF MEMS technology
   are enabling new architectures for the integration of RF transceivers
   with improved performance and smaller size. Several fundamental building
   blocks benefit from the availability of high-Q resonators in the RF
   front-end, the analog baseband and the frequency synthesizer to lower
   power consumption, phase noise and die area. In addition, the
   compatibility of MEMS with CMOS opens the door to a higher integration
   level using for example an above-IC approach.
   This paper presents the recent work made at CSEM in the field of ultra
   low-power transceiver for wireless sensor network applications. It first
   presents the high-Q resonators, including the BAW resonators used in the
   RF front-end and in the RF oscillator together with MEMS used in the low
   frequency oscillators and IF section. These MEMS are activated thanks to
   an AlN piezo layer avoiding the need for high voltage generation which
   is incompatible with the low-power and low-voltage requirement. These
   MEMS are also temperature compensated by the combination of additional
   layers and electronics means.
   The paper then focuses on the main building blocks that can take
   advantage of high-Q resonators starting with the RIF front-end. The
   fundamentals of oscillators built around high-Q devices is described,
   highlighting the basic trade-offs. Finally, new approaches for the
   analog baseband are described. This includes an example of a quadrature
   Delta-Sigma converter combining the different functions of anti-alias
   and image-reject filter together with analog-to-digital conversion. An
   alternative to traditional Delta-Sigma oversampled converters is the use
   of phase analog-to-digital converters to directly quantize the phase
   information without the need to convert the amplitude. This innovative
   approach can save power and complexity for all wireless applications
   using phase or frequency modulations).}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new time-domain simulation method particularly
   amenable for highly heterogeneous nonlinear RF circuits as modern
   wireless transceivers that combine analog RF and both analog and digital
   base-band circuitry. It uses innovative multi-rate Runge-Kutta
   algorithms applied to the envelope transient method over a time-domain
   periodic steady state technique (shooting), to efficiently resolve
   strongly nonlinear circuits excited by forcing functions of very
   distinct time-scales and exhibiting slow (latent) and fast-varying
   (active) state-variables. Attributing different time-steps to these
   latent and active state-variables speedup gains of more than 1-to-7 in
   simulation time were obtained for even a circuit example of very small
   size.}},

Abstract = {{It is a well known fact that telecommunications services are not equally
   available to everyone in the world. This disparity is often called the
   ``Digital Divide,{''} There has been plenty of talk and publications
   about this disparity, but little progress has been made. People
   underestimate the principle that services will be available in a market
   economy if they can be provided at a profit. The service providers in
   affluent regions thrive, simply because it's a profitable business. The
   paper defines a concept to transfer money from existing profitable
   operations to support sustained operations in less affluent areas to
   provide local interfaces. This is mainly done to stimulate profitable
   business for telecom, operators in poor regions of the world. There is
   sufficient precedent for similar transfers, although not on an
   international basis, among domestic telecommunications operators in
   North America and elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Automated impact detection and characterization on aircraft and
   spacecraft has been an elusive goal due to the transitory nature of the
   detectable high-frequency signals involved. Invocon, Inc. has been
   awarded a NASA Phase 2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program
   to develop self-contained, miniaturized, piezoelectric sensory nodes
   with extremely low-power trigger modes that are synchronized within a
   radio frequency network. Each node will continuously monitor an
   accelerometer, acoustic emission sensor, or PZT element for an impact
   event, such as a micro-meteor impact or the foam impact that caused the
   Columbia tragedy. When a programmable threshold is exceeded, a
   low-latency signal acquisition circuit will capture the event as a
   digital waveform for post-processing and impact characterization
   including amplitude and time-of-arrival analysis. The innovative signal
   conditioning circuit design is capable of operation in the micro-watt
   range on average while constantly maintaining the capability to acquire
   and process very high frequency acoustic signals. Such performance can
   potentially provide operating lifetimes of 5 years on a single AA
   battery, or unlimited operation from scavenged power sources.
   Additionally, the system will provide a general purpose hardware
   platform on which Integrated Structural Health Monitoring (ISHM)
   algorithms and sensing techniques can be implemented. The same basic
   system design, with configurable sample rates, sensor interfaces,
   actuation outputs, and local processing algorithms, could be used for
   active or passive damage detection, locating leaks from pressurized
   vehicles and habitats through the produced airborne and surface-borne
   ultrasonic energy, or detecting crack propagation or delamination in
   structures through Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques. By allowing the
   development, demonstration, and potentially deployment of these ISHM
   capabilities on miniaturized devices optimized for low-power and
   distributed operation, the goals of ISHM will be more effectively
   achieved for aircraft and spacecraft. This paper shall provide a general
   description of the triggering capabilities, data acquisition circuit
   design, overall system design, and potential applications.(1 2).}},

Abstract = {{Digital designs today have become extremely complex as the latest
   technologies such as DVI and HDTV require the ability to move larger
   quantities of data than their predecessors. New technologies including
   faster clock rates and higher throughput buses have enabled designers to
   switch to serial protocols from older parallel protocols as a way to
   increase overall data throughput while minimizing the pin-out and
   footprint of their designs. Engineers are forced to find cost-effective
   ways to prototype and implement these designs quickly to allow them stay
   ahead of their competitors and meet aggressive time-to-market deadlines.
   In this paper, we will discuss strategies to implement high-speed serial
   protocols for digital communication using the latest commercial PC
   innovations. We will explore the advantages of field programmable gate
   array (FPGA) technology as well as PCI Express and PXI Express as a
   platform to develop a reconfigurable digital interfacing and test
   platform. We will discuss how engineers can combine these technologies
   with graphical programming techniques to implement digital protocols
   such as Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Aurora, or Digital Visual
   Interface (DVI) quickly with in-line processing algorithms to meet
   changing system requirements for today and tomorrow.}},

Abstract = {{The maintainability and reliability of critical electronic systems such
   as radars and Global Positioning System (GPS) on military and commercial
   aircrafts is a significant concern. Practical condition assessment and
   prediction of remaining useful life for such systems offer significant
   potential for improved readiness and field reliability. This paper
   introduces the `circuit as a sensor' concept as an innovative and
   practical PHM solution for Electronic Systems through proof of concept
   using Radio Frequency Digital (RF/D) systems. To demonstrate the
   feasibility of this concept, an economical test platform operating in
   the frequency range representative of modern avionic systems, with
   available system and component features was selected. An experiment to
   study the effects of degradation from the highly accelerated tests on
   diagnostic features as well as derive failure progression trends was
   conducted. Results from this research are presented. The embedded
   diagnostic and prognostic capability developed is scalable and can tie
   applied to broad class of electronic systems.}},

   for the optimal intensity of watermark by using the adaptive tabu seacrh

   commonly employed in literature. In addition, the watermarked image
   quality is also considered. We employ GA and ATS for the optimal
   localization and intensity of watermark. The watermark detection process
   can be performed without using the original audio signal. The
   experimental results are presented to demonstrate that watermark is
   inaudible and robust to many digital signal processing, such as

Abstract = {{The innovative software architecture of the Wireless Distributed
   Measurement System (W-DMS) including the Dynamic Measurement Application
   Repository Server (D-MARS) is proposed. The tasks of the D-MARS are
   devoted to supply the mobile devices, as the Personal Digital Assistant
   (PDA) with the measurement applications in order to manage and control
   the measurement instruments. The D-MARS permits to download on demand
   two different typologies of Virtual Instruments (VIs). One concerns all
   the functionalities of the Measurement Instrument (MI). The other one
   concerns with the specific functionalities of the MI selected by the
   mobile user and it is organised by modules on the basis of the new
   design approach. The modules are obtained by splitting up the
   traditional VI in several functional entities. Each module implements
   specific functionalities of the MI and is able to operate as autonomous
   and self containing entity. The selection among these modules allows the
   user to dynamically configure the measurement procedure by operating on
   the PDA.
   The aspects concerning the design and the architecture of the D-MARS are
   discussed The new design approach of the modules is shown. In order to
   evidence the innovative features, an applicative example is shown.}},

Abstract = {{The paper proposes an innovative system to multiplex digital information
   over a cable network. The key principle is to artificially create
   multiple reflections in a controlled way and use multi-path propagation.
   At the transmitter side, the information is modulated by letting
   termination impedances vary. At the receiver side, network scattering
   parameters are measured for different frequencies and used by supervised
   classification techniques to recover the digital streams of the
   transmitters. The system is optimized through the joint design of four
   parts: the transmitter modulation scheme, the cable network
   characteristics, the measured scattering parameters and the receiver
   algorithm. We particularly investigate the network topology, the
   measurement frequencies, and the distance metrics. A low-complexity
   receiver algorithm is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The management of digital identities, despite its potential to generate
   business value, creates significant engineering challenges for modern
   firms. In this paper, we first provide an architectural overview of
   identity and access management (IDAM) technologies along with an
   analysis of patenting activities to establish that the IDAM market
   segment dominates the information security sector. An empirical study,
   based on data pertaining to public firms with a significant share of the
   IDAM market, shows that regulations and the frequency of malicious
   attacks are strongly correlated with increasing demand. While demand for
   identity and access management products has been exponentially
   increasing, innovation has only been moving at a moderate rate after
   declining near the end of the market bubble of 2000. The stock market's
   valuation of IDAM firms, while controlling for overall market
   conditions, has consequently been fairly static since 2001 and has
   followed similar trends in other segments of the IT industry. We
   therefore propose a two-pronged strategy involving: (i) standardization
   efforts on the engineering front; and (ii) additional regulations to
   stimulate innovation by IDAM firms.}},

Abstract = {{Digital fountain codes are becoming increasingly important for
   multimedia communications over networks subject to packet erasures.
   These codes have significantly lower complexity than Reed-Solomon ones,
   exhibit high erasure correction performance, and are very well suited to
   generating multiple equally important descriptions of a source. In this
   paper we propose an innovative scheme for streaming multimedia contents
   by using digital fountain codes applied over sliding windows, along with
   a suitably modified belief-propagation decoder. The use of overlapped
   windows allows one to have a virtually extended block, which yields
   superior performance in terms of packet recovery. Simulation results
   using LT codes show that the proposed algorithm has better performance
   in terms of efficiency, reliability and memory with respect to
   fixed-window encoding.}},

Abstract = {{With the explosive growth of internet technology, many innovative
   applications requiring exchange of large amounts of multimedia data have
   become feasible. However this kind of convenience with which authorized
   users can access information, turns out to be a mixed blessing because
   of information piracy. The emerging field of digital rights management
   (DRM) systems addresses the issues related to the intellectual property
   rights of digital content. In this paper, we present a novel invisible
   watermarking method that uses cryptography and watermarking methods
   simultaneously to provide a double layer protection to the digital media
   which can be an effective technique for DRM. Our proposed method
   securely hides binary information in color image media, and securely
   extracts and authenticates it using a secret key. Experimental results
   prove that our proposed invisible watermarking techniques is resilient
   to 90\% of the well known benchmark attacks and hence a fail-safe method
   for providing constant protection to the ownership rights.}},

   and increasing levels of industrial automation are making increasing
   demands for the development and implementation of new, innovative
   support systems for, inter alia, quality assurance and component
   identification purposes. Three-dimensional photography is often the
   preferred way of addressing this need. The system as described
   represents an experimental photographic system for the acquisition of
   three-dimensional images of components moving along a conveyor belt
   system as part of an automated material-handling system in a
   pseudo-industrial environment. The photographic system consists of only
   one digital camera and a scanning laser beam.
   Preliminary results indicate that fairly accurate images can be acquired
   using such a system, whilst good rendering can result from careful

Abstract = {{The paper presents a new way of multiplexing digital communication over
   cable networks. The system is innovative in three ways. Firstly, the way
   the multiple access scheme is achieved. Actually, most of current cable
   multiplexing systems use TDMA. Other well known techniques - especially
   in wireless domain - use FDMA, CDMA or SDMA. The proposed system uses
   the scattering properties of the cable network to separate the
   information streams coming from the different digital sources. We will
   refer to this technique as Scattering Division Multiple Access (ScDMA).
   Secondly, although the digital information goes from the transmitter to
   the receiver, the transmitter does not send any physical signal, but the
   receiver does. The receiver reads the transmitter's information by
   sending signals and analyzing the scattering parameters. The digital
   stream is encoded by letting transmitter impedance vary: for instance,
   11011 might be encoded with a high impedance and 11111 with a low
   impedance. Thirdly, the way the channel is approached is novel.
   Generally, in communications systems, a random channel is imposed, and
   the processing aims at canceling its effect in a trained or blind
   manner. Here, the channel is controlled and the principle is to
   artificially create a multi-path environment in a deterministic manner.
   The main advantages of the system are its instantaneous multiplexing
   ability (simultaneous sources separation and no request latency) and the
   low complexity of the transmitters. The system has been developed based
   on PLC channel model, but the principle is general and can be applied to
   any communication system over cable networks.}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence and widespread use of digital technology at all
   levels, security of systems and the networks that they connect to has
   taken on paramount importance. The past decade has seen widespread
   development, innovation, and growth within the DoD, government, and
   commercial communities of public key infrastructure (PKI) to meet these
   security needs. PKI is a robust technology, supporting numerous
   applications including user and computer authentication; secured
   communications, data encryption; and digital signature.
   Concurrent with the emergence of PKI has been the explosion of network
   security issues related to the problem of proper user authentication and
   the protection of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
   With the expansion of ethernet protocol-based networking into the
   wireless realm via the IEEE 802.11 standards family, the problems of
   network security and user authentication have finally come to a head. In
   a wireless local-area network (WLAN), protecting the network requires
   protecting not only the communications medium, but also the
   authentication medium.
   This paper examines the problems inherent in securing an IEEE 802.11
   WLAN, and discusses how PKI-based authentication of hosts and users can
   be used with the new WiFz protected access (WTA) and WPA-2 protocols to
   achieve a highly secure wireless network environment. It discusses
   issues, including digital certificate format, remote authentication
   dial-in user service (RADIUS) authentication, and client platform
   compatibility, that must be addressed as part of a successful
   implementation It examines how trends in the DoD PKI, including the
   current Common Access Card and emerging Personal Identification
   Verification H standard, will affect PKI-based wireless authentication
   in the near future.}},

   To demonstrate the crosstalk challenge and how to address it, a pogo pin

Abstract = {{XPAD3 is a single photon counting chip based on hybrid pixel counters,
   with low noise, high dynamics and high speed readout Its features have
   been improved to provide an high counting rate capability, a very low
   threshold, an energy discrimination and a fast image readout. The chip
   is designed in 0.25 gm IBM technology, and contains 9600 pixels (130 pm
   x 130 pm) distributed into 80 column of 120 elements each. An innovative
   architecture has been designed in order to prevent the digital circuits
   from disturbing the very sensitive analogue cells. XPAD3 was realized
   into two versions. The XPAD3-S version accepts positive input charges
   and offers an energy range from 4 keV to 40 keV with a single threshold.
   The XPAD3-C version accepts negative input charge and has an energy
   range from 6 keV to 60 keV with a windowed energy selection set by two
   independent thresholds. This last feature will be quite useful for
   experimentations where high contrast resolution is needed. The XPAD3
   circuits can be bump-bonded with Si CdTe or GaAs sensors to match
   detection efficiency with increasing photon energy. The aim of this
   development is to combine several XPAD3 circuits to build an 7.5 cm x 12
   cm sensitive area for the development of a small animal micro-CT
   scanner, PIXSCAN and synchrotron X-ray scattering experiments. First
   prototypes of single chip detectors bump-bonded with a Si sensor and
   double chip detectors bump-bonded with a CdTe sensor have been produced
   and tested and preliminary results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{For the development of digital signal processing systems for fast
   scintillation detectors we comprehensively study the modeling of nuclear
   signals, deconvolution of detector pulses and signal sampling.
   Applications for new scintillators with light decay times of a few
   nanoseconds demand suitable low power digital systems running at lowest
   possible sampling rates. We are interested in accurate sub-nanosecond
   timing and optimal energy resolution. The generalized non-bandlimiting
   sampling theorems allow filter structures with lower than Nyquist
   sampling rates for certain signals, where the classical sampling theorem
   fails. Recently it was shown that, by using a sampling rate greater or
   equal to the rate of innovation, it is possible to reconstruct certain
   restricted signals uniquely. The class of sampling kernels that can be
   used contains transfer functions with rational Fourier transforms. We
   introduce a physically realizable sampling scheme combined with a
   deconvolution timing filter algorithm for radiation detector signals.
   The novel architecture achieves sub-sampling rate timing accuracy
   together with optimal energy resolution and a high throughput for
   LaBr3:Ce scintillation detector system.}},

   to look at the light emitted by air shower by Cherenkov effect. It is
   operating since 2004 at the Roque de Los Muchachos observatory, La
   Palma, Canary islands. MAGIC-II is the upgrade of the project,
   consisting of a twin telescope frame with innovative features like new
   photon detectors to lower the threshold energy further and an ultrafast
   signal sampling to reduce the effect of the diffuse night sky
   background. The new acquisition system is based upon a low power analog
   sampler (Domino Ring Sampler) with frequency ranging from 1.5 to 4.5
   GHz. The data are digitized with a 12-bit resolution ADC. Data
   management is based on a digital board called PULSAR (PULSer And
   Recorder). Every board has 80 analog channels plus auxiliary digital
   signals for trigger and monitor purposes. The PULSAR board shows a good
   programming flexibility with the typical speed of a hardware device and
   an efficient modularity. The firmware controls the analog boards for the
   analog to digital conversion and it handles the data compression and
   reformatting. The data acquisition system design and the role of the
   PULSAR board is described in detail.}},

Abstract = {{A novel universal smart sensors interface and signal conditioner was
   proposed and described in this paper. The innovation integrated circuit
   UFDC-2 is based on four new patented measuring methods for
   frequency-time domain parameters of signals and solves problem for
   interfacing of any frequency-time domain sensors and transducers to PC
   or microcontroller with programmable high accuracy and resolution for
   frequency (time)-to-digital conversion, non-redundant conversion time,
   wide frequency range and constant quantization error. Combining silicon
   micromachining designs and processes with the advanced universal sensors
   and transducers the interfacing circuit overcomes many of early
   limitations for single-chip sensors design. By eliminating the need for
   ADC, the frequency (period, duty-cycle or PWM)-to-digital conversion
   schemes reduce the systems complexity. The applications of such approach
   and developed IC are high-performance integrated sensors with truly
   digital output (RS-232 interface), bus output (SPI or I(2)C) or IEEE
   1451 compatible sensors and transducers.}},

Abstract = {{Three novel integrated CMOS interfaces suited for magnetoresistive
   sensor bridges are described. The first ASIC is all-analog, being the
   simplest and cheapest one. The second ASIC is a mixed-mode solution
   providing a PWM output, and its main innovation is the use of a compact
   nonlinear ADC to compensate for the sensor nonlinearity. This way,
   linearization and A/D conversion are performed simultaneously, saving
   power and silicon area. The third ASIC is mostly digital and fully
   programmable, being the most flexible and accurate (albeit costly)
   solution. It incorporates as main novelties a new offset compensation
   technique that shares most of required circuits with the
   successive-approximation ADC, and a new combinational circuit for sensor
   linearization. Measurement results for the three sensor interfaces are
   provided, and their performance tradeoffs discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The design and implementation of a M-band linear phase digital audio
   equalizer system is presented. Beginning from analysis/synthesis
   filterbank, an innovative uniform and non uniform bands audio equalizer
   is derived using multirate properties. In literature fixed frequency
   response equalization has well-known problems due to algorithms
   implementation.
   The idea of this work derives from different techniques employed in
   filter banks to avoid aliasing in the case of adaptive filtering in each
   band. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown comparing it with a
   simple filterbank and with an octave band equalizer based on frequency
   domain technique. The solution presented here has several advantages in
   terms of linear phase and uniform frequency response avoiding ripple
   between adjacent bands.}},

Abstract = {{India has a rich foundation of clusters, and initiatives to boost the
   various functional areas of a cluster by pinpointing the anomalies that
   cloud them can lead to their dynamism. The digital ecosystem (DE) is one
   approach through which diffusion and use of ICT can be made self
   sustaining and self enabling for clusters, specifically clusters that
   thrive on value addition through embodying their product with skill and
   craftsmanship. This paper reports initial empirical findings from a
   collaborative project called the `Digital Mandi'. The digital ecosystem
   entails a series of interconnected and intra-dependant digital
   platforms, created at key institutional levels (international, national
   and local/Community) augmented by technical (ICT) and social networking
   processes that help break down barriers to both horizontal and vertical
   knowledge sharing. The empirical findings show that the `ecosystem'
   approach speeds up the process of identification, development and uptake
   of innovation. We conclude that similar DBEs can be effective for skill
   based SME clusters facing similar challenges of competitiveness in a
   rapidly globalizing knowledge driven economy.}},

   A digital watermark is used to insert an imperceptible signal into data
   which may be in the form of images, audio or video. This has
   applications in a variety of purposes like copyright control,
   authenticity, captioning etc. As the watermarks are subjected to wide

Abstract = {{Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) gain their strengths from flexible
   market orientation, agile value chains and cluster-based innovation
   capacity. The changing global business environment challenges
   organizations to aim for agility and performance driven management
   through process focused thinking. For the future collaboration of SMEs
   with their partners, the agility aim of the Digital Ecosystem paradigm
   demands for an explicit risk management and collaboration support. This
   involves an explicit management of the business process by combining
   continuous process improvement and process reengineering. However, the
   outcome of process management effort is risky because of the lack of
   operational information about the future process. The paper analyzes the
   possible contribution of risk management to support the management of
   business processes in order to increase the maturity of organizations.
   The concept is applied in a process simulation example for furniture
   production. Collaboration support is provided to allow the real-time
   sharing and interaction of the parties involved, e.g. in case of
   deviations from the agreed upon target process.}},

Abstract = {{Securing computer systems is perhaps one of the key responsibilities of
   modern software architects, as well as hardware designers. The research
   on security issues is getting more important, as the number of embedded
   and networked computing systems is increasing constantly. Due to strict
   restrictions and requirements, only special software applications are
   used in security-critical embedded systems. Consequently, it is
   necessary to secure those software applications passively by the use of
   a secure processor architecture.
   In this paper, we discuss a hardware implementation of a secure
   processor architecture, as well as adaptations of an existing SPARC V8
   processor for the embedded usage in safeguard ecosystems. The main
   advantage of our concept is the compatibility to new and legacy software
   applications and hardware architectures. When compared to existing
   software and hardware solutions, our implementation will result in a
   noticeable increase in security of embedded computer systems.
   National and international support programmes, like the European Union
   framework program IST-FP6, are globally interested in embedded systems
   security. Moreover, our project is funded by the Austrian Ministry for
   Technology and Innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Ranking the world's top E-Government Readiness in 2002, 2004, and 2005,
   Taiwan's experience in promoting e-government could provide worldwide
   governors a practical knowledge for planning and implementation.
   Further, given the e-government services, e.g. tax e-filing system
   (TEFS) can be seen as an innovation for taxpayers to adopt, Taiwan's
   experience has also become a sensible example in innovation marketing.
   This study used three diffusion models, i.e. external, internal, and
   mixed influence models, to reveal whether the diffusion of TEFS in
   Taiwan was affected by mass media advertising, interactions among
   acquaintances, or a combination of both. Findings indicated that the
   mixed influence model is the best fit, but acquaintance's influence is
   the dominant factor. The authors therefore argue that governors should
   consider ``Source-Strategy Fit{''}, i.e. it is essential to understand
   TEFS' features and its influential sources when promoting the G2C
   e-government services. Only when the adequate marketing strategies are
   developed, the huge investments in building e government infrastructure
   can bring about citizens' convenient digital life and government
   efficiency to the full.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge service is an innovational service which amalgamates the
   concept of services innovation and knowledge innovation. Digital library
   is the national knowledge infrastructure which provides various kinds of
   knowledge services for promoting knowledge innovation. In order to
   effectively organize the complex information resources in the digital
   library and make them understood and processed by machine automatically,
   more semantic descriptions are needed. Ontology has become a promising
   technology to express semantics. Ontology concepts and technologies are
   taken into consideration in this paper, and two domain ontologies are
   built on the base of our investigation. And then this paper proposes an
   ontology-based framework for knowledge service in digital library and
   analyses its service process. Using this framework, more efficient
   knowledge services can be provided by a digital library for satisfying
   the customers' individual requirement about knowledge.}},

   onto large silicon wafers to enhance integrated circuits performance,
   provide more functions and reduce power dissipation. For instance, III-V
   compound semiconductors and their integration onto silicon are currently
   in research for future high-speed and ultra-low-power digital CMOS
   applications. Emerging nano-materials and nanotechnologies such as
   nanotubes, nanowires and nanoribbons, as well as new areas such as
   non-charge based devices and spintronics, are being explored for future
   computation and data storage applications. Furthermore, some of these
   nanodevices are finding potential applications in other important areas
   such as health and the environment, energy conversion and storage,
   consumer electronics, communication devices, sensors and so on. The
   research progress of these emerging nanotechnologies and nanoelectronic
   devices, and the challenges and opportunities of combining top-down and
   bottom-up nanoelectronics, will be discussed in this presentation.}},

Abstract = {{The main bottleneck in broadband reconfigurable (or software-defined)
   radio systems is the fast analog-to-digital converters (ADC) required to
   capture the entire system band. Such ADCs are typically costly, consume
   a lot of power, and have non-ideal transfer characteristics, as well as
   a limited spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). This cost problem is
   compounded in multi-antenna and MIMO (multiple input, multiple output)
   systems where the entire RF chain, including the ADC, must be replicated
   for every receiving antenna. This paper presents an architecture where
   each ADC in a MIMO transceiver is replaced by several slower and less
   expensive ADCs, effectively partitioning the sampling problem.
   Furthermore, the combining of the subsampled information streams is done
   in a dynamically adaptive fashion, in conjonction with the standard
   space-time processing performed in MIMO systems. Among the many
   potential advantages of this arrangement, the ability to track and
   compensate for sample clock jitter is emphasized in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The SmartBay, Ireland, concept arose from contacts with representatives
   of other observatories and from ongoing strategic collaboration between
   Ireland and Newfoundland. It has been conceived as a catalytic
   infrastructure project to provide a Test and Demonstration platform for
   emerging technologies for marine monitoring. The backbone of this
   platform will be a fibre optic and power cable network linking seabed
   observation stations for real-time oceanographic, marine monitoring and
   other instruments. SmartBay features as a key initiative in SeaChange,
   the Irish Marine Research Programme, 2007-2013, and has been adopted as
   a specific measure in the Government's Strategy for Science, Technology
   and Innovation.
   SmartBay is intended to meet two distinct but complementary objectives:
   1. Provide a high-capability platform for test and demonstration of
   novel sensors and sensor networks, including those emerging from ongoing
   research projects. In this respect SmartBay is a key component of the
   strategy to develop and support an enhanced industry capability in the
   design and manufacture of innovative instrumentation technologies.
   2. To demonstrate the benefits that real-time observation networks can
   provide to a wide range of end-users. In this context, the intention is
   that it will be possible for SmartBay to monitor natural events such as
   storms, plankton blooms, fish behaviour, etc. as well as shipping and
   other vessel movements. The medium term goal is to provide a predictive
   and early warning capacity for Bay users.
   It is envisaged that the system will he interactive and that scientists
   will communicate with the instruments as events unfold. SmartBay will
   inform and enhance a range of activities of strategic significance to a
   wide variety of agencies and stakeholders in marine sector industries.
   These include:
   Utilisation of seabed survey technologies and the digital environmental
   datasets generated, particularly the Irish National Seabed Survey
   Provision of a test platform for instrument packages before their
   operational deployment.
   Monitoring requirements associated with legislative and management
   activities (eg. European Union Water Framework Directive and Habitats
   Directive, Climate Change Monitoring and Coastal Zone Management)
   Marine tourism and leisure development through, for example, monitoring
   of local sea state, water quality and fish and cetacean behaviour in
   real time
   Fish stock management through observation of spawning, feeding and
   larval behaviour
   Improved coastal modelling for temperature, salinity and hydrographic
   conditions
   Support for the development of excellence in research areas such as
   oceanographic modelling, climate change etc.
   Galway Bay, because of its unique combination of environmental,
   industrial and social features, has been selected as the location for
   SmartBay. The Marine Institute itself is headquartered on the shores of
   Galway Bay and will facilitate logistical and scientific support for the
   installation and ongoing operation of SmartBay.
   SmartBay is currently at the design and planning stage. It is intended
   initiate the permitting process before the end of 2007 and to commence
   instalment of the fibre optic and power cable during the summer of 2009.
   The SmartBay website will commence later in 2007 and will feature real
   time data from a variety of oceanographic and weather buoys already
   located in or near Galway Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling is commonly retained as a critical step in any mixed-signal
   system. High-speed analog-to-digital converter sampling jitter limits
   all-over performance of these systems introducing a signal dependent
   noise in the sampled signal. In most environments it is desirable to
   reduce sampling clock jitter, however there are cases where designers
   are forced to introduce or cope with this undesirable noise effect.
   This work describes an innovative algorithm based on multi-resolution
   analysis (MRA) which allows for the recovery of the original unjittered
   sampled signal in environments where clock jitter is unavoidable. We
   make use of a new versatile signal model and an MSE estimation in the
   Wavelet domain which lead to an adaptive Wavelet resealing technique
   centered around a fully precalculable resealing matrix.
   This technique has been successfully applied to other fields, like
   extracellular recording (ER) signal denoising, since it can be shown
   this problem can be reformulated into a signal dejittering problem.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a checklist for evaluating personal digital
   assistants (PDAs) as performance support to medical professionals. The
   checklist facilitates the communication between designers and innovators
   throughout the development of the artefact, helping to keep focus on the
   project goal, and to invoke new ideas and new facilities. It is
   developed as part of the MINI-project (2006-2007), a PDA design project,
   employing user-driven innovation in development of a prototype of a
   performance support m-learning application for physicians in clinical
   bedside training (residents) at an emergency medical ward. The
   prototype, dubbed `e-pocket', is supposed to replace and expand the
   support which inexperienced but professional physicians normally get
   from carrying books, paper slips and personal notes in their pockets,
   when on duty. The checklist addresses the key issue in developing
   professional competence: how to integrate formal rules of procedural and
   declarative knowledge with personal experience of problem-based
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the relationship between remediation and
   educational innovation in ICT intensive learning environments,
   exemplified through the language laboratory and its digital descendants.
   The language laboratory has historically been affected by a number of
   technological and instructional changes, transforming the dead-end of
   behavioural methodology into the current socio-collaborative paradigms
   of language learning. The language laboratory is thus a learning
   environment that incorporates and refers to several generations of
   technology based language learning. The theoretical focus of the paper
   is on CALL (computer-assisted language learning) and on the issues of
   repurposing and remediation raised by Bolter and Grusin (1999).
   Remediation can be defined as a process of transformation whereby older
   media are represented and refashioned in new media contexts. We shall
   argue that there exists a dialogical relationship between the processes
   of remediation inherent in the genealogy of the language laboratory and
   the processes of educational innovation. In addition to this, the paper
   will suggest ways of rethinking and reforming the language laboratory
   through m-learning and p-learning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the approach the Faculty of Dentistry at the
   University of Toronto took to modernize its antiquated methods of
   instruction with the help of online technologies. Canada's largest and
   oldest dental school had done little to engage any online medium to
   deliver course content before the Fall 2006 semester. While many other
   departments around the university had been using a number of proprietary
   and commercially licensed applications for online course presence, the
   Faculty was obliviously entrenched in the traditional face-to-face mode
   of instruction it had used since its inception. How then, could the
   faculty be steered towards adopting new technologies in their teaching?
   As part of an initial pilot-project, a small but prolific team of
   faculty, students and content developers was assembled to work with
   individual faculty members to brainstorm and research ideas for
   innovative teaching practices in dental studies. The team was not
   contented to merely post digital versions of the ubiquitous Power Point
   lectures in Blackboard (R), the LMS selected in 2006 by the University
   of Toronto as its sole platform for online course delivery, but set out
   to introduce interactivity with the course material. Consequently, they
   created a series of interactive applications such as the virtual
   microscope in Oral Pathology, the 3D cavity preparations in Restorative
   Dentistry, the master media repository and used Blackboard as a hosting
   environment to integrate them with other course components. In a matter
   of 10 weeks in the summer of 2006, the Faculty moved from a laggard unit
   to one of the university's front-runners in online course innovation.
   The result of this collaboration between faculty members and the team
   was 10 courses with interactive online presence, representing
   approximately 25\% of the Faculty's undergraduate curriculum. Since
   then, the Faculty has moved closer to achieving its goal of providing
   meaningful online instruction in all courses.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced packaging technologies are driven by two generally balanced
   forces: performance advances being made by the semiconductor industry
   and the product requirements of the leading electronics markets. The
   semiconductor advancements include shrinking feature sizes and
   innovative transistor structures that provide ever more functionality
   per unit area of silicon and faster clock rates. One of the leading
   electronics markets is the portable electronics market, covering cell
   phones, digital assistants, portable entertainment and digital cameras.
   These products are driving smaller and thinner packages, finer featured
   substrates, multichip packages.. such as SiPs (System-in-Packages) and
   3-D stacking. They are also driving to mixed analog, digital, and RF
   circuitry within one package with increasing concerns with interconnect
   parasitics, EMI shielding and thermal performance.
   A new family of embedded chip packaging and interconnection approaches
   are being developed to address the next generation portable electronics
   circuits. These embedded chip approaches feature embedded actives and
   passives, micro-vias, thin film polymer dielectrics and fine line
   build-up interconnections. This paper will look at a number of embedded
   chip approaches including the GE Embedded Chip Build-Up technology and
   analyze the electrical, density, reliability and cost advantages of this
   approach and show examples of its use in chip scale, chip carrier, and
   SiP applications for portable electronics applications.}},

   Prof. Nian-Shing Chen. It has already opened teachers' training courses
   for 10 semesters, and its excellent achievement has obtained an honor of
   wining the third place for the competition held by the Executive Yuan in
   Taiwan in 2002. It certainly exhibited its excellent model in
   implementation and operation. Therefore, exploring the critical success
   factors of K12-DS will be able to advance its strength to the digital
   school operators, and to helping them to operate the digital school
   continuously, and extend to the other cities and counties around Taiwan.
   All the teachers from the elementary and secondary schools will be able
   to have a more innovated and convenient digital learning environment.}},

Abstract = {{The use of staring infrared imaging systems provides significant
   advantages for military missions such as single sensor day/night
   persistent tactical surveillance of all moving vehicles in a large urban
   battlefield. Monitoring of very wide instantaneous field-of-regard with
   the capability to allocate parts or all of the video-channel bandwidth
   for high-resolution imaging of a narrow field of view allows identifying
   and tracking targets from long standoff distances. This capability has
   been successfully demonstrated in the Agile, Detecting and
   Discriminating, Infrared Electro-Optical System (ADDIOS) developed by
   Applied Science Innovations, Inc. in collaboration with the Air Force
   Research Laboratory (AFRL). The system features electronically
   switchable resolution achieved with digital processing gain, which
   replaced optical or opto-mechanical gain typical of conventional
   cameras. The output of the system has an order of magnitude higher
   resolution compared to pixel-limited resolution of the imaging sensor
   alone. This capability, demonstrated in the working ADDIOS prototype, is
   universally applicable for boosting resolution of ``pixel-hungry{''}
   imagers where available pixel counts fall short of desired, e.g., due to
   technology limitations of high costs. The ADDIOS modular design makes
   the flexible-resolution imaging core equally applicable to cameras with
   conventional lenses, coded aperture systems, and potentially other
   technologies such as holography and optical metrology. The system
   features millisecond switching speed and low power consumption, combined
   with reasonable cost, small mass, and compact form factor applicable to
   retrofitting existing imaging systems. With the experimental prototype
   already demonstrated in the visible and near-infrared, the spectral
   range can be expanded into mid-wave and potentially long-wave infrared
   ranges. The paper summarizes the results of the ADDIOS technology
   development and addresses their application to DARPA's Large Area
   Coverage Optical Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) program,
   including coded aperture imaging.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an autonomous music composition tool is developed using
   Genetic Algorithms. The production is enhanced by integrating simple
   formal grammar rules. A formal grammar is a collection of either or both
   descriptive or prescriptive rules for analyzing or generating sequences
   of symbols. In music, these symbols are musical parameters such as notes
   and their attributes. The composition is conducted in two Stages. The
   first Stage generates and identifies musically sound patterns (motifs).
   In the second Stage, methods to combine different generated motifs and
   their transpositions are applied. These combinations are evaluated and
   as a result, musically fit phrases are generated. Four musical phrases
   are generated at the end of each program run. The generated music pieces
   will be translated into Guido Music Notation (GMN) and have alternate
   representation in Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI). The
   Autonomous Evolutionary Music Composer (AEMC) was able to create
   interesting pieces of music that were both innovative and musically
   sound.}},

Abstract = {{Printed functionality means adding new functionalities into flexible
   substrate, typically paper and plastic, in addition to regular graphical
   properties by using printing methods. Functionality can be on the
   surface of the substrate or within it, or both. Printed functionality
   can be codes containing links to additional information. Such codes
   include one- and two-dimensional bar codes as well as invisible,
   reactive and electronic codes. Furthermore, printed functionality can be
   visual effects and images, multi-layer structures, printed electronics,
   optics and displays as well as printed sensors and indicators. Hybrid
   media is closely related to printed functionality. Hybrid media is
   defined as the integration of different media, contents and
   functionalities - especially convergence between fiber-based printed
   products and digital media.
   In this study new applications of printed functionality have been
   innovated and tested. Finally, new business models have been developed
   for these applications.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative system of digital transmission for long range applications
   in the HF band (3-30 MHz) is presented. The technical challenge is to
   increase significantly the data transfer rate when compared with
   standard modems (typically 4.8 kbits/s in a 3 kHz bandwidth). For this
   purpose, an original array of collocated receiving antennas is developed
   as support for the implementation of a blind spatio temporal
   equalization. Consequently, the effective bandwidth is extended up to 12
   kHz. An experimental 780 km range radio link is tested with a data
   transfer rate attaining 40kbits/s and a BER (bit error rate) remaining
   moderate. Still images are transmitted with a specific source-channel
   coding and the good quality of service is confirmed by the fidelity of
   the restored images. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, market environments can be expressed in terms of increased
   competition, the diverse demands of customers, and the rapid innovation
   of IT technologies and so forth. These environmental changes have left
   companies facing a highly competitive market, and company revenues are
   gradually decreasing. Virtual enterprise is considered as the one of the
   alternatives available to facilitate adjustment to the new digital
   economy and save companies from falling into a red ocean. The contents
   of this research include the definition of virtual enterprise, and the
   characteristics and technologies for embodying it in a company. The
   paper suggests a new flow model for a decision support system in a
   virtual enterprise set-up, assesses critical success factors and weights
   as per the factors from case studies. From the previous analysis, paper
   defines the needs of collaborative activities in virtual enterprise and
   suggests the ubiquitous virtual enterprise reference model.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to analyze current strategies and roles of
   the shared service which is in progress, introduced by Ministry of
   information and communication in Korea and to examine distinctions of
   the shared service compare to existing IT relating SME programs.
   Throughout rapid enlargement of ICT network, our day-to-day business
   environments tend to transform into a digitalized and ubiquitous
   business environment. Thereof information technologies are taking great
   roles by establishing high degrees of industrial structures as well as
   assigning motivations for driving economic growth contributing national
   competitiveness. Thus, global market competitions based on the
   borderless economy today, is becoming one of the important matter within
   every country in order to strengthen domestic industries by supporting
   IT related SMEs to encourage R\&D. This study was conducted based on
   literature reviews and interviewed agencies who are servicing the shared
   service and IT SMES.}},

Abstract = {{Telephone surveys are critical for examining cross-sectional
   characteristics of population subgroups, tracking trends in prevalence
   of conditions and risk behaviors over time, identifying risk factors
   associated with multiple health conditions, and assessing the effects of
   interventions. Technology has aided telephone research through advances
   such as computer-assisted telephone interviewing. However, technology
   such as answering machines and caller ID has,contributed to declines in
   response rates and has increased costs of conducting telephone surveys.
   The exponential increase in cell phone utilization presents a challenge
   to the tradition of random digit dial (RDD) surveys of households.
   Because telephone surveys are used by other industries such as marketing
   and public opinion polling, the marketplace may help drive innovation
   and adaptation. Cell phones have made telephone communication an even
   greater part of the everyday culture and could make potential telephone
   survey respondents even more accessible to public health researchers.}},

Abstract = {{A novel digital controller is presented in this paper that significantly
   improves the dynamic response of a voltage regulator module (VRM). The
   controller uses a digital linear scheme during steady-state operation
   and an innovative nonlinear scheme during transient load conditions. The
   proposed nonlinear controller accurately calculates the optimal response
   to an arbitrary load step variation. This paper demonstrates the design
   procedure of a VRM using the proposed controller. Since the response to
   the load variation is predictable, an engineer is able to design
   (without iteration) a VRM that is guaranteed to meet a set of dynamic
   response criteria (voltage deviation, recovery time).}},

Abstract = {{The design and attractive outfit of products and tools very often are
   cues which encourage somebody to buy them. Yet, the first impression and
   the succeeding working experience sometimes diverge considerably.
   Furthermore, stereotypical behavior and traditional habits as well as
   the lack of numbers and figures indicating the ergonomic quality and the
   utility values of a product or working tool are obstacles to the
   introduction of actually innovative items. The same is true for the
   handle of a mason's trowel, which has been developed some years ago but
   has not achieved general acceptance in bricklaying. Therefore, the
   objective of this study was to evaluate the ergonomically designed
   handle of a mason's trowel in comparison with two standard types, both
   with a round cross-section of the handle and either a straight neck or a
   swan's neck. All the tools were equipped with the same blade.
   Job-specific dynamic and static working elements were performed by 10
   subjects in a laboratory. Under well-controlled conditions,
   physiological cost associated with mixing and throwing of mortar onto a
   vertical wall, translatory carrying and depositing of sand on a
   horizontal wall, rotatory scooping movements (supination and pronation
   of the forearm) with and without an external load of the trowel, and
   static holding of the tool in different working postures were measured.
   Electromyographic activity (EA) of the biceps brachii, pronator teres,
   flexor digitorum, and extensor carpi ulnaris was registered continuously
   and summed up during all of the test sessions lasting 30 or 45 s, each.
   All data were standardized by means of maximum EA resulting from
   preceding job-specific maximum voluntary contractions. Before and after
   the working sessions, which lasted about 4 h for each subject, the
   ergonomic quality of the handles had to be rated by means of a
   questionnaire with 9 items on a bipolar 4-step scale. In accordance with
   the hypothesis that the ergonomically designed handle should enable a
   specific relief of the strain in the grip musculature and the ulnar
   deviation muscles, significantly lower EA values were measured with this
   model during most of the test phases. But the effect was much less in
   scale than was expected from the subjective assessment before the tests.
   Also, subjective rating data after the working sessions differed clearly
   between the three handles mostly corresponding with the pretest
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{The next big improvements in scientific capability in radio astronomy
   are expected to come from large increases in sensitivity and field of
   view, leading to telescopes that are ideally suited to surveying the
   radio sky. For the last fifteen years radio astronomers around the world
   have been competing and collaborating to come up with designs for a
   Square Kilometer Array (SKA), which will be roughly fifty times more
   sensitive than the Very Large Array and three orders of magnitude faster
   at surveying. The challenge of building such a telescope at a relatively
   affordable cost (1 Billion Euros) has led to a number of innovative
   designs. The common element of the leading designs is an increasing
   reliance on digital technology for beam forming. In this paper, I review
   the two main areas of innovation, aperture arrays and phased array
   feeds, and describe how these solve some problems but raise others,
   particularly for calibration and imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The use of innovative information technology is now well
   established in health. However, while the gap in health status between
   Indigenous and other Australians is both significant and unchanging,
   there is limited application of these new approaches to addressing this
   national health priority. This may in part reflect the `digital
   divide{''} which is another facet of Indigenous disadvantage. This paper
   describes an approach to address both issues in remote Indigenous
   settings.
   Results: The Health Interactive Technology Network began as a
   proof-of-concept study of touchscreen technology in two Indigenous
   health settings. It has subsequently expanded to a number of remote
   Indigenous communities and developed new platforms and applications to
   respond to emerging health issues. In creating narrative, interactive
   approaches to address choices in relation to health behaviours, the
   community development and engagement effects of the creative process
   have been highlighted. These findings suggest that these approaches will
   be suited to further expansion in the area of mental health.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technology is still in its infancy, not yet confined to a
   prescribed role in society, and it has therefore become an important new
   medium for innovative feminist artists. This essay looks at new
   technologies of distribution and storage, in particular the CD-ROM, and
   examines how these technologies can shape the `older' medium of film and
   its accompanying institutional systems. The CD-ROM Bilder der
   Beruhrungen (Images of Touch, 1997) by the Austrian feminist avant-garde
   artist Valie Export constitutes an early but thought-provoking
   experiment with digital storage. Instead of regarding her media art from
   the 60s, 70s and 80s as texts firmly grounded in the analog era, Export
   repackages and recontextualizes her film Syntagma (1983) and other
   artworks and displays them in the new digital environment. In an attempt
   to further her specific feminist ideological goals Export creatively
   transcends formal `borders' and, through her art, ventures into a
   virtual terra incognita.}},

   (DRM) to ensure that the software tools used in the client side are

   reverfication and recertification mechanisms are described, discussing
   the advantages as well as the drawbacks of using such techniques. A
   complex use case is presented to complement the description of the
   proposed mechanisms. The presented architecture and mechanisms are being
   implemented in the AXMEDIS project, which aims to create an innovative
   technology framework for the automatic production, protection and
   distribution of digital cross media contents over a range of different

Abstract = {{In order to solve the navigation problem of a mobile robot in an
   unstructured environment a versatile sensory system and efficient
   locomotion control algorithms are necessary. In this paper an innovative
   sensory system for action-oriented perception applied to a legged robot
   is presented. An important problem we address is how to utilize a large
   variety and number of sensors, while having systems that can operate in
   real time. Our solution is to use sensory systems that incorporate
   analog and parallel processing, inspired by biological systems, to
   reduce the required data exchange with the motor control layer. In
   particular, as concerns the visual system, we use the Eye-RIS v1.1 board
   made by Anafocus, which is based on a fully-parallel mixed-signal array
   sensor-processor chip. The hearing sensor is inspired by the cricket
   hearing system and allows efficient localization of a specific sound
   source with a very simple analog circuit. Our robot utilizes additional
   sensors for touch, posture, load, distance, and heading, and thus
   requires customized and parallel processing for concurrent acquisition.
   Therefore a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based hardware was used
   to manage the multi-sensory acquisition and processing. This choice was
   made because FPGAs permit the implementation of customized digital logic
   blocks that can operate in parallel allowing the sensors to be driven
   simultaneously. With this approach the multi-sensory architecture
   proposed can achieve real time capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique was developed to measure the tendon load in people and
   in horses in motion. This non-invasive technique is based on a relation,
   demonstrated experimentally in vitro on isolated tendons and limbs,
   between the velocity of ultrasound in the tendon and the load to which
   it is subjected. A prototype was created to examine the equine
   superficial digital flexor tendon. The reproducibility of these
   measurements assessed in five horses was very good in a given subject,
   but marked differences were observed between the animals, in terms of
   plot shape and ultrasound velocity. These differences appeared directly
   related to the horse's digital standing conformation. The technique thus
   validated was then used to examine the effect of four types of
   orthopaedic shoes compared to a standard shoe, on hard as well as soft
   ground.}},

Abstract = {{The e4d design series is looking for new aspects of digital technology
   in the education of Digital Architecture approaches overcoming the gap
   between the development of architectural and the necessary digital
   skills. Digital Design approaches using the full variety of multimedia
   technology, the parallelism and crossover of analogue and digital
   techniques, 3d-modelling, rapid-prototyping and visualization tools and
   finally the presentation in artistic movies or websites are
   characteristic for the e4d design method. This method was refined during
   several design projects within the last two years. A problem based
   design method was developed, that enabled students to learn digital and
   architectural skills simultaneously in an efficient manner.
   The educational concept of the design approach consisted generally of
   four steps, which are independent fro each other in an educational
   sense, but determined in questions of the ongoing design process. The
   first step consists of an abstract or subjective research phase for the
   students which gave all participants an atmospheric and/or conceptual
   idea of the project. Within the following phase, called
   ``Transformation{''}, parts of the findings are transferred into spatial
   or dynamic structures. Later on the detected atmospheric and
   organizational qualities are used to develop a given building program
   towards a specific solution. In the last step the different traces are
   interconnected, when site specific parameters are blended with the found
   design traces.
   The implementations of digital and analogue mock-ups, as well as the
   evaluation in Virtual Reality environments and the creation of scenic
   animations were crucial for the projects aim to teach the students a new
   way of design with the help of digital techniques. The precise use of
   different kinds of media for the projects visualization, text and image
   oriented design approaches, as well as the way the architectural
   projects could be discussed have been examined.
   We like to share our insights concerning a competent monitoring of the
   digital architectural process, looking for innovative and efficient
   design strategies and wish to discuss the projects outcomes in
   architectural as well as pedagogical aspect.}},

Abstract = {{In 1997, IBM coined the term `e-business' to refer to the increased
   utilization of information and communication technology (ICT) in
   business processes. In 2001, the European Union launched its ambitious
   eEurope program, aimed at pushing Europe at the global forefront in
   e-business uptake, among other things. Ever since, e-business policy has
   been at central focus on regional, national, and European level. The aim
   of this paper is to explore the evolution of regional e-business policy
   in Europe. Its objective is to construct a proposition for a framework
   or typology of e-business policy practices that can function as the
   basis for policy framing and development. The research strategy that
   underpins its findings is based on a critical review of contemporary
   literature, empirical observations and notes from workshops and

Abstract = {{Ciba Specialty Chemicals creates effects to improve the quality of life.
   Building on its technical competencies, the company has developed major
   innovative product groups that provide color, performance and
   protection. Antioxidants and light stabilizers protect plastics,
   coatings, photographic pictures and wood from degradation induced by
   sunlight, air, ozone, heat, fire and mechanical stress. UV absorbers
   protect human skin from sunburn and photo-induced ageing. Pigments and
   dyes add beautiful colors to objects of everyday life, serve as
   recording media for optical information storage on digital versatile
   discs (DVDs) and are used as color filters in liquid crystal displays
   (LCDs). Effect pigments allow creation of color and visual effects by
   interference. Polymeric flocculants are essential components for
   solid-liquid separation processes in wastewater treatment and paper
   production. Photolatent catalysts are key components for light-induced
   polymerization reactions. New sterically hindered N-alkoxyamines are
   initiators for nitroxide mediated radical polymerization (NMP) reactions
   leading to new pigment dispersants with well-defined molecular weights
   and narrow molecular weight distribution. New N-acyloxyamines are
   proposed as peroxide substitutes for controlled degradation of high
   molecular weight polypropylene. A new clarifier can be used to produce
   polypropylene with enhanced transparency and excellent mechanical
   properties. Progress in enabling sciences such as nanotechnology and
   biotechnology together with new technologies entering the markets will
   offer outstanding opportunities for new developments in specialty
   chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{Factories of the future must be capable to adapt themselves to
   continuously changing market demand. Therefore new manufacturing
   technologies are needed: from agile operating machines up to internet
   based services. In particular, new advanced automation solutions, that
   integrate all factory levels in a unique real time framework, are
   mandatory. Nowadays, neither accepted standards nor assessed development
   methodologies and software environments are available to support
   industries when facing such a crucial issue. In the present contribution
   an open and modular automation system architecture is proposed, based on
   emerging modelling paradigms and recent international standards.
   Furthermore, a methodology to develop self-adaptive factory automation
   solutions is illustrated, using a novel modular simulation based method
   to verify digitally - through a modular bottom up approach - the
   correctness of real size automation systems. The proposed framework has
   been applied to a highly innovative reconfigurable factory for
   personalised shoes production. Such a real-size industrial application
   proves the effectiveness and the benefits of the presented methods for
   the development of complex automation solutions for high value added
   production systems.}},

Abstract = {{Many new proposals are continually published in the halftoning domain.
   Alas, the demonstration of the interest of the proposed methods is often
   limited to a few favourable tests for the proposed methods, and images
   showing the defects of the other halftoning methods.
   The halftoning community needs to be able to compare a halftoning method
   with the innovations that appear in this domain. A complete and measured
   evaluation of quality is necessary through to a well defined set of test
   images and metrics to evaluate the algorithm.
   This paper proposes a protocol for the quality assessment of digital
   halftoning algorithm that can be used to compare one algorithm to
   another.
   It discusses the assessment of halftoner quality. It analyzes the
   perceived image quality concepts and defines the technical criteria that
   a good halftoner must match. A first sketch of a simple quality
   assessment protocol is proposed. It is composed of test images and
   quality metrics.
   This protocol could be used to provide new proposed halftoning
   algorithms with objective results.}},

Abstract = {{New communications technologies offer extraordinary opportunities to
   individuals, businesses, and government to efficiently collect, compile,
   and disclose personal information, as well as identify, track, target,
   and reach people. These capabilities arguably serve to promote economic
   efficiency and productivity, national security, innovation and progress,
   as well as an open society. Yet these new technologies also carry the
   potential for unfettered use and abuse, presenting substantial privacy
   concerns. Increasingly common are disruptions or intrusions from
   cell-phone marketing messages, online instant messages, and ad Internet
   pop-UPS.
   Computer users are being confronted by such threats as employee e-mail
   monitoring, hacking and spying from computer key-loggers and spyware,
   and ``phishing{''} for personal information by identity thieves.
   Government surveillance has also been stepped up, from citywide spycams
   and global positioning systems (GPS), to catch speeders and car thieves,
   to FBI searches of library, telephone, Internet, and cable TV subscriber
   records to investigate terrorism and other criminal activity. Personal
   consumer data are also being mined and shared by businesses, with
   advertisers and marketers taking advantage of such data-collection
   techniques as cookies, online agreement forms, and the use of
   radiofrequency identification (RFID) on products purchased.
   How have new technologies and social change affected privacy perceptions
   today? What are the implications of privacy and social change?
   Multidimensional theories have been proposed to comprehend the concept
   of privacy from different disciplines, including communication,
   psychology, and law. A number of empirical studies have also been
   conducted to understand the multidimensional nature of privacy. As the
   following examination reveals, the concept of privacy is not simple,
   although its impacts can be far-reaching.}},

Abstract = {{This volume adopted a unique approach, one that addresses various social
   settings-namely, home, workplace, surveillance, entertainment, consumer,
   and legal settings-to examine the relations between technology and
   social change. By presenting scholarly explications in a range of
   theoretical and empirical venues, we thus integrated these perspectives
   using conceptual themes in socially relevant contexts-rather than
   technology modalities-as the unit of analysis. Drawing from our various
   contributions, it is clear that the influence of these mediated
   communication technologies has been evolutionary. Newton's Third Law
   states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
   Based on this ``dual effects{''} conception, it would appear that for
   all of the benefits accruing from a new technology, there are likely to
   be countervailing negative effects. Naturally, not all predictions
   concerning the social consequences of mediated communication technology
   adoption have come to pass. Orwell's (1949) dystopian prophecies
   involving digital ``Big Brother{''} governments-where average citizens
   endure a fish bowl existence in the eye of government
   surveillance-provides a case in point. Instead, the rise of telematic
   ``technologies of freedom{''} (Poole, 1983) has actually helped
   undermine totalitarianism in some instances and encourage a freer flow
   of information across borders.
   At the global level, spurred by the deregulation of state-supported
   media monopolies and protectionist policies (Anowkwa, Lin, \& Salwen,
   2003), many nations now are opening up their media systems to
   competition, hoping to hasten cross-media competition and convergence
   (see e.g., Noam, Groebel, \& Gerbarg, 2004; Pelton, 2003; Straubhaar,
   Burch, Guilherne Duarte, \& Sheffer, 2002). As a result, Ogan (chap. 2,
   this volume) notes that interactive media technologies such as the
   Internet are altering the one-way media domination or information flow
   from the industrialized to the developing nations of the yesteryear (see
   Dizard, 2000). Hence, there is a shift from the traditional
   media/cultural imperialism paradigm to the new glocalization paradigm
   (Robertson, 1995)-where cultural regionalism and linguistic commonality
   dominate how data, information, news, media, and communication content
   are shared, exchanged, and marketed. Moreover, just as new media
   technologies represent a threat to totalitarianism, they also present
   channels for oppositionary discourse aimed at the world's remaining
   superpower.
   As a case in point, Yahoo!, Google, and MSN have all consented to comply
   with the censorship rules issued by the communist Chinese government,
   which include stripping all references to the word democracy. Even so,
   Chinese bloggers have been able to circumvent the government's
   surveillance and system control to convey their free thoughts with the
   outside world. In a similar vein, the Dubai-based Arab language
   satellite TV network Al Jazeera regularly reports stories that
   overshadow the ideological hegemony and propaganda diffused by American
   and Arabic national media outlets on the issues of democracy, religion,
   and war.
   Although technology innovations have the potential to become the
   equalizer for social, political, and economic development inequities
   among societies, a vast digital divide that exists between the digital
   haves and have-nots has, nevertheless, created unprecedented information
   and knowledge gaps. Surprisingly, these information and knowledge gaps
   also exist within the borders of an information society like ours, where
   concerns over the digital divide are considered minimal. These
   information and knowledge gaps, along with other social changes, are a
   result of how individuals, groups, and institutions adopt and use
   communication and information technologies to function as part of the
   social system in different social settings. The section to follow
   outlines these avenues of social influence in the context of our various
   book chapters, each of which is outlined in turn.}},

Abstract = {{Proposition of innovative software platform dedicated to modelling of
   metallurgical processes is presented in the paper. Developed approach is
   based on the idea of material representation in the form of digital data
   sets describing various material properties in different length scales.
   The platform is equipped with additional software modules dedicated to
   support data gathering, microstructure image analysis, mesh generation
   and performance of multiscale simulations. The latter module, based on
   Cellular Automata - Finite Element (CAFE) method, contains two
   algorithms related to modelling of microstructural phenomena occuring in
   material during deformation under varying conditions i.e. micro shear
   and shear bands analysis and recrystallization modelling. The complex
   approach described in this paper allows not only knowledge based
   prediction of detailed material properties after then-nomechanical
   metallurgical processes but it also gives possibility to modell entire
   life cycle of considered material. Thus, it facilitates the
   investigation of properties of final products and their development by
   strong quality improvement. Moreover, the platform allows to limit costs
   of manufacturing by reduction of many expensive industrial trials and
   their replacement by pure virtual research. Some of the results obtained
   from application of selected software modules are presented in the
   paper.}},

   less than one year lead-time for product development of its new

   from Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. in January 2005, was thrown into the market
   after 10 and a half months of product development period, which was the
   first achievement all over the world. (1) That means ``super-shortened
   process{''} reduced the lead-time of new automotive development to the
   half which had needed more than 20 months. The Japanese automotive
   industry has achieved the less than one year period of ``super-shortened

   ``shortened process{''} in 1990's as a result of its continuous

Abstract = {{We elicit some critical views on how the applications of information
   communication technology (ICT) can be approached for people with special
   educational needs (SEN). The findings, based on a number of concrete
   case-studies, clearly confirm that, despite of the huge research and
   developmental effort having been made for advancing ICT applications in
   education, ICT as a whole is surprisingly lacking a systematic discourse
   with educational domains, even much less concerning those who have
   learning difficulties. Whilst well known technical tools such as
   word-processors, screen-reading software and problem-solving software
   packages still provide useful ``snapshots{''} of ICT applications from
   particular points in time, we argue that these pictures now require
   updating. To enable the ICT development crossing multi-disciplinary
   boundaries, a meta-synthesis approach is innovated. The approach
   consists of four inter-operated components through ICT, i.e., assistive,
   sensory, communicative and interactive component.}},

Abstract = {{The DICOM standard is a set of rules that allows medical images to be
   digitally exchanged, viewed and archived Since the year 2000 the widely
   used DICOM standard has included rules for diagnostic ECG waveforms, but
   for a long time, no ECG manufacturer had marketed electrocardiographs
   that support the DICOM waveform standard. It was spring 2006 before the
   first ECG manufacturer announced its adoption of the DICOM standard for
   diagnostic electrocardiographs. Diagnostic 12 lead DICOM ECGs sent to
   DICOM network servers can be reviewed on DICOM workstations in
   conjunction with typical DICOM images like cardiovascular angiographic
   x-ray and cardiac US images. In DICOM the clinician has access to
   comprehensive medical information that provides essential decision
   support for evaluating patients. The implementation of a vendor neutral
   DICOM solution allows healthcare providers to connect a variety of
   electrocardiographs from different vendors to DICOM servers and no
   proprietary ECG management system for ECG data will be required.}},

Abstract = {{Digital photo management is becoming indispensable for the explosively
   growing family photo albums due to the rapid popularization of digital
   cameras and mobile phone came-as. In an effective photo management
   system photo annotation is the most challenging task. In this paper, we
   develop several innovative interaction techniques for semi-automatic
   photo annotation. Compared with traditional annotation systems, our
   approach provides the following new features: ``cluster annotation{''}
   puts similar faces or photos with similar scene together, and enables
   user label them in one operation; `contextual re-ranking{''} boosts the
   labeling productivity by guessing the user intention; ``ad hoc
   annotation{''} allows user label photos while they are browsing or
   searching, and improves system performance progressively through
   learning propagation. Our results show that these technologies provide a
   more user friendly interface for the annotation of person tame,
   location, and event, and thus substantially improve the annotation
   performance especially for a large photo album.}},

Abstract = {{Technology arguably has the potential to play a key role in improving
   the lives of people in developing regions. However, these communities
   are not well understood and designers must thoroughly investigate
   possibilities for technological innovations in these contexts. We
   describe findings from two field studies in India and one in Uganda
   where we explore technological solutions in the domains of
   communication, microfinance and education. Two common underlying themes
   emerge from these studies: (1) local stakeholders can contribute
   cultural information relevant to design such as needs and practices
   through interaction with technology artifacts and (2) unique social
   network structures embedded within communities are crucial to the
   acceptance and potential adoption of technology. We end with a synthesis
   of the three experiences that draws some practical lessons for ICT
   designers to elicit meaningful feedback and participation from local
   stakeholders in developing regions communities.}},

Abstract = {{Museums increasingly deploy new technologies to enhance visitors'
   experience of their exhibitions. They primarily rely on touch-screen
   Computer systems, PDAs and digital audio-guides. Tate Britain recently
   employed two innovative systems in one of their major exhibitions of
   John Constable's work; a gestural interface and a touch-screen panel,
   both connected to large projection screens. This paper reports on the
   analysis of video-recordings and field observations of visitors' action
   and interaction. It explores how people interact with and around the
   systems, how they configure the space around the installation and how
   they examine and discover their properties. It suggests that designers
   of interfaces and installations developed for museum exhibitions face
   particular challenges, such as the transparency of the relationship
   between people's actions and the system' response, the provision of
   opportunities for individual and collaborative experiences and the
   interweaving of technological and aesthetic experiences.}},

Abstract = {{During the last few years, innovative optical design strategies to
   generate and control image mapping have been successful in producing
   high-resolution digital imagers. This success has, in turn, increased
   the interest in the high-resolution camera and absolute measurement with
   high-resolution wide-angle lenses. This new generation of panoramic
   lenses includes catadioptric panoramic lenses, panoramic annular lenses,
   visible/IR fisheye lenses, anamorphic wide-angle attachments, and
   visible/IR panomorph lenses. Given that a wide-angle lens images a large
   field of view on a limited number of pixels, a systematic pixel-to-angle
   mapping will help the efficient use of each pixel in the field of view.
   In this study, the various relevant tradeoffs will be detailed and the
   advantages and disadvantages of panoramic lenses will be discussed. Of
   particular concern in the optical design of a panoramic imager is the
   uniformity of the image quality; because two hemispherical images can be
   stitched together digitally to form a complete 360-degrees X 360-degrees
   image, the performance of the lens at 90 degrees (preferably more than
   90 degrees) is just as important as at the centre. Lateral colour, edge
   compression (distortion) and severe drop-off of the relative
   illumination can also present significant image defects and may cause
   seams in the immersive image. Finally, we will present various current
   scenarios where a high-resolution panoramic imager will be most
   advantageous.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with recent developments in non-destructive tests on
   operating steel wire ropes, with the aim of analyzing their conditions
   and residual resistance. The instruments for executing magneto-inductive
   tests on wire ropes - employed in cableways, chairlifts, mine elevators
   and, occasionally, in equipment for handling material in harbours (e.g.
   gantry cranes and portainers) - are commonly composed of three parts:
   the revealing device (detector); power supply; and a recorder, equipped
   with an amplification apparatus and paper rolls for printing the
   results. The system proposed in this work is composed of an innovative
   magnetic detector where the traditional paper recording system is
   substituted with a software interface that allows a digital recording of
   the signal. The performances in terms of accuracy and linearity of the
   proposed detector are tested through proper laboratory set up and are
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Physiome is an unibrella term that refers to human modelling with
   mathematics and computational methods, accommodating cross-disciplinary
   science (chemistry, biology, physics) and a breadth of dimensional and
   temporal scale (sub-cellular to organs, sub-microsecond to
   tens-of-years). The Virtual Physiological Human is a European initiative
   that is intended to provide a unifying architecture for the integration
   and cooperation of multi-scale physiome models, thereby creating a
   predictive platform for the description of human beings in silico.
   Unlike the Genorne, the challenge of the Physiome may be almost
   unbounded, as the desire for increased detail imposes a continuing
   pressure for ever-finer data granularity, and the necessary Information
   Technology (IT) infrastructure spawns innovations that Surpass
   conventional solutions. It is foreseen that maturing physiome activities
   will increasingly influence medicine, biomedical research and commercial
   developments, and the central role of IT highlights the need for a
   specific and robust IT infrastructure. The European Commission has
   experience of supporting challenging technical endeavours through its
   Framework Programmes of research, and in the forthcoming 7th Framework
   Programme, it will invite researchers from within and outside Europe to
   unite in seeking solutions to key issues of the Physiome. The Virtual
   Physiological Human (VPH) investment programme will establish the
   necessary infrastructure and address the grand technical challenges
   identified by experts. This paper examines the background to the stategy
   and the ways in which the programme's structure has been determined.}},

Abstract = {{We present efforts to explore the relatively underdeveloped area of
   digital photo display. Using examples from two empirical studies with
   family homes, we develop our results around three broad themes related
   to the display of photos and their arrangement. The first theme
   highlights the collaborative as well as individual work that goes into
   preparing photos for display. The second attends to the obligations
   families have to put particular photos on display. The third introduces
   the notion of curatorial control and the tensions that arise from one
   person controlling a home's photo displays. Drawing on these themes, we
   go on to describe how we have used a critical design approach to open up
   the possibilities for future display innovations. Three critical design
   proposals are presented as sketches to illustrate the development of our
   ideas to date.}},

Abstract = {{The NASA Goddard Library collaborated with several projects on-Center to
   create a framework for the development of web-accessible repositories of
   grey literature. Tools and methods for collaboration were developed
   through a series of prototypes with a variety of Goddard projects based
   on the Library's Digital Asset System (DAS), a repository to describe
   and provide access to project information including images, videos, web
   sites, and technical reports.
   Metadata is a key component of this framework. The Goddard Core Metadata
   Element Set, an extension of the Dublin Core, Is used to describe these
   resources. Additional elements include project name, project code and
   instrument name. A taxonomy of controlled subject terms has been
   developed which can also be extended and tailored for each project. This
   provides consistent searching across the DAS, while at the same time
   enhancing the search precision for each project collection when it is
   accessed as a separate collection in the DAS or through its own web
   site.
   To-date, the Library has used the framework with a number of different
   projects. A commemorative CD with key documents, web sites and oral
   histories by the project managers was developed for the Hitchhiker
   Project as it was being disbanded. Metadata from the Swift project
   library was transformed and made more accessible with pointers to
   documents in the Swift project library. The Landsat Legacy Project, a
   joint project with the Landsat Program Science Office, the US Geological
   Survey, and the NASA History Office, is creating an archive of essential
   technical-, policy-, and science-related documentation. To gather
   significant documentation from the over 35-year-multi-agency history of
   Landsat, the Library added components for external submission of
   documents for potential inclusion in the new repository and for scanning
   paper documents. In addition, video histories are being captured from
   Landsat veterans.
   Through these projects, the NASA Goddard Library has developed a
   methodology for collaborating with different kinds of projects. It
   involves procedures for analyzing the needs of a project and determining
   how the metadata, taxonomy, and interface might need to change, while
   remaining consistent with the DAS framework for cross-repository access.
   Ultimately, the Library plans to extend the effort to other projects.
   (At any given point in time, Goddard has more than 30 projects in
   various stages of completion.) As part of Goddard's knowledge management
   activities, the DAS provides a framework for sharing grey literature
   that would otherwise be scattered across independent project libraries.
   Benefits include the ability to more quickly find and reuse information
   to decrease project costs, enhance safety and promote innovation.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the diffusion of an e-government innovation called
   SMS-alert - among Dutch police forces. A conceptual framework for the
   diffusion of e-government innovations in the public sector is developed
   which combines a functional and a constructivist (or cultural) approach
   of diffusion. The framework focuses on diffusion as a mutual process of
   communication, learning and sense making. Based on this framework and by
   using data from documentation, websites and interviews, the process of
   diffusion and adoption of SMS-alert is reconstructed and the factors and
   mechanisms explaining this process are identified. The case study
   demonstrates that although SMS-alert has diffused rather rapidly until
   now, the diffusion process is currently facing some difficulties, mainly
   due to the existence of competing innovations. By demonstrating the
   importance of both the functional, political and institutional meaning
   of the innovation, the article confirms the value of combining different
   approaches in studying the diffusion of e-govemment innovations.}},

Abstract = {{Regions are becoming global agents of development, overcoming in many
   dimensions the traditional perspective, of the Nation State. Regions are
   getting more powerful and autonomous, are designing regional strategies
   adapted to their needs and potentialities, are promoting their assets
   and resources in the international sphere, are competing for investment,
   projects, highly qualified human resources, tourists, etc., and are
   using place marketing approaches to tell the world how good they are.
   Sustainability and innovation became main drivers in regional
   development models, being a kind of framework yin and yang of the
   regional competitiveness. Regions are becoming real entrepreneurs in the
   global arena. For example in the European Union context, Regions like
   Catalonia, West Midlands, Rhone Alps, Emilia-Romagna are emerging more
   and more as global players, taking on one side the advantages of being
   part of strong States like Spain, UK, France or Italy and on the other
   side they have a degree of autonomy and power that allows them to
   develop the best options in relation to their regional development
   needs. This is usually the case of ``winning Regions{''}, more central
   and better connected (physically, digitally), with high levels of
   urbanization, economic performances, R\&D investment, high-tech sectors,
   etc. usually used as the best case studies. Nevertheless, many other
   Regions, with more rural and peripheral characteristics are willing to
   develop similar approaches, adapted to their situation.
   There are many different realities of rural regions but in general they
   present a more peripheral position, with lower population densities,
   weaker economic development, worse connections, lower levels of human
   capital, low-tech sectors sometimes with lower productivity and
   profitability, etc. Agriculture and associated activities continues to
   be important but in different degrees of relevance for the regional
   development (sometimes is more important in an indirect perspective,
   linked with the maintenance of landscape and local populations,
   preservation of traditions, identity and culture and not that much in
   terms of employment or revenues-a more European perspective). On the
   other side, those regions usually presents advantages and potentialities
   related to the better environmental conditions, are associated with a
   more ``traditional way of life{''}, are far away from the ``development
   urban hazards{''} (pollution, traffic, fast-food meals) being attractive
   to different kinds of tourism (from more relaxed to,more. active /
   sportive; from natural to cultural; etc) and are the source of many high
   quality products (agro-food, wine, etc.). Territory is a factor of
   differentiation and on that way it can be a factor of attractiveness and
   competitiveness, being so irnportant to have planning approaches that
   deals with the specific characteristics and dynamics of each territory.
   Improving the competitiveness factors of rural regions, through capacity
   building processes focused on drivers like sustainability and
   innovation, can, lead to the development of more entrepreneur rural
   regions.
   This paper will discuss the concept of entrepreneur rural regions as an
   approach focused on the improvement of the regional competitiveness
   factors. It will be presented the case study of Alentejo, Region, in
   South of Portugal, that is trying to go from ``bread to brain{''}, from
   a development model based on the land, on the agriculture and natural
   resources,, to a new path of development where the knowledge and
   innovation are the new ``ground{''} for prosperity. That does not mean
   the abandonment of the traditional sectors; it means the integration of
   knowledge-base approaches into the traditional sectors (through
   research, `marketing, e-commerce, etc.). Today Alentejo presents in the
   European markets some high quality products like wine, olive oil,
   agro-food products. Even tourism is boomirig in the Region, trying to
   take advantage from the unspoiled natural areas and the growing
   international demands (especially coastal areas) and bringing in
   innovation (e.g. new products like eco-resorts, rural tourism, thematic
   routes, e-booking services, e-marketing, etc.) nevertheless raising
   worries and concerns about the increasing demand forland (urbanization)
   and natural resources (water, energy) in tourism development areas. If
   we need to have innovation- on one side, we need to have. the issues of
   sustainability on the other, as a way. of balancing environmental and
   socio-economics aspects, safeguarding the quality of the products and on
   that way their competitiveness, Yin-novation and Yang-sustainability.
   The entrepreneur rural regions needs to achieve a complementary relation
   between those perspective and to reinforce some other fundamental
   dimensions like-governance, leadership, human capital (education,
   qualifications), social capital (trust, community rules, bonds),
   leadership, etc. The case study of Alentejo will allow a better view
   over the concept of entrepreneurial,region and its'characteristics. It
   will also, be possible to draw some lessons for regions that are trying.
   to find its way through in rural and peripheral regions like Sichuan in
   P.R.China.}},

Title = {{An attention-information-based spatial adaptation framework for browsing
   videos via mobile devices}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2007}},
Abstract = {{With the growing popularity of personal digital assistant devices and
   smart phones, more and more consumers are becoming quite enthusiastic to
   appreciate videos via mobile devices. However, limited display size of
   the mobile devices has been imposing significant barriers for users to
   enjoy browsing high-resolution videos. In this paper, we present an
   attention-information-based spatial adaptation framework to address this
   problem. The whole framework includes two major parts: video content
   generation and video adaptation system. During video compression, the
   attention information in video sequences will be detected using an
   attention model and embedded into bitstreams with proposed
   supplement-enhanced information (SEI) structure. Furthermore, we also
   develop an innovative scheme to adaptively adjust quantization
   parameters in order to simultaneously improve the quality of overall
   encoding and the quality of transcoding the attention areas. When the
   high-resolution bitstream is transmitted to mobile users, a fast
   transcoding algorithm we developed earlier will be applied to generate a
   new bitstream for attention areas in frames. The new low-resolution
   bitstream containing mostly attention information, instead of the
   high-resolution one, will be sent to users for display on the mobile
   devices. Experimental results show that the proposed spatial adaptation
   scheme is able to improve both subjective and objective video qualities.}},

Abstract = {{Harnessing ICTs effectively is one of the main vehicles for achieving
   the EU's 2010 strategy to become the most competitive digital
   knowledge-based economy. Achieving this requires innovation and a
   process of cultural, structural and economical changes, supported by
   ICTs towards the so-called eAgora. The aims of this paper are to show
   that, instead of delivering an eAgora, we are on course for an eDomus.
   The paper is structured in four main parts. The first introduces the
   eAgora trajectory. The second discusses the eDomus use of digital
   technologies by Italian citizens as depicted by the results of recent
   surveys. The third compares this situation with the outcomes illustrated
   at a European level by the Intelcities EU IP project. Finally, the
   fourth discusses the main implications of these findings for meeting the
   Lisboa strategy objectives, using OECD framework as a benchmarking tool
   for measuring increasing levels of citizens' participation in
   decision-making.}},

   where the UOC has introduced innovative changes such as the
   digitalization of all the exams (scanning exams), their later digital
   distribution to the professors whose task is to correct the exams, and
   the possibility of correcting and grading them in a digital way. This

Abstract = {{Throughout the 1990s, the emerging policy debate on the potential of a
   digital networks society stressed the need to balance two possibly
   opposing features. The protection of immaterial rights, via the IPR /
   Patent regime, should not be so rigorous as to hinder the development of
   new business Models Suited to the digital world. As a more focused
   debate on e-inclusion, interactivity, consumer as creators etc.
   developed, the focus shifted to the need for a balance between content
   owners, content owners IPRs and the reasonable interests of consumers.
   Technology, however, has made it possible for consumers to
   circumnavigate content owners' interests with the result that cultural
   diversity has moved front main stream media to the Internet. Technology
   has turned content, which has been exclusive to many due to cost and the
   necessity to have certain hardware (CD players etc) into collective
   goods. User generated content (UGC) has become a means to bridge the gap
   between consumption and production. The Open Source movement has
   developed rapidly, with thousands of experienced Internet users
   collaborating in the development of new software applications, often in
   parallel with the growth of proprietary solutions protected by the
   IPR/patent regime.
   This paper looks at the significance of these developments for
   creativity and innovation in general and more specifically for the
   current wave of emerging open source / open content-based business
   models. We argue a) that new business models are often at odds with the
   legal regime, b) that consumer privacy is increasingly at odds with the
   legal regime, and c) that innovation may be a victim since improving
   existing ideas is the basis of creativity.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnoses of skin diseases are considerably difficult tasks due to the
   multiply-folded factors. Nailfold capillaroscopy has been developed to
   diagnosis microvascular disturbances mainly in connective tissue
   diseases, including systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, systemic lupus
   erythematosus, and Raynaud's phenomenon. Capillaroscopy is non-invasive,
   easy to use, low cost and suitable for observation of these typical
   phenomena. We improved conventional capillaroscopy by constructing
   ``high speed digital video capillaroscopy{''}, by integrating high speed
   digital video camera, deep-focus zoom lens, appropriate light Source and
   light collecting adaptor. High speed digital video camera enabled us to
   observe the individual red blood cell in human nailfold capillary in
   vivo. The light collecting adaptor is effective for preventing skin from
   excessive light exposure, which causes serious damage. The first
   objective of this study is to extract the shape of nailfold capillary
   quantitatively by using binarization and the level-set method. By using
   the level-set method, the function, which distinguishes Outside from
   inside of the capillary and also evaluates radius distribution along the
   capillary center line, is calculated. Based on this mathematical
   description of capillary shape, more rigorous definition of the
   capillary red blood cell velocity than the conventional method is
   obtained. The second objective of this Study is to propose the
   innovative measurement method of red blood cell velocity in nailfold
   capillary. As plasma gaps show high brightness we trace them and
   estimate the velocities of blood cells on the center line of capillary.
   The last objective of this Study is to observe the behavior of red blood
   cell. We evaluate the movement of individual red blood cell, not only in
   the axial direction but also the lateral direction. We analyze the
   series of images of red blood cells in capillary and discuss their
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to provide a brief review about the
   ImageStream system a novel tool for multiparameter cell analysis in
   flow. The instrument integrates the features of flow cytometry and
   fluorescence microscopy combined with a modem methodology for image
   analysis. Similar to flow cytometry, ImageStream allows analysis of a
   large number of cells based on their fluorescence features and provides
   statistical analysis of these features. Additionally, ImageStream allows
   detailed morphometric cellular analysis based on acquired cellular
   images integrating various morphometric and photometric features of the
   examined cells. Simply stated, ImageStream system is an advanced flow
   cytometer acquiring both integrated fluorescence signals as well as high
   quality fluorescence images and allowing muliparameter analysis. The
   innovative features of the instrument offer new analytical capabilities
   and allow for a multitude of possible applications beyond the current
   means of flow cytometry. While this article summarizes basic information
   about the features of ImageStream and its applications based on the
   available literature and it also describes our own experience.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a number of innovative no-reference algorithms to
   assess the perceived quality of real-time analog and digital television
   and video streams. A prototype system is developed to locate and measure
   the impact of three types of impairments that commonly impair television
   and video signals. Analog sequences are tested for the presence of
   random noise. In the case of digital signals, two fundamental types of
   errors are of interest. The first is the blocking artifact that is so
   pervasive among DCT-based compression schemes such as MPEG. The second
   category includes errors caused by random changes to the bit stream of a
   signal. Of the various forms that these distortions may take on, only
   those that appear as ``colored blocks `` are detected by this system.
   Ideas to address the remaining issues are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, commercially available standard-cell libraries consist of a
   large set of items, including cells optimized with respect to speed,
   area or power consumption. A large number of cells makes the synthesis
   process and the library maintenance quite demanding. By using a reduced
   set of properly-selected cells, such efforts can be reduced, without
   critically affecting performance. This paper introduces an innovative
   library-reduction strategy, based on a evolutionary algorithm, which
   allows for selecting an arbitrarily small subset of cells. Library
   compaction is strictly related to the features of the actual synthesis
   tool, and is tuned by means of a large set of benchmark circuits, so
   that it produces results suitable for general-purpose circuit design.
   Different technologies were accounted for, analyzing dependence of the
   area, time and power figures on the library cell count. Performance,
   with respect to full-size library synthesis, do not appreciably
   degrades, and in several cases actually improves. Synthesis time
   decreases and library maintenance and characterization tasks can thus be
   significantly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Modern wireless systems have to achieve very high data rates over noisy
   channels. Channel codes are usually used to guarantee reliable
   communication, but validating a system with extremely low Bit Error Rate
   (BER) requires the simulation of a huge number of samples. The
   simulation complexity furtherly increases if we want to take into
   account the joint effect of channel codes and complex modulation
   techniques, such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM),
   over multi-path fading channel. The use of software simulators to
   evaluate system performance in several scenarios may result in
   unacceptably long times and a reconfigurable hardware prototyping
   environment may be an effective solution. This paper describes the
   implementation of a complete real-time, fully digital, flexible high
   performance hardware/software prototype for beyond 3G wireless
   communications. The transmitter/receiver chain includes several
   innovative characteristics: Serial Concatenated Convolutional Codes
   (SCCC) Turbo Encoder/Decoder, adaptive OFDM modulation, versatile
   multiple user access scheme and a sophisticated, real-time power
   control.
   Optimal choices for partitioning and internal data representation have
   been described as well as internal architecture and measurement
   environment. Our programmable prototype ensures high flexibility and
   speedup of more than 4000 times compared with the software version.}},

Abstract = {{The coding theory is an application of algebra that has become
   increasingly important over the decades. There are some different works
   that have been devoted to the problems of cryptography/cryptology.
   Cryptography is the study of sending and receiving secret messages. With
   the widespread use of information technologies and the rise of digital
   computer networks in many areas of the world, securing the exchange of
   information has become a crucial task. Currently, very active research
   is being done with electronic or communication applications. In the
   present paper an innovative technique for data encryption is proposed
   based on the random sequence generation using the recurrence matrices
   and a quadruple vector. The new algorithm provides data encryption at
   two levels and hence security against crypto analysis is achieved at
   relatively low computational overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Last year we discussed ``Innovation Priorities{''} at this meeting.
   Since then iNEMI has completed its 2007 Roadmap. Our roadmap identifies
   that while digital convergence occurs ever more rapidly for existing
   markets, the key emerging markets are those with social value such as
   health care, energy, and security. To address both converging markets
   and emerging markets, iNEMI is focusing its project agenda on the
   technology to support minaturization; high reliability medical
   electronics; and energy and the environment. The technology to meet
   these focus areas includes system in package, energy storage and
   conversion, sensors, advanced manufacturing processes, and advanced
   materials. This article not only highlights projects that iNEMI is
   establishing to support these focus areas, but also the gaps in
   technology that we have identified, from the 2007 roadmap, which may
   limit the growth of the electronics industry during the next decade.
   Given the limited resources available for industry, academia, and
   governments to apply, it is crucial that R\&D efforts focus on these
   high priority knowledge gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Advances in technology, expanding indications and defensive
   medical practice, in combination with population aging, have all
   contributed to a substantial increase in utilization of imaging and
   therapeutic radiology procedures in recent years. Moreover, the
   integration of education, innovation and research into high-volume
   workflow, although challenging, is a key requirement in teaching
   hospitals. Therefore, identifying forthcoming demand in the use of
   radiology services at a referral center might be of special interest and
   facilitate health policy planning in this context.
   Methods: Data regarding conventional radiographic, ultrasonographic and
   computed tomography (CT) investigations, radiotherapy sessions, and
   interventional procedures were collected for a 5-year period
   (2000-2004). Based on these observations, we deployed appropriate models
   to forecast utilization rates in 2005-2009.
   Results: Between 2000 and 2004, ultrasound examinations increased by
   31.8\%, mammography by 31.6\%, CT scans by 17.4\%, interventions by
   14.5\% and radiotherapy sessions by 13.9\%, while conventional
   investigations decreased by 42.5\%. We identified significant increasing
   trends for ultrasound, mammography, CT and interventions (all p < 0.001
   for linear component). Compared to current levels, the workload for
   these modalities is expected to rise in the next 5 years by 43\%, 31\%,
   20\% and 14\%, respectively. Radiotherapy sessions demonstrate an
   unstable, non-significant increasing trend (p = 0.189), while
   utilization of conventional radiography declines rapidly (p < 0.001 for
   linear trend, 5-year prediction -51\%).
   Conclusions: In forthcoming years, the demand for radiology services at
   referral centers will increase substantially. Advances in digital
   technology alone will not suffice to completely alleviate the need for
   additional resources and well-trained personnel. (c) 2606 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Designing for Chinese industries and the new China market has became a
   `hot' issue within the global and Chinese industrial design society. The
   characteristics of low labor costs and hard-working Chinese have had an
   effect on the rapid economic development within the region as a whole.
   The purpose of this paper is to analyze state of the art industrial
   development within Taiwan and Mainland China, and to evaluate the
   critical problems of industrial design development in both regions.
   Additionally to discover how Taiwan Chinese digital technology
   industries confront this situation with user-oriented design (UOD). This
   paper synthesizes six approaches to carry out an innovative product
   development framework of new product development procedures, with user
   oriented scenario predictions and experience innovation approach. These
   approaches not only generate original design data from a user's point of
   view, but furthermore make it much easier to get consensus from product
   development teams and really create innovative designs through
   interdisciplinary collaboration to create innovative cultural
   enterprises.}},

Abstract = {{Interactive game, especially for users can be physically involved in the
   game, is one of important applications for gaming nowadays. With the
   most upto-date mediated devices, experience design has inspired lots of
   researches to explore possible or better innovative interactivity
   between human and machines. With physical interaction and rapid
   prototyping, a new computing paradigm combining both
   sensor/electronic/robotic technology and digital design media starts to
   show its root in both design and computing, namely ubiquitous computing
   and ambient intelligence. In addition to this paradigm, we adapt the
   interactivity of design and the design methods for studying situated
   interactive design. Furthermore, this paper documents a series of
   interacting plays for exploring possible interactions. Three attempts
   have conducted: Smart Toys, Spatial Components and Ambient Interaction
   under the realm of computational design and digital media. The outcomes
   of exploration are documented in the paper.}},

   innovative Collaborative Manufacturing Environment (CME) for the next
   generation of Digital Factory in order to support the competitiveness of
   SMEs. A digital factory represents a persistent hybrid community where a
   rich virtualised environment representing a variety of factory
   activities will facilitate the sharing of factory resources,
   manufacturing information and knowledge, and help the simulation of
   collaborative design, planning, production and management among
   different participants and departments. The DiFac CME will be used as a
   framework to support group work in an immersive and interactive way for
   three manufacturing activities: product development; factory design and
   analysis; and training of workers. Furthermore it will provide support
   for data analysis, visualization, advanced interaction and presence
   within the VE, ergonomics analysis and collaborative decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Teleradiology, telepathology, and teleoncology are important
   applications of tele-medicine. Recent advances in these fields include a
   preponderance of radiology PACS (Picture Archiving and Communications
   System) users, the implementation of around-the-clock teleradiology
   services at many hospitals, and the invention of the first ultrarapid
   whole-slide digital scanner based on the array microscope. These
   advances have led to the development of a new health-care-delivery
   clinical pathway called the ultrarapid breast care process (URBC), which
   has been commercialized as the UltraClinics (R) process. This process
   bundles telemammography, telepathology, and teleoncology services and
   has reduced the time it takes for a woman to obtain diagnostic and
   therapeutic breast-care planning services from several weeks to a single
   day. This paper describes the UltraClinics process in detail and
   presents the vision of a network of same-day telemedicine-enabled
   UltraClinics facilities, staffed by a virtual group practice of
   teleradiologists, telepathologists, and teleoncologists.}},

Abstract = {{Intellectual property policy used to have a positive effect in society,
   but it cannot be effectively applied to information production because
   of the rapid development of information technology. This paper proposes
   a new method to balance the benefit of both producers and consumers
   based on the characteristic of information production rather than the
   tight intellectual property protection. We treat the copyright as a
   public production and we suggest that governments give subsidies to
   sustain the information industry and optimize the information
   distribution. Innovation can be stimulated without traditional
   intellectual property. This paper concludes with finding the minimum
   subsidy that ought to be given by the governments.}},

   extraction and search engine system. TableSeer crawls scientific
   documents, identifies documents with tables, extracts tables from
   documents, indexes them and enables end-users to search for tables. We
   also propose an extensive set of medium independent metadata for tables
   representation. Given a query, TableSeer ranks the returned results
   using an innovative ranking algorithm - TableRank. Our results show that
   TableSeer outperforms popular search engines, such as Google Scholar
   when the end-user seeks for tables.}},

Abstract = {{E-government refers to government's use of ICT to provide secured online
   services to citizens and business organizations. e-government is seen as
   having an active and effective role in the development of information
   society and the setup of a government responsive to citizens and
   business needs. However, innovative organizational and technological
   changes represent a prerequisite for the success of this role. In
   addition, a special focus must be placed on security issues in order to
   assess ICT risks and related costs in the setting of a strategic
   decision process and to prevent or respond to digital aggressions. The
   objective of this paper is to identify the key factors to a successful
   digital government specification, implementation, management and
   protection which is based on a generic model built on five main
   activities in order to guarantee reliable and secured e-government
   services. They are: a) the design of a multilevel trust model according
   to the features of administrative services provided and required; b) the
   creation of new certification and audit entities; c) the design of an
   integrative and distributed structure to respond and monitor security
   incidents; d) the launching and conducting of online government
   projects; and e) the training and development of new skills. The
   aforementioned activities require investments to update information and
   communication infrastructures for sustainable e-government services, and
   working procedures reengineering. Moreover, the efficiency of
   e-government implementation presumes a thorough analysis of the
   structure and dynamics of IT cost components. Public managers need a
   cost model to guide their decisions in IT cost-benefits analysis
   structure, particularly when the level of security required by citizens
   and business organizations is high. Thus, our contribution in this paper
   consists in the proposition of a model that allows the provision of a
   large set of services in an e-government in a way that allows: (a)
   addition and maintenance of services, (b) cooperative assessment,
   prevention, and response to digital risks; and (c) computation of
   several costs involved in the process of e-government management. A case
   study illustrating the Tunisian situation in the deployment of
   e-government is presented. In this study, we asses the existing
   e-government services according to our proposed model and introduce a
   set of organizational and technical countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is focusing upon some aspects on designing of an innovation
   of pulse signal processing system. Traditional pulse signal waveform and
   spectroscopy analysis system amplified signal and stretched peak using
   analog method. Those systems suffered from jamming easily and being kept
   instable. The system employed in the paper obtains the compressed
   waveform in time domain and the energy spectrum of the pulse signal
   utilizing digital signal processing method, which is sampled with high
   speed and resolution ADC. The information acquired by the system, showed
   in the remote controlling centre by the virtual instrument panel, is
   transmitted to remote controlling centre by high speed IEEE1394A
   industrial bus, the transmission distance being 72 metres. The system
   processes the acquired data by high speed FPGA and transmits the ones by
   high speed IEEE1394A industrial bus, which solves the contradiction
   between high throughput and high energy resolution in pulse processing
   system, whereupon the function of virtual oscilloscope and energy
   spectroscopy analysis device is implemented. The field trial has
   demonstrated that it is feasible and rich in value of research.}},

Abstract = {{The MAGIC telescope is the world's largest gamma ray telescope, designed
   to look at the light emitted by air shower by Cherenkov effect. It is
   operating since 2004 at the Roque de Los Muchachos observatory, La
   Palma, Canary islands. MAGIC-II is the upgrade of the project,
   consisting of a twin telescope frame with innovative features like new
   photon detectors to lower the threshold energy further and an ultrafast
   signal sampling to reduce the effect of the diffuse night sky
   background. The new acquisition system is based upon a low power analog
   sampler (Domino Ring Sampler) with frequency ranging from 1. 5 to 4.5
   GHz and data are digitized with a 12 bit resolution ADC The analog
   sampler, originally designed for the MEG experiment, has been
   successfully tested on site and showed a very good linearity and single
   photon discrimination capability. Data management are performed by 9U
   VME digital boards called PULSAR (PULser And Recorder) which handle the
   data compression and reformatting as well. Every board has 80 analog
   channels plus auxiliary digital signals for trigger and monitor
   purposes. For a kHz trigger rate and a 2 GHz frequency sampling, the
   data throughput can be as high as 100MB/s thus being a challenge for
   modern data transmission and storage solutions. The data are transferred
   to PCI memory via Gbit optical links using the CERN S-Link protocol and
   to the mass storage system. The Data Acquisition system design and
   performance are described in detail.}},

Abstract = {{In order to customize the measurement procedure operating on Personal
   Digital Assistant (PDA), the Dynamic Measurement Application Repository
   Server (D-MARS) is added into the software architecture of the Wireless
   Distributed Measurement System. The D-MARS is designed to download on
   demand two different typologies of Virtual Instruments (VIs). The first
   one is the traditional VI concerning with all the functionalities of the
   Measurement Instrument (MI). The later is the innovative one and
   concerns with the specific functionalities of the MI. It is organised by
   set(containing modules obtained by splitting up the traditional VI in
   several functional entities according with the characteristics of the
   MI. The selection among these modules allows to the user the dynamically
   configuration of the measurement procedure on PDA. The management policy
   ensuring the efficiency of the working operations of the D-MARS is
   pointed out. In order to evidence the innovative features, an
   applicative example is shown.}},

Abstract = {{Part I of this article dealt with the mathematical methodology of
   antiquity which was essentially of a discrete character whereby a circle
   was deemed to be a multi-sided polygon whose perimeter or area could be
   more easily deduced by considering the multi-sided polygon to be made up
   of a finite set of elemental triangles. Then the emergence of numerical
   methods during the 1700s as a tool for interpolating numerical data was
   explored. Part II deals with certain spectacular mathematical
   discoveries made in France just before, during, and after the French
   Revolution by Laplace, Fourier, Poisson, and Laurent, which form the
   foundation of modern spectral analysis. Then the contributions of
   Nyquist and Shannon to the sampling theorem are examined. The article
   also reviews the work of Babbage from the perspective of a DSP
   practitioner and examines the historical circumstances that eventually
   led to the invention of digital computers and their application as
   general-purpose inexpensive components in DSP systems. The article
   concludes with a summary of some of the innovations of the sixties that
   led to the emergence of what we now call digital signal processing.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the implementation of a 380 MHz, 13 bit, direct
   digital synthesizer/mixer IC in 0.25 mu m CMOS technology. The circuit
   employs an innovative architecture which divides the pi/4 rotation
   operation required in the quadrature synthesizer/mixers, in three
   rotations. The first two rotations are implemented by using a CORDIC
   datapath completely realized in carry-save arithmetic. The directions of
   the CORDIC rotations are computed in parallel by using a little lookup
   table, for the first rotation, and a multiply by constant and addition
   circuit for the second rotation. The final (third) rotation is
   multiplier-based, in order to reduce the circuit latency and increase
   the circuit performances.
   The CORDIC datapath is implemented with a novel approach both at the
   algorithmic level and at the transistor level. At the algorithmic level
   the combined employ of sign-extension prevention, overflow prevention
   and a novel rounding scheme are presented. At the transistor level a
   design style that jointly uses full-CMOS and DPL to improve the circuit
   latency is described.
   The overall circuit performances are very interesting. The
   synthesizer/mixer IC, realized in a 0.25 mu m CMOS technology, has an
   area occupation of 0.22 mm(2) and dissipates 152 mW at 380 MHz with a
   supply voltage of 2.5 V.}},

Abstract = {{It has been universally recognized by the previous researches that
   depressions in DEM data are the major obstacle of determining hydrologic
   flow directions, so numerous methods were proposed to address this
   problem. However, when massive DEM data, such as SRTM and GTOPO30,
   become available through internet, the conventional approaches are too
   time-consuming and inefficient in dealing with such massive data for
   hydrologic analyses. A new innovative approach, unlike all existing
   methods that process DEM data straightforward without utilizing the
   topographic features implied in them, was proposed in this study to
   improve the DEM-processing efficiency. The new approach has two steps:
   first, classify the initial DEM data into eight groups according to the
   elevation values using the quantile classification method, and set each
   category cell values to its quantile and store them in a transient
   matrix. Second, scan the transient matrix from the minimum category to
   the maximum one, restore its initial value if its initial value is
   larger than or equal to its neighbors', else set its value to the
   minimum of its neighbors' if its quantile is larger than its neighbor's,
   and repeat this process until all the depressions are filled.
   Furthermore, unlike the traditional method, which have to scan all the
   DEM cells in each loop, the new one only scan the data needed to be
   further processed by storing their location information into two stacks.
   As a result, the total cells and scanning times are dramatically
   decreased due to stack's nature of ``first in last out{''}, and the
   location information of depressions is all stored in one of the two
   stacks, which facilitate the subsequent hydrologic analysis. DEMs of
   various sizes were used for testing and evaluating the new method. The
   results show the new method is thousands of times faster than the famous
   Jenson and Domingue's (1988) method and is over seven times faster than
   Planchon and Darboux's on average The new algorithm is fully detailed

Abstract = {{We report on a new generation, commercial prototype of a programmable
   array optical sectioning fluorescence microscope (PAM) for rapid, light
   efficient 3D imaging of living specimens. The stand-alone module,
   including light source(s) and detector(s), features an innovative
   optical design and a ferroelectric liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS)
   spatial light modulator (SLM) instead of the DMD used in the original
   PAM design. The LCoS PAM (developed in collaboration with Cairn
   Research, Ltd.) can be attached to a port of a(ny) unmodified
   fluorescence microscope. The prototype system currently operated at the
   Max Planck Institute incorporates a 6-position high-intensity LED
   illuminator, modulated laser and lamp light sources, and an Andor iXon
   emCCD camera. The module is mounted on an Olympus IX71 inverted
   microscope with 60-150X objectives with a Prior Scientific x,y, and z
   high resolution scanning stages. Further enhancements recently include:
   (i) point- and line-wise spectral resolution and (ii) lifetime imaging
   (FLIM) in the frequency domain. Multiphoton operation and other
   nonlinear techniques should be feasible.
   The capabilities of the PAM are illustrated by several examples
   demonstrating single molecule as well as lifetime imaging in live cells,
   and the unique capability to perform photoconversion with arbitrary
   patterns and high spatial resolution. Using quantum dot coupled ligands
   we show real-time binding and subsequent trafficking of individual
   ligand-growth factor receptor complexes on and in live cells with a
   temporal resolution and sensitivity exceeding those of conventional CLSM
   systems. The combined use of a blue laser and parallel LED or visible
   laser sources permits photoactivation and rapid kinetic analysis of
   cellular processes probed by photoswitchable visible fluorescent
   proteins such as DRONPA.}},

Abstract = {{Stealing cell phone has become the eye catching business for culprits.
   There should be a reliable method for protecting the instrument from
   burglars. Our paper proposes a new innovative, reliable, fool proof
   security measure for cell phones using VOICE RECOGNITION.
   Voice recognition is the identification of an individual identity using
   speech as the identitiing characteristic. The voice of the user is
   processed (Speech Processing) using a digital signal processor which is
   the prime part of a cell phone. We are programming this DSP to implement
   this protection technique.
   At first, an original voice database of the user is created. This
   database is stored in the Flash ROM (8M) which is available inside the
   cell phone. Then whenever the user speaks through the cell phone part of
   the speech sample is taken and encoded. This processed voice of the user
   is compared with the original database to check the identity of the
   user. If the user is authorized, he is allowed to talk. If not the
   transmission is cut abruptly by making the microprocessor (MP) go. to
   idle state. Thus the cell phone is being protected from any unauthorized
   use. Even if the cell phone is stolen or misplaced, it won't be of any
   use to the other person.
   In order to find the culprit, the voice sample which is initially stored
   in ROM should be the same as in the network/service provider library.
   The culprits can be found by comparing the voice samples ix., by
   comparing the sample that is stored in the network /service provider
   library with the voice sample taken from the user initial speech
   (temporary memory).Once the mismatch occur the sample which is stored in
   temporary memory is transmitted to the network provider. Using these
   samples, it is possible for the network provider to find the culprit -by
   comparing the obtained sample with the samples which is stored in
   network/service provider library.
   Our proposal demands neither external hardware nor extra cost. The above
   methods possess no hardship for the user unlike the present security
   systems. This method can be adopted universally in all models of Cell
   phones for protection.}},

Title = {{Socio-economic determinants of broadband adoption}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{654-671}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - As innovative forms of information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) such as broadband internet are being adopted, the
   equitable distribution of ICTs has become an issue of concern. These
   apprehensions are being attributed to social exclusion that could arise
   due to the limited internet use among citizens with lower incomes or
   educational levels. This research aims to examine the impact of
   socio-economic determinants, such as age, gender, education, income and
   occupation, on the adoption of broadband.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey research approach was employed to
   achieve the overall aim of this research. The empirical data of the
   socio-economic variables was collected employing a postal survey in the
   UK.
   Findings - The findings of this research suggest that in terms of
   broadband adoption, except for gender, all the other socio-economic
   variables, including age, education, occupation and income,
   significantly helped to explain differences between the adopters and
   non-adopters of broadband.
   Practical implications - The implications of the findings are discussed
   in the context of promoting the adoption of emerging technologies such
   as broadband to parts of the population that have limited access to the
   internet and ICTs in general.
   Originality/value - The primary value of this paper lies in extending
   the understanding of broadband adopters and non-adopters according to
   their socio-economic attributes. This has been achieved by synthesising
   the previous literature on a number of socio-economic: variables (such
   as age, gender, education, income and occupation) and also by
   empirically examining their effects on broadband adoption.}},

Abstract = {{The paper points out that in developed countries the structure of media
   services has recently been significantly transformed Interactive media
   play an ever-increasing role, primarily via broadband Internet
   connection However, we can also expect an increase in digital and mobile
   television broadcasting and reception. Besides technical innovations,
   the transformation of user habits reflects a significant impact of
   changing business environment and altered regulatory conditions. In
   addition to earlier user attitudes, individually tailored proactive
   media usage is spreading. The author analyzes the proliferation of new
   services on the basis of Rogers's diffusion theory. Her empirical
   research showed that in Hungary the innovators in adapting broadband
   technology can be readily distinguished from the rest. However, even
   this apparently homogeneous group of users is by no means uniform but
   consists of clearly distinguishable types, according to demograpical
   features and the characteristics of actual media-consumption.}},

Abstract = {{The innovations and improvements in digital imaging sensors and
   scanners, computer modeling, haptic equipments and e-leaming technology,
   as well as the availability of many powerful graphics PCs and
   workstations make haptic-based rendering methods for e-learning
   documentation with 3-D modeling functionality feasible. E-Learning
   documentation is a new term in computing, engineering and architecture,
   related to digital documentation with e-leaming functionality, and
   introduced to literature for the first time within this paper. In
   particular, for the historical living systems (architectures, monuments,
   cultural heritage sites), such a methodolgy must be able to derive
   pictorial, geometric, spatial, topological, learning and semantic
   information from the target architectural object (historical living
   system), in such a way that it can be directly used for e-learning
   purposes regarding the history, the architecture, the structure and the
   temporal (time-based) 3-D geometry of the projected historical living
   system. A practical project is used to demonstrate the functionality and
   the performance of the proposed methodology. In particular, the
   processing steps from image acquisition to e-learning documentation of
   the Aghios Achilleios basilica, twin lakes Prespes, Northern Greece,
   through its 3-D geometric CAAD (Computer-Aided Architectural Design)
   model and semantic description are presented. Also, emphasis is placed
   on introducing and documenting the new term e-learning documentation.
   Finaly, for learning purposes related to 3-D modeling accuracy
   evaluation, a comparison test of two image-based approaches is carried
   out and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An MWIR TDI (Time Delay and Integration) Imager and Spectrometer (MTIS)
   instrument for characterizing from orbit the moons of Jupiter and Saturn
   is proposed. Novel to this instrument is the planned implementation of a
   digital TDI detector array and an innovative imaging/spectroscopic
   architecture. Digital TDI enables a higher SNR for high spatial
   resolution surface mapping of Titan and Enceladus and for improved
   spectral discrimination and resolution at Europa. The MTIS
   imaging/spectroscopic architecture combines a high spatial resolution
   coarse wavelength resolution imaging spectrometer with a hyperspectral
   sensor to spectrally decompose a portion of the data adjacent to the
   data sampled in the imaging spectrometer. The MTIS instrument thus maps
   with high spatial resolution a planetary object while spectrally
   decomposing enough of the data that identification of the constituent
   materials is highly likely. Additionally, digital TDI systems have the
   ability to enable the rejection of radiation induced spikes in high
   radiation environments (Europa) and the ability to image in low light
   levels (Titan and Enceladus). The ability to image moving objects that
   might be missed utilizing a conventional TDI system is an added
   advantage and is particularly important for characterizing atmospheric
   effects and separating atmospheric and surface components. This can be
   accomplished with on-orbit processing or collecting and returning
   individual non co-added frames.
   We present the mission objectives associated with this instrument, the
   derived instrument requirements, a concept of operations, the optical
   and detector trades, the expected performance and a path forward.}},

Abstract = {{With the explosion of technology development, information appliance (IA)
   and digital devices (DD) become more and more popular these years. And
   the development of the third generation (3G) mobile phone is viewed as
   the most potential profitable product in the next decade. However, 3G
   mobile phone is confronting its promotion bottleneck. By using diffusion
   of innovation and lifestyle theory, hence, this study aims to examine
   the factors influencing adopting 3G mobile phone intention. Result shows
   only ``technology cluster{''} is significantly related to adoption
   intention among four variables examined in this study.}},

Abstract = {{A simple auto-tuning technique, based on the relay feedback, for
   voltage-mode synchronous half bridge isolated POL converter is here
   reported. By means of the relay control, small oscillations on the
   output voltage are generated during converter soft-start. Based on the
   measurements of the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations, the
   gain and phase of the converter transfer function at the oscillation
   frequencies are derived. Instead of estimating the converter transfer
   function at different frequencies, the paper proposes an innovative
   iterative procedure, where the tuning of PID singularities is obtained
   directly by including the controller in the relay feedback. Conversely,
   compensator gain tuning is performed by means of a technique based on
   crossover frequency analysis, in order to obtain a specified closed loop
   bandwidth. The proposed algorithm is very simple, requires small tuning
   times and it is fully compliant with the cost/complexity constraint of
   integrated digital ICs. Even if aimed to an integrated digital
   controller, experimental investigation has been performed using discrete
   components, implementing the digital control in a Field Programmable
   Gate Array (FPGA).}},

Pages = {{164-170}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Collaboration on procurement of e-content between health
   libraries in the National Health Service (NHS) and in higher education
   (HE) should have advantages in increasing their negotiating power to
   improve licence terms and avoiding unnecessary duplication of content.
   The aim of the paper is to examine some of the strategies for ensuring
   that collaboration across the two sectors works effectively. The paper
   is based on a report to the Joint Information Systems Committee of the
   Funding Councils (for higher and further education) in the UK, and the
   NHS Library and Knowledge Development Network, on research conducted in
   2006.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methods included interviews (n = 39)
   with representatives from NHS and higher education bodies,
   representatives of independent health libraries, the National Library
   for Health, collective agencies, publishers and aggregators.
   Findings - There were common interests in functionality/interfaces, open
   access, and better metrics for estimating usage that might contribute to
   discussions with publishers over the licence terms. There are
   differences in the type of resource each sector might deem to be core.
   The extent of existing collaboration on purchasing and related
   collection management activities varied considerably across the UK.
   Three possible paths for cooperative activity were identified: sharing
   information and joint advocacy; building the technical infrastructure;
   and joint procurement. Mapping of the stages, roles, actors and
   stakeholders in some processes was done with ``use cases{''} (Unified
   Modeling Language) to help identify some of the risks involved.
   Research limitations/implications - Poor response from online surveys
   limited the validity of the forecasting of user needs. Usage statistics
   were difficult to obtain and compare.
   Practical implications - The paper concludes that collaborative
   procurement of e-content activities should focus on health services
   research requirements, and open access needs across the sectors. More
   innovative analysis of usage statistics is required to profile usage and
   inform cost analyses of both the impact of new roles for health
   librarians, and cost analyses of e-resources on a life cycle basis.
   Originality/value - The paper develops new ways of examining the
   business processes required for collaborative procurement.}},

Abstract = {{We have designed a system that predicts species richness in the mixed
   wood boreal forest of Canada. The system is based on a simple
   multivariate linear model that uses four landscape characteristics as
   independent variables: canopy species type, distance from the nearest
   ridgeline, time since the last fire and canopy stem density. The model
   is shown to provide statistically significant estimates of richness when
   using observed independent variables. We developed models for estimating
   the four landscape characteristics from geospatial data consisting of
   remotely sensed imagery and a digital elevation model. We ran the model
   at the stand scale and the pixel scale and found that stand scale
   predictions were be more accurate that pixel scale predictions. We
   produced a map of vegetation species richness for Prince Alberta
   National Park in central Saskatchewan Canada that is consistent with our
   expectations. We also estimated the uncertainty in the four landscape
   characteristic estimates and developed a methodology for propagating
   this uncertainty through the system to produce estimates of uncertainty
   in the pixel-based richness predictions. While the uncertainty. is
   significant, the estimation and management of uncertainty in a mapping
   system of this type represents an innovation.}},

Abstract = {{In a digital economy, companies face intensive competition and a
   changing market situation, and thus they make efforts in Knowledge
   Management (KM) by understanding that knowledge creation is a spiral
   process of interaction between explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge so
   as to enhance their competitive advantage in innovation. Product
   innovation must link technological competence such as engineering and
   process know-how as well as customer competence such as knowledge of
   customer needs. The importance of KM in product technological innovation
   has been critically recognised, whereas the potential for customer KM is
   not pervasively studied. This inspires the demand to study how
   congruently managing product knowledge and customer knowledge with the
   support of Information Technology (IT), does enable the conversion of
   tacit knowledge into codified knowledge for creating value and reducing
   risk. It also arouses the motivation to propose an integrated KM model
   to deal with a high technology product development project.}},

   where they could operate it while driving. Three independent variables
   had a positive impact on use motivation: intensity of communication,
   average daily driving time and expected passenger use motivation.
   Additionally, three independent variables had a positive correlation
   with usage rates: perceived technological sophistication, user
   innovativeness and frustration in technology. Of the four user
   categories, intense users and non-specialised users had a higher
   awareness of MDTV as an essential technology than did specialised and

Abstract = {{Vogue is a widespread phenomenon in human society. In consumption-driven
   society, vogue is not only a matter of consumption trends, as well as an
   effective tool to stimulate and control consumption. Therefore, vogue
   becomes the significant characteristics of consumer, society. Design
   meets the needs of humanity, and the needs presents in the consumer
   behavior. From this, design is serving for consumption. Sociologists
   show that the core force to promote modem consumer desires is closely
   related with novelty, which shows in the vogue system. And the core
   competitive force of design is innovation. For this reason, we believe
   that the inner link between vogue and design is associated with
   innovation.}},

   The number of significant digits, sampling rate and others has an
   important effect on system design and link indicator distribution. This
   paper, aiming at part of the key indicator requirements of the empty
   port in TD-SCDMA (power, dynamic range of output signal, peak-to-average
   ratio of multicarrier output signal, dynamic range of input signal,
   reference sensitivity of receiver and anti-jamming of input signal)
   makes an analysis of the requirements of ADC and DAC for the number of
   digits in design implementation.
   The analysis has been demonstrated in the implementation of the
   proof-of-principle prototype.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the acceptability and impact of an audiovisual, bilingual,
   interactive computer module relating to appropriate antibiotic use. In
   winter 2001, adults seeking urgent care for acute respiratory infections
   at an inner-city urgent care clinic were invited to complete the
   computer module and survey (N = 26). After responding to questions about
   their symptoms, patients were provided information about their illness
   and appropriate antibiotic use, and then asked severla questions about
   the acceptability of the module. The main outcomes, reflecting qualities
   known to enhance diffusion of innovations, wre ``learning something new
   about colds and flu{''} and trusting the computer information.
   Spanish-language respondents (16\%) were much less liekly to report
   prior computer experience, more likely to need h elp, and strongly
   preferred answering to a person compared with English-language
   respondents. In multivariable analysis, Spanish-language respondents
   were more likely to report learning something new (OR = 5.0; 95\% CI:
   2.0, 12.4) and trusting the information (OR = 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.0, 6.0).
   We conclude that an interactive computer module was well received among
   a medically underserved urgent care clinic population. Benefits appear
   greatest among populations having the least experience with this medium.}},

Abstract = {{The Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS) are
   intelligent transportation systems that provide routing, guidance,
   surveillance, and control to aircraft and vehicles in order to keep up
   the airport capacity under all local weather conditions, while
   maintaining the required level of safety; however, reflections,
   multipath, and shadows due to buildings, equipment, and other reflecting
   objects on the airport surface make it difficult, if not sometimes
   impossible, for existing A-SMGCS to reliably cover the whole aerodrome.
   In these cases another sensor must step in to fill those gaps. Digital
   video cameras not only can solve these kinds of problems filling blind
   spots in the existing A-SMGCS, but also provide a cost effective
   solution. This article presents an innovative system for airport surface

Title = {{Information systems for patient follow-up and chronic management of HIV
   and tuberculosis: A life-saving technology in resource-poor areas}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Background: The scale-up of treatment for HIV and multidrug-resistant
   tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in developing countries requires a long-term
   relationship with the patient, accurate and accessible records of each
   patient's history, and methods to track his/her progress. Recent studies
   have shown up to 24\% loss to follow-up of HIV patients in Africa during
   treatment and many patients not being started on treatment at all. Some
   programs for prevention of maternal-child transmission have more than
   80\% loss to follow-up of babies born to HIV-positive mothers. These
   patients are at great risk of dying or developing drug resistance if
   their antiretroviral therapy is interrupted. Similar problems have been
   found in the scale-up of MDR-TB treatment.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the role of medical
   information systems in tracking patients with HIV or MDR-TB, ensuring
   they are promptly started on high quality care, and reducing loss to
   follow-up.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted starting from a previous
   review and using Medline and Google Scholar. Due to the nature of this
   work and the relative lack of published articles to date, the authors
   also relied on personal knowledge and experience of systems in use and
   their own assessments of systems.
   Results: Functionality for tracking patients and detecting those lost to
   follow-up is described in six HIV and MDR-TB treatment projects in
   Africa and Latin America. Preliminary data show benefits in tracking
   patients who have not been prescribed appropriate drugs, those who fail
   to return for follow-up, and those who do not have medications picked up
   for them by health care workers. There were also benefits seen in
   providing access to key laboratory data and in using this data to
   improve the timeliness and quality of care. Follow-up was typically
   achieved by a combination of reports from information systems along with
   teams of community health care workers. New technologies such as
   low-cost satellite Internet access, personal digital assistants, and
   cell phones are helping to expand the reach of these systems.
   Conclusions: Effective information systems in developing countries are a
   recent innovation but will need to play an increasing role in supporting
   and monitoring HIV and MDR-TB projects as they scale up from thousands
   to hundreds of thousands of patients. A particular focus should be
   placed on tracking patients from initial diagnosis to initiation of
   effective treatment and then monitoring them for treatment breaks or
   loss to follow-up. More quantitative evaluations need to be performed on
   the impact of electronic information systems on tracking patients.}},

Abstract = {{The Digital Opacity Compliance System (DOCS) is an innovative method
   that uses digital imaging technology to quantify visible opacity of
   stationary sources. DOCS, which has been demonstrated at pilot and full
   scale as a technically defensible and economically attractive
   alternative to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Reference
   Method 9 (Method 9), uses commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) digital
   cameras in combination with a user-friendly computer software package to
   determine opacity. To date, all DOCS field testing has been conducted
   using two models of digital cameras, notably, Kodak Models DC265 and
   DC290, both of which are no longer commercially available. To ensure
   that field-validated digital cameras will be available to future DOCS
   users, a suite of new digital cameras was evaluated with the opacity
   determination software including the following: (1) Sony Model Cybershot
   Model DSC-WI, (2) Nikon Model Coolpix 5200, (3) Fuji Finepix Model E500,
   and (4) Kodak Model DX6490. Within the opacity range of regulatory
   interest, that is, 0-40\%, the Sony Cybershot Model DSC-WI and Nikon
   Coolpix Model 5200 digital cameras were found to generate plume
   photographs of which the DOCS opacity analysis yielded results that were
   statistically equivalent to the previously field-validated Kodak Model
   DC290. In contrast, the Fuji Finepix Model E500 generated plume
   photographs of which the DOCS opacity analysis were, on average, 2.2\%
   less than those generated by the Kodak Model DC290 photographs, a
   difference that was determined to be statistically significant. Over the
   same opacity range, photographs taken by the Kodak Model DX6490 yielded
   DOCS opacity readings that were found to be statistically equivalent to
   a Method 9-certified transmissometer. Based on the results from the
   current digital camera validation testing approach, EPA has developed a
   new camera-based visible opacity measurement method titled
   ``Determination of Visible Emission Opacity from Stationary Sources
   Using Computer-Based Photographic Analysis Systems.{''} The proposed
   method is expected to be promulgated after closure of the public comment
   period.}},

   technology tools designed to support the management of school teachers'
   professional knowledge. Framed by drawing on experience of teacher
   education in England, the paper is structured around a consideration of
   what is meant by teachers' professional knowledge and issues in
   technology-mediated professional development. Two evaluative case
   studies of ICT-mediated knowledge management for teacher development
   purposes are presented. First, an evaluation of a curriculum development
   project in initial teacher education in several European countries;
   second, a project to develop more experienced teachers' skills in the
   teaching of aspects of enquiry-based science in UK secondary schools.
   Implications of innovative approaches to the management of teachers'

Abstract = {{We present two critical innovations that enable a unique, purely
   electronic approach to microfluidic whole-cell analysis, focusing on the
   problem of cell identification and sorting. We used fully-scalable
   lithographic techniques to microfabricate digital barcodes, providing a
   means for low-cost, large volume production. We have demonstrated
   molecular functionalization of the barcodes, using biotin-streptavidin,
   as well as human CD4 antibody, and we have successfully linked the
   barcodes to polystyrene beads using the biotin-streptavidin complex.
   This functionalization allows unique barcodes to be attached to specific
   cell types, based on phenotype. We have also implemented an electronic
   barcode readout scheme, using a radio frequency microsensor integrated
   in an elastomeric microfluidic channel, that can read individual
   barcodes at rates in excess of 1000 labels s(-1). The barcodes are
   biologically compatible, and coupled with the electronic sensing
   technology, provide a route to compact, inexpensive, disposable cell
   identification, sorting and purification.}},

Abstract = {{During the last few years, the number of historical and archaeological
   items recorded using innovative, three dimensional surveying
   technologies has increased considerably. Comprehensive digital,
   photo-realistic 3D recording and modelling yields a huge range of new
   possibilities for documenting, analysing and safeguarding items of
   cultural importance. ArcTron GmbH has specialised in electronic
   surveying and the development of CAD and database information systems
   for heritage and archaeology for over 12 years employing total stations,
   laser pantographs and photogrammetry, as well as a variety of laser
   scanning systems, to generate 3D recordings. Innovative complementary
   combinations of these technologies allow their respective strengths to
   be fully exploited. The data resulting from recording techniques of
   these kinds can be used as a basis for producing docum entation of
   outstanding quality. 3D digital models with photo-realistic texturing,
   orthophotos, coloured point clouds, 3D damage mapping, rapid prototyping
   models and multi-media presentations are just some of the potential
   resulting forms of documentation. Historical monuments and items ranging
   from huge sections of terrain down to the smallest artefact can be
   reproduced with such accuracy and to such a high level of realism that
   documentation of this kind is not only extremely useful for
   archaeologists, conservators and architectural historians etc. but
   practically indispensable.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to present the schematic for building a
   multimedia information visualization system and digital archive which
   takes advantage of a wider spectrum of media elements (images, sound,
   datasets) and interactivity with regards to research level historical
   body of knowledge.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodology for this interactive
   multimedia visualized system was based on create a digital environment
   to explore larger bodies of research that expand on simple text-based
   Information Retrieval Database systems. Through photos, videos,
   interactive maps, digital audio interviews, primary documents and
   narrative structures the system presents new methodologies for building
   digital libraries. The ``educational{''} objective of this project was
   to present a stylistically elegant yet intellectually robust interactive
   multimedia information system for academic libraries.
   Findings - Building new online digital libraries must involve robust
   interactivity to take advantage of the computer's intrinsic specificity
   and the wider set of choices open to the human perceptual apparatus.
   Instead of text-based navigation systems, a more creative set of visual
   ``tools{''} should be explored for digital libraries including
   interactivity and cognitive cartographies. Key here are the terms
   ``visual metaphor{''} and innovatively structuring visually intuitive
   ``narratives{''} into non-linear dynamic but humanly usable information
   systems.
   Research limitations/implications - In expanding the range of
   ``allowable{''} ``historical archival media{''} (audio, video, images,
   datasets, databases) in digital libraries and keeping research level
   academic integrity, future questions regard what this means for
   historiography, information construction, and questions surrounding
   epistemology and ``archives{''} of the future.
   Practical implications - Technically, the successes in building this
   digital library information system solve the question of how to present
   a large robust amount of information indifferent rich media formats in
   an interesting and engaging manner. The project points to methodologies
   to present a research spectrum depth structure of textual material that
   can seamlessly be incorporated through wider spectrum of media elements:
   images, video, audio, music, datasets and interactivity.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a methodology for marrying a
   textual body of academic research with a wider spectrum of media
   elements (sound, images, datasets, music) and incorporating them into a
   digital library through an innovative methodology. It will be valuable
   to anyone needing guidelines and specific algorithmic recipes and
   suggestions for building new millennia digital libraries which take
   advantage of a wider spectrum of media elements.}},

Abstract = {{Ornamental stone products are commercially classified on the market
   according to several factors related both to intrinsic lythologic
   characteristics and to their visible pictorial attributes. Sometimes
   these latter aspects prevail in quality criteria definition and
   assessment. Pictorial attributes are in any case also influenced by the
   performed working actions and the utilized tools selected to realize the
   final stone manufactured product. Stone surface finishing is a critical
   task because it can contribute to enhance certain aesthetic features of
   the stone itself. The study was addressed to develop an innovative set
   of methodologies and techniques able to quantify the aesthetic quality
   level of stone products taking into account both the physical and the
   aesthetical characteristics of the stones. In particular, the degree of
   polishing of the stone surfaces and the presence of defects have been
   evaluated, applying digital image processing strategies. Morphological
   and color parameters have been extracted developing specific software
   architectures. Results showed as the proposed approaches allow to
   quantify the degree of polishing and to identify surface defects related
   to the intrinsic characteristics of the stone and/or the performed
   working actions.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the possibilities to use polychromatic X-rays sources to
   study wood properties that usually require of monochromatic radiation.
   Three applications using X-ray tubes without monochromator together with
   high-resolution energy-sensitive X-rays detectors are presented. In a
   first experiment, a standard X-ray source and a spectrometric detector
   were placed on both sides of a wood dryer which operates at 70 degrees C
   and 50 degrees C for dry-bulb and wet-bulb respectively. Digital
   cartography obtained can offer the possibility to identify some
   phenomenological parameters of fluid migration in wood. In a second
   part, an innovative device designed and made by the authors to record
   X-ray scatter intensities is presented. The feasibility to use the ratio
   of diffraction to attenuation for moisture content determination is
   discussed. This device has been also used for microfibril angle
   determination by recording and analyzing the X-ray scattered intensities
   of cellulose (002) lattice. The microfibril angle determination was
   successful; however, a background of X-rays scattering from amorphous
   component of wood prevented the determination of moisture content.}},

Abstract = {{Technological developments combine previously distinct technologies that
   result in converging markets. In converging markets, firms from
   different industries compete against each other, often for the first
   time. We propose that firms introducing new products in converging
   markets will learn vicariously from other firms in the market. Further,
   we propose that this learning will vary across the dual-technology
   frontier (DTF), where the high-technology frontier (HTF) and
   low-technology frontier (LTF) map onto innovative activities driven by
   technological opportunity and user needs. We propose that at the HTF,
   local search will dominate and firms will be influenced by HTF product
   introductions of similarly sized, successful firms. At the LTF, learning
   will occur across the DTF, vary by origin industry of the firm, and be
   affected by complementarities in routines and capabilities and market
   competition among firms. We test the proposed model of vicarious
   learning using panel data on new product introductions of 67 firms in
   the U.S. digital camera market in the 1990s. Findings generally support
   our proposed model of vicarious learning in this market. They show
   heterogeneity in vicarious learning across the technology frontier and
   firm characteristics-including the origin industry of target firms. Our
   results show that vicarious learning in new product introductions in
   converging markets-which includes both mimetic and nonmimetic
   learning-is similar in some ways, but different from more traditional
   markets. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our
   findings for theories of organizational learning, new product
   development, and converging markets.}},

Abstract = {{A concept for Scientific Knowledge Systematization is presented,
   existing of three components: knowledge development, value adding and
   knowledge management.
   To put this concept in practice, a software framework architecture and
   supporting tools is developed to facilitate efficient knowledge
   integration and an improvement and acceleration of the development of
   specific model applications. Within Wageningen University and Research
   Centre (WUR) this is supported by Wageningen Systems.
   Wageningen Systems is a research program of Wageningen UR and based on
   the assumption that knowledge is not only based in the heads of
   employees and text books, but also in models and databases. The use of
   this digital knowledge is strongly influenced by the way this knowledge
   base is built up, distributed and equipped with tools for interactive
   exchange of this knowledge. It is the strategy and philosophy of
   Wageningen UR that innovative knowledge is best developed by both
   deepening (fundamental) research and broadening (applied) research,
   referred to as an integrated approach. A knowledge system is necessary
   to stimulate and facilitate such an integrated approach in environmental
   sciences.
   The international context that Wageningen UR works in, requires a
   prominent role in the development of ontology in the field of what we
   call the ``green/blue environment{''}. See:
   http://www.wur.nl/UK/research/research+themes/
   The Wageningen Systems expertise in the field of software frameworks,
   interactive tools and semantic interoperability has made a clear
   contribution to the strong position of Wageningen UR in international
   integrated assessment studies. Also within Wageningen, Wageningen
   Systems has pushed the exchange of information and the co-production of
   knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Digital light processing (DLP) is an innovative display technology that
   uses an optical switch array, known as a digital micromirror device
   (DMD), which allows digital control of light. To date, DMDs have been
   used primarily as high-speed spatial light modulators for projector
   applications. A tablet PC is a notebook or slate-shaped mobile PC. Its
   touch screen or digitizing tablet technology allows the user to operate
   the notebook with a stylus or digital pen instead of using a keyboard or
   mouse. In this paper, we describe an interface solution that translates
   any sketch on the tablet PC screen to an identical mirror-copy over the
   cross-section of the DMD micromirrors such that the image of the sketch
   can be projected onto a special screen. An algorithm has been created to
   control each single micromirror of the hundreds of thousands of
   micromirrors that cover the DMD surface. We demonstrate the successful
   application of a DMD to a highspeed two-dimensional (2D) scanning
   environment, acquiring the data from the tablet screen and launching its
   contents to the projection screen; with very high accuracy up to 13.68
   mu m x 13.68 mu m of mirror pitch.}},

Abstract = {{The recent developments in the field of embedded systems gave birth to
   mobile devices with significant computation power and long battery life.
   However, there are still a limited number of video applications for such
   platforms. Due to high computational requirements of video processing
   algorithms, an intensive assembler optimization or even hardware design
   is required to meet the resource constraints of the mobile platforms.
   One example of such challenging video processing problems is a problem
   of video denoising.
   In this paper, we present a software implementation of a
   state-of-the-art video denoising algorithm on a mobile computation
   platform. The algorithm is based on the three-dimensional discrete
   cosine transform (3D DCT) and block-matching. Apart from its
   architectural simplicity, this algorithm allows the computational
   scalability. In addition, the main components of this algorithm are
   8-point DCT and block matching procedure which can be efficiently
   computed by using hardware acceleration units of the modem digital
   signal processor.
   Our target platform is the OMAP Innovator development kit, a dual
   processor environment including ARM 925 RISC general purpose processor
   (GPP) and TMS320C55x digital signal processor (DSP). The C55x DSP offers
   a hardware acceleration support to implement DCTs and block-matching
   algorithms. Hardware acceleration can offer a significant speed-up in
   comparison to assembler optimization of the source codes. The results
   demonstrate a possibility to implement an efficient video denoising
   algorithm on a mobile computational platform with limited computational
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{In the IPTV systems, multicasting will play a crucial role in the
   delivery of high-quality video services, which can significantly improve
   bandwidth efficiency. However, the scalability and the signal quality of
   current IPTV can barely compete with the existing broadcast digital TV
   systems since it is difficult to implement large-scale multicasting with
   end-to-end guaranteed quality of service (QoS) in packet-switched IP
   network. China 3TNet project aimed to build a high performance broadband
   trial network to support large-scale concurrent streaming media and
   interactive multimedia services. The innovative idea of 3TNet is that an
   automatic switched optical networks (ASON) with the capability of
   dynamic point-to-multipoint (P2MP) connections replaces the conventional
   IP multicasting network in the transport core, while the edge remains an
   IP multicasting network. In this paper, we will introduce the network
   architecture and discuss challenges in such IP over Optical multicasting

Abstract = {{Digital imaging techniques have been applied to fine art and cultural
   heritage for decades. Due to continuing advances in technology and
   increases in funding, the application of digital imaging and digital
   reproduction to fine art and cultural heritage has recently exploded. To
   simplify the discussion of digital fine art, this paper will sub-divide
   digital imaging into five segments: digital image capture; archiving;
   conservation; restoration; and reproduction. The Hewlett-Packard
   Company, Cultural Heritage Imaging and the Rochester Institute of
   Technology have, each been major participants in this digital imaging
   explosion. The author is familiar with many of the activities of these
   three institutions. Taken together, their activities form a storyboard
   of where digital fine art maybe headed. By way of example, the results
   of specific projects will be discussed. Advances in digital image
   capture include hyperspectral imaging and reflection transformation
   imaging and their use at the Worcester Art Museum. A striking innovation
   in archiving and conservation is demonstrated by the Kyoto International
   Culture Foundation shrine art conservation project. The rejuvenation
   simulation of a Seurat painting and the physical restoration of the
   vault at the Santos Juanes Church demonstrate amazing progress in the
   field of digital restoration. Finally, the Grand Tour in London is a
   great illustration of how digital fine art reproduction can involve the
   public in their cultural heritage. A widespread bibliography is
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{With the introduction of the original 6-color Photosmart Photo Printer
   in 1997, HP took inkjet image quality to new heights and ushered in a
   new era in home photo printing. The addition of light dye-load cyan and
   light dye-load magenta inks increased smoothness and reduced grain,
   resulting in photo quality prints that rivaled or surpassed that of
   traditional silver halide prints. A decade later, HP is poised to do the
   same to the digital publishing world with its recently introduced HP
   Indigo Light Cyan and Light Magenta inks for the HP Indigo press 5500.
   In this paper, we reflect back on the innovations that Hewlett-Packard
   has brought to the field of photo quality inkjet printing over the past
   10 years, and how we are leveraging many of these innovations into the
   realm of digital publishing.
   As a case study, we describe the process of creating a high quality
   photo book, a Joel Meyerowitz catalogue of vintage color prints, which
   was produced for the photographer's exhibit at the Edwynn Houk Gallery
   in New York in April to June 2006. In this instance, a 7-color HP Indigo
   press 5000, equipped with standard process CMYK inks plus light cyan,
   light magenta, and Pantone Cool Gray 9C was used. All text was printed
   using the gray ink, while images were reproduced using 7-color process
   CMYKcmg on the front and back covers, and 6-color process CMYKcm inside.}},

Abstract = {{For the banknote industry, the advent of and rapid advances in digital
   printing technology present both an opportunity and a threat. On the one
   hand, digital pre-press techniques are revolutionizing the speed with
   which banknote designs can be originated, as well as broadening the
   range of security features that can be generated and the quality of
   these. Digital printing is also ideally suited for banknote
   serialization as an alternative to traditional letterpress printing,
   although banknote producers are yet to embrace it in production. On the
   other hand, a combination of the falling prices in digital printing
   technology and advances in the quality and capabilities of these is
   lowering the bar to counterfeiting, and making the tools for the
   production of fake currency available to a much wider pool of potential
   counterfeiters. In other words, counterfeiting is moving beyond the
   traditional, skilled criminals and is now within the reach of the
   everyday opportunists presenting a potential explosion in fake currency.
   In their battle to stay one step ahead of the counterfeiters, banknotes
   issuers and producers are engaged in a constant process of innovation
   and renewal involving the reduction in the lifecycle of banknote designs
   and the development of ever-more complex intrinsic and extrinsic
   security features - at the same time as ensuring quality and durability
   of notes and their acceptability to the public. This presentation will
   cover the principles of banknote production and the main producers,
   worldwide demand, rates and methods of counterfeiting (including an
   analysis of the growth of digital counterfeiting) and some of the latest
   features and development to maintain the integrity of banknotes,
   particularly against the threat posed by digital reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are hoped as the most
   promising advanced medicine of 21st century. Both are the most promising
   and reasonable approaches to save patients with organ failure, instead
   of transplantation. To date, simple and thin tissues have been
   successfully engineered such as skin and cartilage, however, a number of
   challenges are needed in engineering other thicker, larger and more
   complicated tissues and finally available organs. Biological tissues are
   composed of several types of cells and biomaterials, and have 3D
   architectures with micro-scaled resolution and macro-scaled mass. To
   engineer such tissues, printing technologies are promising, because the
   printer must print pictures on macro-scaled papers simultaneously with
   micro-scaled resolution. Then, we have developed 2D to 3D biofabrication
   using inkjet and hydrogel. 3D bioprinter has been developed using inkjet
   by our selves and several structures with hydrogel and living cells were
   fabricated. In this presentation, we introduce our progress of the
   research and development using inkjet technology. Digital fabrication
   including inkjet will provide promising and innovative approaches for
   sophisticated tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{This is an introductory paper of a recent EC project dealing with
   research in cultural heritage and aiming to communicate new fields of
   application for optical metrology techniques. The project is in its
   initial state and more conclusive information is expected to be
   available at the time of the perspective conference. Nowadays safety,
   ethical, economical and security issues as well as the increase demand
   for loaning of art objects for exhibitions in transit, are forcing the
   Conservation Community to undertake strong initiatives and actions
   against various types of mistreatment, damage or fraud, during
   transportation of movable Cultural Heritage. Therefore the interest
   directs to the development of innovative methodologies and
   instrumentation to respond to critical aspects of increased importance
   in cultural heritage preservation, among which of prior consideration
   are: to secure proper treatment, assess probable damage, fight fraud
   actions in transportation.
   The MULTIENCODE aims to create a new standard way of monitoring the
   condition of artworks by using the latest holographic technology. It
   will produce innovative methods and tools which will allow conservators
   to assess the conservation state of an object and the need for any
   treatment; illustrate any new damage; monitor the impact of transport;
   and confirm a piece's originality. An object would undergo transient
   alterations to extract its distinct holographically encoded patterns
   before being digitally classified and archived. The coded data can then
   be easily retrieved to be compared with past and any future entries to
   assess changes to the object.
   It is thus proposed in this project the development of a novel Impact
   Assessment Procedure (IAP) based on interference-signal direct encoding
   nature by exploiting and further providing to the conservation community
   the holographic technology advances and innovative tools for a highly
   secure encoding-decoding system of objects' features required in many
   critical aspects for sustainable preservation of movable artworks.
   It may apply in many functional and strategic decision-makings in
   museums operation, from routine seasonal examination of conservation
   state, to periodic assessment of conservation treatments and materials
   compatibility, to deterioration control and definition of early-induced
   damage, to continuous monitoring of transportation impact, to direct
   confirmation of originality and control of maintenance for any art
   object in transit, etc.
   The effective proposed method relies on the original coded extraction of
   distinct features from the artwork under conservation, transportation
   and loan that characterizes the state of conservation of the artwork and
   its originality. The coding and decoding of such characteristic features
   can be performed holographically before and after have been optically
   and numerically transformed for digital archiving. The object features
   or the archived coded data forming the ``signature{''} of the object can
   be recollected and compared through repeatable IAP at any later time to
   provide indication of induced alterations. The project advances the
   state of the art elaborating in synergy with existing methods and
   practices and concludes with specific novel instrumentation and
   standards for universal application and worldwide exploitation.
   The proposed method advances the state of the art elaborating in synergy
   with existing methods and practices and concludes with specific novel
   instrumentation and standards for universal application and worldwide
   exploitation. It would enable Lis to make further progress on our
   previous research into the deterioration of objects through handling,
   transport and environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recently digital items have been widely used by people in the online
   space including virtual communities and online games. Some Internet
   companies even in the context of virtual community (VC) generate revenue
   from the sales of digital items to their online members. The sales of
   digital items provide insights for Internet companies and virtual
   community providers who are suffering from the lack of a profitable
   business model. This study examines why people pay for digital items
   from the self-presentation perspective in the context of VC by
   introducing a new construct, digital identity, and developing a
   conceptual framework of presentation of digital identity. The findings
   of this study show that the presentation desire of digital identity
   leads to the intention of purchasing digital items. This study
   identifies the significance of online group norm and online group
   involvement on the presentation desire from the social digital identity
   perspective and the significance of personal innovativeness from the
   personal digital identity perspective. These findings help to advance
   theory and offer practical insights in the context of Internet business

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to present the digital library Galician
   virtual library (BVG, for ``Biblioteca Virtual Ga ega{''}) in Galician.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper shows the objectives pursued by
   the BVG, its development, putting special emphasis on the main
   technological challenges, and presents some data about its usage.
   Findings - A digital library can be used to stimulate a lesser-used
   language and to promote the culture and tourism of a region.
   Originality/value - The paper shows how a digital library can be used to
   strengthen the Galician language, which is currently categorised as a
   ``Lesser Used Language{''} in the European Community and to contribute
   to the preservation and spreading of Galician culture and literary
   works, either from current authors or from previous documents. It also
   provides a digital publishing house for new authors and opens a
   communication channel between current authors and their readers.
   Finally, it helps to connect a scattered community like the Galician,
   offering a centralised access point to any information about Galicia.
   This work also presents some technological innovations included in the
   BVG, especially from the viewpoint of user interface design and search
   by content.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, great effort has been devoted to waveguide lasers, because of
   their inherent simplicity with respect to fiber lasers. Actually, due to
   their compactness, such lasers are expected to achieve a higher temporal
   coherence, making them attracting for fiber optical reflectometry,
   distribute sensing, and range finding applications. Furthermore, the
   availablity of fast saturable absorbers based on carbon nanotubes allows
   for a cheap and reliable implementation of the passive mode-locking
   technique with the potential for generating high repetition rate pulse
   trains. Such lasers will provide low-noise and inexpensive pulsed
   sources for applications in optical communications, optically sampled
   analog-to-digital converters, and spectral line-by-line pulse shaping.
   We report here on advanced waveguide lasers, operating both in
   continuous wave and pulsed regimes, based on active waveguides
   fabricated by femtosecond laser writing in a phosphate glass substrate.
   A single longitudinal mode waveguide laser providing more than 50 mW
   with 21\% slope efficiency was demonstrated. Furthermore, by combining a
   high gain waveguide and an innovated fiber-pigtailed saturable absorber
   based on carbon nanotubes, a mode-locked ring laser providing transform
   limited 1.6-ps pulses was also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (SHWS) recently has been extensively
   researched for optical surface metrology due to its extendable dynamic
   range compared with the interferometry technique. In our institute, we
   have developed a digital SHWS by adopting a programmable Spatial Light
   Modulator (SLM) to function as a microlens array and replace the
   physical one in the traditional configuration of this sensing system. In
   this paper, we proposed to use the developed system for the relative
   measurement of toroidal surfaces, which are widely used in many optical
   systems due to their unique optical features of different curvatures in
   X and Y directions. An innovative idea to design the diffractive
   microlens array implemented by SLM was presented to tackle the
   measurement challenge. This unconventional design approach has a great
   advantage to provide different optical powers in X and Y directions so
   that focusing spots can be formed and captured on the detector plane for
   accurate centroid finding and precise wavefront evaluation for 3D shape
   reconstruction of the toroidal surface. A digital Shack-Hartmann
   Wavefront Sensing system with this unique microlens array was built to
   verify the design concept, and the experimental results were presented
   and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative instrument for fast and accurate surface profiling of
   three dimensional patterned microstructures and in-situ plasma etching
   depth control is proposed. Several advantages of the design make it
   promising for in-situ metrology. First, the system constitutes a
   common-path interferometer with the spatial phase shift between the
   reference and the object beams, thus the vibration and improper
   positioning of an object have a minor impact on the system performance.
   Second, no mechanical translation of either object or sensor is
   required; instead, a digital micromirror array is used for scanning the
   surface. It results in a higher processing rate, better measuring
   reproducibility, and easy adaptation of the method to specifics of the
   fabrication technology or object under test. Third, recording a full
   fringe for a particular pair of object's pixels is done within a single
   frame of a CCD camera. Also, multiple fringes for the whole line of
   object pixels can be captured at once. Then only 1-D scan is required to
   recover the depth profile of a 2-D object area. The experimental setup
   has been constructed to verify major principles of the method and
   measurement of test samples have been realized and compared to
   alternative measuring methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the ways that innovative applications of digital
   technologies are being developed in Manchester (in the North West of
   England) and in the UK's largest urban regeneration area, East
   Manchester, with the aim of tackling the `' digital divide,'' reengaging
   citizens in civic life, and transfiorming the delivery of public
   services in the context Of urban regeneration. The paper suggests that
   sustainable regeneration requires a much more holistic approach to urban
   development than has been the case in previous strategies and policies
   and can benefit from using digital technologies. In order to turn the
   digital divide into a `' digital dividend,'' more emphasis needs to be
   placed on citizen engagement, empowerment and capacity building. This
   case study aims to provide examples of how a multi-agency partnership
   approach is working to tackle these challenges through the `'
   ONE-Manchester `' initiative (Open Network E-Manchester).}},

Abstract = {{Recently digital items (e.g., avatars) have been widely used by people
   in virtual communities (VC) and online games. Some Internet companies
   generate revenue from sales of digital items to their customers. Sales
   of digital items provide revenue for Internet companies and VC providers
   who are suffering from lack of a profitable business model. However
   there is a lack of understanding about people's digital item purchase
   and usage. This study examines why people pay for digital items from the
   self-presentation perspective, by focusing on online identity, based on
   social identity theory. The findings show that the presentation desire
   of online identity leads to intention of purchasing digital items. The
   results show the significance of online group norm and online group
   involvement in enhancing the presentation desire from the online social
   identity perspective. This study also identifies the significance of
   interaction effects between personal innovativeness and online group
   involvement in enhancing the presentation desire from the online
   personal perspective. These findings help to advance theory and offer
   practical insights in the context of Internet business and VC.}},

Abstract = {{Personal experience computing is an emerging research area in computing
   support for capturing, archiving, and editing. This paper presents our
   design, implementation, and evaluation of a mobile authoring tool called
   mProducer that enables everyday users to effectively and efficiently
   perform archiving and editing at or immediately after the
   point-of-capture of digital personal experiences from their
   camera-equipped mobile devices. This point-of-capture capability is
   crucial to enable immediate sharing of digital personal experiences
   anytime, anywhere. For example, we have seen everyday people who used
   handheld camcorders to capture and report their personal, eye-witnessed
   experiences during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in New York
   (The September I I Digital Archive. http://www.911digitalarchive.org/).
   With mProducer, they would be able to perform editing immediately after
   the point of capture, and then share these newsworthy, time-sensitive
   digital experiences on the Internet. To address the challenges in both
   user interface constraints and limited system resources on a mobile
   device, mProducer provides the following innovative system techniques
   and UI designs. (1) Keyframe-based editing UI enables everyday users to
   easily and efficiently edit recorded digital experiences from a mobile
   device using only key frames with the storyboard metaphor. (2) Storage
   constrained uploading (SCU) algorithm archives continuous multimedia
   data by uploading them to remote storage servers at the point of
   capture, so that it alleviates the problem of limited storage on a
   mobile device. (3) Sensor-assisted automated editing uses data from a
   GPS receiver and a tilt sensor attached to a mobile device to facilitate
   two manual editing steps at the point of capture: removal of blurry
   frames from hand-induced camera shaking, and content search via
   location-based content management. We have conducted user studies to
   evaluate mProducer. Results from the user studies have shown that
   mProducer scores high in user satisfaction in editing experience,
   editing quality, task performance time, ease of use, and ease of
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{While information technology is a basic and necessary component to any
   research and development project leading to innovation, knowledge
   derived from information is crucial to accelerating radical innovation.
   Information has become more readily available to researchers in the past
   decade, with much of this information residing in digital libraries,
   patent databases, and even on the World Wide Web. However, much of this
   information is not easily retrievable. As the amount of information has
   grown throughout the past decade, finding specific information has
   become nearly impossible. Search engines are not adequate for finding
   critical knowledge for innovation in this vast sea of information. On
   the other hand, information must be rapidly retrieved and processed into
   knowledge in order to accelerate radical innovation. This paper
   describes a novel accelerated radical innovation methodology for
   accelerating breakthrough innovation from inception through
   commercialization, and then describes the required capabilities of a
   triad of necessary IT technologies that must be integrated with the new
   methodology if radical innovation is to be accelerated by the envisioned
   2-10 times beyond current innovation time horizons. This IT triad
   includes integrated tools for information retrieval, pattern
   recognition, and knowledge management which must interact and cooperate.}},

Abstract = {{R\&D and innovation are important activities in firms. During these
   activities, spillover and diffusion of knowledge are generated.
   Especially in this era of information and the Internet, the speed of
   knowledge flow is faster, the costs are lower and the paths are more
   diverse. In the past year, most of the studies about spillover or
   knowledge flow were focused on one industry or one industrial park
   because the cross industries' knowledge flow was limited. That is,
   researchers discussed knowledge flow between firms within one specific
   industry. Since Internet technology began sweeping the world, the
   conception and boundaries of industry blurred. The phenomenon was called
   digital convergence. This mean that some technologies and knowledge can
   be applied to different industries or the firms of different industries
   can enter the same markets and become competitors. Therefore, this paper
   will discuss the knowledge flow of different industries. Among many
   indicators of measuring spillover and knowledge flow, patent citation is
   a mature and objective indicator. This paper is positioned in the field
   of business methods technology, and draws upon the largest patent
   database in the world - USPTO as its source of information. The purposes
   of this paper are: 1. to examine the knowledge flow of business methods
   that have any significant difference between and within different
   industries; 2. to detect the direction of knowledge flow between the
   different industries; and 3. to propose some suggestions of knowledge
   flow in the field of business methods technology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore the merging of supply chains between media and
   telecommunications as an example of business application of industry
   convergence. The goal of this study is to provide managerial insight
   into the various facets of convergence of supply chains so that
   companies can effectively exploit business opportunities presented by
   the accelerating process of digital convergence and related
   technological innovations. In this study, the focus is set on business
   models, rather than business strategies as such, since digital
   convergence is an emerging sector that deserves independent attention as
   a new business concept. We formulated a series of propositions, related
   to customer value, value network, and supply chain efficiency, using
   frameworks borrowed from the existing business model literature and
   value creation theories for internet business. Managerial implications
   are discussed and applied to DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting), a
   new telecom-broadcasting convergence business model, recently introduced
   in South Korea.}},

Abstract = {{This report explores students' naive conceptions of infinity as they
   compared the number of points on line segments of different lengths.
   Their innovative (albeit incorrect) resolutions to tensions that arose
   between intuitions and properties of infinity are addressed Attempting
   to make sense of such properties, students reduced the level of
   abstraction of tasks by analysing a single number rather than infinitely
   many. In particular, confusion between the infinite magnitude of points
   and the infinite amount of digits in the decimal representation of
   numbers was observed Furthermore, misconceptions in students'
   understanding of real numbers and their representation on a number line
   were exposed.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in digitalization of the terrestrial television signal emission
   have already become commercially available in many European countries
   based on the introduction of the digital video broadcasting -
   terrestrial (DVB-T) standard. As the DVB-T system is not completely
   suitable for mobile signal reception, a new digital video broadcasting -
   handheld (DVB-H) system with a number of innovations, intended for
   mobile signal reception by small, pocketsize receivers has been designed
   The signals received on movement are influenced by the frequency Doppler
   shift, related to the rate of receiver movement and relative angle
   between the movement direction and signal direction. In this paper the
   impact of Doppler shift on mobile communication reception and technology
   to its reduction in DVB-H system are presented.}},

   it can be said that auto-ID technologies are core components of
   automated inventory control systems on all echelons of supply chain. As
   being a novel sub-component of auto-ID, RFID innovates important
   features. Due to the fact that RFID is a recently developed technology,
   there exist some deficiencies, like the lack of standardization and the
   lack of legislation regulations that cause questions about privacy and
   security in society. In this study. we reviewed the standardization
   studies of related organizations like EPCglobal and ISO and compare
   these regulations. We also classify the risks that threaten the privacy
   of individuals and organizations. Finally, regarding the standardization
   studies and existing risks towards the privacy of individuals and
   organizations. security proposals and policy suggestions are introduced.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging of mobile games invites many researchers from all around
   the world to continue the studies related to this field. As in many
   countries especially Japan and Korea, mobile game is getting more
   attention from digital gamers as one of the most preferable type of
   digital games. One good reason that contributes to the success of mobile
   game is because of its mobility, which means gamers can play games at
   anytime and anywhere they wish for. In this paper, we examine the usage
   of mobile game compared to other type of digital game such as console or
   arcade game in Malaysia. We also perform a series of analysis regarding
   to student preferences in every situation before a paradigm shifts from
   console or arcade game to mobile game. A survey on user preferences
   among students of Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) has been done to
   gather useful information and relevant data to support this paper. The
   survey showed that an overwhelming majority (60\%) of the respondents
   prefer to play game in mobile phone. The questionnaire survey is part of
   an ongoing research study titled Mobile-Based Based Mental Skill Game
   Technology for Programming Course sponsored by Ministry of Science,
   Technology and Innovation (MOSTI). The data that have been gathered from
   the survey were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science
   (SPSS), Release 13.0.0, to investigate the number and percentage of
   students that use mobile game.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an innovative concept of a virtual testing
   environment for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) applying a suitable
   conjunction of two performance extraction algorithms - the Servo-Loop
   and Histogram method. The testing engine proposed is implemented in
   MAPLE and consists of program procedures to extract ADC errors expressed
   in term of integral and differential non-linearity (INL and DNL). The
   novelty of our solution is the use of effective search algorithm and
   improved convergence properties resulting in a significant reduction of
   the simulation time. Another advantage of the proposed approach is the
   fact that the implementation in MAPLE creates an ideal opportunity to
   build a complex environment comprising the virtual testing engine as
   well as circuit-level ADC models. Simulation results are shown,
   demonstrating the output of the ADC testing procedures using both the
   Servo-Loop and Histogram method.}},

Abstract = {{The Open Source Software (OSS) development model is arousing increasing
   interest from both practitioners and theorists. OSS models are congenial
   for both private companies and public administrations since they provide
   software users and suppliers with highly responsive and innovative
   development models which are likely to reduce costs and to provide
   additional autonomy within critical technological domains. OSS are
   characterized by the distribution of source code to any developer
   interested in contributing to the provision of the code. License terms
   allow a developer to make unlimited copies of the source code which can
   be modified indefinitely by developers to fulfil particular needs. Each
   developer is then free to distribute her work and exploit it
   commercially depending on license terms. The U.S. Department of Defense
   (DoD) is currently introducing Open Source Software (OSS) development
   models through its Open Technology Development (OTD) project (Herz et
   al. 2006). OSS adoption is becoming popular for military purposes.
   Indeed, the digital transformation of the U.S. military has generated a
   strong need for new modes of software management. In this context, the
   OTD project tends to set up an innovative model for software
   acquisition, maintenance, updating, and renewing. Focusing on the
   adoption of Military Open Source Software (MOSS) models by the U.S.
   Department of Defense (DoD), this article suggests that the open nature
   of OSS development platforms induces significant organizational changes
   related to the acquisition, transformation and creation of a variety of
   OSS core capabilities. Furthermore, we suggest that the U.S. military
   organizations should perceive modularity in software architecture as a
   means to establish effective modes of knowledge management and
   innovation. Building on the distinction between architectural and
   component knowledge, we find that modular source code structuring
   facilitates the division, distribution and coordination of both
   architectural knowledge and component knowledge within heterogeneous OSS
   developers' communities.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, Taiwan government put it this way -- if there is not
   improvement to national competitive advantage, then, there is no
   advantage. There is a need to expand the performance of studying in
   order to build national power and improve the well-being of our people.
   Several initiatives have been adopted to enhance the scientific and
   technological strength of the country. This year, national authority
   focused on ``innovative science, technology research and
   development{''}, a new lease of life was given to encourage the economy
   growth. At the 7th national scientific and technical meeting, leaders
   drafted 6 tactics designed to guide the first stage of the national
   scientific and technical development plan (the 94-97th year of R.O.C.).
   Aviation technology education was the focus of the transnational
   d-leaming course. It was designed for students to study and do research
   between countries over the Internet. Part of the research was to develop
   a clearinghouse for existing and newly developed aviation education
   materials, strategies, methods, etc. If our country follows this model,
   it should become a leader for the input and application of new
   scientific and technological knowledge used to: educate and train future
   manpower, improve scientific knowledge, create technological
   innovations, and digitize scientific and technological education
   materials in an organized fashion to benefit a Hi-Tech country.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the significance of specific concepts in the diffusion of
   scientific knowledge is a challenging issue concerning many theoretical
   and practical areas. We introduce an innovative visual analytic approach
   to integrate microscopic and macroscopic perspectives of a rapidly
   growing scientific knowledge domain. Specifically, our approach focuses
   on statistically unexpected phrases extracted from unstructured text of
   titles and abstracts at the microscopic level in association with the
   magnitude and timeliness of their citation impact at the macroscopic
   level. The H-index, originally defined to measure individual scientists'
   productivity in terms of their citation profiles, is extended in two
   ways: 1) to papers and terms as a means of dividing these items into two
   groups so as to replace the less optimal threshold-based divisions, and
   2) to take into account the timeliness of the impact of knowledge
   diffusion in terms of the timing of citations and publications so that
   attention is particularly drawn towards potentially significant and
   timely papers. The selected terms are connected to higher-level
   performance indicators, such as measures derived from the H-index, in
   the form of decision trees. A top-down traversal of such decision trees
   provides an intuitive walkthrough of concepts and phrases that may
   underline potentially significant but currently still latent scientific
   discoveries. Timeliness measures can also help to identify institutions
   that are at the forefront of a research field. We illustrate how widely
   accessible tools such as Google Earth can be utilized to disseminate
   such insights. The practical significance for digital libraries and
   fostering scientific discoveries is demonstrated through the
   astronomical literature related to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).}},

Abstract = {{Tables are ubiquitous in digital libraries. In scientific documents,
   tables are widely used to present experimental results or statistical
   data in a condensed fashion. However, current search engines do not
   support table search. The difficulty of automatic extracting tables from
   un-tagged documents, the lack of a universal table metadata
   specification, and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make
   table search problem challenging. In this paper, we describe TableSeer,
   a search engine for tables. TableSeer crawls digital libraries, detects
   tables from documents, extracts tables metadata, indexes and ranks
   tables, and provides a user-friendly search interface. We propose an
   extensive set of medium-independent metadata for tables that scientists
   and other users can adopt for representing table information. In
   addition, we devise a novel page box-cutting method to improve the
   performance of the table detection. Given a query, TableSeer ranks the
   matched tables using art innovative ranking algorithm - TableRank.
   TableRank rates each <query, table> pair with a tailored vector space
   model and a specific term weighting scheme. Overall, TableSeer
   eliminates the but-den of manually extract table data from digital
   libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables. We
   demonstrate the value of TableSeer with empirical studies on scientific
   documents.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we propose a new error-correction framework, called CoRe,
   which uses counterexamples, or bug traces, generated in verification to
   automatically correct errors in digital designs. CoRe is powered by two
   innovative resynthesis techniques, Gwi-Directed Search (GDS) and
   Entropy-Guided Search (EGS), which modify the functionality of internal
   circuit's nodes to match the desired specification. We evaluate our
   solution to designs and errors arising during combinational
   equivalence-checking, as well as simulation-based verification of
   digital systems. Compared with previously proposed techniques, CoRe is
   more powerful in that: (1) it can fix a broader range of error types
   because it does not rely on specific error models; (2) it derives the

Abstract = {{Like many geological surveys, the British Geological Survey (BGS)
   constantly reviews the way it deploys its resources to gather and
   interpret field observations taken from geological mapping programmes.
   Recently the BGS have fully digitised map production from capture to
   publication, but more efficiency gains are needed, targeting where
   field-surveying work can be most effectively carried out using GIS and
   visualisation technology for significant operational and business
   improvements. As we develop our information systems capability and
   knowledge, the BGS intend to extend the use of its immersive 3D
   Visualisation Facilities (i3DVF) by integrating existing digital field
   mapping capability into the immersive visualisation facilities, thereby
   allowing teams to investigate field interpretation using extensive and
   varied types of information prior to subsequent field visits. This paper
   introduces the design and development of an innovative new concept and
   resulting application called `GeoVisionary', developed jointly with
   Virtalis Ltd, a technology/enterprise company that specialises in highly
   immersive visualisation system builds.}},

Abstract = {{The term digital video broadcasting (DVB) is today used as a synonym for
   digital television in many countries. Digital Terrestrial Television
   (DTT) is an implementation of digital technology to provide a greater
   number of channels, a better quality of picture and sound through a
   conventional antenna instead of a satellite dish or cable connection.
   Digital television isn't just an innovative signal representation; it
   represents a new multiple-channel data broadcasting that affect not only
   the technology side but also the content itself. Within this framework,
   the T-Learning (Television-Learning) has reached a considerable
   importance in the last years and is emerging as a potentially important
   media to create opportunities for teaming at home.
   The main aim of the paper is to describe a system to provide the use of
   a Learning Management System (LMS) on digital-terrestrial platform,
   respecting the reference standards (SCORM, IMS, AICC, LOM, etc.). This
   innovative system allows users to get learning services at home, using a
   LMS that has to meet a number of requirements, including the integration
   of a multiplicity of contents.}},

   also considered. We employ GA for the optimal localization and intensity

Journal = {{PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{41}},

Pages = {{365-385}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an evaluation of The
   Glasgow Story (TGS) digitisation project, funded by the UK's National
   Lottery's New Opportunities Fund digitisation (NOF-Digi) programme, and
   a critique of the evaluation process itself. The paper emphasises the
   need for user impact evaluation and for results to be brought into the
   public domain in order to substantiate the claimed benefits of
   digitisation projects and programmes and inform ongoing digitisation
   activity. By critiquing the evaluation methods used the paper also hopes
   to contribute to the development of good practice in evaluation
   methodology.
   Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaires, focus groups, data logs,
   online surveys and feedback forms were used to gather user responses and
   make impact assessments.
   Findings - The paper suggests that whilst the evaluation can point to
   some positive impacts that justify the project's innovative approach,
   practical constraints on the evaluation and methodological flaws
   ultimately limit the value of the results. The paper concludes that
   effective evaluation of digitisation needs to extend beyond individual
   projects, or at the very least, employ generic evaluation tools that
   facilitate comparison between different projects and approaches.
   Originality/value - Few digitisation projects attempt to assess their
   impact and fewer still make their results available. As one of the
   larger NOF-Digi projects, the results from the TGS evaluation provide a
   unique window on one of the major digitisation initiatives in recent
   years.}},

   development can be directly predicted, with the finite element formulas

   law is introduced in relation to faults. And in the process, such
   complicated factors as the digital simulated joint and crevasse of soft
   rocks are not neglected. Therefore, the method this paper presents is
   highly valuable in both theory and application.}},

Abstract = {{Product development performance has become a key issue for car
   manufacturers. But innovation seeks to outperform dominant design,
   whereas project development targets well-defined areas (costs, lead
   times, quality, etc.). This article provides an analysis of the extent
   to which innovation is compatible with recent managerial and technical
   methods (project and multi-project management, co-development,
   simulation tools and digital mock-ups, etc.). The analysis is based on a
   recent development project conducted at Renault in which these various
   techniques were used in an attempt to achieve highly ambitious targets
   simultaneously in the areas of lead times, costs and innovation. During
   the course of the project, unexpected design problems revealed failures
   in co-ordination, monitoring procedures and expertise. We argue that
   recent project development methods can induce negative effects on
   collective learning processes and that these effects have managerial
   implications for innovative developments.}},

   Phidel, an innovative software, tackles and works out all the

Abstract = {{Most software-defined radio (SDR) prototypes make use of FPGA (Field
   Programmable Gate Array) devices such as digital filtering that perform
   operations at high sampling rates. The process from specifications and
   design to the implementation in FPGA requires the use of a large number
   of simulation tools. In the first stages of the design, the use of
   high-level tools such as Matlab, are required to perform intensive
   simulations. Results will help us to select the best specifications.
   Once the main design parameters have been established, the overall
   design is divided into modules following a hierarchical scheme. Each
   module is defined using a hardware description language (HDL) such as
   VHDL or Verilog.
   In the process of FPGA development, the design is simulated at multiple
   stages. Initially, each VHDL module is simulated individually by
   creating test benches to simulate the subsystem and observe the results.
   After each individual module has been tested, the complete design is
   integrated and mapped into a nedist which is translated to a gate level
   description. Once the design is laid out in the FPGA, a simulation stage
   takes place considering hardware aspects such as propagation delays.
   Finally, it is very important to perform cosimulations for the final
   hardware verification. Cosimulation consists in applying input signals
   from numerical simulators such as Matlab to hardware components from
   hardware-based simulators such as ModelSim. Only the inputs and outputs
   of the hardware component are analyzed to check the performance.
   In this paper, we discuss the overall simulation process involved in the
   implementation of a FPGA-based modem used in a traffic light control
   system using LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes). The application of LEDs in
   traffic lights has several advantages with respect to incandescent bulbs
   in terms of lower power consumption and a number of functions can be
   implemented: modification of lighting condition depending on climatic
   conditions, change in the crossing time for pedestrians, failure
   detection, generation of alarms, etc. In order to implement these
   applications, the installation of modems in the regulator and traffic
   lights sites is required.
   In our proposal, these modems are implemented in FPGA boards. As an
   additional innovation, the physical transmission medium is formed by the
   powerlines connecting the regulator and traffic lights in a star
   topology. The communication system is based on the EchoNet standard for
   powerline communication. This specification proposes the use of the CDMA
   multiple access scheme, which makes the system very robust against
   impulsive noise interference oftenly found in traffic scenarios.
   We have focused on the design flow, making special emphasis on the
   simulation tools required and the main parameters that must be taken
   into efficient design. In the paper, performance results account to
   perform an obtained by simulation and cosimulation will be presented,
   including parameters of the communication system (BER, frame detection
   probability) and also result from the hardware simulation tool (power
   consumption, delays, use of physical resources).}},

Abstract = {{RISKCURVES is a computer program package that was developed by TNO in
   the late 1980s to facilitate the user to perform a Quantitative Risk
   Assessment (QRA). Recently, the software was upgraded and the
   capabilities have been greatly improved. Innovative concepts like
   multi-level data entry, introducing a 6 step QRA approach, and placing
   the actual event icons on a digital background map were included. Since
   performing a QRA is still considered as `complex' and `time-consuming',
   special attention was paid to the user friendliness of the software by
   minimizing user interaction and using advanced presentation and analysis
   techniques. Based upon the Yellow Book 2005 (PGS 2), and Green Book (PGS
   1), the effect and consequence models included within RISKCURVES provide
   a sound, scientific and transparent basis to perform a QRA. This article
   describes RISKCURVES, showing several examples of the actual
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Now, at the beginning of the third millennium, the world is undertaking
   major social, economical and technological changes - the third
   industrial revolution, connected to the new informational technology.
   More and more frequently, the organizations use computers, computer and
   communication networks in order to develop their business. The
   informational technology (IT) is a central instrument of the new era,
   and the digital revolution is considered a technological innovation,
   which has continued the processes begun by the microelectronics'
   revolution. The essence of the digital revolution can be found within
   the generalization of the ways of information processing - based on the
   binary logics - and also within the development of the different ways of
   handling and delivering this information. The digital revolution can be
   considered - after R. Freeman and L. Soete - as a base for the new
   technological paradigm. Another specialist, J. Rifkin talks about a
   computer revolution, which is the foreplay of much more significant
   changes that take place in the global economy. R Munch considers that
   the communications' development has strongly changed the way the modem
   society works, and A. Toffler affirms that in the new era, the capital
   passes from the tangible form to electronic impulses that symbolize
   tangible.}},

Abstract = {{A multisensing flexible Tag microlab (FTM) with RFID communication
   capabilities and integrated physical and chemical sensors for logistic
   datalogging applications is being developed. For this very specific
   scenario, several constraints must be considered: power consumption must
   be limited for long-term operation, reliable ISO compliant RFID
   communication must be implemented, and special encapsulation issues must
   be faced for reliable sensor integration. In this work, the developments
   on application specific electronic interfaces and on ultra-low-power MOX
   gas sensors in the framework of the GoodFood FP6 Integrated Project will
   be reported.
   The electronics for sensor control and readout as well as for RFID
   communication are based on an ultra-low-power MSP430 microcontroller
   from Texas Instruments together with a custom RFID front-end based on
   analog circuitry and a CPLD digital device, and are designed to
   guarantee a passive ISO15693 compliant RFID communication in a range up
   to 6 cm. A thin film battery for sensor operation is included, allowing
   data acquisition and storage when no reader field is present. This
   design allows the user to access both the traceability and sensor
   information even when the on-board battery is exhausted.
   The physical sensors for light, temperature and humidity are
   commercially available devices, while for chemical gas sensing
   innovative MOX sensors are developed, based on ultra-low-power
   micromachined hotplate arrays specifically designed for flexible Tag
   integration purposes. A single MOX sensor requires only 8.9 mW for
   continuous operation, while temperature modulation and discontinuous
   sensor operation modes are implemented to further reduce the overall
   power consumption.
   The development of the custom control and RFID electronics, together
   with innovative ultra-low-power MOX sensor arrays with flexible circuit
   encapsulation techniques will be reported in this work.}},

Abstract = {{Automated impact detection and characterization on aircraft and
   spacecraft has been an elusive goal due to the transitory nature of the
   detectable high-frequency signals involved. Invocon, Inc. has been
   awarded a NASA Phase 2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program
   to develop self-contained, miniaturized, piezoelectric sensory nodes
   with extremely low-power trigger modes that are synchronized within a
   radio frequency network. Each node will continuously monitor an
   accelerometer, acoustic emission sensor, or PZT element for an impact
   event, such as a micro-meteor impact or the foam impact that caused the
   Columbia tragedy. When a programmable threshold is exceeded, a
   low-latency signal acquisition circuit will capture the event as a
   digital waveform for post-processing and impact characterization
   including amplitude and time-of-arrival analysis. The innovative signal
   conditioning circuit design is capable of operation in the micro-watt
   range oil average while constantly maintaining the capability to acquire
   and process very high frequency acoustic signals. Such performance can
   potentially provide operating lifetimes of 5 years on a single AA
   battery, or unlimited operation from scavenged power sources.
   Additionally, the system will provide a general purpose hardware
   platform on which Integrated Structural Health Monitoring (ISHM)
   algorithms and sensing techniques can be implemented. The same basic
   system design, with configurable sample rates, sensor interfaces,
   actuation outputs, and local processing algorithms, could be used for
   active or passive damage detection, locating leaks from pressurized
   vehicles and habitats through the produced airborne and surface-borne
   ultrasonic energy, or detecting crack propagation or delamination in
   structures through Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques. By allowing the
   development, demonstration, and potentially deployment of these ISHM
   capabilities on miniaturized devices optimized for low-power and
   distributed operation, the goals of ISHM will be more effectively
   achieved for aircraft and spacecraft. This paper shall provide a general
   description of the triggering capabilities, data acquisition circuit
   design, overall system design, and potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray microscopy with synchrotron radiation will be a useful tool for
   innovation of x-ray imaging in clinical and laboratory settings. It
   helps us observe detailed internal structure of material samples
   non-invasively in air.. And, it also has the potential to solve some
   tough problems of conventional breast imaging if it could evaluate
   various conditions of breast tissue effectively. A new hard x-ray
   microscope with a spatial resolution better than 100 nm was installed at
   Pohang Light Source, a third generation synchrotron radiation facility
   in Pohang, Korea. The x-ray energy was set at 6.95 keV, and the x-ray
   beam was monochromatized by W/B4C monochromator. Condenser and objective
   zone plates were used as x-ray lenses. Zernike phase plate next to
   condenser zone plate was introduced for improved contrast imaging. The
   image of a sample was magnified 30 times by objective zone plate and 20
   times by microscope objective, respectively. After additional 10 times
   digital magnification, the total magnifying power was up to 6000 times
   in the end. Phase contrast synchrotron images of 10-mu m-thick female
   breast tissue of the normal, fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change and
   carcinoma cases were obtained. By phase contrast imaging, hard x-rays
   enable us to observe many structures of breast tissue without sample
   preparations such as staining or fixation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Based on analyses of the difficulties encountered during the
   process of integrating technology into instruction and the efforts made
   by researchers to overcome barriers to such integration, we propose that
   the efforts made to date ( e. g., increasing the availability of
   computer equipment and enhancing computer literacy, support, and
   training) are not sufficiently comprehensive to achieve the goals of
   improving teaching efficiency and developing innovative teaching
   methods.
   Objectives: The objective of this research commentary is to highlight
   the importance of the software infrastructure for teachers ( SIT) to
   promoting the integration of information technology into instruction.
   Research Method and Design: A critical synthesis was conducted on the
   literature of using computer technology for learning, teaching, and
   teacher professional development.
   Conclusions: This study points out the features of SIT, the benefits of
   using SIT, and the possible approach to the development of SIT, and
   highlights some problems that have yet to be solved.}},

Abstract = {{In fiscal 2001, Matsushita electric, a traditional Japanese manufacturer
   of general electrical appliances, recorded the largest loss in its
   history. Then, following drastic structural reforms, the company's
   business results experienced a rapid V-shaped recovery. By transforming
   its product development strategy from the old technology-led type to a
   customer-led type and implementing far-reaching organizational reforms,
   Matsushita emerged as a global leader in the field of digital household
   appliances. The source of Matsushita's new product development
   capability was founded on the formation of a number of strategic
   communities (SCs), which represent the organizational boundaries within
   and outside Matsushita Group companies, and the organizational
   integration of these SCs. In this paper, the author uses a detailed case
   study to describe the mechanism of boundary management that enabled
   Matsushita electric to simultaneously establish a new market position
   and achieve competitively advantageous capability in the hi-tech field
   of digital appliances by balancing vertically integrated SCs and
   horizontally integrated SCs. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of cars has during recent years become increasingly
   dependent on complex electronic systems used especially for safety but
   also comfort, performance and informatics. Automotive winter testing
   activities in northern Sweden is vital to test and try out those
   systems. A contradiction to increased performance is that faulty
   software also causes 30 \% of severe malfunctions in the functionality
   of the car. To deal with these problems, as early in the design process
   as possible, innovative methods to cope with digital abstraction and the
   physical world in a unified way seems promising. One useful approach, in
   automotive winter testing, might be to support the possibilities for
   real-time vehicle simulations of the car in motion. The closer
   collaboration in the automotive industry might be an incitement for
   investing in technologies for knowledge sharing. Besides enhancing the
   product development process, additional knowledge might support
   innovations. Today, instead of providing parts similar to their
   competitors and relying on one or two automakers, successful suppliers
   focus heavily on innovation and on collaboration with a number of
   manufacturers on a global market. Due to the possibilities to visualize
   whole processes, the use of simulations seems to support a `seeing
   first' approach to innovations.
   Thus, the purpose of this paper is to describe an as-is scenario and a
   to-be scenario for automotive winter testing to highlight how the use of
   real-time simulations facilitates innovative methods.}},

Abstract = {{The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has designed and fabricated a
   forward-looking, impulse-based, ultra-wideband (UWB) imaging radar for
   detection of concealed targets. This system employs a physical array of
   16 receive antennas to provide the necessary aperture for sufficient
   cross-range resolution in the forward-looking geometry. Each antenna
   feeds a base-band receiver/digitizer that integrates the data from a
   number of radar pulses before passing it on to the personal computer
   (PC) based operator's console and display. The innovative ARL receiver
   design uses commercially available integrated circuits to provide a
   low-cost, lightweight digitizing scheme with an effective sampling rate
   of approximately 8 GHz. The design is extensible to allow for growth in
   the number of channels used and improvements in integrated circuit
   performance to eventually meet the expected unmanned ground vehicle
   combat pace. Down-range resolution is provided by the bandwidth of the
   transmitted pulse which occupies 300-3000 MHz. Range coverage is
   designed to be 25 meters with an adjustable start point forward of the
   vehicle. Modeling studies have shown that a pair of transmitters
   situated at the two ends of the receive array provides best performance
   in cross-range resolution. Radar data is continuously collected so that
   a horizontal two-dimensional synthetic aperture is formed for 3-D image
   formation. This allows focusing of the data to yield estimates of target
   height as well as position to tag potential obstacles as being negative
   (e.g. holes, ditches) or positive (e.g. tree stumps). The forward motion
   also improves the cross range resolution to targets as their aspect
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of higher performance (in area, time and power
   consumption) and greater precision binary adders is a constant
   requirement in digital systems. Consequently, the design and
   characterization of adders and, most of all, their adaptation to the
   requisites of present-day deep-submicron technologies, are today still
   issues of concern. The binary adder structures in deep-submicron
   technologies must be revised to achieve the best balance between the
   number of bits in the adder and its delay, area and power consumption.
   It is therefore very important to make an effort to carefully optimize
   adder structures, thus obtaining improvements in digital systems. This
   communication presents the optimization of adder structures for
   implementations in deep-submicron technologies through their
   partitioning into blocks. This partitioning consists of dividing the
   number of input bits to the adder into several subsets of bits that will
   constitute the inputs to several adder structures of the same. or of
   different types. The structures used to accomplish this study range from
   the more traditional types, such as the carry look ahead adder, the
   ripple carry adder or the carry select adder, to more innovative kinds,
   like the parallel prefix adders of the type proposed by Brent-Kung,
   Han-Carlson, Kogge-Stone or Ladner-Fischer. The analyses carried out
   allow the characterization of structures implemented in deep-submicron
   technologies for area, delay and power consumption parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, we have seen several catastrophic \& cascading failures
   of power systems throughout the world. Power system breakup and
   blackouts are rare events. However, when they occur, the effects on
   utilities \& general population can be quite severe. To prevent or
   reduce cascading sequences of events caused by the various reasons,
   KEPRI is researching ways to revolutionize innovative strategies that
   will significantly reduce the vulnerability of the power system and will
   ensure successful restoration of service to customers. This paper
   describes a restoration guidelines / recommendations for the KEPS
   simulator, which allows power system operator and planner to simulate
   and plan restoration events in an interactive mode. The KEPS simulator
   provides a list of restoration events according to the priority based on
   some restoration rules and list of priority loads. Further, the paper
   will draw on research using information from a Jeju case study.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated System-on-Chip (SoC) has been designed in 0.6 mu m CMOS
   mixed analog/digital technology, and tested for high rate alpha particle
   Counting. The sensor is the most innovative part of the chip, with a
   total active area of 2 x 2.5 mm x 5 mm. The two-stage charge-to-voltage
   amplification scheme includes a numerical block for offset compensation.
   Designed with a gain of 700, the chip has been tested in alpha sources:
   a very high signal over noise ratio was obtained, leading to a detection
   efficiency of 5 MeV alpha particles close to 100\%. The chip is working
   at room temperature and has been tested tip to 300 kHz reset frequency.
   Future applications of this SoC will focus on detection of fast and
   thermal neutrons free of gamma contamination. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Innovation diffusion in global contexts: determinants of post-adoption

Abstract = {{Grounded in the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology
   organization-environment framework, we develop an integrative model to
   study the determinants of post-adoption stages of innovation diffusion,
   using enterprise digital transformation as an example of
   technology-enabled innovations. We specify four innovation
   characteristics ( relative advantage, compatibility, costs and security
   concern) and four contextual factors ( technology competence,
   organization size, competitive pressure and partner readiness) as
   determinants of post-adoption usage, and postulate usage as an
   intermediate link to impact on firm performance. We test the proposed
   model using a dataset of 1415 companies from six European countries. We
   find that the innovation needs to be used extensively in value-chain
   activities before its impact can be realized. Among the innovation
   characteristics, we find that compatibility is the strongest driver, and
   security concern outweighs cost as a usage inhibitor. Among the
   contextual variables, technology competence, partner readiness and
   competitive pressure significantly drive e-business usage, and the
   structural inertia of large firms tends to slow down its penetration.
   Collectively, these results indicate that innovation diffusion can be
   better understood by including both innovation characteristics and
   contextual factors, whereas earlier literature has traditionally treated
   the two separately. Finally, we evaluate an international dimension
   among European countries and tease out important boundary conditions
   that would not have been evident in a single-country dataset. Our
   results show that careful attention must be paid to the economic and
   regulatory factors that may result in uneven innovation diffusion even
   among developed European countries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes extending the frontiers of information systems ( IS)
   research by seeing computer art as a kind of information system. It
   explores some research questions that arise if we take such a view. A
   new agenda for IS research is developed, based upon six themes in
   computer art and related work in previous IS research. The link between
   IS and computer art is bi-directional: our theories of information
   systems could inform the study of computer art, and computer art could
   inform our information systems theories, possibly leading to
   modification or even abandonment of them. Twelve research questions are
   suggested, and potential barriers to IS researchers studying computer
   art are also discussed. The paper offers possibilities, not solutions,
   and makes an important contribution by suggesting new opportunities for
   innovative research in IS and by signposting some of the topics which

Abstract = {{Computer software is somewhat of a problem child for intellectual
   property law. Courts and legislatures have struggled to find a balance
   between encouraging innovation in software development and avoiding
   undesirable digital information monopolies. Although neither the patent
   nor the copyright system has provided a particularly satisfactory
   paradigm for software protection, copyright arguably creates more
   insidious undercurrents in today's marketplace. If lawmakers do not act
   expeditiously to stem the tide of copyright protection, the software
   industry could be facing an intellectual property grab of great
   proportions which might ultimately impede innovations in software
   development.
   This Article argues for a shifting of the paradigms employed for
   software protection. In particular, copyright law should be scaled back
   and, to the extent it is retained, the doctrines of merger and scenes a
   faire should be more clearly developed to avoid unjustifiable
   information monopolies and questionable market practices. Lawmakers also
   need to recognize that, due to recent advances in encryption technology,
   trade secrecy is now a more viable candidate for software protection
   than in the past.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the further development in the design and
   implementation of an innovative optical instrumentation system that can
   measure the size distribution of particles in a pneumatic suspension. A
   low-cost charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is used to capture the
   images of the particulate flow field, which is illuminated by a low-cost
   laser sheet generator. The particle size distribution is then determined
   by processing the particle images through the use of novel processing
   algorithms. Experimental results obtained on a small scale particle flow
   test rig have demonstrated that the system is capable of measuring the
   size distribution of pneumatically conveyed particles with repeatability
   better than 1\% for a volumetric concentration up to 2\%. A relative
   comparison is made between the on-line imaging technique and the widely
   accepted laser diffraction based particle sizing method. In addition to
   laboratory scale testing, results obtained in an industrial setting are
   presented and compared favorably with off-line reference values.}},

Abstract = {{Digital tool making offers many challenges, involving much trial and
   error. Developing machine learning and assistance in automated and
   semi-automated Internet resource discovery, metadata generation, and
   rich-text identification provides opportunities for great discovery,
   innovation, and the potential for transformation of the library
   community. The areas of computer science involved, as applied to the
   library applications addressed, are among that discipline's leading
   edges. Making applied research practical and applicable, through
   placement within library/collection-management systems and services,
   involves equal parts computer scientist, research librarian, and
   legacy-systems archaeologist. Still, the early harvest is there for us
   now, with a large harvest pending. Data Fountains and iVia, the projects
   discussed, demonstrate this. Clearly, then, the present would be a good
   time for the library community to more proactively and significantly
   engage with this technology and research, to better plan for its
   impacts, to more proactively take up the challenges involved in its
   exploration, and to better and more comprehensively guide effort in this
   new territory. The alternative to doing this is that others will develop
   this territory for us, do it not as well, and sell it back to us at a
   premium. Awareness of this technology and its current capabilities,
   promises, limitations, and probable major impacts needs to be
   generalized throughout the library management, metadata, and systems
   communities. This article charts recent work, promising avenues for new
   research and development, and issues the library community needs to
   understand.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing ease and frequency of digital music piracy and the global
   nature of the music industry make it important to understand why
   consumers in different national markets purchase music CDs. Study 1
   identified 5 factors underlying CD purchasing, noting these differences
   between British and Japanese participants. Study 2 investigated
   relationships between these 5 factors and individual-difference
   variables. Compliance was unrelated to scores on the Friendship factor.
   Experience seeking and scores on the Re-Experience the Music factor were
   correlated negatively. Scores on the Friendship factor and
   innovativeness were unrelated, although innovativeness and scores on the
   Need to Control and Be Involved With Music factor were positively
   associated with product, purchase decision, and consumption
   involvements. Implications for marketing and future research are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer-grade digital cameras have become commonplace and with
   calibration there is significant potential for their use in
   photogrammetric applications. This paper describes a new method for
   automatic camera calibration, which is suited to colour digital cameras.
   Two innovations are central to the developed process. The first is
   exploitation of RGB colour attributes in the design of automatically
   detected and identified coded targets. The second is a new approach to
   initial value determination for relative orientation, which then
   supports fully automatic initial network exterior orientation and
   subsequent bundle adjustment with self-calibration. Accuracy aspects are
   also touched upon and the impact of chromatic aberration is discussed.
   Finally, an example of the automatic calibration process, which is
   implemented in the iWitness system, is presented for the case of
   multiple zoom settings of a consumer-grade digital camera.}},

Abstract = {{Network effects are the basis of competitive advantage in digital
   economies. Although some researchers have indicated that technologies
   characterized by network effects are difficult to replace, real-world
   situations have not confirmed this argument. Challengers still defeat
   market leaders in markets with network effects. The analytical results
   presented here include the following: (1) a proposed new concept,
   resilience, can describe the resistive strength of a network to
   challenger customer-capturing strategies, (2) three types of networks
   can be identified based on their resilience values, and (3)
   high-resilience networks possessing technology are difficult to replace.

Abstract = {{Not quite half a year after Edison's introduction of projected motion
   pictures to the American public in 1896, North American Review writer
   George Parsons Lathrop wondered whether the stage would be
   revolutionized by filmed scenery. Theatrical entrepreneurs and effects
   inventors quickly explored the multimedia potential of the new medium,
   enlarging the scenic scope of the stage and bringing to the theatre a
   spatial freedom that in some cases transcended the limits of traditional
   stagecraft, for instance by simulating movement in depth. Prominent
   Broadway producers featured filmed scenery effects in popular
   productions for several decades. As projection technology has
   improved-most recently with digital techniques-designers repeatedly have
   envisioned a stagecraft of screens and moving images, but practitioners
   and historians are largely unaware of the origins of this perpetually
   innovative scenic approach. In this article, Gwendolyn Waltz examines
   the early history of filmed scenery.}},

   mathematical analysis of periodicity and frequency in the realm of sound
   is, first, a by-product of innovations in war technology and, second,
   radically changed by different ways in Which numerical systems process
   data. With regard to the development of Kittler's thought the article is
   a somewhat idiosyncratic but nonetheless highly revealing and
   representative example of his recent switch from media-technological to
   more alphanumerically oriented analyses and the accompanying focus on
   the importance of Ancient Greece for the evolution of science.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes novel innovation idea and research results of
   digital, self-adapting smart sensors and systems-on-chip (SoC) designs
   based on universal frequency sensor interfacing integrated circuit. The
   developed integrated interfacing circuit based on four novel patentable
   conversion methods and designed to interface directly with any
   frequency-time domain sensors and improve the frequency (period,
   duty-cycle, time interval, etc.)-to-digital conversion and PC
   interfacing.
   The proposed design approach lets significantly simplify the design
   process, reduce time to market and production price and produce digital,
   smart and multiparameters sensors and sensor systems including SoC with
   high metrological performances. It also lets move from a traditional
   analog sensor output to quasi-digital. No output standardization is
   necessary as in case of analog sensors.
   In comparison with the direct microcontroller interfacing the proposed
   approach also lets to eliminate many design problems connected with the
   use of advanced conversion methods for frequency-time parameters,
   embedded microcontroller choice, its programming and additional error
   components due to so-called program-dependent or software-related
   effects. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Automated vs manual triage for bioterrorist disaster: a blinded
   crossover feasibility study comparing personal digital assistant to
   paper-based triage}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{843-846}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: This article reports results of a National Institutes of
   Health/National Library of Medicine Small Business Innovation
   Research-funded research grant comparing paper-based and automated Palm
   handheld computer disaster triage documentation.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of
   automated handheld computer triage and compare it to handwritten triage.
   Methods: A paired t test was used in an intraindividual, blinded,
   crossover study to compare the 2 methods of disaster triage by 2
   objective measures-time and accuracy. A total of 57 experienced,
   licensed first responders participated.
   Results are from analysis of 8 disaster scenarios with a total of 400
   patients triaged using the 2 methods of documentation, crossed over,
   blinded, and paired per participant. Results: The study demonstrated the
   feasibility of using TriageDoc, a Palm personal digital assistant (PDA)
   program, as a viable alternative to current manual disaster triage.
   Furthermore, the PDA program gave advantage to bioterrorist agent
   identification.
   Conclusions: The feasibility of an automated Palm (Palm, Inc.,
   Sunnyvale, CA) PDA triage program was demonstrated in this study. Study
   limitations, by the number of participants and the fact it is
   feasibility research, are acknowledged. Nevertheless, the research
   demonstrated TriageDoc was as accurate or more accurate as the manual
   method of triage with a tendency to require less time. Also there was no
   statistically significant difference between research sites with respect
   to accuracy or time to completion when the TriageDoc system was used.
   The program provided consistency and had flexibility in adapting to the
   various differences in triage methods at different locations. Hence, PDA
   programs such as TriageDoc may have potential advantages over
   handwritten documentation for disaster triage. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Industrial and knowledge relocation strategies under the challenges of
   globalization and digitalization: the move of small and medium

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Owing to globalization and digitalization, small and medium firms adopt
   relocation strategies to transfer their activities (and implicitly also
   knowledge) among territorial systems, inducing transformations into both
   source and destination areas. Cognitive proximity and knowledge
   creation/transfer play a crucial role, especially critical when
   concerning tacit knowledge, which can be transferred only by moving
   people. In each industrial cluster or industrial district it is possible
   to identify a kernel of critical activities, which requests complex
   competencies and has high added value, and a kernel of tacit knowledge,
   which is based on repeated face-to-face interactions. The former resists
   globalization and the latter prevents digitalization, which impacts
   heavily on territorial systems lacking trust, cooperative attitude, and
   other sociocognitive factors. Relocation strategies are divided into
   selective and replicative alternatives, depending on the ability to
   preserve large kernels. When replicative strategies are followed by many
   firms, the socio-cognitive integrity and the economic competitiveness of
   the territorial system are severely damaged. Thus, in order to prevent
   the ruinous consequences of massive replicative relocation, local and
   regional governments should steer territorial systems towards selective
   relocation strategies supporting innovation and improving human capital,
   paying attention and developing socio-cognitive factors too. In the
   final part of the paper, case studies of industrial and knowledge
   relocation at intra-European level are discussed, and a general model is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Volar plate fixation with use of either a locking plate or a
   neutralization plate has become increasingly popular among surgeons for
   the treatment of dorsally comminuted extra-articular distal radial
   fractures. The purpose of the present study was to compare the relative
   stability of five distal radial plates (four volar and one dorsal), all
   of which are commonly used for the treatment of dorsally comminuted
   extra-articular distal radial fractures, under loading conditions
   simulating the physiologic forces that are experienced during early
   active rehabilitation.
   Methods: With use of a previously validated Sawbones fracture model, a
   dorsally comminuted extra-articular distal radial fracture was created.
   The fracture fixation stability of four volar plates (an AO T-plate, an
   AO 3.5-mm small-fragment plate, an AO 3.5-mm small-fragment locking
   plate, and the Hand Innovations DVR locking plate) were compared under
   axial compression loading and dorsal and volar bending simulating the in
   vivo stresses that are generated at the fracture site during early
   unopposed active motion of the wrist and digits. A single dorsal plate
   (an AO pi plate) was used for comparison, with and without simulated
   volar cortical comminution. The construct stiffness was measured to
   assess the resistance to fracture gap motion, and comparisons were made
   among the implants.
   Results: The volar AO locking and DVR plates had greater resistance to
   fracture gap motion (greater stiffness) compared with the volar AO
   nonlocking and AO T-plates under axial and dorsal loading conditions (p
   < 0.01), with no significant difference between the AO volar locking and
   DVR plates. The volar AO locking plate had greater resistance to
   fracture gap motion than did the volar AO nonlocking plate under axial
   loading and dorsal bending forces (p < 0.01). The dorsal pi plate had
   the greatest resistance to fracture gap motion under axial loading and
   volar and dorsal bending forces (p < 0.01). However, the pi plate was
   significantly less stable to axial load and dorsal bending forces when
   the volar cortex was comminuted (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: In this model of dorsally comminuted extra-articular distal
   radial fractures, dorsal pi-plate fixation demonstrated better
   resistance to fracture gap motion than did the four types of volar plate
   fixation. The AO volar locking and DVR plates conferred the greatest
   resistance to fracture gap motion among the four volar plates tested.
   Volar locking technology conferred a significant increase in resistance
   to fracture gap motion as compared with nonlocking plate technology.
   Clinical Relevance: The present study provides comparative biomechanical
   data that may be helpful for individualizing plate fixation techniques
   and postoperative rehabilitation protocols for the treatment of dorsally
   comminuted extra-articular distal radial fractures. While the dorsal pi
   plate had the highest resistance to fracture gap motion, the locked
   volar plates showed significantly higher resistance to fracture gap
   motion than the unlocked plates did, suggesting that either surgical
   approach (dorsal or volar) combined with rigid plate fixation should
   allow for early assisted finger and wrist motion in the treatment of
   comminuted distal radial (Colles-type) fractures.}},

Abstract = {{Conception, as defined by the fertilisation of an ovum by a sperm, marks
   the beginning of human development. Currently, a biomarker of conception
   is not available; as conception occurs shortly after ovulation, the
   latter can be used as a proxy for the time of conception. In the absence
   of serial ultrasound examinations, ovulation cannot be readily
   visualised leaving researchers to rely on proxy measures of ovulation
   that are subject to error. The most commonly used proxy measures
   include: charting basal body temperature, monitoring cervical mucus, and
   measuring urinary metabolites of oestradiol and luteinising hormone.
   Establishing the timing of the ovulation and the fertile window has
   practical utility in that it will assist couples in appropriately timing
   intercourse to achieve or avoid pregnancy. Identifying the likely day of
   conception is clinically relevant because it has the potential to
   facilitate more accurate pregnancy dating, thereby reducing the
   iatrogenic risks associated with uncertain gestation. Using data from
   prospective studies of couples attempting to conceive, several
   researchers have developed models for estimating the day-specific
   probabilities of conception. Elucidating these will allow researchers to
   more accurately estimate the day of conception, thus spawning research
   initiatives that will expand our current limited knowledge about the
   effect of exposures at critical periconceptional windows. While basal
   body temperature charting and cervical mucus monitoring have been used
   with success in field-based studies for many years, recent advances in
   science and technology have made it possible for women to get instant
   feedback regarding their daily fertility status by monitoring urinary
   metabolites of reproductive hormones in the privacy of their own homes.
   Not only are innovations such as luteinising hormone test kits and
   digital fertility monitors likely to increase study compliance and
   participation rates, they provide valuable prospective data that can be
   used in epidemiological research. Although we have made great strides in
   estimating the timing and length of the fertile window, more work is
   needed to elucidate the day-specific probabilities of conception using
   proxy measures of ovulation that are inherently subject to error.
   Modelling approaches that incorporate the use of multiple markers of
   ovulation offer great promise to fill these important data gaps.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the relationship between firm size and innovation inputs in
   Taiwan, Two inputs are considered: R\&D and technology imports. Building
   on an existing theoretical framework, we test this relationship by
   estimating bivariate Tobit models in twenty 2-digit industries, using a
   panel of 27,754 firms observed from 1992 to 1995. We find that, in all
   industries, R\&D intensity and/or technology imports intensity depend
   strongly on firm size, following an ``inverted-U{''} pattern. Moreover,
   we find that most industries are only ``mildly Schumpeterian{''}.
   Finally, our results provide some empirical evidence for complementarity
   between R\&D and technology imports in the innovation process.}},

Abstract = {{In cellular networks, an important practical issue is how to limit the
   handoff dropping probability efficiently. One possible approach is to
   perform dynamic bandwidth reservation based on mobility predictions.
   With the rapid advances in mobile positioning technology, and the
   widespread availability of digital road maps previously designed for
   navigational devices, we propose a predictive bandwidth reservation
   scheme built upon these timely opportunities. In contrast to the common
   practice of utilizing only incoming handoff predictions at each cell to
   compute the reservations, our scheme is more efficient as it
   innovatively utilizes both incoming and outgoing handoff predictions; it
   can meet the same target handoff dropping probability by blocking fewer
   new calls. The individual base stations are responsible for the
   computations, which are shown to be simple enough to be performed in
   real-time. We evaluate the scheme via simulation, along with five other
   schemes for comparison. Simulation results show that those schemes that
   rely on positioning information are significantly more efficient than
   those that do not. Our scheme's additional use of the road topology
   information further improves upon this advantage, bringing the
   efficiency closer to the bound set by a benchmark scheme that assumes
   perfect knowledge about future handoffs.}},

Abstract = {{Synchrotron-based digital radiography and microtomography devices are
   powerful, nondestructive, high-resolution research tools. In this paper,
   we present a linear system with a pixel size of 22.5 mu m and a
   field-of-view (FOV) 13 cm long and about 1 mm high. The system is
   composed of a linear converter GOS screen coupled to an intensified
   electron-bombarded CCD (EBCCD) camera, by means of a
   rectangular-to-linear fiber optic adapter. This optical guide is
   composed of seven bundles, each one transporting light in a coherent way
   to preserve spatial information. In this way, a high spatial resolution
   over an extended FOV is obtained. The detector works as an X-ray scanner
   by means of a high-precision translation mechanical device with 18 cm
   travel range. The total FOV obtained this way is 13 cm long and 18 cm
   high. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of this
   system to investigate a large area of a bone and to calculate the
   appropriate histomorphometric parameters. Here we present an
   investigation gained at ELETTRA synchrotron facility at Trieste, Italy.
   A monochromatic 34-keV beam has been used for imaging a human proximal
   femur, about 9 cm in width, with our system. The reconstructed images
   (13 cm x 13 cm) were cross sections containing femoral head, femoral
   neck, and greater trochanter. The local variations in trabecular and
   cortical structure of the examined bone were clearly visible at a level
   not obtainable with medical CT scanners. The used spatial resolution
   allowed the visualization of thin trabeculae, which typically lie in a
   range of 100 mu m or lower. The quality of the reconstructed
   cross-section images confirmed that the system presented is a novel tool
   for high resolution three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of bone structure,
   with a pixel size over a volume of interest not achievable with
   conventional microCT scanners.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial inkjet media is increasingly used in daily life; this use
   ranges from offices to digital photography. The impact that the
   development of this technology has had on the paper industry has been
   phenomenal. However, an increasing amount of paper is discarded and it
   is often after the introduction of complex chemical ink within its
   substrate. The understanding of the interactions between the layer of
   coated media and ink call be used to further understand and develop
   technology for the use of recycling office and photo papers. This paper
   presents the innovative concept in characterizing the surface of the
   inkjet media by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). Comparisons are made between the data obtained from
   both atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of the
   receptive layer and surface analysis software that was used to obtain
   surface characteristics. In this study the hardness and force of
   interaction has also been examined by the means of nanoindentation
   measurements using silicon nitride cantilever tips and forces of
   interaction between a selection of colloid probes and the receptive
   layer of the inkjet media. The effect of loading force on indentation
   was studied ill terms of approach of impact and type of media tested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an innovative model for assessing the technical
   communication course by analytically scoring online portfolios, open to
   the internet, for ten separate (analytic) variables and one overall
   (holistic) score. The model is a statistically verifiable and
   sustainable method that strengthens the curriculum and fosters consensus
   within the teaching community. We achieved construct validity by
   redefining the elements of the course to incorporate communication in
   the digital age and then by creating new criteria for evaluation related
   to that construct. We achieved inter-reader reliability by beginning
   each assessment with a calibrated reading and by adjudicating
   non-adjacent scores. After using the model successfully for three
   semesters, we can see increased consistency in teaching among sections
   and semesters, more communication among instructors, and we are
   beginning a database with which we can test farther change. The theory
   and method behind this model can be applied to other disciplines as
   well.}},

Abstract = {{The Open Video Digital Library (OVDL) provides digital video files to
   the education and research community and is distinguished by an
   innovative user interface that offers multiple kinds of visual
   surrogates to people searching for video content. The OVDL is used by
   several thousand people around the world each month and part of this
   success is due to its user interface. This article examines the
   interplay between research and practice in the development of this
   particular digital library with an eye toward lessons for all digital
   libraries. We argue that theoretical and research goals blur into
   practical goals and practical goals raise new research questions as
   research and development progress - this process is akin to walking
   along a Mobius strip in which a locally two-sided surface is actually
   part of a globally one-sided world. We consider the gulf between the
   theories that guide current digital library research and current
   practice in operational digital libraries, provide a developmental
   history of the OVDL and the research frameworks that drove its
   development, illustrate how user studies informed its implementation and
   revision, and conclude with reflections and recommendations on the
   interplay between research and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, changes in technology have allowed academic
   medical center libraries to bring the world of biomedical information to
   the physician's computer desktop. Because digital libraries have grown
   so rapidly and in so many ways, some clinicians may be uncertain about
   the services and resources that are available to them. This article
   explains how clinical faculty can best utilize their library to support
   their research and patient care. It addresses some of the most common
   myths about the ``new{''} medical library, and it highlights innovations
   in library resources and services that can help physicians to better
   access, use and manage medical information.}},

   had many misconceptions of DTV and their DTV knowledge level was most
   related to personality traits and internet usage or tenure. While the
   desire for bigger screen size, digital video recorder ownership, income

   were the best predictors of intention to adopt DTV converters.}},

Abstract = {{Producing enterprises in Europe were in a situation marked by a strong
   growth in competition and individualization of the customer's requests
   increasing at the same time. In order to maintain the market, many
   enterprises with mass production are challenged to link two strategic
   options: simultaneous improvements in differentiation and cost
   structures. Consequently, controversial measures would be required.
   Attempts to find a solution in the context of conventional business
   models showed the following characteristics: a strong increase in
   information and communication, an increase in the product type and
   number of variants, a reduction in manufacturing lot size, unstable,
   frequently changing production processes and extensive storekeeping at
   several stock levels ('complexity costs'). Enterprises which introduce
   the mass production for the individual customer try to combine the
   advantages of mass production with those of individual manufacture.
   Intelligent competition strategies based upon concepts of the `Digital
   Factory' approach aim to overcome the traditional duality of `cost
   leadership' or `differentiation strategy' and to make both efficiency
   and effectiveness possible.}},

Abstract = {{Anoles of the Anolis onea series represent a dramatic case of retrograde
   evolution, exhibiting great reduction (A. annectens) and loss (A. onca)
   of the subdigital pads considered a key innovation for the evolutionary
   radiation of anoles in arboreal environments. We present a molecular
   phylogenetic analysis of these anoles and their closest known relatives
   (A. auratus, A. lineatus, A. meridionalis, and A. nitens) using new
   mitochondrial DNA sequence data from the ND2 gene, five tRNA genes
   (tRNA(Trp), tRNA(Ala), tRNA(Asn), tRNA(Cys), tRNA(Tyr)), the origin of
   light-strand replication, and a portion of the CO1 gene (1,446 aligned
   base positions, 612 parsimony informative). Our results confirm
   monophyly of the A. onca series and suggest an evolutionary separation
   of approximately 10 million years between A. annectens and A. onca.
   Evolution of subdigital structure in this series illustrates ectopic
   expression of developmental programs that replace flexible subdigital
   lamellae of the toepad with rigid, keeled scales resembling dorsal
   digital scales. Our phylogenetic results indicate that narrowing of the
   toepad in A. auratus evolved separately from toepad reduction in the A.
   onca series. Expansion of the subdigital lamellae along the phalanges in
   A. auratus appears to compensate constriction of lamellae by digital
   narrowing, maintaining greater climbing capability in this species.
   Toepad evolution in the lineage ancestral to A. auratus features changes
   of the same developmental modules as the A. onca series but in the
   opposite direction. Large molecular distances between geographic
   populations of A. auratus indicate that its derived toepad structure is
   at least 9 million years old.}},

Abstract = {{Exponential technological advances in telescopes capabilities are today
   a key factor to obtain large digital sky surveys. The huge amount of
   digital observational data can be investigated through data-mining
   techniques based on a clustering approach that uses a number of distinct
   astronomical objects (such as stars, galaxies, quasar, etc.) as data
   set, in order to discover rare or even previously unknown types of
   astronomical objects and phenomena. A very interesting and innovative
   field in data mining is the outlier detection. Given a set, an outlier
   is an individual who behaves in an unexpected way or features abnormal
   properties. We will show an outlier detection technique based on the
   deviation approach: identification of outliers by examining the spectra
   of astronomical objects in a group. Objects that ``deviate{''} from an
   expected description are considered outliers. Also, an algorithm which
   implements this technique will be described. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Context.-Digital technology is commonly used for documentation of
   specimens in anatomic pathology and has been mainly limited to still
   photographs. Technologic innovations, such as digital video, provide
   additional, in some cases better, options for documentation.
   Objective.-To demonstrate the applicability of digital video to the
   documentation of surgical specimens.
   Design.-A Canon Elura MC40 digital camcorder was used, and the unedited
   movies were transferred to a Macintosh PowerBook G4 computer. Both the
   camcorder and specimens were hand-held during filming. The movies were
   edited using the software iMovie. Annotations and histologic photographs
   may be easily incorporated into movies when editing, if desired.
   Results.-The finished movies are best viewed in computers which contain
   the free program QuickTime Player. Movies may also be incorporated onto
   DVDs, for viewing in standard DVD players or appropriately equipped
   computers. The final movies are on average 2 minutes in duration, with a
   file size between 2 and 400 megabytes, depending on the intended use.
   Because of file size, distribution is more practical via CD or DVD, but
   movies may be compressed for distribution through the Internet (email,
   Web sites) or through internal hospital networks.
   Conclusions.-Digital video is a practical, easy, and affordable
   methodology for specimen documentation, permitting a better
   3-dimensional understanding of the specimens. Discussions with
   colleagues, student education, presentation at conferences, and other
   educational activities can be enhanced with the implementation of
   digital video technology.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports an integrated microfluidic chip for polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) applications utilizing digital microfluidic chip (DMC)
   technology. Several crucial procedures including sample transportation,
   mixing, and DNA amplification were performed on the integrated chip
   using electro-wetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) effect. An innovative concept
   of hydrophobic/hydrophilic structure has been successfully demonstrated
   to integrate the DMC chip with the on-chip PCR device. Sample droplets
   were generated, transported and mixed by the EWOD-actuation. Then the
   mixture droplets were transported to a PCR chamber by utilizing the
   hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface to generate required surface tension
   gradient. A micro temperature sensor and two micro heaters inside the
   PCR chamber along with a controller were used to form a micro
   temperature control module, which could perform precise PCR thermal
   cycling for DNA amplification. In order to demonstrate the performance
   of the integrated DMC/PCR chips, a detection gene for Dengue II virus
   was successfully amplified and detected. The new integrated DMC/PCR
   chips only required an operation voltage of 12V(RMS) at a frequency of 3
   KHz for digital microfluidic actuation and 9V(DC) for thermal cycling.
   When compared to its large-scale counterparts for DNA amplification, the
   developed system consumed less sample and reagent and could reduce the
   detection time. The developed chips successfully demonstrated the
   feasibility of Lab-On-a-Chip (LOC) by utilizing EWOD-based digital
   microfluidics.}},

Abstract = {{This research reports on a conceptually and methodologically innovative
   study, which sought to measure the influence of gender on interpersonal
   distance. In so doing, we argue for an important distinction to be made
   between biological sex, gender role, and sexuality. To date, however,
   progress in the study of interpersonal distance (IPD) has been inhibited
   by poor operational definitions and inadequate measurement
   methodologies. For our own investigation, we innovated on methodology by
   devising the digital video-recording IPD method (DiVRID) that records
   interpersonal spatial relationships using high quality digital video
   equipment. The findings highlighted not only the validity of our
   innovative method of investigation, but also that a more sophisticated
   conceptualization of the impact of gender on IPD is warranted than can
   be accounted for by biological sex differences. In this study, we found
   that gender role accounts for more of the variation in IPD than the
   conventionally reported gender variable, sex.}},

Abstract = {{In the wake of globalization, still more regional clusters are globally
   outsourcing (purchasing components that were originally manufactured
   internally) or offshoring (globally relocating manufacturing while
   maintaining ownership control). Policy makers and business strategists
   alike are searching for theoretical frameworks to understand the
   underlying dynamics of this global reshuffling of production activities
   and how this will affect innovation and competitiveness. This article
   examines production relocation from a regional perspective. It shows
   that the impact of globalization on regional clusters depends on the
   modularity and digitalization of the regional production activities,
   which affect stickiness and coordination costs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent results show that a relatively small number of random projections
   of a signal can contain most of its salient information. It follows that
   if a signal is compressible, in some orthonormal basis, then a very
   accurate reconstruction can be obtained from random projections. This
   ``compressive sampling{''} approach is extended here to show that
   signals can be accurately recovered from random projections contaminated
   with noise. A practical iterative algorithm for signal reconstruction is
   proposed, and potential applications to coding, analog-digital (A/D)
   conversion, and remote wireless sensing are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In a competitive environment of frequent and rapid change, electronic
   business (e-business), whose supply, production, and logistics and
   distribution networks are enabled digitally, is increasingly dependent
   on electronic interconnections that are innovative in their
   functionality. Conceivably, its ability to deliver functions and
   services is closely associated with and helpful for the completion of
   employees' tasks and jobs, leading to service quality being critically
   important for both the employees and e-business (EB). On the other hand,
   since EB utilizes enterprise applications, user satisfaction, as a
   surrogate measure of information system (IS) or information technology
   (IT) effectiveness/success is also important for enterprise applications
   success. Thus, this research attempts to extrapolate the results of
   marketing research concerning customers' perceptions of service quality
   and IS/IT research as to employees' perceptions of service quality with
   EB. First, we revise the SERVQUAL instrument to fit the new context of
   EB and measure employees' perceived service quality with EB. Based on a
   survey of 161 respondents practicing mostly in seven international
   electronic businesses in Taiwan, a 13-item EB-SERVQUAL instrument is
   proposed. This can be used to improve and diagnose the service quality
   of EB. Second, we examine user satisfaction with enterprise applications
   and its causal link in relation to service quality with EB. The
   instrument and our findings in this paper will be valuable to
   researchers and practitioners interested in designing, implementing, and
   managing EB. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{``Network neutrality{''} is the shorthand for a proposed regime of
   economic regulation for the Internet. Because of the trend to deliver
   traditional telecommunications services, as well as new forms of content
   and applications, by Internet protocol (IP), a regime of network
   neutrality regulation would displace or subordinate a substantial
   portion of existing telecommunications regulation. If the United States
   adopts network neutrality regulation, other industrialized nations
   probably will soon follow. As a result of their investment to create
   next-generation broadband networks, network operators have the ability
   to innovate inside the network by offering both senders and receivers of
   information greater bandwidth and prioritization of delivery. Network
   neutrality regulation would, among other things, prevent providers of
   broadband Internet access service (such as digital subscriber line (DSL)
   or cable modem service) from offering a guaranteed, expedited delivery
   speed in return for the payment of a fee. The practical effect of
   banning such differential pricing (called ``access tiering{''} by its
   critics) would be to prevent the pricing of access to content or
   applications providers according to priority of delivery. To the extent
   that an advertiser of a good or service would be willing to contract
   with a network operator for advertising space on the network operator's
   affiliated content, another practical effect of network neutrality
   regulation would be to erect a barrier to vertical integration of
   network operators into advertising-based business models that could
   supplement or replace revenues earned from their existing usage-based
   business models. Moreover, by making end-users pay for the full cost of
   broadband access, network neutrality regulation would deny broadband
   access to the large number of consumers who would not be able to afford,
   or who would not have a willingness to pay for, what would otherwise be
   less expensive access. For example, Google is planning to offer
   broadband access to end-users for free in San Francisco by charging
   other content providers for advertising. This product offering is
   evidently predicated on the belief that many end-users demand discounted
   or free broadband access that is paid for by parties other than
   themselves. Proponents of network neutrality regulation argue that such
   restrictions on the pricing policies of network operators are necessary
   to preserve innovation on the edges of the network, as opposed to
   innovation within the network. However, recognizing that network
   congestion and real-time applications demand some differential pricing
   according to bandwidth or priority, proponents of network neutrality
   regulation would allow broadband Internet access providers to charge
   higher prices to end-users (but not content or applications providers)
   who consume more bandwidth or who seek priority delivery of certain
   traffic. Thus, the debate over network neutrality is essentially a
   debate over how best to finance the construction and maintenance of a
   broadband network in a two-sided market in which senders and receivers
   have additive demand for the delivery of a given piece of
   information-and hence additive willingness to pay. Well-established
   tools of Ramsey pricing from regulatory economics can shed light on
   whether network congestion and recovery of sunk investment in
   infrastructure are best addressed by charging providers of content and
   applications, broadband users, or both for expedited delivery.
   Apart from this pricing problem, an analytically simpler component of
   proposed network neutrality regulaion would prohibit a network operator
   from denying its users access to certain websites and Internet
   applications, such as voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). Although some
   instances of blocking of VoIP have been reported, such conduct is not a
   serious risk to competition. To address this concern, I analyze whether
   market forces (that is, competition among access providers) and existing
   regulatory structures are sufficient to protect broadband users. I
   conclude that economic welfare would be maximized by allowing access
   providers to differentiate services vis-a-vis providers of content and
   applications in value-enhancing ways and by relying on existing legal
   regimes to protect consumers against the exercise of market power,
   should it exist.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in
   documenting pharmacists' clinical interventions.
   Setting: Evans Army Community Hospital (EACH), a 78-bed military
   treatment facility, in Colorado Springs.
   Participants: Pharmacists on staff at EACH.
   Practice Description: All pharmacists at EACH used PDAs with the pilot
   software to record interventions for 1 month. The program underwent
   final design changes and then became the sole source for recording
   pharmacist interventions. The results of this project are being
   evaluated every 3 months for the first year and yearly thereafter.
   Practice Innovation: Visual CE (Syware Inc. Cambridge, Mass.) software
   was selected to develop fields for the documentation tool. This software
   is simple and easy to use, and users can retrieve reports of
   interventions from both inpatient and outpatient sections. The software
   needed to be designed so that data entry would only take a few minutes
   and ad hoc reports could be produced easily.
   Main Outcome Measures: Number of pharmacist interventions reported, time
   spent in clinical interventions, and outcome of clinical intervention.
   Results: Implementing a PDA-based system for documenting pharmacist
   interventions across ambulatory, inpatient, and clinical services
   dramatically increased reporting during the first 6 months after
   implementation (August 2004-February 2005). After initial fielding,
   clinical pharmacists in advanced practice settings (such as disease
   management clinic, anticoagulation clinic) recognized a need to tailor
   the program to their specific activities, which resulted in a spin-off
   program unique to their practice roles.
   Conclusion: A PDA-based system for documenting clinical interventions at
   a military treatment facility increased reporting of interventions
   across all pharmacy points of service. Pharmacy leadership used these
   data to document the impact of pharmacist interventions on safety and
   quality of pharmaceutical care provided.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Determination and comparison of radiation exposure for
   examinations of the skull with unsubtracted 3D Rotational Angiography
   (3D RA) and 2D Digital Subtraction Angiography (2D DSA). Materials and
   Methods: Measurements were carried out with a skull of an Alderson
   phantom for 3D RA and for 2D DSA in p. a. and lateral projections using
   an Innova 4100 angiography system with a digital flat panel detector
   from GE Healthcare. 45 thermoluminescent dosimeters TLD 100H from
   Harshaw were placed inside the phantom to measure organ doses. In
   addition the dose area product was recorded and the effective dose was
   calculated using the Monte Carlo program PCXMC. Results: For a biplanar
   DSA run (lateral and p.a. projection), the organ doses were 4 to 5 times
   higher and the effective dose was 4 times higher than for a 3D RA even
   though the number of images for the two DSA runs was only half of that
   for 3D RA. Conclusion: The radiation exposure for unsubtracted 3D RA
   using a flat panel detector is significantly lower than for biplanar
   DSA. Using 3D RA in place of 2D DSA can reduce the radiation exposure of
   patients in neuroradiology procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The digital imaging revolution continues apace, affecting the whole
   spectrum of the photographic industry. In many parts of the world
   digital cameras now outsell conventional film cameras, and many of the
   disadvantages associated with digital image capture in the very recent
   past(1,2) have been nullified.
   As the digital industry grows, the various technologies involved
   continue to be ever innovative. With respect to digital cameras, the
   image sensor performance criteria have improved immeasurably since the
   launch of the first solid-state camera in the early 1980s. The
   charge-coupled semiconductor device (GOD), for so long the unrivalled
   image-capture component in digital cameras, is now being challenged by
   complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and the
   innovatively re-designed Fujifilm Super COD. In addition, the recent
   introduction of the Foveon full-colour imaging sensor has added a new
   dimension to digital image capture.
   This paper reviews current image-capture sensors and the way that the
   various digital imaging camera designs are able to record and reproduce
   colour images.}},

Journal = {{DECISION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{393-426}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{As new technological innovations are rapidly introduced and changed,
   identifying an individual characteristic that has a persistent effect on
   the acceptance decisions across multiple technologies is of substantial
   value for the successful implementation of information systems.
   Augmenting prior work on individual innovativeness within the context of
   information technology, we developed a new measure of adopter category
   innovativeness (ACI) and compared its effectiveness with the existing
   measure of personal innovativeness in IT (PIIT). Further, we examined
   two alternative models in which the role of individual innovativeness
   was theorized differently-either as a moderator of the effects the
   perceived innovation characteristics of usefulness, ease of use, and
   compatibility have on future use intention (moderator model) or as a
   direct determinant of the innovation characteristics (direct determinant
   model). To ensure the generalizability of the study findings, two field
   studies (N = 634) were conducted, each of which examined the two models
   (moderator and direct determinant) and measured individual
   innovativeness using the two measures (ACI and PIIT). Study 1 surveyed
   the online buying practices of 412 individuals, and Study 2 surveyed
   personal digital assistant adoption of 222 healthcare professionals.
   Across the markedly different adoption contexts, the study results
   consistently show that individual innovativeness is a direct determinant
   of the innovation characteristics, and the two measures share many
   commonalities. The new measure offers some additional utilities not
   found in the PIIT measure by allowing individuals to be directly
   classified and mapped into adopter categories. Implications are drawn
   for future research and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in general and MRA of the abdominal
   vessels in particular have undergone substantial improvements in the
   past 5 years triggered by the introduction and application of parallel
   imaging (PI), new sequence techniques such as centric k-space
   trajectories and undersampling, dedicated contrast agents and clinical
   high-field scanners. All of these techniques have the potential to
   improve image quality and resolution or decrease the image acquisition
   time. However, each of them has its own specific advantages and
   drawbacks. This review describes the main technical innovations and
   focuses on the impact these developments may have on abdominal MRA.
   Special consideration is given to the interaction of these various
   technical advances. The clinical value of advanced MRA techniques is
   discussed and illustrated by characteristic cases.}},

Abstract = {{The Supreme Court's Brand X decision has reignited the debate over
   ``network neutrality, `` which would limit broadband networks' authority
   to impose restrictions on end users' abilily to access content, run
   applications, and attach devices and to charge content and application
   providers higher prices for higher levels of quality of service. In this
   Article, Professor Christopher Yoo draws on the economics of congestion
   to propose a new analytical framework for assessing such restrictions.
   He concludes that when transaction costs render metering network-usage
   uneconomical, imposing restrictions on bandwidth-intensive activities
   may well enhance economic welfare by preventing high-volume users from
   imposing uncompensated costs on low-volume users. Usage of
   bandwidth-intensive services can thus serve as a useful proxy for
   congestion externalities just as port usage served as a proxy for
   consumption of lighthouse services in Coase's classic critique of the
   economic parable of the lighthouse. In addition, content delivery
   networks and other commercial caching systems represent still another
   innovative way to manage the problems associated with congestion and
   latency that would be foreclosed by network neutrality. Furthermore,
   allowing network owners to differentiate their services can serve as a
   form of price discrimination that can mitigate the sources of market
   failure that require regulatory intervention in the first place. This
   framework suggests that broadband policy would be better served by
   embracing a network diversity principle that would eschew a
   one-size-fits-all approach and would allow network providers to
   experiment with different institutional forms until it can be shown that
   a particular practice is harming competition. At most, concerns that
   telephone companies may prevent end users from using their digital
   subscriber line (DSL) connections to access Voice over Internet Protocol
   (VoIP) provide support for targeted regulatory intervention. They do not
   justify a blanket prohibition of end user restrictions that network
   neutrality proponents envision.}},

Abstract = {{The Modern Distance Education Project for the Rural Schools (MDEPRS) of
   China has a wider scope and serves a larger population than any other
   informational project in the world. It likely will result in a
   far-reaching informational revolution for basic education in China.
   Here, we introduce three main innovative models of material delivery,
   the recent developments of MDEPRS, and the problems associated with this
   project. We then fully discuss strategies for optimizing this project,
   such as establishing reasonable goals and directions, restructuring its
   major components, improving the delivery models and digital contents,
   sustaining its development, conducting better financial audit and
   project evaluation, and increasing community participation and financial
   investment.}},

Title = {{Hollywood versus the Internet: the media and entertainment industries in

Abstract = {{The behaviour of oligopolistic firms is a source of considerable debate
   and concern, given their market power and ability to shape the
   development of new markets. A key area of debate concerns the scope for
   strategic adaptation in oligopolies; and in particular, the extent to
   which such large and otherwise successful firms ignore or marginalize
   important shifts in the marketplace. In this article, I critically
   evaluate these general theoretical issues through the lens of a
   specific, geographically bounded case study: the collision between
   Hollywood, a mature oligopoly comprising six studios, and the Internet,
   a decentralized architecture that has made possible peer-to-peer (P2P)
   file sharing between networked computers. I argue that in a secure form
   (enforced by `digital rights management' software), file sharing has
   considerable promise for all copyright owners, including the studios. I
   examine the oligopolistic behaviour of the studios in response to the
   Internet, and in particular, their response to an alternative mode of
   peer-based film distribution, oriented around legal, paid-for file
   sharing. I argue that the studios are trying to preserve the
   oligopolistic structure of the industry in a digital age by promoting an
   inefficient and restrictive `design' for Internet distribution, oriented
   around centralized server-client architectures, which provides tight
   control over digital commodities and minimizes the disruptive impact of
   the Internet. This behaviour must be understood in light of the social
   and economic incentives that influence executives, as well as the
   context in which decision-making takes place. Nonetheless, their
   response also raises some worrying questions about the future shape of
   creativity, distribution and consumption in the film industry (and in
   the broader realm of media and entertainment) in a digital and networked
   economy. The article is based on over 150 interviews with elites in the
   studios and other related firms in the Los Angeles region.}},

   and on a deterministic watermarking procedure, embedding a short
   meaningful or random signature into the image. Experimental results show
   that the inserted signature can almost always be fully recovered even in
   presence of a reasonable amount of image degradation due to image
   processing operators, such as filtering, geometric distortions and
   compression. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carpal skeleton shows drastic developmental changes during
   embryogenesis. At this stage, the cartilaginous matrices appear and
   later form models of the limb bones. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the morphometry of carpal bones in humans during
   embryological development. We obtained digitalized histological serial
   sections of 18 human embryos and early fetuses from the Institute of
   Anatomy in Paris. Surfdriver and MSC Patran software were used for
   three-dimensional reconstruction and morphometry. There was a strong
   correlation between the volume of the carpal cartilaginous structure and
   the size of the embryos (P < 0.001) and an exponential correlation
   between the carpal volume and the percentage of volume presented by the
   proximal carpal row (P=0.005). According to inertia parameters, the
   geometry of carpal cartilaginous structure, initially plane, becomes
   curved during embryogenesis. Carpal bones growth follows non-homothetic
   transformation. The innovations in embryo reconstruction serve as new
   tool for scientific investigation. A hypothesis of carpal development is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray computed tomography (CT), introduced into clinical practice in
   1972, was the first of the modern slice-imaging modalities. To
   reconstruct images mathematically from measured data and to display and
   to archive them in digital form was a novelty then and is commonplace
   today. CT has shown a steady upward trend with respect to technology,
   performance and clinical use independent of predictions and expert
   assessments which forecast in the 1980s that it would be completely
   replaced by magnetic resonance imaging. CT not only survived but
   exhibited a true renaissance due to the introduction of spiral scanning
   which meant the transition from slice-by-slice imaging to true volume
   imaging. Complemented by the introduction of array detector technology
   in the 1990s, CT today allows imaging of whole organs or the whole body
   in 5 to 20 s with sub-millimetre isotropic resolution. This review of CT
   will proceed in chronological order focussing on technology, image
   quality and clinical applications. In its final part it will also
   briefly allude to novel uses of CT such as dual-source CT, C-arm
   flat-panel-detector CT and micro-CT. At present CT possibly exhibits a
   higher innovation rate than ever before. In consequence the topical and
   most recent developments will receive the greatest attention.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate evaluation of current underground infrastructure must be
   done before any crucial decisions regarding lifecycle analysis,
   rehabilitation and replacement intervals and appropriate remedial
   methods can be made. Unfortunately, traditional technologies and

   This paper describes an innovative method for assessment of underground
   pipe, utilizing Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Digital Scanning and
   Evaluation Technology (DSET) to collect accurate information about the
   condition of a buried pipeline. Prediction modeling, using logistic
   regression, to measure the extent of deterioration of the infrastructure

Abstract = {{The imperatives of social cohesion make it necessary to consider the
   highly variable characteristics of users alongside the design and
   implementation of IT networks and services. In this context much has
   been written on the so-called `digital divide' in society. Recent
   ESRC-funded research at UCL has illustrated how it is simplistic to
   think of the impacts of new information and communication technologies
   (ICTs) in terms of a single, or even small number of, `digital divides'.
   As developments in what has been termed the `e-society' reach wider and
   more generalised audiences, so it becomes appropriate to think of
   digital media as having wider-ranging but differentiated impacts upon
   consumer transactions, information gathering and citizen participation.
   This paper describes the development of a detailed, nationwide household
   classification based on levels of awareness of different ICTs, levels of
   use of ICTs, and their perceived impacts upon human capital formation
   and the quality of life. It illustrates how geodemographic
   classification makes it possible to provide context for detailed case
   studies, and hence identify how policy might best improve both the
   quality and degree of society's access to ICTs. We have provided a more
   detailed overview of the methodology elsewhere {[}1, 2] and here we also
   illustrate how the classification may be used to investigate a range of
   regional and sub-regional policy issues.
   A particularly innovative aspect of this classification is the Web
   resource hosted at www.spatial-literacy.org/esocietyprofiler. This site
   makes it possible to look at the classification system, aggregated to
   unit postcodes, across Great Britain. Users can look at national
   distributions for each of the groups and types in the classification,
   and offer feedback as to whether the classification appears to work for
   any locality.}},

Abstract = {{An inherent disadvantage of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is its
   sensitivity to patient motion which causes artifacts in the subtraction
   images. These artifacts could often reduce the diagnostic value of this
   technique. Automated, fast and accurate motion compensation is therefore
   required. To cope with this requirement, we first examine a method
   explicitly designed to detect local motions in DSA. Then, we implement a
   motion compensation algorithm by means of block matching on modern
   graphics hardware. Both methods search for maximal local similarity by
   evaluating a histogram-based measure. In this context, we are the first
   who have mapped an optimizing search strategy on graphics hardware while
   paralleling block matching. Moreover, we provide an innovative method
   for creating histograms on graphics hardware with vertex texturing and
   frame buffer blending. It turns out that both methods can effectively
   correct the artifacts in most case, as the hardware implementation of
   block matching performs much faster: the displacements of two 1024 x
   1024 images can be calculated at 3 frames/s with integer precision or 2
   frames/s with sub-pixel precision. Preliminary clinical evaluation
   indicates that the computation with integer precision could already be
   sufficient. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The current repair process for worn-out turbine blades and blisks is
   very manual, and experience based and hence is error-prone. It requires
   sophisticated CNC-driven (Computer Numerical Control) laser equipment to
   replace manual welding for the repair. This paper presents an innovative
   strategy that can lead to the automation of laser welding and cladding.
   The project makes use of reverse engineering techniques to capture the
   geometric shape of the worn area by digitized point cloud and nominal
   geometry. The core software technologies include four aspects: (i)
   point-to-surface-best-fitting technology that puts the point cloud
   coordinate system nominal CAD (Computer Aided Design) coordinate system,
   (ii) a procedure to extract a worn boundary that automatically separates
   the worn area and the undamaged area, (iii) geometric model
   representation for the worn area, and (iv) generation of an STL file to
   drive the CNC laser machine. The tool has been implemented using UG API
   (Unigraphics Application Programming Interface). Some experimental
   results have shown that the presented strategy is efficient for repair
   automation.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with active vibration suppression in a suspended
   Fabry-Perot cavity, employed as the sensor in an innovative
   thrust-stand, called Nanobalance. The Nanobalance aims to exploit the
   sensitivity of in-vacuum Fabry-Perot interferometers to sub-nanometric
   displacements in order to measure thrust (< 1 mN) and noise of space
   microthrusters with micronewton accuracy. The instrument has been
   conceived around an in-vacuum optical Fabry-Perot cavity embraced by two
   pendulums (the active and the passive) suspended to an athermic, spacer.
   The thruster under test is mounted on the active pendulum and an equal
   dummy thruster is mounted on the passive one for balancing. The
   objective of the paper is to suppress the beat motion centered on the
   mean pendulum natural frequency (10-14 Hz depending on the thruster
   under test) without affecting the measurement bandwidth (2 Hz) where
   thrust has to be measured. Beat motion arises because of small pendulum
   imbalances excited by ground noise. Relevant digital control strategies
   and experimental results will be presented and discussed. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{This study proposed the vision-based system which remotely measures
   dynamic displacement of bridges in real-time using digital image
   processing techniques. This system has a number of innovative features
   including a high resolution in dynamic measurement, remote sensing,
   cost-effectiveness, real-time measurement and visualization, ease of
   installation and operation and no electro-magnetic interference. The
   digital video camera combined with a telescopic device takes a motion
   picture of the target installed on a measurement location. Meanwhile,
   the displacement of the target is calculated using an image processing
   technique, which requires a target recognition algorithm, projection of
   the captured image. and calculation of the actual displacement using
   target geometry and number of pixels moved. For the purpose of
   verification, a laboratory test using shaking table test and field
   application on a bridge with open-box girders were carried out. The test
   results gave sufficient dynamic resolution in frequency as well as the

Abstract = {{In today's digital economy, knowledge is regarded as an asset, and the
   implementation of knowledge management supports a company in developing
   innovative products and making critical management strategic decisions.
   Product innovation must link technological competence such as
   engineering and process know-how with knowledge about the customer, so
   that the product will meet the customers' needs, in order to secure
   market acceptance. Even though the importance of knowledge management in
   the technological innovation of a product has long been recognized, its
   potential for customer knowledge management has not been widely
   researched.
   To address the importance of the need of customer knowledge in
   innovative product development, this paper proposes an E-CKM model with
   a methodology for precisely delineating the process of customer
   knowledge management for innovative product development. In the
   knowledge management domain, an important task is the conversion of
   tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, allowing information
   technology, such as web-based surveys and data mining to extract
   customer knowledge from different market segments. An empirical study
   applying the E-CKM model has been carried out, and it meets the
   evaluation criteria in a multiple-assessment scheme for showing a
   satisfactory result. The result is used in the decision making for
   innovative product development in order to reduce project risk and
   secure commercial success. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposed a model for security technology adoption and
   implementation through the examination of factors affecting adoption and
   implementation of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology. In the
   early 1990s, PKI was widely believed to be the panacea for solving a
   number of security issues that would open the door for
   business-to-business (13213) electronic commerce. However, history has
   demonstrated a lack of broad-based adoption of PKI by organizations,
   although the use of digital certificates has become fairly prevalent.
   Why has implementation of the PKI technology been so narrow? What are
   the factors that mediate security technology adoption and
   implementation? Technology use, diffusion and adoption literature
   provide a conceptual framework and theoretical motivation for examining
   the case of PKI. Additional insight is provided by the examination of
   the experience of a few organizations that have, to some degree,
   implemented PKI technology, supplemented by a review of published
   information on other organizational PKI experiences. The combination of
   theoretical and practical considerations yield a security implementation
   model that we believe sheds light on the factors affecting PKI
   implementation and shows promise for examination of security technology
   adoption in general. We believe that the model and the research that
   supports it has important implications for both academics and
   practitioners in gaining a better understanding of the process for
   adoption of security technologies by public and private organizations.

Abstract = {{Rotary kilns are widely used in industry to achieve effective gas-solid
   heat transfer at high temperatures by direct contact with hot flue gases
   obtained by combustion. However, various disturbances related to
   nonpremixed combustion often used in practice introduces undesired
   variability in product quality and forces overheating, especially when
   obtaining the desired quality is dependent upon reaching a minimal
   solids discharge temperature. This paper investigates the use of digital
   RGB flame images and multivariate image analysis (MIA) techniques to
   quantify these combustion-related variations and to predict the future
   behavior of product quality. Very good solids discharge temperature
   forecasts were obtained over a time window running from current time t
   to about the mean residence time within the kiln using only a single
   flame image collected at time t. This information will be used to
   develop innovative automatic flame image-based control schemes to
   improve quality control and reduce fuel consumption.}},

Abstract = {{There are several research projects going on around the world, which are
   attempting to develop a prosthetic device to restore sight to the blind.
   This paper describes the efforts of Second Sight of New York, Inc. The
   device being developed is called an Artificial epi-Retinal Prosthesis
   (AeRP), which is basically a small optical computer that fits into the
   intraocular space of the eye. The AeRP is designed to draw light into
   the device by specially designed fibre optics. The light is `digitized'
   by the fibre optic system and then directed to individual photodiode
   cells making up concentric cylinders thus providing several hundred
   photodiode cells in the device. The produced electrical stimulation from
   each cell is then delivered to the retinal ganglion cells by a specially
   designed delivery system utilizing electrically conducting polymer
   strands (ECP), which sit on an `umbrella' at the back of the device. The
   retinal ganglion cells receive the electrical stimulation, which would
   then be transmitted through the visual system of the brain. There are
   several innovations in this approach as compared to the other projects.
   They include, first the design, which will allow for a high number of PC
   to produce electrical stimulation that will stimulate multiple RGC per
   PC; the use of the ECP strands has not been used in such an approach
   before this. Tests have revealed that nerve cells have a good affinity
   for the material of the ECP. The use of the ECP as well as the fact that
   the AeRP is completely photovoltaic, with no external power sources,
   implies that there will not be high heat build-up in the back of the
   eye, which might damage RGC. A smaller version of the AeRP called the
   Mini epi-Retinal Prosthesis (MeRP) is the subject of a complimentary
   paper. It is being built now and will be tested in cell culture studies
   to determine the efficacy of the design and materials. No actual
   implants have been performed yet.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of superior connectivity and integration technologies is
   paving the way for flexible electronic partnering options. Such
   flexibility is essential if a company wants to attract a large number of
   partners (with varying connectivity needs and preferences) to its supply
   chain network. This article conceptualizes twelve electronic partnering
   options. It then discusses the various types of sensemaking and
   conversion challenges that companies encounter in developing this
   critical electronic business (e-business) capability and proposes a
   multi-pronged approach to effectively deal with them. This approach
   involves four distinct but synergistic campaigns of
   digitization-strategic congruency, organizational design, technology
   infrastructure, and relational campaigns. The utility of this approach
   is illustrated by examples of successful business-to-business (B2B)
   digitization initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Digital games are now the second most popular form of entertainment
   after television. The extraordinary imagery in today's games, comparable
   to that found in film and TV, coupled with its increasing complexity and
   realism, have broadened the appeal of electronic entertainment to
   include adults as well as adolescents and children. Similar to the
   explosion of interest in screenwriting and directing that accompanied
   the growth of the film and TV industries, many creative thinkers today
   see interactive entertainment as the most innovative and culturally
   pertinent mode of expression available to them.
   The purpose of games education is not to fill the ranks of the game
   industry but to fully explore the nature of the medium, to gauge its
   potential, and to articulate a creative vision not limited by current
   technological capabilities. A play-centric: approach to the study of
   games is a. step toward that ultimate goal.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents two applications of haptic technologies to
   demonstrate how they can increase human computer interaction during
   different steps of design process. The first application aims at
   developing a system to generate digital shapes by manipulating haptic
   tools that resemble the physical ones that the modelers use in everyday
   work. The second is focused on the use of haptic interfaces to evaluate
   ergonomics of virtual products control boards. We designed and developed
   the mentioned haptic devices, the first uses two FCS HapticMaster
   equipped with a innovative strong and stiff 6 DOF device carrying
   simulated clay modeling tools. The second is an ``ad hoc{''} mechatronic
   device able to simulate some controls with rotary motions (knobs). The
   described haptic devices are integrated in more complex virtual reality
   applications; the paper describes their architecture and the
   methodologies proposed to Simulate material shaping and ergonomic
   validation. The main aspects of haptic modeling and rendering are also
   discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Digital flat-panel-based volume CT (VCT) represents a unique design
   capable of ultra-high spatial resolution, direct volumetric imaging, and
   dynamic CT scanning. This innovation, when fully developed, has the
   promise of opening a unique window on human anatomy and physiology. For
   example, the volumetric coverage offered by this technology enables us
   to observe the perfusion of an entire organ, such as the brain, liver,
   or kidney, tomographically (e.g., after a transplant or ischemic event).
   By virtue of its higher resolution, one can directly visualize the
   trabecular structure of bone. This paper describes the basic design
   architecture of VCT. Three key technical challenges, viz., scatter
   correction, dynamic range extension, and temporal resolution
   improvement, must be addressed for successful implementation of a VCT
   scanner. How these issues are solved in a VCT prototype and the
   modifications necessary to enable ultra-high resolution volumetric
   scanning are described. The fundamental principles of scatter correction
   and dose reduction are illustrated with the help of an actual prototype.
   The image quality metrics of this prototype are characterized and
   compared with a multi-detector CT (MDCT).}},

Abstract = {{Latches and flip-flops play important roles in the building of digital
   CMOS circuits. In the paper, a new low-power positive level-sensitive
   latch and a simple and innovative dynamic pulse generator are proposed.
   The pulse generator is then used with the proposed latch to create a
   low-power and high-performance single edge-triggered flip-flop (SETFF).
   The proposed positive level-sensitive latch deploys two non-precharge
   (static) n-stages (SN) in a true-single-phase-clocking (TSPC) scheme. We
   therefore named our latch SN2. This is because the TSPC latches have the
   advantage of single clock distribution, less clock routing area,
   high-speed and no clock skew. Based on the 0.18-mu m single-poly
   six-metal CMOS technology, the SPECTRE simulation results derived for
   typical input activities showed that the latch can attain a maximum
   power saving of 29.1\% when compared to other reported designs. As for
   our proposed flip-flop that is derived from the proposed SN2 latch with
   incorporation of a dynamic pulse generator circuit, it is able to
   outperform other reported works by about 16.2\% to 67.4\% for its
   power-delay product (PDPCQ) that is taken with respect to the
   clock-to-output delay. The two new designs are therefore suitable for
   used in low-power and high-performance CMOS VLSI/ULSI applications.}},

Abstract = {{The RFX-mod experiment is resuming operation after a five-year shutdown
   during which significant machine modifications have been done to improve
   plasma controllability. Its scientific program is focused on the
   exploitation of innovative plasma control techniques, including
   magneto-hydrodynamic mode control. To allow a variety of control
   schemes,on the experiment, a distributed, digital, real time control
   system has been developed and commissioned. This includes a set of
   computing nodes (currently seven), exchanging data in real time during
   the plasma discharge. Characteristic figures of the control schemes
   implemented in the experiment are: pulsed operation with one 200 ms
   pulse every 10 minutes, large amount of input/output channels.
   (currently about 740 input and 270 output channels), maximum latency
   time in the range 0.3-2 ms depending on control applications. The paper,
   after a brief discussion on the system architecture, presents the
   control operational scenarios, focusing on the system commissioning and
   the first results achieved in operation.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative in-core flux mapping system has been developed and applied
   successfully for service in commercial pressurized water reactors. With
   the benefit of double indexing path selector mechanism, the reliability
   of the detector drive system has been improved five times higher than
   that of a conventional system. The problems caused by strong friction
   generated between the detector cable and guide tubes have been resolved
   by the double indexing path selector architecture enabling the detector
   guide tubes to have smaller curvature and shorter length in nature. The
   system normally exerts two-thirds of force to make the detector reach
   the top of the fuel position, compared with conventional ones. In
   addition, simple and fast maintenance is realized by optimizing the
   number of components in the detector drive system and providing easy
   access to the components, thereby guaranteeing minimum radiation
   exposure to maintenance personnel. The programmable logic
   controller-based digital controller with Windows(R)-based operator
   console provides fully automated and user-friendly operation and
   maintenance support means. The developed in-core flux mapping systems
   have been deployed at the Kori nuclear units 1-4. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The challenge in Aerospace Engineering, in the next two decades as set
   by Vision 2020, is to meet the targets of reduction of nitric oxide
   emission by 80\%, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide both by 50\%,
   reduce noise by 50\% and of course with reduced cost and improved
   safety. All this must be achieved with expected increase in capacity and
   demand. Such a challenge has to be in a background where the
   understanding of physics of flight has changed very little over the
   years and where industrial growth is driven primarily by cost rather
   than new technology.
   The way forward to meet the challenges is to introduce innovative
   technologies and develop an integrated, effective and efficient process
   for the life cycle design of aircraft, known as systems engineering
   (SE). SE is a holistic approach to a product that comprises several
   components. Customer specifications, conceptual design, risk analysis,
   functional analysis and architecture, physical architecture, design
   analysis and synthesis, and trade studies and optimisation,
   manufacturing, testing validation and verification, delivery, life cycle
   cost and management. Further, it involves interaction between
   traditional disciplines such as Aerodynamics, Structures and Flight
   Mechanics with people- and process-oriented disciplines such as
   Management, Manufacturing, and Technology Transfer.
   SE has become the state-of-the-art methodology for organising and
   managing aerospace production. However, like many well founded
   methodologies, it is more difficult to embody the core principles into
   formalised models and tools. The key contribution of the paper will be
   to review this formalisation and to present the very latest knowledge
   and technology that facilitates SE theory. Typically, research into SE
   provides a deeper understanding of the core principles and interactions,
   and helps one to appreciate the required technical architecture for
   fully exploiting it as a process, rather than a series of events.
   There are major issues as regards to systems approach to aircraft design
   and these include lack of basic scientific/practical models and tools
   for interfacing and integrating the components of SE and within a given
   component, for example, life cycle cost, basic models for linking the
   key drivers. The paper will review the current state of art in SE
   approach to aircraft design and identify some of the major challenges,
   the current state of the art and visions for the future. The review
   moves from an initial basis in traditional engineering design processes
   to consideration of costs and manufacturing in this integrated
   environment. Issues related to the implementation of integration in
   design at the detailed physics level are discussed in the case studies.

Abstract = {{Six forestry scientific and technological projects being actualized in
   China were the implementations of ecological construction and security,
   development of forestry biological technique and fine variety
   cultivation, protection and utilization of forest biological germplasm
   resources, development of forestry bio-industry and digital forestry,
   and construction of forestry innovation ability. Among them, digital
   forestry was an effective measure to improve the ability of forestry
   innovation, to realize resources sharing, and to develop sustainable
   forestry. Spatial database of digital forestry should be constructed
   according to the criteria and index system of forest sustainable
   management. Based on analyzing the status and advances of China's
   digital forestry construction, a database framework of digital forestry
   towards sustainable forestry development was studied and established
   preparatorily. The database was divided into four layers as theory
   layer, system layer, status layer, and parameter layer. It was concluded
   that during the process of digital forestry platform construction, the
   relative social, economic, and politic data should be considered and
   collected, which meant that the database should represent not only the
   current forestry development, but also the social, politic, and economic
   situations. Constructing China's digital forestry information platform
   under full utilization of idea and index system for sustainable forest
   management was urgent and important.}},

Abstract = {{Howard Malmstadt was a true giant of Analytical Chemistry and clearly
   one of the most influential analytical chemists of the last 50 years.
   Howard, through his own work and that of his students (first generation)
   and their students (second generation) and their students' students
   (third generation) changed the course of Analytical Chemistry. His
   research interests were broad and ranged from analytical solution
   chemistry (titrimetry and reaction rates) and electrochemistry to atomic
   and molecular spectroscopy, chemical instrumentation, clinical chemistry
   and automation. Howard was also one of the most innovative and
   influential educators of our time. He changed forever the analytical
   curriculum through his many books on Electronics for Scientists, most
   written in conjunction with Chris Enke and Stan Crouch. Their texts and
   short courses went from pioneering the application of tube-based analog
   electronics (servo systems and operational amplifiers) in scientific
   measurements to the impact that integrated circuits and digital
   electronics would have on laboratory measurements. He strongly believed
   in the importance of ``handson{''} in education. To this end, he
   expended considerable personal effort and time to see not only the
   development and commercialization of an effective laboratory
   infrastructure to support education in analog and digital electronics,
   but also oversaw the development of modular instrumentation for
   spectroscopy. Over the years he received many awards from the Analytical
   Chemistry community for his outstanding efforts and contributions to
   teaching and research. Many of Howard's students went on into academia.
   They and their students now represent the ongoing legacy for analytical
   chemistry that evolved from Howard's laboratory at Illinois. A
   remarkable diversity of research programs are underway in their
   laboratories. Topics range from atomic, laser, mass, and Raman
   spectroscopy to detection technology, analytical education,
   micro-fabricated instrumentation, and intercellular analytical
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{In the digital economy, knowledge is regarded as an asset in an
   organization, and knowledge management (KM) implementation supports a
   company in developing innovative products and making critical management
   strategic decisions for business excellence. Customer relationship
   management (CRM) is an information-technology-enabling management tool,
   which manages the relationship with customers to understand, target, and
   attract them, with the objective of satisfying and retaining customers.
   Their synergy potential draws attention in the academic community and
   has led to the emergence of the customer knowledge management (CKM)
   model. In a knowledge management domain, an important task is the
   conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, whereby the
   well-established Kano's Method has come up to demand and extract
   customer knowledge for attractive quality creation in new product
   development projects. As a consequence, this study proposes a Kano-CKM
   model with a methodology to delineate precisely the process of customer
   knowledge discovery for innovative product development. An industry
   level market research project applying the Kano-CKM model has been
   accomplished to present a satisfactory justification and will be
   described in the case study part of this article.}},

Abstract = {{The Enamel Defects Index (EDI) was created based on three innovative
   principles: (i) a basic level of the three major categories of defects;
   (ii) more detailed subcategories of each major category; and (iii) each
   category scored independently as present {[}1] or absent {[}0],
   simplifying decision making. The aim of this investigation was to
   further test the index in a number of applications and to expand it to
   record defect subtype and treatment need. Testing was undertaken by
   operators with different levels of clinical experience. A
   computer-assisted learning (CAL) package was developed for operator
   training and calibration. The index was also used on clinical
   photographs and high-resolution digital images of exfoliated and
   extracted teeth. Scoring of photographs revealed substantial
   intra-operator agreement. Training using the CAL package resulted in
   significant improvement in index use. Intra-operator reproducibility was
   good to excellent, and interoperator reproducibility was good for buccal
   surfaces on digital images. Index expansion allowed information on
   defect subtype, location, and treatment need to be gathered readily. The
   EDI has high reproducibility and allows more rapid and accurate data
   collection from clinical and in vitro studies than the Federation
   Dentaire Internationale Developmental Defects of Enamel index.}},

Abstract = {{While many electronic commerce (EC) companies are adopting one-to-one
   marketing approaches using various personalization technologies to make
   their products and services unique for the purpose of attracting and
   retaining customers and improving their completion edges in the EC
   ecosystem, which, nevertheless, has low entrance barriers for new
   players to join and further intensify the competition, none or few of
   them consider a fundamental issue-the user's product-specific knowledge.
   Our research proposed to add this new domain of the customer's knowledge
   on appropriate target products into the personalization process as a
   part of the overall EC strategy for businesses. In this paper, we
   present our initial design for assessing the user's product-specific
   knowledge using the proposed innovative method for detecting it directly
   in a non-intrusive way without asking users to answer or fill out any
   types of questionnaires. Our method is based on customer's on-line
   navigation behaviors by analyzing their navigation patterns through
   pre-trained artificial neural networks. An empirical study designed for
   a case of EC store selling digital cameras was conducted in our research
   to prove the concept, and a good preliminary result was derived from the
   study.
   For the purpose of comparing the performances between the conventional
   approach of using questionnaire and the proposed innovative approach of
   navigation pattern mining, a questionnaire based approach for evaluating
   the user's product-specific knowledge was designed and incorporated into
   our knowledge level assessment system (KLAS). Our study result shows
   that although the pure questionnaire-based KLAS is intrusive and may not
   be accepted by some users, for those users willing to complete the
   questionnaire, the proposed navigation pattern approach can be combined
   with the questionnaire-based approach to create a hybrid KLAS which has
   a significantly improved accuracy rate in detecting the customer's
   product knowledge level. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The acceleration of labor productivity growth that began during the
   mid-1990s is the defining economic event of the past decade. A consensus
   has arisen among economists that the acceleration was caused by
   technological innovations that decreased the quality-adjusted prices of
   semiconductors and related information and communications technology
   (ICT) products, including digital computers. In sharp contrast to the
   previous 20 years, services-producing sectors-heavy users of ICT
   products-led the productivity increase, besting even a robust
   manufacturing sector. In this article, the authors survey the
   performance of the services-producing and goods-producing sectors and
   examine revisions to aggregate labor productivity data of the type
   commonly discussed by policymakers. The revisions, at times, were large
   enough to reverse preliminary conclusions regarding productivity growth
   slowdowns and accelerations. The unanticipated acceleration in the
   services sector and the large size of revisions to aggregate data
   combine to shed light on why economists were slow to recognize the
   productivity acceleration.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Use of vaginal douche products has been linked with a variety
   of reproductive health problems; nonetheless, the practice of douching
   persists. The goals of this study were to 1) determine the use of
   vaginal douches and other feminine hygiene products, 2) ascertain how
   safe women think vaginal douche products are, and 3) evaluate women's
   readiness to stop douching.
   Methods: A random-digit-dial computer-assisted telephone survey was
   conducted among US women between the ages of 18 and 44.
   Results: Of the 2,602 women interviewed, 11.8\% (n = 307) engaged in
   regular douching (White: 9.1\%; African American: 27.7\%; Hispanic:
   15.0\%). Women who douched, compared to women who did not douche, used
   other feminine hygiene products significantly more often (vaginal sprays
   {[}p <.0001], wipes/towelettes {[}p < 0.01], vaginal powder {[}p <
   0.0001] and bubble bath for feminine cleansing {[}p < 0.001]). Women who
   douched also were more likely than nondouchers to agree with the
   statement, ``Douche products are safe to use; otherwise they wouldn't be
   on the market{''} (70.3\% vs. 33.4\%, respectivcly; p < 0.0001). Nearly
   all women (90.0\%) who douched had no intention to discontinue the
   practice.
   Conclusion: Compared with women who do not douche, women who douche use
   other feminine hygiene products at a much higher rate and also believe
   that douche products are safe. Women who douche will remain resistant to
   Stopping the practice without innovative interventions. Given that most
   women start douching in adolescence, teens should be targeted for
   prevention efforts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of an extensive study concerning surge
   instability in an industrial compression system and its dynamic
   suppression. Both numerical simulations and experiments have been used
   to analyse the system behaviour under unstable operating conditions and
   to compare different control devices for surge suppression. First, the
   characterization of surge is performed over the whole unstable operating
   range of a compression system based on a four-stage centrifugal
   compressor. The unsteady energy associated with the surge cycle is
   employed as an index of the surge intensity to allow for a quantitative
   approach to the problem. Subsequently, the behaviour and performance of
   a passive-type control system and of an active-type one are analysed and
   compared. The former consists of an innovative device based on an
   oscillating water column, whereas the latter is a high-gain type of
   feedback device implemented digitally. Experimental data show that the
   proposed passive device is effective not only in inhibiting surge
   development, but also in suppressing fully developed instability. The
   active device turns out to be more effective than the passive one, but
   under severe conditions it may fail because of actuator limitations and
   noise amplification. Finally, the relative merits and limitations of the
   two control systems are discussed with reference to their effectiveness
   range, flexibility, steady-state performance, installation, maintenance,
   and costs.}},

Abstract = {{The author provides an overview of the history and current state of
   Hebraica cataloguing at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, one of the
   world's greatest collections of Hebrew manuscripts and early printed
   works. Thanks to an innovative project of cooperation between the Herzog
   August Bibliothek Wolfenbuttel (HAB, Duke August Library) and the
   Bodleian Library, which was subsidized between 2003-2005 by the German
   Research Foundation, 211 of altogether 261 early Hebrew, Yiddish and
   Aramaic editions in the Wolfenbuttel collection were catalogued in
   Oxford, where in some cases up to six duplicates are being held.
   Editions that are only held in Wolfenbuttel were catalogued there.
   All bibliographic records were created in the original Hebrew and in
   transliteration in RLIN, the bibliographic database of the Research
   Libraries Group. The catalogue entries for all 359 copies in Oxford are
   accessible via OLIS, the OPAC of Oxford University, including internal
   administrative data and call numbers. The catalogue entries for all 299
   Wolfenbuttel copies, including extensive holding details, are available
   on the website of the HAB. Incorporation of these Unicode records into
   the Northern German Union Catalogue (GVK), which runs on PICA, is
   currently being tested at the University of Gottingen. In total, 657
   copies held by both libraries were catalogued within this project.
   Instead of using shelf-classification, subject access was provided by
   using keywords controlled by the thesaurus of the Library of Congress.
   The descriptive and analytical sections of the bibliographic records
   follow the rules of Anglo-American and Oxford-specific cataloguing,
   while German standards were applied to the digitization of key pages and
   the cataloguing of individual copies from Wolfenbuttel collection.
   Special mention is made of the influence of the new Unicode standards on
   the trend toward cataloguing works in non-Latin script in their original
   language.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of intracranial aneurysms has been revolutionized since
   the introduction of electrolytically detachable platinum coils in 1991.
   Since this basic innovation, many refinements of the embolic materials
   and techniques have emerged. Today, in Europe, half of all aneurysms are
   treated endoarterially and this share is growing. The reassuring results
   of the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) have changed the
   treatment strategy from neurosurgical clipping to embolization. However,
   the role of these alternative modes of treatment varies between
   institutions and countries. An angiographic follow-up pattern after
   endovascular treatment has remained largely undefined and in the same
   way there has been much diversity in applying alternative imaging
   modalities. Although some institutions continue to perform intervalled
   digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance angiography has
   assumed an increasing role. A vast majority of patients with embolized
   aneurysms are eligible to be monitored solely by non-contrast
   three-dimensional time-of-flight technique.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the technical characteristics of a newly developed device
   for bipolar and multipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of kidney
   tissue with a resistance-controlled power output.
   The standardized model of the isolated perfused ex vivo porcine kidney
   was used. Two different applicators (20 and 30 mm active length) were
   selected for bipolar RFA, and one pair of applicators (2 x 30 mm active
   length) for multipolar RFA. RF energy was applied at different power
   levels (20, 30, 60 W) depending on the total active length of the
   electrodes. Treatment times were 1, 3, 5 and 9 min. The ablation cycles
   were recorded in continuous digital real-time and displayed on a monitor
   showing pre-set power, actual applied power, applied energy, tissue
   resistance, and impedance. Lesion sizes were measured macroscopically. A
   coagulation coefficient (coagulated tissue volume per applied energy
   unit) was calculated.
   There was a dosage-effect relationship between the generator
   power/treatment time and the sizes of the lesions. With increasing
   treatment time, less tissue volume was coagulated per unit of applied
   energy. The actual applied energy was lower than that calculated
   theoretically. The resistance and impedance values for the 30-W
   applicator were lower than those of the 20-W applicator.
   The technical features of this RFA device, with internally cooled
   bipolar and multipolar applicators and a resistance-controlled power
   output, represents an innovative improvement in RF technology. In vivo
   studies are needed to confirm the expected advantages and the
   suitability of this device for complete and reliable ablation of renal
   tumours.}},

   Compared with existing designs, the proposed scheme provides an optimal

Abstract = {{Within media theory the worldwide shift from a 19th-century print
   culture via a 20th-century electronic culture to a 21st-century digital
   culture is well documented. In this essay the emergence of a digital
   culture as amplified and accelerated by the popularity of networked
   computers, multiple-user software, and Internet is investigated in terms
   of its principal components. A digital culture as an underdetermined
   praxis is conceptualized as consisting of participation, remediation,
   and bricolage. Using the literature on presumably ``typical{''} Internet
   phenomena such as the worldwide proliferation of independent media
   centers (indymedia) linked with (radical) online journalism practices
   and the popularity of (individual and group) weblogging, the various
   meanings and implications of this particular understanding of digital
   culture are explored. In the context of this essay, digital culture can
   be seen as an emerging set of values, practices, and expectations
   regarding the way people (should) act and interact within the
   contemporary network society. This digital culture has emergent
   properties with roots in both online and offline phenomena, with links
   to trends and developments predating the World Wide Web, yet having an
   immediate impact and particularly changing the ways in which we use and
   give meaning to living in an increasingly interconnected, always on(
   line) environment.}},

Abstract = {{As companies race to digitize physical-based service processes
   repackaging them as online e-services, it becomes increasingly important
   to understand how consumers perceive the digitized e-service
   alternative. We theorize that consumers often perceive e-services as
   being artificial and non-authentic, and that consumers must perform this
   assessment when deciding whether new e-services are viable alternatives
   to traditional service methods. This research investigates whether
   consumer perceptions of artificiality increase perceptions of e-service
   risk, which has been shown to hamper consumer acceptance in a variety of
   online settings. An empirical study operationalized perceived
   artificiality (PA) within a controlled laboratory experiment that
   manipulated the risk of a specific e-service class (e-payments). For a
   specific e-service brand, PA is reduced when the web interface is viewed
   as easy to use; alternatively, PA is increased when consumers have
   relatively high risk perceptions about the overall e-service class.
   Furthermore, consumers who were rated as information technology
   innovators had lower overall artificiality perceptions, however,
   exposure to negatively framed e-service efficacy information removed
   this artificiality reducing effect. The theoretical linkages between PA
   and perceived risk, and the two antecedents - ease of use and e-service
   class risk - were confirmed by survey results. The implications of these
   results for future research as well as the design and marketing of
   e-services are examined.}},

Abstract = {{There is a strong history of social science research within Latin
   America, but its visibility (both within and outside the region) has
   been low for reasons of language and print distribution. The
   introduction of the Internet and online publication makes this
   information potentially more visible to the global research community,
   and within Latin America several organizations have undertaken to
   exploit this opportunity. The approaches taken show how collaboration
   between countries, and particularly between librarians and publishers,
   can provide innovative solutions. The CLACSO project uses a digital
   library model as a publishing platform for its member journals and this
   has provided a successful - and hopefully sustainable - model.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop an innovative, rapid and
   economical assessment methodology to determine the knowledge, attitudes
   and behaviours regarding eye health and to determine the rates of the
   most common causes of visual impairment and undiagnosed eye disease.
   Methods: Letters were posted to Seniors Card holders aged 70-79 in 18
   randomly selected areas, stratified by socio-economic status. A
   questionnaire was developed to measure knowledge, attitudes and
   behaviours regarding eye health. Uncorrected refractive error was
   determined by measuring presenting and best-corrected visual acuity
   (VA). Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneratiori were
   assessed using digital non-mydriatic retinal photography. Glaucoma was
   assessed using Frequency Doubling Technology (FDT) and digital images of
   the optic nerve head. Cataract was determined using digital
   retroillumination images of the lens taken with a non-mydriatic camera.
   The cost for recruiting, examining and grading images for each
   participant was calculated by dividing the total study cost by the
   number of participants examined. Results: Of the 13,483 participants
   invited to participate in the study, appointments were made for 1860
   (13.8\%) people with 1701 (91\%) actually attending. Overall, missing
   data from the 1695 questionnaires represented less than 1.0\% and all
   participants attended the vision screening over a three-month period.
   Presenting and best-corrected visual acuity and FDT results on both eyes
   were obtained on 99\% of the sample. The proportion of gradable digital
   images of the fundus in both eyes in the sample was 89\%, while 90\% of
   participants with bilateral presenting VA < 6/12 had assessable lens
   images. The cost for recruiting, examining and grading images for each
   participant was approximately AUS\$150. Conclusion: The recruitment from
   a mailing obtained the required sample size for the study, allowing a
   large sample of participants to be examined efficiently over a short
   period of time. It is important that the most common causes of visual
   impairment and undiagnosed eye disease can be determined using this
   rapid assessment methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Experts call for stronger safety cultures and transparent
   reporting practices to increase medication safety in today's strained
   healthcare environments. The field of ecological restoration is
   concerned with the effective, efficient, and sustainable repair and
   recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. A
   study was undertaken to determine whether the lessons of restoration
   science can be adapted to the study of medication safety issues.
   Methods: Working with 26 practitioners, the principles of good
   restoration were used to design and pilot an innovative multifaceted
   medication safety intervention. The intervention included focus groups
   with practitioners, the construction and administration of a research
   based medication safety inventory, repeat digital photography of
   environmental safety issues, and targeted environmental modifications.
   Results: Participants were most concerned about staff education and the
   physical environment for medication administration. Ward staff used the
   research to build a healthy reporting culture, introduce regular
   discussions of near misses, develop education strategies, redesign
   delivery and storage processes, and renovate the environment.
   Conclusions: Members of a busy hospital ward successfully adapted
   methods of restoration science to study, redesign, and strengthen
   medication safety practices and ward safety culture within existing
   resources. Further research will be conducted to test the merits of
   restoration science for health care.}},

   the use of Internet technologies to enhance knowledge and performance.
   E-learning technologies offer learners control over content, learning
   sequence, pace of learning, time, and often media, allowing them to
   tailor their experiences to meet their personal learning objectives. In
   diverse medical education contexts, e-learning appears to be at least as
   effective as traditional instructor-led methods such as lectures.
   Students do not see e-learning as replacing traditional instructor-led
   training but as a complement to it, forming part of a blended-learning
   strategy. A developing infrastructure to support e-learning within
   medical education includes repositories, or digital libraries, to manage
   access to e-learning materials, consensus on technical standardization,
   and methods for peer review of these resources, E-learning presents
   numerous research opportunities for faculty, along with continuing
   challenges for documenting scholarship. Innovations in e-learning
   technologies point toward a revolution in education, allowing learning
   to be individualized (adaptive learning), enhancing learners'
   interactions with others (collaborative learning), and transforming the
   role of the teacher. The integration of e-learning into medical
   education can catalyze the shift toward applying adult learning theory,
   where educators will no longer serve mainly as the distributors of
   content, but will become more involved as facilitators of learning and
   assessors of competency.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial worldwide efforts are underway aimed at identifying the
   spatial and temporal distribution of the global sources and sinks of
   atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The sink/source strength of vegetated
   surfaces at ground sites can now be estimated with reasonable accuracy
   and micrometeorological techniques are now well established, while
   difficulties exist in up scaling these figures to the regional and
   global scales. Airborne measurement of mass, momentum, and energy fluxes
   for boundary layer research has been available for decades requiring the
   use of large aircraft to carry instruments and dedicated support
   facilities. The advent of compact, low-power instruments and high speed,
   high-capacity digital data acquisition systems has recently allowed
   small research aircraft to perform such measurements with high accuracy.
   This paper first describes the Sky Arrow ERA (Environmental Research
   Aircraft), a small research aircraft that has been recently developed in
   Italy, in the frame of an international scientific collaboration. This
   aircraft can be operated to measure fluxes of mass, momentum and energy
   while flying at low altitude and reduced ground speed. The fluxes are
   computed with the airborne eddy correlation technique. The basic theory
   at the basis of the flux measurement technique is also described in the
   paper, and two application examples are discussed to illustrate the
   quality and the accuracy of the measurements that can be made using this
   research platform. Potential applications of those data to parametrize
   land surface schemes, validate simulation models and provide extensive
   and reliable ground truthing for satellite remote sensing applications
   are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the factors that contribute to the formation of an
   effective capsular bend as a deterrent to posterior capsule
   opacification. Its goal is to assist the practicing ophthalmologist in
   separating current understanding of this process from various working
   models previously proposed.
   While a square-edge design appreciably improves resistance to posterior
   capsule opacification, significant factors remain under the control of
   the surgeon. These factors combine to form the physical and
   psychological barrier of a capsular bend. Innovative digital imaging has
   shown lens epithelial cell migration, allowing for a more rapid
   assessment of posterior capsule opacification resistance. A three-piece
   intraocular lens allows for full 360 degree capsular bend formation
   surrounding the optic edge; some single-piece designs may inhibit
   capsular bend formation. Decreasing, but not eliminating, the surviving
   lens epithelial cell population may diminish capsular bend strength,
   which may decrease resistance to posterior capsule opacification in the
   face of a regenerating cortex. All demographic features of
   clear/refractive lens exchange suggest higher rates of posterior capsule
   opacification than with standard cataract surgery.
   The quality of capsular bend formation will determine how resistant an
   intraocular lens will be to posterior capsule opacification as a
   consequence of regenerating cortex, As refractive lens exchange and new
   accommodating intraocular lens designs become more popular, the problems
   of regenerating cortex will increase in magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, real-time displacement measurement of bridges was carried
   out by means of digital image processing techniques. This is innovative,
   highly cost-effective and easy to implement, and yet maintains the
   advantages of dynamic measurement and high resolution. First, the
   measurement point is marked with a target panel of known geometry. A
   commercial digital video camera with a telescopic lens is installed oil
   a fixed point away from the bridge (e.g., on the coast) or oil a pier
   (abutment), which can be regarded as a fixed point. Then, the video
   camera takes a motion picture of the target. Meanwhile, the motion of
   the tat-get is calculated using image processing techniques, which
   require a texture recognition algorithm, projection of the captured
   image, and calculation of the actual displacement using target geometry
   and the number of pixels moved. Field tests were carried out for the
   verification of the present method. The test results gave sufficient
   dynamic resolution in amplitude as well as the frequency. Use of this
   technology for a large Suspension bridge is discussed considering the
   characteristics Of Such bridges having low natural frequencies within 3
   Hz and the maximum displacement of several centimeters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the digital processing method based on wavelet
   network (WN) to measure the time-of-flight (ToF) between the ultrasonic
   pulse and echo reflected by the target. The measure is carried out once
   the WN is trained to model the cross correlation between the signals
   coming from the ultrasonic transducer and the reference one. The aspects
   concerning the modeling by the WN of the cross correlation and, in
   general, of the nonlinear function are taken into account. An innovative
   procedure to initialize and to train the WN is pointed out to ensure
   high accuracy and good generalization. After a brief outline of the
   theory underlying the WNs, all the fundamental steps of the measurement
   method are described in detail. The results of the experimental tests
   carried out for method validation and characterization are shown.
   Finally, comparative tests between the virtual instrument based on the
   proposed measurement method and the ultrasonic digital indicating tester
   are given and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Europe today stands at a crossroad, racing challenges but also
   opportunities. In its intent to make Europe a leading technology-based
   economy by 2010 the European Commission has identified biotechnology and
   genomics as fields for future growth, crucial for supporting the
   agricultural and food processing industry. Since first commercialization
   in 1996, GM crop areas have grown at double-digit rates, making this one
   of the most rapidly adopted technologies in agriculture. However, in
   contrast to other world areas and despite European Commission support,
   Europe has found itself `bogged-down' in a polemic between opponents and
   supporters of plant biotechnology. As a result, planted areas have
   remained small. This stalemate is due to a lack of political leadership,
   especially at the Member State level, all the more surprising in light
   of European early development and competitive advantage with crop
   biotechnology. This situation proves once again that, for cutting-edge
   innovations, a solid science base alone is not sufficient. Acceptance or
   rejection of new technologies depends on interlinked political,
   economic, and societal factors that create a favorable or unfavorable
   situation at a given time. This article will look at GM crops in Europe
   and the role science and politics have played in the introduction of
   crop biotechnology. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous pervasive monitoring has the potential to improve the quality
   of life of many persons (for example those who suffer from heart
   arrhythmias or elderly people who suffer from chronic diseases). We show
   the three main steps related to the monitoring process and supported by
   our System. First, how data are captured by sensors which send those
   data using wireless communications to a PDA (Personal Digital
   Assistant). Second, how data are analyzed, locally on the PDA, using
   techniques proposed in the areas of the Semantic Web and Machine
   Learning. Finally, how data stored at the PDA can be queried remotely
   using web services. Those three steps are illustrated in two different
   scenarios that the system can deal with: tele-assistance and monitoring
   of arrhythmias. Moreover, through the paper we highlight the main
   advantages provided by the system: active monitoring which consists in
   reacting to anomalous situations without direct intervention of the
   user; universal assistance, i.e. irrespective of time or place through
   the use of wireless communications and PDAs; vital signs monitoring
   which consists in using sensors that capture the value of those vital
   signs, and subsequently feed them to a decision support system that
   analyses them and generates an alarm if necessary, and remote monitoring
   which allows authorized personal to consult data on monitored patients,
   using the Internet. Finally we present some performance results which
   demonstrate the feasibility of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced control for automotive is one of the most promising research
   topic in the forthcoming decade. Actually, the long-term target is the
   substitution of most hydraulic car systems with their electronic
   counterparts. A bright example is set by the steering function, which
   has passed from pure mechanical to power assisted and recently to pure
   electrically power assisted function. The next step, the full electronic
   steering (Steer-By Wire, SBW), is in progress. Definitively, it is going
   to substitute the mechanical connection with the steering wheel by
   wire-transmitted digital signals to one or more remote electric motors.
   Obviously, any innovative control strategy needs thorough hardware
   verification. At the early stages, or whether a real car prototype was
   not available, it is common practice to use hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
   simulators, for fast control prototyping. In this frame, as proposed
   here, a high dynamic electric drive can virtually reproduce the real
   nonlinear load, represented by the steering chain and other external
   torque contributes. The paper presents the model details, the system
   architecture as well as the experimental validation of the complete HIL
   simulator.}},

Abstract = {{Laser acupuncture is defined as the stimulation of traditional
   acupuncture points with low-intensity, non-thermal laser irradiation. It
   has been well applied in clinic since the 1970s; however, some
   traditional acupuncture manipulating methods still cannot be implemented
   in the design of this kind of instruments, such as lifting and thrusting
   manipulating method, and twisting and twirling manipulating method,
   which are the essential acupuncture method in traditional acupuncture.
   The objective of this work was to design and build a low cost portable
   laser acupuncture therapeutic instrument, which can implement the two
   essential acupuncture manipulating methods. Digital PID control theory
   is used to control the power of laser diode (LD), and to implement the
   lifting and thrusting manipulating method. Special optical system is
   designed to implement twisting and twirling manipulating method. MSP430
   microcontroller system is used as the control centre of the instrument
   The realization of lifting and thrusting manipulating method and
   twisting and twirling manipulating method are technological innovations
   in traditional acupuncture coming true in engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The paper discusses a novel human-robot communication system for people
   with disability using electromyography (EMG) signals via a Personal
   Digital Assistant (PDA). This paper is a continual research from our
   previous work {[}1] with the objective of extending our approach to
   portable device with adaptive user interface capability. It presents an
   innovative architecture of human-robot interaction where the disabled
   persons could command the robot through an EMG-based Morse code-inspired
   communication paradigm on PDAs. The disabled persons may issue
   high-level commands to the robot via their muscle's EMG signal The
   system will decompose these EMG commands into low-level subtasks. Then,
   the robot dynamically constructs an action selection network to form the
   action plan. The architecture is developed on a PDA that offers small
   and lightweight mobile interaction devices. Utilizing the PDA with
   EMG-based modified Morse code could provide flexibility, mobility, and
   durability for handicapped people to control the robot-aid system.
   Additionally, the system is designed as an agent-based user interface
   (UI) for mixed-initiative interaction for the user. The proposed
   paradigm has been implemented to develop a prototypical system, and the
   experiments also illustrate the conventionality, and the robustness of
   such a human-robot framework.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a real-time visual tracking system for dense traffic
   intersections is presented The system structure is based on background
   estimation and subtraction method A novel method for background
   estimation based on Statistical Video Background Extraction (SVBE) is
   presented A moving object detection algorithm for performing background
   subtraction from original image has been improved To reduce noise, to
   improve the robustness of the system, and to reduce the error rate in
   detection and tracking process, morphological image processing method
   for binary images is used A developed blob analysis technique for
   extracted binary image facilitates pedestrian and car detection.
   Processing blob's information of relative size and location leads to
   distinguishing between pedestrian and car. Applying temporal analysis
   techniques and moving object detection methods improves system
   versatility to detect and recognize waiting and moving pedestrian and
   car. To enhance system robustness to scene changes and reduce error rate
   an innovative method of Remembrance Adaptive Background Update (RABU),
   is presented The proposed method scans the scene changes and includes
   relatively unchanged field to background update. This system is
   implemented in MATLAB (R) and Simulink (R), using Video and Image
   processing Blockset, Image Acquisition Blockset and Image Processing
   Toolbox. The proposed system provides continuous visual tracking for
   traffic intersections with the ability to provide extensive data for
   traffic control systems. System is tested with both live real-time video
   and pre-recorded video. The obtained results demonstrate also good
   performance of the proposed system for pedestrian and car tacking and
   prove its adaptability to varying weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is focused on the implementation of an innovative vehicles
   surveillance system using the 1090 MHz channel. SSR (Secondary
   Surveillance Radar) Mode S (selective) exploitation in high traffic
   environment calls for enhancing communication capacity. In the
   Multilateration and ADS-B applications, the presence of both SSR Mode S
   replies and squitter makes the superimposition of 1090 MHz signals
   probable. In Sect. II it is shown that these limitations in SSR signals
   analysis and decoding can be mitigated by exploiting the ICAO tolerance
   of the transponder transmission carrier frequency, whose central value
   has to be within the interval between 1087 and 1093 MHz (reduced to 1090
   +/- 1 MHz later). The AVMS (Airport Vehicles Management System) project
   enables the implementation of A-SMGCS functionalities. For the
   management of the large flat of airport service vehicles we propose the
   use of adiacent frequency channels for vehicular Mode S transmissions to
   avoid frequency signals superimposition with airbornes replies. A
   receiver equipped with selective digital filtering allows to separate
   the airborne channel by the vehicular one. In section III we show the
   channel capacity improvement, then we exploit the detection and the TOA
   estimation of frequency agility environment signals. Finally in section
   IV is analyzed the compliance with the EUROCAE requirements matching and
   conclusion are drawn.}},

Abstract = {{Parallel MRI acquisitions are generally reconstructed off-tine on PCs
   and computer clusters. Building upon an existing multichannel digital
   receiver, we present an innovative single-FPGA front-end that performs
   real-time 2D-FFT reconstruction from arrays of up to 16 coils. Partial
   reconfiguration enables rapid switching of FPGA modules for maximal
   flexibility and lower hardware cost. After an acquisition has been
   buffered, more complicated parallel MRI reconstruction techniques can
   replace receiver logic. Alternatively, the front-end can be used as a
   hardware-accelerated reconstruction engine with other receivers or for
   PCs. As proof-of-concept for real-time non-cartesian reconstruction, a
   reconfigurable module for next-neighbor regridding of spiral MRI is also
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation wishes to
   establish the necessary services needed in a national service oriented
   architecture. A key piece of technology in this vision is a hierarchy of
   addressing services based on registries.
   The ministry will register all public sector institutions with their
   UBL-based(1) invoice services in a master registry. This guarantees a
   critical mass of public sector institutions and offers a good value
   proposition to the SME's. Not only can they send all invoices to the
   public sector electronically but they also have the ability to send
   electronic invoices to other private companies registered in the
   registry.
   The ministry believes that this solution will demonstrate the advantages
   of a service oriented architecture {[}1] and infrastructure based on
   registries and that this demonstration will generate the broad use of
   registries for other services.
   The proposed solution {[}2] consists of elements normally associated
   with a web service architecture. What differentiates this proposal is
   not the content but the approach to lowering barriers by limiting
   implementation choices and ensuring a critical mass of service
   providers.}},

   to research in wireless systems and radio implementation. In the area of
   wireless systems, there are several competing standards in particular
   for wireless broadband. The modem, on the other hand, is evolving into a

Abstract = {{Almost all electronic systems are made up of a combination of CCAs
   (Circuit Card Assemblies). The testing of these CCAs has significant
   impacts on system readiness and maintainability. The migration from
   parallel data buses to high speed serial buses has introduced many new
   challenges in interfacing prime hardware with test equipment. The number
   of low voltage power forms required on new boards to support multiple
   core voltages has also added to the complexity of test. Great. increases
   in the density of integrated circuits and packages, and the amount of
   circuitry installed on prime hardware circuit cards makes probing
   difficult and even impossible in some cases. All of these factors make
   traditional CCA test techniques inadequate for testing and
   troubleshooting.
   This paper discusses many of the techniques being used to address the
   automated test needs in this new age of digital CCA test. The focus is
   on digital CCAs due to the fact that CCAs previously full of analog
   circuitry are being replaced with more and more digital circuitry. One
   item at the core of the new test philosophy is the use of FPGAs (Field
   Programmable Gate Arrays) to drive many of the tests rather than digital
   10 cards in standard test equipment. The flexibility of the FPGA in
   communicating with numerous interfaces as well as its ability to be
   reprogrammed quickly makes it a key player in digital test. Also,
   opportunities increase greatly for BIT (Built In Test) and
   software/firmware reuse between prime hardware and test equipment.
   It is essential that each of the engineers and managers involved in
   testing systems containing circuit cards understand the impacts of the
   current and upcoming technology on automated test and the strategy
   necessary to be successful.}},

Abstract = {{Digital signal processing algorithms are nowadays playing a more and
   more important role in most measurement processes. Also in the presence
   of poor digitized data, reliable and repeatable results can often be
   assured by complementing the adopted measurement procedure with a
   suitable processing stage. The realization of a ``collection `` of
   measurement algorithms to be shared among researchers and technicians
   working on similar topics should thus be advisable. Complex algorithms,
   however, suffer from critical drawbacks, in terms of computational
   burden and hardware resources requested, when applied to very long
   acquired records.
   The authors suggest hereinafter the adoption of GRID service as an
   innovative solution in order to provide researchers with the collection
   `` of measurement algorithms and concurrently overcome the cited
   drawbacks. A GRID Service is a new hardware/software approach capable of
   merging the higher computational performance of parallel GRID computing
   with key mechanisms and standards of Web Service. It would be so
   possible to migrate complex measurement algorithms into services
   available and accessible on Internet. As an application example, the
   authors present a GRID Service implementing a method for power
   measurement in digital wireless communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, a considerable part of lives lost in traffic accidents is due
   to inappropriate vehicle speed or headway. Excessive speed is one of the
   major causes of accidents on European roads, responsible for one-third
   of all road accidents. SASPENCE, as part of the EU founded integrated
   project PReVENT, is developing and evaluating an innovative system able
   to perform the reliable and comfortable Safe Speed and Safe Distance
   concept, which helps the driver to avoid dangerous situations related to
   excessive speed or too small headway.
   In this paper, the high precise reconstruction of the road geometry is
   discussed. This information about the road geometry is needed in the
   project to be able to calculate the risk of a given scenario and given
   speed. A sensor fusion method is proposed to combine information from a
   vision sensor, a radar system, digital maps, a GPS sensor and odometric
   sensors to one common description of the road geometry in front of the
   vehicle. Thereby, the sensor information is used to localize the own
   vehicle relative to the map data. The system has been tested using real
   data and the results are shown in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{As digital communication of television content becomes more pervasive,
   the long-standing problem of assessing video quality becomes
   particularly important. This work describes some innovative guidelines
   for easy and reliable determination of a quality metric that is
   subjectively meaningful: Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), representing
   how often a typical viewer observes a noticeable visual error and a
   related instantaneous metric relating to the fraction of viewers that
   find a given video portion to be within acceptable quality levels. The
   value of MTBF is addressed in the context of video quality, and
   objective measurements that correlate well with subjective evaluations
   of MTBF are investigated for different video clips at bit rates in the
   range of 1.5 - 5 Mbps. The full-reference objective metrics of PSNR and
   JND are found to have correlation coefficients of 0.69 and 0.88
   respectively. In contrast, a reduced-reference objective metric, Spatial
   Temporal Join Metric {[}1] (STJM) is found to have a correlation
   coefficient of 0.84. A method for estimating the MTBF of a video
   sequence from objective measurements is also described.}},

   for low-cost, distributed, intelligent condition monitoring systems. The
   resulting monitoring and management systems are flexible and use
   existing machine, process and controller signals as an initial source of
   process information, thereby reducing implementation cost and time. The
   paper illustrates how, using the advanced digital and analogue signal
   acquisition and processing functionality of ever more powerful
   microcontrollers, key analogue sensor signals may be used to support
   monitoring functions. This approach will ultimately intelligently manage
   the handling of acquired signals to ensure that only fault related data
   are entered into the high level signal processing functions. Thus the
   proposed work will exhibit synergy with concurrent research in

   China's digital TV development during the process of catching-up. We
   look at the obstacles and opportunities and emphasize on two kinds of

   is market obstacle. Then we propose two different approaches of
   catching-up: technology breakthrough and market breakthrough. We argue
   that the appropriate path for China to adopt is to occupy the domestic
   market in the first place and then catch up with the developed countries
   on technology innovation. At last, we have designed a questionnaire and

Abstract = {{Organic growth is the key to long term success of any company. GE's aim
   is to make growth a process that is both reliable and predictable.
   Innovation is critical to accelerate this organic growth. GE's
   innovation has strong link to process rigor, which focuses on the
   customer value and commercial excellence. Initiatives such as
   simplification, digitization, Six Sigma etc. have provided the
   capability to drive innovation faster than ever before. In this paper,
   the role of Six Sigma in the innovation process has been emphasized. A
   case study is presented to illustrate the approach. Some imperatives in
   the paper are only authors' personal observations.}},

Abstract = {{Possible solutions to the management of multichannel delivering
   production on demand, and containment of sale prices in the digital
   multimedia content production could be the automating, accelerating and
   restructuring the production process. The proposed solution provides
   innovative methods and tools to speed up and optimize content production
   and distribution based on the GRID technologgy supported by a specific
   programming language that allow defining the automatic procedure for
   content processing, production, adaptation, protection, DRM managing,
   distribution, etc. This paper describes the GRID architecture of the
   AXMEDIS Content Processing Area and the language adopted to define
   algorithms executed into the GRID environment.}},
