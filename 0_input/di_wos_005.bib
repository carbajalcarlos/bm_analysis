Abstract = {{Task-based language teaching (TBLT) has heavily influenced syllabus
   design, classroom teaching and learner assessment in foreign language
   teaching contexts (Nunan, 2004; Skehan, 2009). This paper discusses an
   innovative English as Foreign Language (EFL) undergraduate course, which
   incorporated task-based assignments, design education, project
   management and technology-enhanced language learning. In this course,
   the language learning assignments centered on designing and analyzing
   objects using CAD software such as Autodesk 123D Design, BuildwithChrome
   and the Tinkercad. Following real in-class physical LEGO assembly,
   design software was used collaboratively to develop further design
   analysis and procedural understanding. Students met both individually
   and as group activities centered on technical document authoring. Google
   Drive, and Schoology (learning management system) were used extensively
   during the course. This paper outlines a task-based technical
   communication course and explains how students worked on real LEGO
   design, and then co-authored engineering reports detailing the
   structural and functional specifications documenting the assembly
   procedure. The paper also considers how LEGO-based 3D design principles
   can be taught in an EFL classroom. Students were not only taught design,
   but also how to author complex technical documents in English. This
   innovative approach with TBLT involves learner-driven active learning so
   that hands-on interaction with physical objects takes place before
   theoretical instructions are provided (Blikstein, 2013). Incorporating
   collaborative design pedagogies using real (physical) and virtual
   (online) LEGO design, and DV (digital video) to develop language
   learning coursework that promotes active learning.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, Higher Education Institutions have been Increasing the use of
   web technologies to support face-to-face teaching process and new forms
   of learning. Based on the achievement of pre-defined learning
   objectives, teachers have increasingly been defining learning strategies
   considering the advantages of digital interaction and personalization of
   learning paths. The work described in this paper aims to explicit
   reflection on current practices regarding the use of Web 2.0
   technologies in Higher Education looking for a pedagogical framework.
   Contrary to the majority of scientific papers published in this area of
   knowledge, this research starts by analysing current educational
   practices, using a case study method, and seeks then for a pedagogical
   pattern, using a bottom-up approach. As a result, it was found that the
   pedagogical exploration of current Web 2.0 technologies can enhance
   formal learning and preparation for lifelong learning. Nevertheless, it
   is important to map all the web tools used in order to clarify its usage
   and control the dispersion of inherent social environments.}},

Title = {{A GRAPHICAL INTERFACE FOR AWARDING INCREMENTAL POINTS FOR DIGITAL BADGES

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and implementation of a graphical
   interface for awarding small numbers of points to students rapidly and
   repeatedly. The points accumulate and contribute toward digital badges
   which are used as the mechanism for recording and recognizing
   achievements in an English village project at a university in Japan.
   Hitherto, standard grading interfaces in leading open-source Learning
   Management Systems (LMS's), such as Moodle, have not been suitable for
   awarding incremental points for two main reasons. First, there is the
   difficulty of locating a student in a vertical list of names that is
   ordered alphabetically and potentially spans several pages. Second, in
   order to award incremental points in systems that only store a total
   number of points, it is necessary for the teacher to perform some mental
   arithmetic when awarding points and increase the current total by the
   incremental amount.
   To address these two issues, the new interface represents students
   graphically, as icons that are arranged on the computer screen to
   correspond to the physical location of the students in the classroom.
   The teacher simply taps or clicks the student icons to award points,
   which are then added to any points awarded previously. Thus, points can
   be awarded quickly and with minimal interruption to communication. In
   order to support these features, while at the same time adhering to
   Moodle's standard internal programming protocols, an innovative scheme
   of data passing was developed. When the page first loads, information
   from each student's profile is combined with the details of the icon
   locations and number of points awarded so far and is sent to the browser
   as a standard Moodle HTML form. Once in the browser, JavaScript is used
   to rearrange the form elements and present them as a graphical
   interface.
   This interface was developed as the first stage of a project to nurture
   an English village community in Japan, in which an entire university
   campus is transformed into an English-speaking community. It was
   trialled in two main teaching environments. These were: (1) small-groups
   of up to 8 students attending voluntary, out-of-hours English
   conversation classes in a seminar room, and (2) mediumsized groups of up
   to 40 students attending compulsory general English classes in a
   university classroom. During the trials, it became apparent that the
   interface could be used not only for awarding incremental points but
   also for awarding scores for non-incremental tasks such as exams or
   reports. Furthermore, in response to teacher feedback, the interface was
   modified so that it could be used with Moodle's Advanced Grading
   methods, including Rubrics and Marking Guides. Overall, the points
   interface proved to be a useful, reliable and popular method for
   awarding points within Moodle because it simplifies the task of locating
   students, reduces typing, and reduces the number of page loads. Thus, it
   can be said to have achieved the objectives of awarding points quickly
   and unobtrusively and it can now become a central technology in the
   larger goal of building an English Village based on digital badges.}},

Abstract = {{The classroom is one of the privileged environments aiming knowledge
   construction and the establishment of social relationships as well as of
   cultural exchanges. Studies regarding classroom environment, focusing
   the pedagogical approaches, are countless; however, studies regarding
   the classroom environment as the physical space are significantly fewer.
   Nevertheless, a new classroom physical space - the Future Classroom Lab
   (FCL) - has been developed based, in part, on 21st Century Skills.
   Spaces like the FCL are spreading throughout Europe, existing already
   more than 2,600 FCL's. The Information and Communications Technology
   (ICT) advent and the ICT-based emergent pedagogical approaches
   contributed to the increase of studies concerning the physical classroom
   environment, as the classroom space and layout became no longer the most
   suitable. But are these new spaces suitable for the Non in Education,
   Employment or Training (NEET)/Refugee population and are they being
   designed and conceived to promote the inclusion of these populations?
   Considering this scenario and the NEET and Refugee populations' current
   crisis in the European Union {[}1], {[}2]) the research that this paper
   presents aims to investigate innovative interior design strategies to
   the classroom architectural space in order to promote the inclusion of
   these specific populations: through the analysis of how the FCL spaces
   are being used in the European Schoolnet FCL network and through the
   observation of some of these spaces in Portugal, a Digital Future
   Classroom (DFC) is going to be designed. Privileging the enabling spaces
   approach {[}3] on the classroom complexity spaces (architectural,
   social, cognitive, emotional, epistemological, cultural and
   organizational, technological and the virtual space), this ongoing
   research aims at understanding how to ``translate{''} these concepts
   into the classroom interior design, aiming the promotion of the user's
   inclusion. This analysis also gathers the spatial and pedagogical
   semiotics as well as the spatial pedagogy inherent to the classroom.
   This article presents the relevance of the research supported by its
   theoretical and conceptual frameworks and the methodology that is being
   adopted. The present research, mainly qualitative, can be considered
   under the constructivist (or socio-constructivist) paradigm and with a
   slight nuance of the critical theory paradigm. Considering also that
   ``The researcher-as-bricoleur-theorist works between and within
   competing and overlapping perspectives and paradigms{''} {[}4, p. 5] the
   research design resorts to triangulation, as it uses ``different methods
   in an attempt to confirm, cross-validate, or corroborate findings{''}
   {[}5, p. 24] in order to respond to each of the set objectives
   fulfilling all the requests.}},

Abstract = {{Information systems and technologies (IST) are the essence of up-to date
   organizations, and changes in this field are occurring at an
   uncontrollable pace, interrupting traditional business models and
   forcing organizations to implement new business models. The integration
   of technological innovations, such as Big Data - Analytics, Cloud
   Computing, Mobile Connectivity, and Social, the four pillars of digital
   transformation, with business practice can enable significant
   competitive advantage. On the other hand, Information Systems are the
   core of every business and cut across almost all aspects of
   organizational life. Information Systems and Information Technology are
   used as support to all aspects of organizational functions and
   activities. In this context, the teaching of Information Systems both at
   the higher level and training education must be urgently aligned with
   these transformations, so that present and future Information Systems
   professionals may learn to solve problems with greater agility. Such
   agility is also required to organizations. In this paper a curriculum of
   an Information Systems course at the High Education level is analyzed,
   while some extensions and adjustments are proposed in order to address
   the new challenges of Digital Transformation in organizations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the benefits of incorporating coding skills in the
   instruction of the engineering design process in an engineering
   university that specializes in oil and gas related engineering. The
   project basically involved changing the traditional method of teaching
   the engineering design process. Instead of only designing a simple
   product, the students were trained to design and actually build a fully
   functional video game by using a free, easy-to-use online software that
   can be used by other students.
   Code literacy is, almost unequivocally, a prerequisite for entering a
   digital world and the critical thinking skills involved in developing an
   effective program code are simply phenomenal. Therefore, we can safely
   argue that writing a glitch-free program code is at the top echelon of
   problem solving skills. Realizing how beneficial code literacy is to
   engineering students, the authors looked for potential incorporation of
   coding in the engineering design course referred to as STPS-201
   (Strategies for Team-based Engineering Problem Solving).
   STPS201 is the first course in a two course sequence that introduces
   students to engineering design and problem solving in a project-based
   learning environment. Solutions to engineering problems are developed
   through a process that has a number of phases beginning with problem
   definition and culminating in a feasible ``conceptual design{''}.
   However, this course stops at the abstract idea of a conceptual design.
   The remaining phases are addressed mainly in subsequent courses (STPS251
   and Senior Design).
   The authors of this paper decided to pilot the idea of asking the
   students to develop a fully functional prototype of a video game and not
   just stop at the conceptual design phase. Other colleagues felt it would
   be too challenging. The working prototype idea was not favoured because
   it seemed too daunting and because programming a video game seemed to be
   asking our students for too much at this stage. However, the authors
   acquired permission to proceed with the pilot idea from the department
   and the results were extremely promising. The success of this pilot
   influenced subsequent semesters and many teams are now developing
   similar projects.
   The authors believe this pilot was innovative as it was never attempted
   at this university before students moved into their engineering majors.
   The pilot seems to have demonstrated significant impact on teaching
   effectiveness, student learning and retention. The student feedback on
   this pilot supports this claim. The ideas clearly have potential for
   widespread use within and across disciplines and the authors have
   already started scaling it to larger sections. After all, who would say
   no to a fun challenge like designing your own game?}},

Abstract = {{Micro-credentialing combined with Blockchain, MOOCs and free online
   course provide sufficient motivation for Higher Education to critically
   evaluate its long term role in educating the next generation. A changing
   student population and the continual technological developments puts
   pressure on universities to blend, flip and video classes. Many
   organisations feel the need to follow suit as education lurches from the
   age old tradition of the ``Sage on the stage{''} to the ``Guide on the
   side{''}. This shift impacts teaching spaces, expectations regarding
   student approaches to learning, and requires the development of a new
   didactic approach. Teachers who are used to `sending' knowledge during
   traditional lectures to halls filled with students, find themselves
   appearing in front of green screens, segmenting their classes into short
   video chunks, and developing more interactive learning sessions. Are
   these the right choices to follow, based on what empirical evidence and
   how can we ensure that this process is positive for all involved? A
   tourism `model' was segmented into 40 short (58 minute) web lectures
   (studio recorded videos with power point slides) on a university course.
   Over six semesters, the content was reverse engineered into the course
   structure, and `constructively aligned' with assessment goals. Each
   course iteration enabled the embedded content to be actively implemented
   more deeply, through interactive workshops, peer teaching, student
   generated video clips and student formulated exam questions. Teaching
   through the video lens resulted in the development of a new didactic
   approach for the lecturer. Both the on-screen `Video Teaching' persona,
   and the new interactive role in class were enabled as a result of the
   catalyzing possibilities of video and the `digitization' of the teacher.
   Student perceptions of this learning approach reveal positive support
   for this format. The ongoing research into this subject is supporting
   the transition of lecturers into this new didactic both in The
   Netherlands and internationally.}},

Abstract = {{The Polytechnic University of Valencia has established 13 transversal
   competences that must be acquired by our graduates when finishing their
   corresponding Engineering Degrees. These competences are assessed at
   least once through the first part of the Degree (2 years) in order to
   verify their acquisition in a preliminary level.
   Competence no. 4 (CT04) is Innovation creativity and entrepreneurship.
   Its preliminary level (domain level I) should give learning results such
   as questioning reality, identifying improvement needs and contributing
   ideas to generate added-value to a product. Thus assessing the
   competence must take into account these learning results. In order to do
   this some indicators have been considered:
   Do the students question the reality? Do the students generate
   innovative ideas? Are they able to communicate these ideas in a formal
   way? Are they able to identify the results?
   The control for the acquisition of the preliminary level of this
   competence is the subject Digital Electronics. It is scheduled in the
   second year, second semester of the Degree in industrial Electronics and
   Automation Engineering at the Design Engineering School of the
   Polytechnic University of Valencia. In order to assess the acquisition
   of this competence in this subject, a project consisting of a
   competition with small robotic vehicles has been carried out along the
   semester.
   In this paper, we comprehensively analyse the preparation,
   implementation and results of this proposal, which allows both
   strengthening the transversal competence and facilitating the evaluation

Abstract = {{The provision of technology platforms and mobile devices in the
   framework of holistic and interactive educational models represents a
   valuable resource in humanistic training, since it implies greater
   motivation, stimulating learning, strengthening concentration,
   collaborative work and stimulating meaningful learning. Consequently,
   the research presents the results of the project entitled
   ``Strengthening of Educational Quality in Mathematics and Citizen
   Competencies through the use of Tablets{''}, aimed at teachers and
   students of 9th, 10th and 11th from 31 Official Schools of the District
   Barranquilla - Colombia. Its purpose was to develop mathematical and
   citizen skills for the improvement of educational quality. The AULATOUCH
   web and mobile access platform was created, which, contextualized in the
   holistic model, considers the different ways in which students learn and
   communicate, as well as how teachers participate in technological
   mediation. In the theory, the contributions on educational innovation
   are articulated by Camina, Ballester, Coll \& Garcia {[}1], learning for
   the digital age, Siemens \& Downes connectivism {[}2] and Bertalanffy
   systems theory {[}3]. The research design is mixed, descriptive -
   explanatory. It works with a quasi-experiment (pretest and posttest),
   survey and observation. The results show that the pedagogical strategies
   mediated by tablets in the subjects of mathematics and civic
   competences, motivate students to learn, improve their academic
   performance and strengthen the development of skills. It's concluded
   that the inclusion in the didactic cycle of a technological tool such as
   Aulatouch represents a dynamic agent for didactic mediation and the
   strengthening of students' learning, because it positively impacted the
   academic performance in the mentioned disciplines in more than 70\% of
   the students, who participated in the project.}},

Abstract = {{It is recognised that many European countries are currently facing a
   crisis amongst their younger generations in respect of scientific
   learning vocations. The number of students specialising in science,
   technology, engineering and maths (STEM) disciplines has been in steady
   decline in recent years and Europe faces nowadays the concrete risk of
   an acute shortage of suitably qualified scientists, technicians and
   engineers. There is strong evidence that for many young people their
   disengagement from STEM subjects starts during secondary education. The
   drivers of this disengagement are various but research indicates that
   there are primarily two factors at play: first, there is a commonly held
   perception that amongst young people that scientific subjects are
   difficult to learn and master; second, there are misapprehensions
   regarding the employment pathways available to STEM students with many
   young people believing that studying these subjects will lead to poorer
   pay and a less attractive working life.
   Evidence suggests that the teaching of STEM subjects requires radical
   reform. Immersive, experiential learning and the deployment of
   self-directed learning approaches can be the catalyst for deepening
   student engagement and improving learning outcomes. However, too much
   STEM teaching remains teacher-led, didactic and one-dimensional. At
   best, this makes the learning experience more challenging in relation to
   student performance; at worst, potential STEM students are put off these
   subjects for life due to an inability to fully engage in the content of
   lessons. For those students who do stick with STEM subjects, their
   ability to develop the skills and competencies they need to operate
   effectively within highly technical employment environments can be
   diminished meaning that employers are required to undertake considerable
   retraining in order to bring graduates up to speed.
   These dual problems - of the attractiveness of STEM subjects to learners
   and the effectiveness of STEM teaching in relation to learning outcomes
   - require novel solutions. The NEWTON project funded under the
   Horizon2020 E.U. programme - is a large scale initiative to develop and
   integrate innovative technology-enhanced tools for teaching and learning
   and to create a pan-European learning network platform that supports
   fast dissemination of learning content to a wide audience in a
   ubiquitous manner. NEWTON is seeking to deploy a range of novel
   techniques and methodologies, such as AR/VR, Fab-Lab, Virtual Labs, user
   profiling, self-directed learning and gamification - that is the use of
   game mechanics - and game-based learning (the use of so-called `serious
   games') for the engagement of the student and for the enhancement of the
   learning experience, in general. Within the context of a project of this
   scale - and one that utilises the many and various elements of a modern
   learning management system - the authors of this paper have developed a
   specific model, the Newton Enhanced Gamification Model (N-EGM), which
   provides a coherent approach to the implementation and use of
   gamification and game-based learning integrating the concepts of
   socialization and personalization in an unique solution within a
   digitally-driven STEM teaching context. This paper presents that model
   and discusses, in detail, the way in which these elements can integrate
   effectively with other digital learning tools and technologies as a way
   of cultivating student motivation, increasing engagement and,
   ultimately, improving learning outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Open educational resources (OER), openly licensed teaching, learning and
   research materials are useful tools for teaching, learning and
   assessing. In 2002 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, USA)
   launched the Open Courseware (OCW) initiative that allowed publish
   online course materials, providing open and free access to its materials
   for educators, students, and individual learners around the world.
   Since then, the number of courses and the initiatives related to open
   education have constantly growing. At present, more than 260
   Universities and institutions working on open education from around the
   world collaborate in this Consortium, which provides access to more than
   26,000 free online courses. In this context, the concept of Reusable
   Learning Objects (RLO), which can be reused in multiple instructional
   contexts such as the OCW, emerges as independent and self-contained
   learning elements, done in digital format with a pedagogical purpose.
   Some examples of RLO include wikis, videos, podcasts, etc.
   The objective of this paper is to present the methodology and the main
   results achieved to date in a teaching innovation project financed by
   the University of Zaragoza (Spain) during the academic years 2015-16 and
   2016-17. In this project, more than 20 RLO's have been created in the
   form of educational videos under Creative Commons licenses. The aim is
   to promote self-learning and to improve the learning outcomes of five
   subjects in the field of Thermodynamics and Thermal Engineering, which
   are currently taught in three different degree courses. In order to
   assess the teaching-learning process through the educational videos,
   different questionnaires for the students have been designed and
   launched. Initially, all the videos and questionnaires are only
   accessible through a Moodle site to the students enrolled in the five
   subjects. However, at the end of this project, all the educational
   videos will be published within the OCW platform of the University of
   Zaragoza, integrating them in a free and consistent OCW specifically
   designed to support the study of thermodynamics and thermal engineering
   fundamentals. In this way, the project is in line with the ``four R's of
   openness{''} framework, which includes the possibility of reusing,
   redistributing, revising and remixing all the learning objects
   developed.
   So far, the results show that most students are satisfied or very
   satisfied with this innovation experience. In this sense, they consider
   that the use of educational videos has improved their learning process,
   increasing their motivation to study and helping them understand the
   most complicated topics.}},

Abstract = {{It seems that the digital world is all around us, wherever we turn to.
   Although not palpable, this world is already an important part of our
   everyday lives. When we talk specifically about the teaching/learning
   process we see that, at least in the last decade, the development of
   alternative and new strategies has been huge. The way students react to
   some methods and tactics is changing and engaging then into their own
   learning process is becoming a constant ``challenge{''} to teachers, in
   all different educational levels. As Math professors in a High Education
   Institution where Mathematics is a basic and supporting course to other
   advanced (but non-Mathematical) ones, this so called ``challenge{''}
   grows exponentially.
   In this paper we analyse the impact of introducing and supporting some
   Math contents through video lectures, in a voice over presentation
   style, based on animated arrangements, in our own mother language. These
   videos were developed for a first-year Math course in several Management
   degrees in the Tourism and Hospitality Area. The specific curricular
   items were chosen with a primary objective of trying to level up the
   mathematical competencies that are fundamental to the development of
   `mathematical literacy' of our students. Our video lectures are
   available to students in our institutional Moodle platform, with all its
   features, along with other resources (as texts and proposed exercises)
   as well as in a YouTube channel. We will also describe students'
   background areas of study in preuniversity level and analyse if this has
   any influence in the way they interact with video-lectures in their own
   learning development and knowledge construction and report student's
   perception of the eventual benefits of using this digital resource in
   engaging and promoting their self-responsibility in the leaning process.
   Finally, we will analyse students' evaluation of the videos recorded by
   the professors and uploaded to the Moodle platform and YouTube as a
   learning tool.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an international Project of Teaching
   Innovation developed between three universities (University of the
   Basque Country; University of Salamanca and Autonomous University of
   Lisbon). The focus was the process of virtualization of teaching
   contents. The main objective of this project was to plan and create
   digital didactic materials in an interactive format within an
   interdisciplinary perspective. Teachers and students from Science and
   Communication Sciences conceptualized and developed digital content of a
   specific course (Inorganic Chemistry) to promote an active learning
   framework in a digital environment.
   The starting point for this project was the new educational model of
   higher education and the use of technology as an element to empower the
   teaching-learning process. This paper provides an articulated analysis
   around this project, which focuses its main interest on the great
   importance that, the practical work that the students performs within
   the subjects has acquired in the new curricula, both at the level of
   hours of work and of specific weight in the final grade.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the integration of Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICT) in pedagogical practices is a reality that has the potentiality to
   transform and innovate the teaching and learning process. In the 2014/15
   school year, the EduLab Program emerged, involving 10 Portuguese school
   groupings. Within the EduLab Program, the AGIRE project arose in order
   to describe and understand the needs of teaching and assessment
   practices, in a school grouping in the Centre of Portugal.
   During the second year of the EduLab project, opinions of the EduLab
   teachers about their training needs were identified. Based on those
   identified needs, a 25 hours Training Course (TC) was designed and this
   research has come out. Its goal is to develop, implement and evaluate
   the above-mentioned accredited TC to answer to the identified needs and
   enhance the Teacher Professional Development (TPD), in order to improve
   and innovate teachers' pedagogical practices. This TC includes three
   main topics: (1) outdoor learning; (2) collaborative and self-regulated
   learning; and (3) learning assessment. The recently initiated study aims
   to respond the last two topics of the TC through the preparation and
   implementation of activities carried out in this context. This
   investigation is a case study and intends to answer the research
   question ``How to promote teacher professional development, in a TC
   context, towards innovation of pedagogical practices and integrating
   technological resources provided by the EduLab?{''}. The following
   objectives were defined: (1) to identify the teachers' perceptions about
   their teaching practices with ICT; (2) to plan the last two TC's topics
   (collaborative and self-regulated learning, and learning assessment)
   that meets the teachers' needs; (3) to implement and monitor these TC's
   topics; and (4) to assess the impact of the contribution of the explored
   TC's topics in the TPD and teachers' pedagogical practices. From the
   obtained results it seems that teachers, despite low level of
   integration of digital technologies in their practices, they are
   motivated to get competences on ICT. So, it is expected that this
   research will contribute positively to the integration of ICT in
   teaching, to the professional growth of teachers, and the development of
   pedagogical and digital skills, thus fostering the change of practices.}},

Abstract = {{This study concerns an innovative platform entitled ``AESOP: Advanced
   Electronic Scenarios Operating Platform{''} which was developed to
   enable teachers and pupils to design, develop and evaluate interactive
   educational material.
   Special emphasis is placed on the presentation of the features and the
   potential of this electronic system as an integrated learning teaching
   and research tool of electronic lessons that exploits modern web
   technologies without any software add-ons, using only a modern Web
   Browser at any desktop or mobile computing device.
   The structure of the educational/teaching scenario is designed and
   extracted dynamically from the platform. There is extensive reference to
   the use and exploitation of a considerable number of free web-based
   tools for the design of an original or the reuse of an existing digital
   material, as well as, to the possibility of transforming a digital
   material into an interactive application.
   In each scenario the creator/designer, by using knowledge, experience
   and imagination, is able to create a compound digital material in
   accordance with one or more cognitive subjects, thematic areas and
   classifications. This is done by describing teaching goals and
   objectives, instructional phases and worksheets, and fully adjust them
   into the structure of a modern and pedagogically exploitable digital
   educational/teaching scenario that is consistent with the current
   applied Greek curricula of education.
   The potential of the AESOP Platform has already been exploited by
   thousands of Greek teachers. Currently the platform hosts high quality
   teaching digital material, scientifically and pedagogically accredited
   by the responsible scientific authority for educational issues of the
   primary and secondary education in Greece (Greek Institute of
   Educational Policy).
   Any teacher in Greece, has the potential to choose among 39 cognitive
   subjects of the primary and secondary education and to design digital
   interactive educational/teaching scenarios for all students, for diverse
   groups of students or even for individual students with special needs or
   inclinations.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge is no longer produced exclusively in the traditional
   class-based learning environment. For twenty-first century learners,
   digitally networked classrooms are the new social spaces where
   innovative learning perspectives are cultivated. However, like
   traditional class-based learning environments, digitally networked
   classrooms need to be sensitive to the social forces of race, gender,
   and class that will inescapably invade digital cultures. Therefore, even
   in the cloud, this chapter argues, ``difference{''} as a concept is
   always already embedded as a contributing feature under which knowledge
   is constructed and constructing. To this end, this chapter suggests that
   a consideration of ``difference{''} and its signifying effect on cloud
   pedagogy is a useful lens to explore the phrase ``anywhere anytime{''}
   to the term ``anybody{''} in the digitally networked classroom. Finally,
   this chapter proposes that the model ``anywhere, anytime, anybody{''}
   must become part of the basic structure of a democratic and
   collaborative knowledge building community to democratize teaching and
   learning in the cloud.}},

Pages = {{227-236}},
Abstract = {{Building information modelling (BIM) is a new technique, which has been
   innovated from the traditional method to a modern form. BIM should be
   classified as a modern technique, since it is dealing with digital data.
   3D BIM with its time schedule results on 4D/BIM is represented by
   softwares, such as Naviswork and Syncro, which has an advantage to solve
   most of the project issues such as clash detection among projects
   components, visualisation to projects tasks, and other benefits. The aim
   of this current study is to find out the benefits and challenges of
   4D/BIM implementation in the construction projects. The data collection
   method in this research is done by conducting semi-structured interviews
   (SSIs) with the senior civil engineer in Al-Najaf hospital project in
   Iraq, in addition to that there is the extensive literature review about
   the benefits, challenges and obstacles in the implementation of 4D/BIM.
   Analysis of the results was conducted by adopting content analysis
   method (CAM). The results proved that the construction industry in Iraq
   needs to further support from the government by increasing awareness and
   financial support for construction companies.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution is aimed at presenting the state of art related to the
   records management in the public sector and, more specifically, to the
   main tools required for managing current records according to the
   Direction general for Archives and its specific competencies which imply
   a role for defining and approving classification and preservation plans.
   The article analyses various projects developed for the public sectors
   in the last 25 years in connection with the innovation processes for the
   public administration and the crucial role recognized to the records
   management. The paper illustrates the work done by working groups for
   universities, municipalities, regions and provinces but also for health
   environment, chambers of trade, banks and educational institutions. With
   reference to the State institutions, a general picture is presented for
   ministries such as Ministry of Justice and Ministry for cultural
   heritage. In the last case the classification system developed and
   adopted in 2004 in connection with the electronic registry system is
   discussed in detail. The paper presents also the project supported by
   the Agenzia dell'Italia digitale (AGID) dedicated to the definition of a
   common classification plan for administrative functions in the public
   sector. Even if not complete the picture is able to provide elements to
   evaluate the tools and their critical aspects, to stress the need for
   cooperation, to update the present systems and study general
   methodologies. The contribution is also dedicated to the role of
   professionals with specific experience in the records management systems
   for public sector.}},

Abstract = {{The use and abuse of digital technology in teaching and learning become
   a necessity in digital era. The digital era challenges future teacher to
   use information technology in teaching and learning at school with
   creative and innovative ways. PGSD (Elementary School Teacher of
   Education) students should also have the ability of using technology
   with creative and innovative ways in their teaching competences. This
   article aimed to investigate how to develop digital literacy skill by
   Digital Learning model in the classroom. The Digital Learning Model must
   be done by finding, managing, processing and presenting data from
   digital information. This study used R\&D design and the subject were 20
   second grade students from PGSD FKIP UMMI academic year 2015/2016. Data
   were gathered through observation, questionnaires, and interviews. This
   study revealed that this learning model made learning more meaningful
   and improved communication skills on how to present data visually. Based
   on this study results, it is recommended for lecturers to use this
   learning model to improve digital literacy skill.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter reveals the overview of intellectual property (IP), the
   perspectives on intellectual property rights (IPRs), the importance of
   IP in global business, and the importance of IPRs in global business. IP
   is an asset category involving four distinct types (i.e., copyrights,
   trademarks, patents, and trade secrets). Many industries rely on the
   adequate enforcement of their copyrights, trademarks, and patents, while
   consumers utilize IP to ensure they are purchasing the guaranteed
   products. IPRs promote the confidence and ease of mind that consumers
   demand and markets rely on. Enforced IPRs ensure products are authentic,
   and of the high quality that consumers recognize and expect. The chapter
   argues that IP stimulates innovation and economic growth, as it helps
   bring in monetary returns, build brand visibility, and enhance business
   success in the digital age.}},

   procedures for a specific type of damage and subsequent repair of a
   Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic Composite (CFRP) aerostructure, along
   with an analysis of the process based on ergonomic methodologies and

   unique ability to increase the operator efficiency and reduce the
   opportunities for injury. The key benefit of this research is the
   demonstration of the potentialities of using 3D environments to
   highlight process issues and to provide design suggestions that will
   reduce the time and cost of the repair. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Nowadays digital substitutes of human beings ( digital humans), capable
   of interacting with digital mock-ups in Virtual Reality, are widely used
   in many fields of engineering (e.g. ergonomics, product design,
   maintenance, and training). Nevertheless, the animation process of
   digital humans is still a time-consuming task, and its accuracy and
   reliability strongly depend on the experience and the skills of the
   operator. This paper presents an innovative algorithm capable of
   significantly speeding up the animation process of digital humans,
   allowing the operator to focus only on the so-called ``task-related
   control points{''}. This approach allows also to easily conduct
   biomechanical analyses. The algorithm has been tested with reference to
   several application scenarios in Virtual Reality. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The use of batteries and other electrochemical devices in modern power
   systems is rapidly increasing, with stricter requirements in terms of
   cost, efficiency and reliability. Innovative monitoring solutions are
   therefore urged to allow a successful development of a wide range of
   emerging applications, including electric vehicles and large-scale
   energy storage to support renewable energy generation. Presently, a huge
   gap still exists between the accurate and sophisticated monitoring
   techniques commonly employed in laboratory tests, on the one hand, and
   the simple and rough solutions available in most commercial
   applications, on the other hand. The objective of this paper is
   therefore to contribute to the development of low-cost but accurate
   solutions for commercial battery condition monitoring, by proposing an
   embedded system that combines real-time digital signal processing with
   the high computational power and user friendly interface of a modern
   computer, at a cost comparable to a simple micro-controller. In more
   detail, the paper focuses on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on a
   battery performed by a DC-DC power converter, and it explains how the
   proposed low-cost off-the-shelf hardware can control the converter,
   acquire the measurement signals, accurately process them in the time and
   frequency domains, and estimate the result uncertainty in real-time,
   which is necessary to promptly and reliably detect any variation in the
   battery condition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a conceptual paper based on the method of literature
   review and case study (second-hand data). The paper has three aims.
   First, it tries to discuss the correlations between PSS and other terms
   that contribute to PSS development in the last four decades. Following
   the literature review, a chronicle chart of PSS development is compiled
   to link PSS with these main terms, environmental sustainability and
   digital technology. Second, it intends to explore the impact of digital
   technology on PSS and sustainability. Third, it aims to develop a
   conceptual framework, in which all PSS actors including suppliers,
   integrators, customers, end users and the society co-create value for a
   sustainable economy facilitated by digital technology. There are two
   main contributions of this paper. One is that it is the first time to
   compile such a PSS chronicle chart to show the correlation. The other is
   that the framework embraces the idea of oneness between product and
   services, functional fulfillment and social needs, and economic growth
   and sustainability that call for value co-creation. The framework can
   serve as an education model and practice guide for academia, industry
   practitioners, policy makers and non-government organizations (NGOs).

Abstract = {{This paper copes with the research challenges of Smart Product-Service
   Systems (PSS). It conceptualizes Smart PSS as a digital-based ecosystem
   of value creation characterized by high complexity, dynamics and
   interconnectedness among stakeholders. Against this background, the
   paper shows the demands for more integrated engineering methods and
   raises research questions that call for specific solutions, for example,
   with respect to IT-security or organizational transformation. Finally,
   the paper introduces new research infrastructure facilities that are
   geared to generate specific solutions for Smart PSS. The
   interdisciplinary research center on smart engineering described at the
   end of the paper is an invitation to the international PSS community to
   mutually explore new knowledge and methodologies for the life cycle

Abstract = {{Global society is encountering many challenges such as climate change,
   resource depletion, etc., which comes with a set of challenges and
   opportunities for businesses. Applied research in operational tools and
   methods that support sustainable product-and service systems innovation,
   aims to strengthen businesses to overcome these challenges. In recent
   years, several tools and methods have been developed in the sustainable
   product development field with focus on modelling and digitalization.
   This paper explores how sustainability has been integrated in modelling
   and simulation, and presents results from a literature review with the
   purpose of highlighting opportunities and challenges in the field.
   Furthermore, an initial model-based engineering support toolbox (MBE) is
   presented, with focus on support tools for socio-ecological
   sustainability integration in the early product development stages. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of an innovative robotic system for
   building constructions. The proposed robotic system has a modular
   structure and reconfigurability so that it can adapt to different
   construction requirements. The robotic system developed in this paper is
   applied in residential low-rise buildings (ground floor plus three
   floors and attic). The reconfigurable system presented in this paper
   implies the possibility of applying three different types of robots: the
   parallel SCARA, construction Delta robots and redundant, hyper articular
   robot for infrastructure inspection. The modular structure ensures rapid
   assembly and disassembly, functionality of the system even in the event
   of failure of one component of the module The robotic system design is
   conceived on the model of 3D printers with the possibility of easy
   replacement of various end effectors to manipulate the material in
   construction, assembly installation and final processing of the facade
   and walls. In the conclusion section of the paper a brief comparative
   analysis of conventional ways of constructing and discussion about the
   innovative approach of using robots in highly automated processes of
   building construction will be given.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The role of the Chief Research Informatics Officer (CRIO) is
   emerging in academic health centers to address the challenges clinical
   researchers face in the increasingly digitalized, data-intensive
   healthcare system. Most current CRIOs are the first officers in their
   institutions to hold that role. To date there is very little published
   information about this role and the individuals who serve it.
   Objective: To increase our understanding of the CRIO role, the leaders
   who serve it, and the factors associated with their success in their
   organizations.
   Methods: The Clinical Research Informatics Working Group of the American
   Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) conducted a national survey of
   CRIOs in the United States and convened an expert panel of CRIOs to
   discuss their experience during the 2016 AMIA Annual Symposium.
   Results: CRIOs come from diverse academic backgrounds. Most have advance
   training and extensive experience in biomedical informatics but the
   majority have been CRIOs for less than three years. CRIOs identify
   funding, data governance, and advancing data analytics as their major
   challenges.
   Conclusion: CRIOs play an important role in helping shape the future of
   clinical research, innovation, and data analytics in healthcare in their
   organizations. They share many of the same challenges and see the same
   opportunities for the future of the field. Better understanding the
   background and experience of current CRIOs can help define and develop
   the role in other organizations and enhance their influence in the field
   of research informatics.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual art residencies are a phenomenon generally unknown, both within
   and outside the hegemonic cultural and artistic circuits, compared to
   its non-digital analogues. Nevertheless, these innovative initiatives
   offer numerous advantages and opportunities to the artists interested in
   generating new dimensions for the art expression on the Internet. After
   detection of a significant lack of professional studies about virtual
   art residencies, the current research intends to make them known
   providing a solid theoretical basis, increasing its critical literature
   and fostering its participation, dissemination and creation. The
   methodology used is based on the review of the critical literature about
   art residencies (both physical and virtual) and combines the collection
   and analysis of objective data with the study of the subjective
   interpretation from the organizations (also called ``hosts) involved in
   the creation and development of these initiatives. Finally, from the
   analysis of the quantitative and qualitative information that seeks to
   respond to what is and what does imply a virtual art residency, it is
   appropriate to propose a practical and specific definition for these
   virtual art residencies that includes the different contributions arisen
   throughout the investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this paper is to recognize and to underline the role
   of engagement as the core of a digital and social media strategy. Since
   many fashion brands haven't exploited completely the potentialities that
   the continuously evolving digital media can offer, we have reviewed the
   literature in an effort to structure an approach to define an effective
   digital media strategy. Furthermore, we examined the Burberry case to
   identify the axes that addressed brand strategy and the role of
   engagement in its success. The main contribution of the paper is
   therefore an engagement-oriented approach to the definition process of a
   digital strategy that can be implemented by companies who intend to
   enter the digital business. The current scenario demands a continuously
   evolving mind-set and organization focused not only on reaching target
   audiences, but also on retaining them through a customer-centric
   strategy. The suggested approach might be adopted by companies belonging
   to various sectors, but customer engagement can be especially useful for
   visually-oriented sectors like fashion, where consumers are easily
   reached and already overloaded with content from many sources, and where
   a captivating and innovative digital marketing strategy can become a
   critical success factor.}},

Title = {{Personalised digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful
   alcohol consumption in community-dwelling populations}},
Journal = {{COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and
   psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm
   in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol
   consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention
   in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have
   enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or
   smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem
   alcohol consumption.
   Objectives
   To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital
   interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption,
   alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community,
   specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and
   cost-effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii)
   Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face
   brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component
   behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their
   mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the
   development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives
   were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the
   digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care,
   education or other community-based settings and those where it is
   offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to
   specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g.
   functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on
   outcomes.
   Search methods
   We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of
   Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers
   and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists
   of included trials and relevant systematic reviews.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the
   effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or
   with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful
   alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a
   measure of alcohol consumption.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane
   Collaboration.
   Main results
   We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants.
   The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding
   (36\% and 21\% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one
   studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the
   primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a
   digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95\% CI 15
   to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or
   minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence).
   Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that
   participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one
   drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls
   (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about
   one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group
   compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in
   15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit
   per occasion less than no intervention control participants
   (moderate-quality evidence).
   Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and
   face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol
   consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95\% CI -24.59 to
   25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions
   produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported
   whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions.
   A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22).
   `B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in
   g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether
   individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs
   of goal setting (B -43.94, 95\% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B
   -48.03, 95\% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B
   -74.20, 95\% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71,
   95\% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95\% CI -72.66
   to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption
   in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B
   > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B
   -95.12, 95\% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95\% CI
   -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95\% CI -60.64 to
   -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption.
   The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies
   were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model
   (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n
   = 21, 51\%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to
   select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of
   an association between reporting theory use and intervention
   effectiveness.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower
   alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK)
   standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial
   heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the
   reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested
   there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption
   between digital and face-to-face interventions.
   The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source
   were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to
   reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an
   experimental context.
   Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present.
   Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories.
   Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in
   intervention effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{This work deals with possible alternative methodologies for education,
   considering the current context of the entertainment society, mediated
   by the Digital Technologies of Information and Communication (DTIC). In
   order to deepen these reflections, a qualitative research was made,
   based on narratives, field notes and the researchers' reports. These
   researchers written this article and were responsible for the
   elaboration of the Vacation courses. As a result, it was found that for
   meaningful learning with alternative methodologies, the construction of
   knowledge must take place in an active way, involving students and
   facilitating teachers. In order for teachers to be able to use active
   and alternative methodologies appropriately, it is desirable that they
   be enabled in their initial and / or continuing training courses in
   these innovative learning and teaching practices.}},

Abstract = {{Blockchain - the innovation behind Bitcoin - enables people to exchange
   digital money with complete trust, and seems to be completely
   transforming the way we think about trust. While blockchain is designed
   for secured, immutable funds transfer in trustless and decentralized
   environment, the underlying storage of blockchain is very simple with
   only limited supports for data access. Moreover, blockchain data are
   highly compressed before flushing to hard disk, making it harder to have
   an insight of these valuable data set. In this work, we develop EtherQL,
   an efficient query layer for Ethereum - the most representative
   open-source blockchain system. EtherQL provides highly efficient query
   primitives for analyzing blockchain data, including range queries and
   top-k queries, which can be integrated with other applications with much
   flexibility. Moreover, EtherQL is designed to provide different levels
   of abstraction, which are suitable for data analysts, researchers and
   application developers.}},

Title = {{Measuring and mapping the emergence of the digital economy: a comparison

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a method to quantify
   the digital economy using a representative measurement approach and use
   it to analyze the USA, Germany, the Republic of Korea and Sweden.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research approach of this paper is
   based on a developed methodology to identify firms of the digital
   economy by measuring the market capitalization of selected countries in
   comparison over time using financial databases.
   Findings - Comparing the market capitalization of the digital economy,
   the USA lead both in absolute as well as in relative terms. The 11 firms
   with the largest market capitalization are all American. For Germany,
   the results show that policy measures should be undertaken to ameliorate
   competitiveness in the field.
   Research limitations/implications - This current measurement only
   includes public firms. An interesting avenue for future research would
   be to transfer the approach to investigate private firms.
   Originality/value - Previous research has focused on comparing
   information and communication technologies adoption and infrastructure
   as well as innovation hubs between countries. The authors are not aware
   of any paper to date which has compared market capitalization in the
   digital economy between countries using a representative sample. This
   paper offers a research approach to measure and compare the digital
   economy between countries. The methodology could be applied to other
   countries which seek to benchmark their performance and derive policy
   measures to be able to compete with jurisdictions leading in the digital
   economy.}},

   instruments were shaped by three dimensions: technological, social and

   constructivist pedagogy, skills to master the platforms, and knowledge
   for the social use of technologies. There is also perceived resistance

Abstract = {{Purpose - The UN statistics show that the world's population is expected
   to be nine billion by the 2050. As a result, the food production must
   also be raised to 70 per cent or more. Vertical farming (VF) is an
   innovative and alternative approach to meet the challenges; however, its
   management will also be a challenge. This paper, therefore, shares the
   understanding of future food challenges and Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) and its application to manage the facility.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual digital prototype of a VF is
   developed in a BIM environment using design science. First, the data are
   collected from literature review and then analysed and simulated for
   optimum conditions in a BIM-enabled digital prototype.
   Findings - The results showed that BIM to manage a VF has not been
   researched or explored yet. However, BIM has proven its numerous
   benefits to the architecture, engineering and construction and facility
   management industries, and it is a powerful solution to design and
   manage VF to solve future food production problems.
   Originality/value - There is a very limited research on VF in the
   literature, and BIM for VF is also not discussed or researched yet. The
   originality and value of this research stems from both expanding BIM
   horizons and designing and managing VF.}},

Journal = {{GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES B-HUMAN GEOGRAPHY}},

Pages = {{256-267}},
Abstract = {{Against the backdrop of modernity entering its digital stage,
   theoretical conceptions of the relation between technology and space
   regard the two as becoming increasingly interlinked. In human geography,
   such conceptual advances are mainly reflected either in models of
   globalization as being driven by technological change or in more
   specific investigations into technologies that have an inherent relation
   to space and place, such as locative media. The article opens up a
   geographical perspective on the relation of technology and space by
   focussing on the micro-level of the everyday use of technology. A
   framework is proposed that understands the symbolic geographies involved
   in the everyday interaction with technology as a combination of numeric
   components (places and networks coded by numbers), deictic expressions
   and graphics (as in egocentric interfaces sensitive to the user's
   location) and common toponyms (established place names). Not only is
   this model applicable to the example of locative media, it also promises
   to be transferable to various kinds of complex infrastructure systems
   (including those for communication and transport) and media technology.
   The last part of the paper reflects on the apparent renaissance of
   traditional geographic concepts (such as place, landscape, region or
   nation state) in the context of digitalized lifeworlds. This can be
   explained by innovations in interface design enabling both providers and
   users of technological systems to integrate familiar geographic concepts
   into interaction language.}},

Abstract = {{This work has the purpose of presenting strategies of use of digital
   platform to engage and dynamize the teaching process. I thus understand
   the concept of gamification a process that can be developed in
   teaching-learning, aligning the concepts Web 2.0. Since its inception
   the Internet (Web) has been presented as a powerful tool that can be
   used in several contexts, including education, with its interactive and
   dynamic interfaces. The gamification of English gamification is concept
   that reflects: engagement, gameplay, reward systems and collaborative
   teachings. The proposal is to present a methodology based on 3 steps:
   Step 01 corresponds to the planning part where teacher can from several
   points: texts, problem situation, thematic of a lesson. Step 02, moment
   of teacher interaction with Socrative platform, creation of
   questionnaires, Step 03, moment of class, where the teacher provides
   access through code, so that students have the possibility to access the
   quizzes and study (Study teams) and individual, thus being able to
   review the content, study at home or in the computer laboratory of the
   educational institution or another location that is convenient, for its
   multi-platform feature: cell phone, tablet. Skimmed planning makes the
   classroom more innovative and interactive, where students become active
   agents of the teaching-learning process.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, by means of technological innovation in communication networks
   and information, it has assisted healthcare experts across the world to
   seek high-quality diagnosis as well as to communicate each other as
   second opinions via enabling extensive and faster access to the
   patients' electronic medical records, such as medical images. Medical
   images are extremely precious owing to its importance in diagnosis,
   education, and research. Recently, telemedicine applications in
   telediagnoisis, teleconsulting, telesurgery, and remote medical
   education play an imperative role in the advancement of the healthcare
   industry. Nevertheless, medical images are endured security risk, such
   as images tampering to comprise false data which may direct to wrong
   diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, watermarking of medical images
   offers the compulsory control over the flow of medical information. It
   is the typically used data hiding technique in the biomedical
   information security domain and legal authentication. In the field of
   telemedicine, exchange of medical signals is a very common practice. The
   signals are transmitted through the web and the wireless unguided media.
   The security and the authenticity are the matter of concern due to the
   various attacks on the web. Any type of the signals vulnerability in the
   biomedical data is not acceptable for the sake of proper diagnosis. A
   watermark is used to prove the ownership of the exchanged data. The
   logos of the hospitals or medical centers and electronic patient's
   report card can be added to the biomedical signals as a watermark to
   establish the property right. This work provides an extensive view about
   the existing research works in the field of watermarking techniques on
   different biomedical signals. It includes the design and evaluation
   parameters serving as a guideline in the watermarking schemes'
   development and benchmarking. This work also provides the comparative
   study between different watermarking methods. It reviews several aspects
   about digital watermarking in the medical domain. Also, it presented the
   properties of watermarking and several applications of watermarking.
   Meanwhile, it discusses the requirements and challenges that the
   biomedical watermarking process face.}},

Abstract = {{On the Waterfront Italo Falcomata of Reggio Calabria you can admire the
   most extensive tract of the walls of the Hellenistic period of ancient
   city of Rhegion. The so-called Greek Walls are one of the most
   significant and visible traces of the past linked to the culture of
   Ancient Greece in the site of Reggio Calabria territory. Over the years
   this stretch of wall has always been a part, to the reconstruction of
   Reggio after the earthquake of 1783, the outer walls at all times,
   restored countless times, to cope with the degradation of the time and
   the adjustments to the technical increasingly innovative and
   sophisticated siege. They were the subject of several studies on
   history, for the study of the construction techniques and the
   maintenance and restoration of the same. This note describes the
   methodology for the implementation of a three-dimensional model of the
   Greek Walls conducted by the Geomatics Laboratory, belonging to DICEAM
   Department of University ``Mediterranea{''} of Reggio Calabria. 3D
   modeling we made is based on imaging techniques, such as Digital
   Photogrammetry and Computer Vision, by using a drone. The acquired
   digital images were then processed using commercial software Agisoft
   PhotoScan. The results denote the goodness of the technique used in the
   field of cultural heritage, attractive alternative to more expensive and
   demanding techniques such as laser scanning.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is one of the most substitutes
   developing nanotechnologies for electronic circuits, as a result of
   lower force utilization, higher speed and smaller size in correlation
   with CMOS innovation. The essential devices, a Quantum-dot cell can be
   utilized to logic gates and wires. As it is the key building block on
   nanotechnology circuits. By applying simple gates, the hardware
   requirements for a QCA circuit can be decreased and circuits can be less
   complex as far as level, delay and cell check. This article exhibits an
   unobtrusive methodology for actualizing novel upgraded simple and
   universal gates, which can be connected to outline numerous variations
   of complex QCA circuits. Proposed gates are straightforward in structure
   and capable as far as implementing any digital circuits. The main aim is
   to build all basic and universal gates in a simple circuit with and
   without crossbar-wire. Simulation results and physical relations affirm
   its handiness in actualizing each advanced circuit.}},

Abstract = {{In today's world of portable and super fast electronic gadgets, speed is
   major concern point. Multiplication is used in many applications such as
   Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and digital filtering. If
   the multipliers too slow, the performance of entire circuits will be
   reduced. On VLSI implementation level, the area also becomes quite
   important as more area means more system cost. So, speed and area are
   two important parameters in VLSI Design. This paper presents the design
   a Double Stage multiplier for 32{*}32 binary bit number multiplication.
   The proposed system consists of 2 stages of operation. The two stages of
   operation is used to complete the operation of multiplier. By extending
   the bits of generator an additional product of Double Stage multiplier
   is obtained. By lowering the complexity of the product of partial
   reduction we can reduce the area and delay. So, multiplication operation
   is performed by the Double Stage is efficient with the less area and it
   reduces delay i.e., speed is increased.}},

   has been set up with an eye to achieving integration within the current
   administrative management process and to involving new actors in the
   decision-making process through a ``collective governance{''} approach.
   Therefore, this paper seeks to set up a methodological (and
   technological) framework, which is seen as crucial for addressing the
   complexity and dynamics of urban planning and programming, by
   integrating the perspectives of citizens through their actual
   engagement.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the question of how
   social entrepreneurs achieve the desired impact-based model of business.
   Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative research design included
   semi-structured in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs of three Chilean
   Tourism B Corporations (B Corps), participant observation of the Latin
   American B Movement, and print, digital and social media clippings.
   Findings - This research unearths the practices by which entrepreneurs
   implement their aspirations of balancing profit and social impact
   obligations within their business models.
   Research limitations/implications - Though an intentional sample is not
   representative in quantitative terms, the employed research design
   allowed the authors to deepen the understanding of the processes which
   are taking place in Chile, Latin America, and on the Global scale. The
   authors concluded that social benefit commitment guides innovation in
   business models of Chilean entrepreneurs seeking to have a broader
   positive impact on vulnerable communities and the society at large.
   Practical implications - This research shows that traditional businesses
   have the possibility of hybridizing management, combining the necessary
   organization that defines its mission with social or environmental
   purposes. The latter is likely to open up new markets for traditional
   businesses.
   Social implications - Social entrepreneurship is the principal means for
   new generations of entrepreneurs to make changes in businesses and in
   vulnerable local communities through global aspirations. But the need
   for more open political discussion within the B Movement is clear,
   especially regarding the nexus between the ``negative externalities{''}
   of the traditional economy and social or environmental problems which
   the B Corps intend to solve. Such debate would allow companies and the
   movement to more easily identify new courses of action.
   Originality/value - This study gives account of regional nuances of
   social entrepreneurship and social innovation phenomena. In particular,
   there has been a surge of impact-oriented rather than profit-oriented
   innovation initiatives in neoliberal-oriented Latin American states,
   such as Chile. These initiatives offer us a wealth of empirical
   information about the development of alternative business models.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY AND SERVICE SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3-4, SI}},
Pages = {{317-330}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Today's generations face the effect that knowledge is no more
   usable for decades or even centuries. The pace of change as well as its
   profoundness has reached levels that cause massive changes in companies,
   but also whole societies. Some call this phenomenon the 4th industrial
   revolution or Industry 4.0. Others use the term ``digital
   transformation{''}. Does this mean that quality managers are becoming
   obsolete soon? How do the Quality occupations adopt? Which changes need
   to be accomplished in the field of Quality occupations to provide
   sustainable competencies for future employees? What tasks and functions
   need to be carried out? And how can these tasks be defined on a
   universal basis that fits for different kind of branches as well as
   small and big companies?
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on Abbotts ``System of
   Professions{''}, the development of a transformation concept for Quality
   occupations is carried out. The purpose of this paper is to define basic
   professional positions in the field of Quality Engineering regarding
   quality assurance (QA) and quality management (QM) as well as from an
   operative to a strategic level. Tasks and responsibilities of todays and
   future businesses models are clustered and enhanced or specified. In a
   survey, which included 389 executive managers in Germany, the German
   Association of Quality elevated those jurisdictions and their
   competences of QA and QM professionals. The results are used to define
   the new role bundle model for Quality occupations in Germany.
   Findings - The innovative and sustainable role bundle model offers
   defined Quality occupations for future business models needed for the
   4th digital revolution. Thereby, not every role has to be taken by a
   separate employee in a business organisation. By offering different kind
   of clusters, the role bundle model helps to create agile role profiles
   regarding the actual business situation and its size. This way, tasks
   and jurisdictions within the business organisation can be adapted fast
   to the changes of the business organisation.
   Originality/value - The innovative concept is based on two success
   criteria: the creation of Quality occupations according to the changes
   of digital transformation and a survey involving more than 350 German
   executive managers in the field of Quality. Based on the results, a role
   bundle model for Quality occupations is designed that helps to
   coordinate education programmes at universities and professional
   trainings in Germany.}},

Abstract = {{Organizations make extensive use of websites to communicate with people.
   Often, visitors to their sites speak many different languages and expect
   that they will be served in their native language. Translation of web
   content is a major challenge for many organizations because of high
   costs and frequent changes in the content. Currently, organizations rely
   on professional translators or machines to translate their content. The
   challenge is that professional translations is costly and too slow while
   machine translations do not produce high quality or accurate
   translations even though they may be faster and less expensive.
   Crowdsourcing has emerged as a technique with many applications. The
   purpose of this research is to test whether crowdsourcing can produce
   equivalent or better quality translations than professional or machine
   translators. A crowdsourcing study was undertaken and the results
   indicate that the quality of crowdsourced translations was equivalent to
   professional translations and far better than machine translations. The
   research and managerial implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Per the ALARA principle, reducing the dose
   delivered to both patients and staff must be a priority for endovascular
   therapists, who should monitor their own practice. We evaluated patient
   exposure to radiation during common neurointerventions performed with a
   recent flat-panel detector angiographic system and compared our results
   with those of recently published studies. Methods: All consecutive
   patients who underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiography or intervention
   on 2 modern flat-panel detector angiographic biplane systems (Innova IGS
   630, GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK) from February to November
   2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Dose-area product (DAP), cumulative
   air kerma (CAK) per plane, fluoroscopy time (FT), and total number of
   digital subtraction angiography (DSA) frames were collected, reported as
   median (interquartile range), and compared with the previously published
   literature. Results: A total of 755 consecutive cases were assessed in
   our institution during the study period, including 398 diagnostic
   cerebral angiographies and 357 interventions. The DAP (Gy x cm(2)),
   fontal and lateral CAK (Gy), FT (min), and total number of DSA frames
   were as follows: 43 (33-60), 0.26 (0.19-0.33), 0.09 (0.07-0.13), 5.6
   (4.2-7.5), and 245 (193-314) for diagnostic cerebral angiographies, and
   66 (41-110), 0.46 (0.25-0.80), 0.18 (0.10-0.30), 18.3 (9.1-30.2), and
   281 (184-427) for interventions. Conclusion: Our diagnostic cerebral
   angiography group had a lower median and was in the 75th percentile of
   DAP and FT when compared with the published literature. For
   interventions, both DAP and number of DSA frames were significantly
   lower than the values reported in the literature, despite a higher FT.
   Subgroup analysis by procedure type also revealed a lower or comparable
   DAP. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on the work of Steve Benford, Gabriella Giannachi, Oliver Grau
   and Mark Hansen, this article explores the paradigms of mixed reality
   worlds in order to try to establish how aesthetic illusion is negotiated
   in the shift from a culture of representation in which art is formed by
   a fixed gaze and perspective which audiences interpret privately, to a
   culture of participation that offersaudiences multiple opportunities for
   interaction with the work and each other. This analysis is important
   because it investigates the interfaces between real and virtual through
   an analysis of convergence culture and play. It will be argued that the
   work of Blast Theory and 1927 demonstrate how the development of digital
   and mobile technology has revived contemporary cultural interest in play
   as a dynamic that allows societies and communities to communicate and
   connect, evaluating their realities and imagining new ones, especially
   through a re-imagined positioning of the body. In this sense, play has
   become a practice strongly related to processes of social and cultural
   innovation.}},

Title = {{Understanding researchers' intention to publish in open access journals}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1149-1166}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how attitudes,
   norms (injunctive and descriptive) and perceived behavioral control
   (PBC) (capacity and autonomy) influence the intention to publish open
   access (OA), and how personal innovativeness in information technology
   affects attitude and PBC.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study employs an integrated and
   extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework within a
   cross-sectional survey design. The sample consists of researchers at a
   Norwegian university, and data are collected digitally via e-mail
   invitation and analyzed using structural equation modeling.
   Findings - This study determines that attitude is the strongest
   predictor of the intention to publish OA, followed by injunctive and
   descriptive social norms, and PBC capacity and autonomy. All factors
   positively influence intention apart from PBC autonomy, which has a
   negative effect.
   Research limitations/implications - Potential limitations include: a
   relatively small sample size, self-reported data and employing
   intention, not behavior, as the ultimate dependent variable.
   Practical implications - This research contributes with a deeper
   understanding of what drives the intention to publish OA research
   articles, and how innovativeness affects attitudes and PBC autonomy.
   Support is found for an extended TPB model with decomposed normative and
   PBC components. This knowledge is essential in creating an impetus for
   systematic research on OA publishing behavior.
   Originality/value - Theory-driven research into understanding OA
   publishing behavior is rare. Decomposing the normative and PBC
   constructs is uncommon in TPB research, and a novel approach in OA
   research. Personal innovativeness has not been explored previously in
   relation to OA publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct a UK-based assessment
   of oral history technology and to identify the most important features
   that should be available in any oral history search system.
   Design/methodology/approach - A co-design approach involving interviews
   and focus groups was adopted. The framework approach with elements of
   grounded theory was used to analyse transcripts to identify themes.
   Findings - The analysis found that ``ethics, consent and control{''},
   ``accessibility and engagement{''}, ``publicity and awareness{''}, and
   ``innovative technologies{''} were the four major themes identified. It
   was also established that there is limited understanding of oral history
   in the digital age, numerous interests, ethical concerns, lack of
   publicity and several key attributes that those designing an oral
   history search system or archive should strive for. The findings also
   identified that further exploration into sampling selected technologies
   on different user groups is required in order to develop software that
   would benefit the field.
   Research limitations/implications - Participants were all recruited from
   one geographic region. The qualitative methodology utilised could be
   deemed to have elements of subjectivity.
   Practical implications - This study has identified important features of
   any oral history search system and offered design recommendations for
   any developer of an oral history search systems.
   Originality/value - This research has validated some previous findings
   for oral history search systems from more limited user studies. New
   issues for consideration including usability, software development and
   marketing have also been identified.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The elastic reconstruction of 5G network services provides the
   capability of network slice orchestration to access the network on
   demand, guarantee service experience on demand, and construct services
   on demand as well as to construct basic network services with lower
   costs. In this paper, the Cloud-ICT Convergence Service Architecture to
   construct an open and elastic digital information ecosystem is proposed.
   By constantly adapting to the requirements of 5G, the architecture will
   make network slices smaller to fit the requirements of agility in some
   scenarios, and will support telecom operators in building a cloud-based
   network, implementing network slicing, and bringing service innovation,
   management transformation and smooth evolution to future 5G networks.
   This paper also describes the procedure of adding new slices for
   vertical industry applications, and illustrates how this system could
   effectively be put into operation, for example in the vertical market in
   the carrier industry. Based on the cloud network integration
   architecture, a distributed SDN controller, D-ZENIC, is introduced for
   scalability.}},

Title = {{The moderating effect of personal features on the consequences of an
   enjoyable co-creation experience}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{386-401}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to draw a more nuanced picture of the impact
   of co-creation experience shedding light on the moderating role of
   consumers' personal features. Virtual co-creation is considered a viable
   strategy to develop consumer-centered products in the digital era. As an
   additional effect, this research highlighted that co-creation
   experiences may establish beneficial consumer-brand relationships.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using survey data stemming from 727
   consumers who virtually engaged in new product development projects, the
   authors test the hypotheses, applying structural equation modeling.
   Findings - The results of this study show that consumers' personal
   features such as novelty seeking and dissatisfaction with existing
   products moderate the impact of an enjoyable experience on aspects of
   the consumer-company relationship. Consumers' dissatisfaction with
   current product solutions is also found to moderate the relationship
   between an enjoyable co-creation experience and evoked product interest
   as well as between product involvement and evoked product interest. The
   study further substantiates previous findings on the
   relationship-effects of co-creation and particularly highlight the
   potential of co-creation experiences for nurturing ``imaginary{''}
   relationships with the product being co-created significantly prior to
   market launch.
   Originality/value - Participants in virtual co-creation approaches are
   widely heterogeneous individuals ranging from customers and Facebook
   fans to brand community members and innovative users. The study
   contributes to a better understanding of how the diversity of the crowd
   can be handled in virtual co-creation and advances the theory of value
   co-creation as a new marketing paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{Today, digital has invaded all areas and the sectors of the economy of
   information and communication contributes to the largest share of
   wealth. The trend accelerated during the last 15 years of the digital
   economy and the new Information and Communication Technology (NICT)
   diffusion affect the enterprise competitiveness and the country level on
   the international market also.
   This work aims briefly the theoretical competitiveness concept and NICT
   impact under the development and innovation of a country competitiveness
   process. Secondly, this paper aims the empirical findings within a data
   analysis for the 35 countries sample during 2012-2015 years in order to
   examine the relationship between NICT development and the global
   competitiveness of the Euro-Mediterranean region, issues related in the
   productivity evolution and enabling innovation as key indicators of the
   overall countries competitiveness of this area.}},

Abstract = {{The community development in different domains (business, education,
   welfare, etc.) has been the prime focus over the last decade due to the
   evolution of digital technologies and the shift in working patterns.
   However, many public and private investments have failed to produce
   sustaining and real value from them. The observed deficiencies which are
   causing the failure of community development projects ranged from
   initiation within the artificial and closed laboratory to open learning
   environments. The community development is entailed without
   understanding the real community needs, community's value chain, and
   potential problems with limited interactions. These shortcomings have
   resulted in failure to develop effective, prosperous, and world class
   communities, leveraging the new innovative and powerful approaches. An
   approach to developing collaborative systems, called Living Lab (LILA),
   is discussed in this paper and this approach has empowered and engaged
   the communities (students, lecturers, computer scientists, electronics
   engineers, visually impaired and blind people) to experiment and learn
   the innovative solutions of their real-world problems. The theme of this
   innovation-led approach is to embed community-driven solution within the
   communities.
   This paper presents the actual framework for the establishment of a
   Living Lab using specific case study at Birmingham City University
   (BCU), along with its impact on community development. This research
   determines the key features that the visually impaired would find useful
   in a mobility cane called ``XploR{''}. The smart cane incorporates
   facial recognition technology to alert the user when they are
   approaching a relative or friend from up to 10 m away. This is a
   revolutionary `smart' cane enabling blind people to instantly identify
   friends and family. The cane also features GPS functionality to aid
   navigation. This project is part of LILA, a European initiative
   encouraging entrepreneurship and fostering internationalisation.}},

Abstract = {{The higher education system worldwide is on the cusp of disruptive
   change due to innovative education providers such as digital platforms
   and universities offering fully online or blended programs. While the
   e-learning industry in the UAE is projected to grow significantly, the
   level of adoption of e-learning has not been high. The overall purpose
   of our multistage research project is to understand the barriers to the
   adoption of e-learning in the UAE despite the benefits of online
   education, such as lower costs and pedagogical benefits. We propose a
   preliminary conceptual framework explaining the students' attitudes and
   intention to adopt e-learning. In our future research, we will refine
   and test the conceptual framework and provide guidelines for higher
   education institutions and policymakers on institutional change to
   support e-learning initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Technology has changed the way marketers interact and engage with
   customers and data. New and exciting technologies are emerging but there
   is little consensus about their relative importance beyond the initial
   hype. Augmented reality (AR) is one such technology that has the
   potential to facilitate dialogue and interaction between physical and
   digital worlds potentially leading to the creation of value for both
   customers and organizations. In this chapter we propose that AR can also
   aid the research process and generate deeper and more meaningful
   customer insights which will aid the reduction of customer-perceived
   risks. This chapter emphasizes the importance of AR in marketing and
   seeks to encourage discussion of the potential uses for AR in overcoming
   traditional limitations in marketing and customer research.}},

   study internet and other digital media in mass communication. A specific
   objective was to study and apply digital strategies to broadcast
   scientific contributions of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San
   Marcos. It is an applied, cross-sectional study. It uses podcast,
   streaming and hypertext. As a result, the Media Lab UNMSM was created.
   Today is a Research Nucleus of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San
   Marcos. A Media Lab enables students and professors to innovate with
   digital media. It also helps to spread scientific content among the
   community. It is the first Media Lab of the Peruvian university.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Although social media proficiency and use are key business and
   marketing practices in today's digital environment, research has failed
   to offer sufficient insights into what drives small firms to use social
   media and how they vitalise co-creative social media environments with
   consumers. In response, the purpose of this paper is to examine how
   small firms utilise social media to interact and build bonds with
   consumers. These bonds become an important tool in the development of
   successful, profitable businesses and marketing practices in the digital
   age.
   Design/methodology/approach - To examine how small firms use social
   media to engage with consumers and vice versa, the authors utilised a
   case-study approach and collected qualitative data by conducting
   semi-structured interviews.
   Findings - The results showed that the small firms in this research seek
   to establish relationships and facilitate interactions with their core
   consumers in order to co-create value. In particular, the data
   demonstrate that producers engage in two distinctive practices: bonding
   (i.e. cultivating emotional ties with music fans) and spreading (i.e.
   encouraging expressive circulation by fans). Altogether, the findings
   indicate that the representative firms in this research use social media
   to develop synergistic relationships with consumers and to tap into the
   collective energy of consumers in their business environments.
   Originality/value - The authors show that small companies use social
   media to establish relationships and interact with fans in order to
   co-create value and vitalise collective consumption, engagement, and
   participation. The case blurs the traditional distinction between
   production and consumption and suggests that the value of goods is a
   social creation, not merely a manufactured product.}},

Journal = {{MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS}},

Pages = {{236-244}},
Abstract = {{The aim of the article. The purpose of the article is to analyze the
   challenges and targets of economic entities in the new digital world in
   order to develop recommendations for the management of one of the most
   dangerous economic risk-IT-risk.
   The results of the analysis. This paper analyzes the state and
   development of the digital world of today. It is shown that this stage
   of human development is characterized by the global information and
   communication revolution, analogues of which the world has never known.
   The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) causes a
   transition to an innovative model of economic development and new forms
   of business organization that are based on the management of information
   and knowledge. The growth of non-material production is becoming a key
   element of the digital economy and, ICTs are becoming the driving force
   behind the development of today's society.
   The article dissects the dynamics of the ICT contribution to GDP growth
   in the developed and developing countries. The results of the analysis
   showed that in the developed countries the contribution of ICT to the
   GDP growth declined in recent years, while in developing countries it
   increased. At the same time, annual growth rate of GDP in the developing
   countries was significantly higher than in developed countries,
   especially in the post-crisis years. The analysis led to the conclusion
   that the digital technologies qualitatively help enterprises to improve
   operational efficiency, reduce the cost of social and economic
   transactions and significantly contribute to innovation. They increase
   the efficiency of companies, transforming the existing types of
   activities into fast, comfortable and cheap ones.
   However, there is a downside to the dividends of the new digital world,
   which shows an increase in the number of emerging risks. The paper
   analyzes the most important risk factors in the world as a whole, and in
   its individual regions. It has been shown that the most dangerous risks
   of doing business at this stage are the IT-risks and cyber-risks, which
   cause considerable damage to the global economy. The following trends of
   IT-risks are substantiated: -
   The growth in the total number of adverse events and their hardening;
   The increase in the number of targeted attacks, cases of intellectual
   property theft and cyber-extortion, the increase in the number of bank
   fishing situations;
   The further spread of risks beyond the financial market;
   The increase in the vulnerability of control systems of enterprises;
   The tightening of legislation at the global level;
   The increase in awareness of the need for insurance of IT-risks and the
   growth of insurance volumes.
   Conducted analysis showed that the protection of information, and,
   hence, the cyber risk management, should be a priority for businesses
   and other entities. The article deals with the problems and challenges
   of cyber-risk management at both the macro and the micro levels. Risk
   management at the macro level should include the development of national
   information security policies and monitoring the policy of other
   countries regarding all networks and systems. Risk management at the
   micro level should include a system of measures, among which the
   insurance of cyber risks is gaining the greatest popularity.
   Conclusions and directions of further research. The development of
   information and communication technologies in addition to the positive
   effect also bears a negative effect, which manifests itself into the
   rapid growth of cyber-risks causing significant damage as to separate
   business entities, and to the world economy as a whole. One way to speed
   up the spread of digital dividends today is a competent risk management
   in the IT-sphere, which requires further research, particularly in the
   insurance industry.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional lecture-centered approaches alone are inadequate for
   preparing students for the challenges of creative problem solving in the
   STEM disciplines. As an alternative, learner-centered and other
   high-impact pedagogies are gaining prominence. The Wabash College 3D
   Printing and Fabrication Center (3D-PFC) supports several initiatives on
   campus, but one of the most successful is a computer-aided design (CAD)
   and fabrication-based undergraduate research internship program. The
   first cohort of four students participated in an eight-week program
   during the summer of 2015. A second group of the four students was
   successfully recruited to participate the following summer. This
   intensive materials science research experience challenged students to
   employ digital design and fabrication in the design, testing, and
   construction of inexpensive scientific instrumentation for use in
   introductory STEM courses at Wabash College. The student research
   interns ultimately produced a variety of successful new designs that
   could be produced for less than \$ 25 per device and successfully detect
   analytes of interest down to concentrations in the parts per million
   (ppm) range. These student-produced instruments have enabled innovations
   in the way introductory instrumental analysis is taught on campus.
   Beyond summer work, the 3D-PFC staffed student interns during the
   academic year, where they collaborated on various cross-disciplinary
   projects with students and faculty from departments such as mathematics,
   physics, biology, rhetoric, history, classics, and English. Thus far,
   the student work has led to three campus presentations, four
   presentations at national professional conferences, and three
   peer-reviewed publications. The following report highlights initial
   progress as well as preliminary assessment findings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the new designed data model of AlrMaps and new
   possibilities of linguistic maps generation and editing. The first
   version of the Linguistic Atlases Publishing System (LAPS) was developed
   to enable the publishing of the New Romanian Linguistic Atlas by
   Regions. Moldova and Bukovina (NALR-MB). The third and the fourth
   volumes were prepared using LAPS. Over time, the interest of
   dialectologists for computer-aided preparation of the linguistic atlases
   has increased and new requests have been received to adapt the system
   for the Audio-Visual Linguistic Atlas of Bukovina (ALAB) and the
   Aromanian Linguistic Atlas (ALAR) publishing.
   Considering the previously accumulated experience, a new version of LAPS
   entitled AlrMaps was developed in order to eliminate the shortcomings
   identified, to make the system independent of the map and region for
   which it will be used and last but not least to create a more friendly
   interface using the new tools available as a result of software and
   hardware progress. One of the main innovations of the new LAPS is the
   integration of GIS functions into the archiving and processing of
   linguistic data. In the future this aspect of the new application will
   facilitate the development of national geolinguistic projects for the
   Romanian dialectologists, by also using multimedia technologies in the
   configuration of complex, multidimensional linguistic databases.}},

Abstract = {{Ageing has significant impacts on the organization of healthcare systems
   and on social inclusion-especially for elderly people affected by
   Cognitive Impairment (CI). These people are significantly exposed to
   undeniable risks that can affect their health and wellbeing (falling,
   malnutrition, hygiene issues, etc.) especially when living alone. This
   paper defines a Business Model (BM) allowing independent living for
   elderly people affected by CI. This BM include: (i) an up-to-date,
   modular, flexible and scalable organizational model describing the
   activities to be accomplished by regulators and service suppliers; and
   (ii) a digital platform based on innovative and easy-to-replicate
   information and communication technologies. The organic approach to the
   development of the BM is then focused in an Italian use case as a part
   of ``DECI{''}, a ``Horizon 2020{''} project with four pilot projects in
   Israel, Italy, Spain and Sweden.}},

Abstract = {{With global megatrends like automation and digitization changing
   societies, economies, and ultimately businesses, shift is underway,
   disrupting current business plans and entire industries. Business actors
   have accordingly developed an instinctive fear of economic decline and
   realized the necessity of taking adequate measures to keep up with the
   times. Increasingly, organizations find themselves in an evolve-or-die
   race with their success depending on their capability of recognizing the
   requirements for serving a specific market and adopting those
   requirements accurately into their own structure. In the transportation
   and logistics sector, emerging technological and information challenges
   are reflected in fierce competition from within and outside. Especially,
   processes and supporting information systems are put to the test when
   technological innovation start to spread among an increasing number of
   actors and promise higher performance or lower cost. As to warehousing,
   technological innovation continuously finds its way into the premises of
   the heterogeneous warehouse operators, leading to modifications and
   process improvements. Such innovation can be at the side of the hardware
   equipment or in the form of new software solutions. Particularly, the
   fourth industrial revolution is globally underway. Same applies to
   Future Internet technologies, a European term for innovative software
   technologies and the research upon them. On the one hand, new hardware
   solutions using robotics, cyber-physical systems and sensors, and
   advanced materials are constantly put to widespread use. On the other
   one, software solutions based on intensified digitization including new
   and more heterogeneous sources of information, higher volumes of data,
   and increasing processing speed are also becoming an integral part of
   popular information systems for warehouses, particularly for warehouse
   management systems.
   With a rapidly and dynamically changing environment and new legal and
   business requirements towards processes in the warehouses and supporting
   information systems, new performance levels in terms of quality and cost
   of service are to be obtained. For this purpose, new expectations of the
   functionality of warehouse management systems need to be derived. While
   introducing wholly new solutions is one option, retrofitting and
   adapting existing systems to the new. requirements is another one. The
   warehouse management systems will need to deal with more types of data
   from new and heterogeneous data sources. Also, it will need to connect
   to innovative machines and represent their respective operating
   principles. In both scenarios, systems need to satisfy the demand for
   new features in order to remain capable of processing information and
   acting and, thereby, to optimize logistics processes in real time.
   By taking a closer look at an industrial use case of a warehouse
   management system, opportunities of incorporating such new requirements
   are presented as the system adapts to new data types, increased
   processing speed, and new machines and equipment used in the warehouse.
   Eventually, the present paper proves the adaptability of existing
   warehouse management systems to the requirements of the new digital
   world, and viable methods to adopt the necessary renovation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technologies have changed the world dramatically and, as a
   consequence, higher education is undergoing significant teaching and
   learning transformations based on their use. The need to plan and
   produce disruptive innovations for traditional learning tools brings a
   challenge in this sense. One of these modern pedagogical perspectives is
   the use of transmedia storytelling in education, which has given a new
   configuration to instructional tools and have changed their forms and
   educational function. We present a proposal of specialized vocabulary in
   reproductive biology of plants using the principles of transmedia
   storytelling. The design of an educational transmedia artifact for the
   particular terminological entry of the term ``polinizador{''} is shown
   to illustrate the proposed structure for the vocabulary. This artifact
   is constituted by diverse resources made with the use of different media
   and is based on the use of tags linked to each resource, which allow
   interactive navigation between them, structuring the storytelling about
   the selected term. Each resource adds particular information on the
   definition of the term, so that the student can obtain the answer he
   needs. Transmedia storytelling allows the students' interaction with
   resources in a way consistent with their own interests, making them the
   center of their learning.}},

Abstract = {{A university campus is comprised of Schools and Faculties attended by
   students whose primary intention is to learn and ultimately graduate
   with their desired qualification. From the moment students apply to a
   university and thereafter gain acceptance and attend the campus they
   create a unique digital footprint of themselves within the university IT
   systems. Students' digital footprints are a source of data that is of
   interest to groups including teachers, analysts, administrators and
   policy makers in the education, sociology, and pedagogy domains.
   Learning analytics can offer tools to mine such data producing
   actionable knowledge for purposes of improving student retention,
   curriculum enhancement, student progress and feedback, and
   administrative evolution. In this paper, we summarise three ongoing
   Learning Analytics projects from an Irish university, demonstrating the
   potential that exists to enhance Higher Education pedagogical
   approaches. First year students often struggle with making the
   transition into University as they adapt to life and study at a Higher
   Education Institution. The research projects in the area of Learning
   Analytics at our institution focus on: improving test performance using
   analytics from a general-purpose VLE like Moodle, identifying studying
   groups and the performance peer effect using on-campus geolocation data,
   and detecting lower-performing or at-risk students on programming
   modules.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows a model of teacher training developed by the Department
   of Mathematics of the University of Turin, aimed at introducing teachers
   to the use of innovative methodologies for learning Mathematics and for
   developing disciplinary and cross-cutting competences. The learning
   methodologies proposed are mainly based on Problem Posing and Problem
   Solving, the use of an Advanced Computing Environment, of a Virtual
   Learning Environment and of an Automated Assessment System. The training
   model, designed in blended modality, mainly relies on the creation of an
   online community of practice, where teachers, supported by tutors,
   collaborate in the creation of interactive learning materials for their
   classes. They acquire competences not only in the use of learning
   technologies, but also on sharing and collaborating in virtual
   environments; they learn how to develop self-tailored didactic
   methodologies. The key strengths of this model are highlighted and the
   results, achieved after the experimentation in several projects, are
   discussed, showing the effectiveness of the model.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH AND BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{209-217}},
Abstract = {{Background: Care and support of children with physical or mental
   disabilities are accompanied with serious concerns for parents,
   families, healthcare institutions, schools, and their communities.
   Recent studies and technological innovations have demonstrated the
   feasibility of providing therapy and rehabilitation services to children
   supported by computer games.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to present HapHop-Physio, an
   innovative computer game that combines exercise with fun and learning,
   developed to support cognitive therapies in children.
   Methods: Conventional software engineering methods such as the Scrum
   methodology, a functionality test and a related usability test, were
   part of the comprehensive methodology adapted to develop HapHop-Physio.
   Results: The game supports visual and auditory attention therapies, as
   well as visual and auditory memory activities. The game was developed by
   a multidisciplinary team, which was based on the Hopscotch r platform
   provided by Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology IDMT
   Institute in Germany, and designed in collaboration with a
   rehabilitation clinic in Colombia. HapHop-Physio was tested and
   evaluated to probe its functionality and user satisfaction.
   Conclusion: The results show the development of an easy-to-use and funny
   game by a multidisciplinary team using state-of-the-art videogame
   technologies and software methodologies. Children testing the game
   concluded that they would like to play again while undergoing
   rehabilitation therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In this paper we present Geocraft, a Geo-ICT framework meant to
   provide the information needed to support the development of smart
   cities in an accessible and user-friendly way. We explored whether
   Geocraft could be an effective way to get the people of the place,
   especially youth, involved in geospatial issues.
   Methodology/Approach: Geocraft is a virtual environment in which we
   import real geospatial data into the gaming environment of the popular
   computer game Minecraft. In Geocraft, we can run real-time impact models
   to virtually simulate and visualise future developments and their
   implications, providing the user with relevant information during design
   processes. Geocraft is linked to Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs);
   data generated or added in Geocraft can upgrade existing databases and
   SDIs. In four use cases, Geocraft is used by children and high school
   students to address spatial planning challenges with the help of
   Geocraft.
   Findings: Geocraft has an appropriate level of abstraction to
   effectively represent the real world. The use of Geocraft enhances
   insight in geospatial relations and can raise awareness and insights in
   a number of geospatial issues. Geocraft can be used to collect the ideas
   of citizens, in this case children, and engage them in urban planning
   issues to raise solutions that can reckon on public support. Geocraft
   can engage thousands of children working on the same geospatial project
   in the same online Geocraft world. Spatial scenarios designed in
   Geocraft can be effectively translated into a feasible spatial design
   and be imported to the digital environment of professional designers.
   Moreover, Geocraft turned out to be a valuable educational tool to
   develop typical 21th century skills: communicating, finding and
   evaluating information, creating and innovating, collaborating and
   problem solving.
   We conclude that as an easy to use smart visualisation tool, in which
   everybody can build future scenarios, Geocraft can be used to get the
   people of the place involved with geospatial issues.
   Research Limitation/implication: We present qualitative research
   results. In the next step, we will investigate how statistically
   significant the improvements in learning skills are.
   Originality/Value of paper: This paper presents a new digital
   environment facilitating citizen participation and educational
   processes. We use actual spatial data to transform physical reality into
   a parallel and playable virtual version of that reality. Herein we can
   simulate spatial processes and support collaboration. By doing so, we
   can provide unique visualizations of complex processes, raising insights

Abstract = {{The passage from the birth of the Web and the 3.0 has been signed by a
   series of technical innovations, which are the result of a new concept
   of sharing knowledge. 2.0 theorists speak about a new intelligence which
   is coordinated in real time on the Web and which generates a real
   mobilization of the users both in the virtual and the material realities
   (Ryan in Storia di Internet e il futuro digitale. Piccola Biblioteca
   Einaudi, Torino, 2011). Paradigms are born in relation to this
   principle: Lovink's Mediactivism, Castells' Network affinities and
   Levy's Collective Intelligence and Barabarasi's model of Small Word
   aristocratic. The aim of this project is: to analyse the affinities
   networks which are related to the theme ``citta di Chieti{''}, which are
   the movements of discussion that are created by the network and to
   understand how the social sciences could study their social form,
   content and function. The research methodology used for the analysis is
   the lukering that is an invisible and not participant observation of the
   virtual communities in a period of time going from January 2014 to
   September 2014. The lukering is part of a range of analysis instruments
   called Digital Ethnography (Underberg and Zorn in Digital Ethnography:
   Anthropology, narrative and New Media. University of Texas Press,
   Austin, 2013; Kozinets in Netnography: Doing Ethnography Research On
   Line. Sage Pubns Ltd, London, 2010). All these three typologies of
   structure which have been analysed before reflect the ``little
   aristocratic worlds{''} model described by Barabasi and the forms of
   mediactivism vary according to the structure of virtual teams and hubs
   are the elements that influence public opinion and the viral content of
   the group.}},

   areas of digital skills among Spanish and Mexican undergraduate
   students. The statistical analysis involves descriptive and correlation
   stages. Results and conclusions: This research study has confirmed that
   undergraduate students lack digital skills in the areas of

Abstract = {{Natural phenomena in mountains such as rockfalls cause severe damage to
   exposed population and assets. Numerical modelling is widely used to
   assess the hazard level (combination of phenomenon's intensity and
   frequency). This paper describes how innovative methods and tools are
   used to assess both thematic (related to the characteristics of the
   rockfalls) and spatial (related to the local topography) data
   uncertainties considering rockfall propagation. Those uncertainties are
   propagated in rockfall simulation models using classical Monte Carlo
   (probabilistic) and hybrid (possibilistic) approaches. Uncertainties
   related to the altimetric information, through Digital Elevation Model
   (DEM), are modelled by random fields using the newModTer software, that
   can produce terrain simulations. This paper compares both uncertainty
   propagation approaches, taking into account spatialized uncertain
   variables, and proposes a sensitivity analysis describing the
   contribution ofDEMvariability on the global uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technologies are driving industrial engineering towards a new
   asset management paradigm that involves the integration of system
   design, risk analysis, prognostic predictions and cost assessment.
   Evidence of such evolution is the appearance of multi-simulation
   platforms for combined analytics, characterized by an extensive sharing
   of information content. In this context, new approaches are required to
   meet the increasing complexity of modern systems. Amongst a range of
   activities that concern the design and construction of an industrial
   system, early safety assessment represents a highly interesting area of
   application. Early safety assessment helps determine the risks
   associated with a safety critical system and can be used to prevent
   expensive design iterations via early mitigation of such risks. For this
   reason, new solutions, that are able to assist design and risk engineers
   in early safety assessment, are getting increasingly important. This
   paper addresses this area by proposing a prototype solution that
   integrates a CAD software tool for the drawing of Piping and
   Instrumentation Diagrams (P\&ID) with HiP-HOPS, a well-known software
   tool based on Compositional Safety Analysis and Model Based Safety. This
   prototype enables the dependability analysis and optimization of process
   and power plants. In this approach, risk and plant engineers can work in
   teams to implement a rich extended model of the P\&IDs that embeds all
   the necessary information to automatically retrieve the fault trees
   associated with the process of the system. The immediate benefit is to
   achieve efficient dependability assessment at an early design stage. A
   case of study of a cooling water system of a chemical plant is presented
   and the potential of this work is demonstrated. Further benefits will
   arise in the future by applying innovative algorithms to the extended
   plant model that will be able to assist in design decisions, on the
   basis of the process plant characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Smartphones, e-mobility, Internet of Things (IoT) our world is situated
   in the middle of digitalization, product life cycles are short and
   innovations are particularly welcome in the information technology (IT)
   industry, as they imply a great opportunity for lucrative businesses. In
   particular, innovative start-up companies are playing an increasingly
   important role in this context. However, a strict consideration of
   country-specific circumstances (Germany and Latvia have been selected as
   examples) has to be made to evaluate founding culture. The following
   paper focusses on these issues in different ways and gives an insight of
   the entrepreneurial situation in the respective countries to the reader
   in the way how different circumstances affect start-ups and how the
   future development in the countries should be. The results show, that
   besides Germany Latvia also portrays a very attractive market with even
   hidden potential for IT start-ups.}},

Abstract = {{Organic food produce arc less harmful but often more expensive than
   their non-organic equivalents. Cost-conscious consumers would prefer
   cheaper alternatives. Over the last decades, consumers' health
   consciousness is driving the agro food industry. Healthier food products
   have entered the global markets rapidly gaining market share. Due to
   environmental concern, some consumers may favour organic food due to its
   environmentally-friendly supply chain. Organic farming methods adhere to
   standards requiring organic food merchandises with that has organic
   label grown without the use of lethal pesticides. innovations in digital
   technologies such as advanced data analytics, predictive modelling, and
   robotics are making farms more efficient. Biotechnology advances helps
   to create better and more abundant food. This study examines four
   factors (health consciousness, environmental concern, perceived value
   and social lifestyle) influence towards urban consumers' patronage
   towards of organic produce. Organic producers and marketers are facing
   dilemma of not knowing factors that influence urban consumers' patronage
   towards organic produce. Urban consumers would be more accepting towards
   innovation. Innovation adoption sets as a catalyst for our independent
   and dependent variables. This study aims to further improve strategies
   to enhance patronage of organic food produce among urban Malaysian
   consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Financial Institutions, as well as businesses are constantly looking for
   ways to innovate and provide a differentiated client experience. In this
   paper, the author analyzes the case of employee IT satisfaction in a
   bank. With the proliferation of Information Technology (IT) facilitated
   development of specialized applications, banks are competing in a new
   digital enabled environment, where disruptors and substitute products
   affects traditional lending business, payments or savings. Digital and
   self-service channels changed customer behavior, eliminated need for
   bank's employee assistance by use of mobile and e-commerce. In this new
   environment, employees and their performance plays the role of potential
   differentiator. Many authors studied how job performance is influenced
   by employee satisfaction and the information systems environment where
   hardware, communications links and software systems represent the main
   tool that client facing employees arc using to fulfill their job. The
   employee satisfaction is influenced by the perceived IT user experience
   and expected value of using IT as a job support tool. The research
   purpose is to explain how and why employees in a bank uses their
   perception to express IT User experience and consequently, satisfaction.
   The author surveyed bank employees (608 responses out of a population of
   3000 individuals. Hypothesis were tested using regression and factor
   analysis. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed through
   the lens of the Technology Acceptance Model, to explain impact of the
   main factors influencing perception of overall IT landscape, as well as
   prioritizing projects within their budgetary constraints.}},

   opening manifold new opportunities, while also bearing certain
   complication and risks. One has to face these challenges, consider them
   as chances and turn them into a positive. Also one has been to open to
   change conventional process patterns; ergo following the philosophy of
   Change Management. In addition the theme of sustainability has to be
   taken into account, about which everybody speaks and thinks to
   understand it; mostly, however, opinions, definitions, and conversion

Abstract = {{Medical science is in the current global healthcare sector where
   innovation based on information and communications technology produces
   major changes that have the effect of patient centeredness. Using Big
   Data solutions for the healthcare system as it is both an opportunity to
   improve the quality of medical performance and cost optimization. In
   this paper we aimed to analyse the impact of applying innovative
   technologies based on Big Data in diabetes management. The purpose of
   the study was to determine patients' perception on adoption of
   innovative technologies for the prevention, detection and treatment of
   diabetes as well as their involvement in establishing own treatment
   plans. The data we collected through a questionnaire, and we processed
   them with SPSS v.24. According to the results obtained, we found that
   patients are open to upgrading treatment and sharing of new treatments.
   Furthermore, the study demonstrates the need to shift from traditional
   medical system at in-health system - the premise of applying innovative
   technologies based on Big Data, cloud computing and smart mobile
   devices. Through integration and interoperability of such disparate
   information, the decision support system and knowledge management system
   will have a digital archive and mechanisms that will allow the addition
   of a new dimension in the treatment of the disease by prevention and
   personalized treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle manufacturers have developed advanced driver assistance systems
   (ADASs) to reduce driver workload and enhance safety. The delivery of
   these systems to consumers occurs through dealerships not owned by
   manufacturers. Limited research is available on how dealerships provide
   consumers with information and training on ADASs. In an exploratory
   study seeking information on new safety technologies, semi-structured
   blind interviews of salespeople at 18 Boston, Massachusetts, area
   dealerships were conducted in the context of potential vehicle purchase
   across six vehicle brands. Although some dealerships were making
   concerted efforts to introduce and educate customers on ADASs, a number
   of salespeople interviewed were not well positioned to provide adequate
   information to their customers. In select instances, salespeople
   explicitly provided inaccurate information on safety-critical systems.
   The dealerships in the sample that represented mass-market brands (Ford
   and Chevrolet) were the poorest performers. Sales staff at Subaru
   dealers were well trained and had print and digital content to drive
   consumer engagement. Educational staff, or ``geniuses,{''} at BMW
   dealers presented a potentially innovative way of segmenting the sales
   process from technology education. In the absence of some technology
   introduction and education at dealerships, consumers may remain
   under-informed or misinformed about the disruptive safety technologies
   that are rapidly being introduced across the vehicle fleet.}},

Abstract = {{The paper provides a critical analysis of the idea of technological
   unemployment. The overview of the existing literature on the employment
   effects of technological change shows that on the micro-level there
   exists strong and positive relationship between innovations and
   employment growth in firms; on the sectoral level this correlation
   becomes ambiguous; on the macro-level the impact of new technologies
   seems to be positive or neutral. This implies that fears of explosive
   growth of technological unemployment in the foreseeable future are
   exaggerated. Our analysis further suggests that new technologies affect
   mostly the structure of employment rather than its level. Additionally
   we argue that automation and digitalisation would change mostly task
   sets within particular occupations rather than distribution of workers
   by occupations.}},

   observe numerous innovations in the ways of publishing research
   outcomes. It is possible that digital media together with artificial
   intelligence are causing permanent changes in scientific communication
   and in the design of research and publications. In the humanities, this
   phenomenon has led to the production of academic video and
   ``born-digital{''} publications. How do these tendencies and initiatives
   fare in the environment of Central European universities? We have
   conducted an inquiry into this issue within the pilot research project
   Interfaces of Science, and the answers given by Slovak, Czech and Polish
   scientists and researchers indicate that they do not enjoy adequate
   conditions to develop zeal and openness.}},

Abstract = {{Common problems faced in optical comprehensive design experiment and
   going against the Washington Accord are pointed out. For resolving these
   problems, an instructional and innovative teaching scheme for Optics
   Comprehensive Design Experiment is proposed. We would like to understand
   the student that can improve the hands-on practical ability, theory
   knowledge understanding ability, complex problem solving ability,
   engineering application ability, cooperative ability after tracking and
   researching the student who have attended the class about Optical
   Comprehensive Design Experiment, We found that there are some problems
   on the course such as the experiment content vague, the student
   beginning less time, phase separation theory and engineering
   application, the experiment content lack of selectivity and so on. So we
   have made some improvements reference to the Washington Accord for the
   class teaching plan about Optical Comprehensive Design Experiment. This
   class must relevant to the engineering basic courses, professional
   foundation course and the major courses, so far as to the future study
   and work that which can play a role in inheriting and continuity to the
   students. The Optical Comprehensive Design Experiment teaching program
   requires students learning this course to have learnt basic courses like
   analog electronics technique, digital electronic technique, applied
   optics and computer and other related courses which students are
   required to comprehensively utilize. This teaching scheme contains six
   practical complex engineering problems which are respectively optical
   system design, light energy meter design, illuminometer design, material
   refractive index measuring system design, light intensity measuring
   system design and open design. Establishing the optional experiment and
   open experiment can provide students with a greater choice and enhance
   the students' creativity, vivid teaching experimental teachers and
   enriching contents of experiment can make the experiment more
   interesting, providing students with more opportunities to conduct
   experiment and improving students' practical ability with long learning
   time, putting emphasis on student's understanding of complex engineering
   problems and the cognitive of the process to solve complex engineering
   problems with actual engineering problems. Applying the scheme in other
   courses and improving accordingly will be able to ensure the quality of
   engineering education. Look forward to offering useful reference for the
   curriculum system construction in colleges and universities.}},

Abstract = {{Specialized courses play a significant role in the usage of basic
   knowledge in the practical application for engineering college students.
   The engineering data available has sharply increased since the beginning
   of the information age in the 20th century, providing much more
   approaches to study and practice. Therefore, how to guide students to
   make full use of resources for active engineering practice learning has
   become one of the key problems for specialized courses. This paper took
   the digital image processing course for opto-electronic information
   science and technology major as an example, discussed the teaching model
   of specialized course in the information age, put forward the
   ``engineering resource oriented model{''}, and fostered the ability of
   engineering students to use the basic knowledge to innovate and deal
   with specific project objectives. The fusion of engineering examples
   into practical training and teaching encourages students to practice
   independent engineering thinking.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional optics, the focusing should be done before the
   exposuring. However, a light field camera makes it a reality to take a
   photograph before the focusing. The principle of a light field camera
   consists of some fundamental theories on optical imaging, including
   pinhole imaging, depth of focus, digital refocusing, synthetic aperture
   imaging, etc. It is easier for students to understand the above theories
   through learning the theory and experiment of a light field camera.
   Meanwhile it also involves some optical knowledge for a light field
   camera during the acquisition and processing images. In the paper, we
   will discuss the similarities and differences on optical properties
   among the pinhole, the convex lens and the light field camera. Our
   intention is to make these optical theories much easier to understand
   for students in our teaching work.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, natural gas markets have witnessed several
   critical upheavals: increasing market volatility, greater geopolitical
   risks and penetration of disruptive technologies. In this fast evolving
   environment, uncertainty expands without any frontier along many
   dimensions simultaneously. Against this background of tidal changes, the
   identification and assessment of incoming economic opportunities and
   risks has become decisive. In this paper, we present an innovative
   method to overcome the challenge by leveraging an advanced digital: the
   abstract syntax tree. Our approach consists in the systemic assessment
   of an exhaustive continuum of physically possible outcomes to identify
   the underlying key risks and opportunities areas associated with natural
   gas trading activities, hence building a risk-opportunity topology along
   several dimensions for traders. We demonstrate that such
   risk-opportunity topologies enable their users to depart from a
   hope-for-the-best attitude towards the traditional low-medium-high
   scenarios and achieve a systemic understanding where the
   risk-opportunity continuum can be characterized into fragile, robust and
   anti-fragile areas.}},

   computer vision and deep learning techniques. With the recent
   development in mobile computing technology, many deep learning framework

   this work, we intend to employ such ICT strategies with the aim of
   supporting the tourism in an art city: for these reasons, we propose to
   provide tourists with a mobile application in order to better explore
   artistic heritage within an urban environment by using just their

Abstract = {{The profession of digital archivist is crystallising, fundamentally
   challenging traditional archival roles. The very nature of digital
   records also challenges the sustainability of archival systems and
   collections. Records that used to stay stable for decades in an analogue
   world now risk being lost or damaged within moments of creation. How
   should archivists react to these changes? Archivists have to lift
   ourselves out of our analogue environment and focus more effort on
   forging a new path, to reposition archives, archival institutions and
   archival practitioners more strategically for the future. To do this,
   archivists must resist the temptation to think that we and we alone - as
   people, as archivists or as today's archivists as opposed to yesterday's
   archivists - can come up with the ultimate solution to the world's
   recordkeeping problems. Archivists must keep innovating, absolutely. But
   we also need to be agile and flexible, remembering that anything we come
   up with today will be superseded at some point in the future -
   increasingly, in the very near future. Archivists need to forge links
   with archives, systems and people in order to come up with approaches to
   records and archives care that remain usable now and flexible well into
   the future.}},

   computer-aided content analysis; (2) a record of individual message
   posting and reading; and (3) longitudinal survey data. Further, this
   article discusses how the resulting data can be applied to online social
   network analysis and demonstrates how to construct two distinct types of
   online social networks-open and targeted communication networks-for
   different types of content embedded in social networks.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate measuring tool is required to measure the full-field
   displacement of the complex geometry of the human proximal femur when
   subjected to axial loads. Optical techniques, such as digital image
   correlation (DIC), have been used extensively in order to measure planar
   or volumetric displacement. Even though DIC methods are now in frequent
   use in experimental bone mechanics, this technique has only recently
   been reported to measure 3D proximal ex-vivo femur displacement fields
   during loading under axial loads. The innovation of this paper is to
   extend the use of the DIC technique to visualize and track the progress
   of failure of the proximal femur under limb stance configuration. An
   experimental protocol has been proposed and validated on eight human
   cadaveric femurs. The results indicated that failure takes place by
   shearing in the head-neck region. Furthermore, it was found that this
   method enables to extract additional information on the fracture profile
   and its initiation. The obtained information can facilitate the
   interpretation of the in vitro failure behavior of human femur under
   axial loading conditions which will serve the validation of hip models.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reviews traditional and computer-assisted road network layout
   approaches and brings them together in an overall stream of development.
   It results in the main finding that changes in the representation of the
   road network layout problem triggered major scientific advancements. A
   systematic, 2D transport geometry representation emerged in the 1870s
   and led to the mathematical derivation of optimal road spacing. The
   representation of road network and harvest layout problem as a
   mathematical graph and the solution of the corresponding linear
   programming problem, triggered a representational shift in the early
   1970s. The broad availability of digital elevation models DEMs at the
   beginning of the 1990s was another representational innovation, enabling
   an automatic road route layout on the terrain DEM surface. The most
   recent shift consisted of systems to semi-automatically, concurrently
   laying out harvest/transport-network problems on DEMs in the mid-1990s.
   The review identifies challenges for future research, among which the
   extension of the concurrent harvest/road-network layout systems for
   multi-objective functions is the first importance. Considering that
   scientific advancement is mostly going along with changes in problem
   representations, research should explore improved representations for
   lattice type terrain representation, among which triangular irregular
   network (TIN) meshes seem to be the first interest. Additional paths for
   improvements are the integration of road network planning with detailed
   road engineering, the refinement of optimization problems formulations,
   and the cross-national adaptation of road network planning courses to
   operations-research-based approaches.}},

Abstract = {{School assessment is still a hot topic in education, because the
   evaluation of students' competences is a process with a major social
   impact ( especially on the labour market). In the digitalized world,
   school evaluation must be rethought in a new way: to become an
   innovative, personalized and pragmatic assessment. This article is
   focused on the study of the assessment culture in the Romanian school
   teachers' and students' beliefs about school assessment, values and
   behaviours regarding school assessment. The theoretical premises of the
   research are to be found in the studies and theories of school
   assessment and in the model of the national culture - Hofstede.
   Are teachers prepared to implement a new culture of assessment? Can
   students, parents, managers and social community adopt a new mentality
   of school assessment? In this case, the key factor are the teachers who
   are the agents of change in behaviours, attitudes and values of school
   assessment, according to the new social and economic trends. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Digital games are employed with excellent results in teaching because
   they use to create strong connections between the student and the
   subject to be learned. On the side of the learner they benefit from
   interactivity, challenge, immersion and fair assessment of the results,
   while on the studied subject side they offer repeatability of the
   notions, fast adaptation to the domain changing, compliance with the
   student profile and risk free simulations for notions that require
   experimentation. The paper shows the importance of serious games in
   education with accent on the business area. It is presented a case study
   regarding the use in the academic curricula of the IBM INNOV8 serious
   games, developed by IBM as part of their Academic Initiative program.
   The study reports the results of master students playing the game and
   their opinion about its usefulness as training for business activities.
   There is investigated the perceived connection of the simulations to
   business process management aspects like process discovery and process
   modelling, problem recognition, problem solving, iterative process
   improvement, analytic and strategic thinking, decision making, real-time
   business management, proactive thinking, defining goals, team work and
   time management. The paper investigates the possible ties between the
   business process management encountered in games, the academic
   background of the students, as well as the profession and position in
   the company for the employed ones. (C) 2017 Published by Future Academy}},

Journal = {{INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{230-245}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe an innovative model
   of teacher professional learning that has evolved over a decade (2006 to
   2016).
   Design/methodology/approach - Working in a range of different school
   contexts, in conjunction with an ongoing engagement with the research
   literature, has enabled the development over three phases of a robust
   yet flexible framework that meets teachers' expressed needs. At the same
   time, the framework helps to shift teachers' pedagogical orientations,
   as the learning design supports school-focused, job-embedded teacher
   professional learning, which challenges more traditional instructional
   environments by infusing digital technologies and other elements of
   twenty-first century skills into teaching and learning.
   Findings - Building on the experiences of the first two phases, the
   paper reports the most recent phase which expands on the emergence of a
   fourth wave of online learning to design and develop a massive open
   online course (MOOC) that potentially enables the massive scaling up of
   access to this already validated model of teacher professional
   development. The importance of maintaining key elements, threshold
   concepts and signature pedagogies in the design of MOOCs for teacher
   professional learning are discussed, and the paper concludes with early
   lessons from this latest work in progress.
   Originality/value - Challenges are identified relating to the design of
   the social supports within the MOOC structure to sustain the
   collaboration, dialogue and ongoing reflection observed across Phases 1
   and 2 that are necessary for the changes in pedagogical orientation and
   classroom practices.}},

Abstract = {{Good practices in eGov are being increasingly used by Local Governments
   being that it is considered by them as an advantage. The main goal is
   providing to the town hall a differentiation point and approximate their
   services to the citizens. For this, it is necessary to define and apply
   innovative strategies in order to increase the use of services by the
   citizens. This paper is framed in a research work and it presents a
   first overview of the existing good practices in eGov, taking in
   consideration the Portuguese's reality. The good practices identified
   were distinguished with many awards and with a positive response from
   the target audience. The use of digital marketing strategies aims to
   increase their membership and coming closer the municipalities of its
   citizens through the dissemination of the good practices. At this moment
   the data collected are almost exclusively of good practice in Portugal,
   however some international practices were also identified. As a result
   of this study the community has a list of good practices that can be
   applied in their municipalities.}},

Title = {{Exploring research on quality and reliability management through text

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY \& RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore and describe research
   presented in the International Journal of Quality \& Reliability
   Management (IJQRM), thereby creating an increased understanding of how
   the areas of research have evolved through the years. An additional
   purpose is to show how text mining methodology can be used as a tool for
   exploration and description of research publications.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study applies text mining
   methodologies to explore and describe the digital library of IJQRM from
   1984 up to 2014. To structure and condense the data, k-means clustering
   and probabilistic topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation is
   applied. The data set consists of research paper abstracts.
   Findings - The results support the suggestion of the occurrence of
   trends, fads and fashion in research publications. Research on quality
   function deployment (QFD) and reliability management are noted to be on
   the downturn whereas research on Six Sigma with a focus on lean,
   innovation, performance and improvement on the rise. Furthermore, the
   study confirms IJQRM as a scientific journal with quality and
   reliability management as primary areas of coverage, accompanied by
   specific topics such as total quality management, service quality,
   process management, ISO, QFD and Six Sigma. The study also gives an
   insight into how text mining can be used as a way to efficiently explore
   and describe large quantities of research paper abstracts.
   Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on abstracts of
   research papers, thus topics and categories that could be identified via
   other journal publications, such as book reviews; general reviews;
   secondary articles; editorials; guest editorials; awards for excellence
   (notifications); introductions or summaries from conferences; notes from
   the publisher; and articles without an abstract, are excluded.
   Originality/value - There do not seem to be any prior text mining
   studies that apply cluster modeling and probabilistic topic modeling to
   research article abstracts in the IJQRM. This study therefore offers a
   unique perspective on the journal's content.}},

Abstract = {{Why do entrant firms sometimes gain the upper hand under conditions of
   discontinuous technological change? Previous research on this topic has
   either looked at the role of established competencies and/or firm
   incentives to invest in a new technology. In this paper we explore an
   alternative explanation. Drawing upon evidence from the ongoing
   transition from CCTV to digital, IP-based video surveillance, we argue
   that entrant firms may be more prone to act entrepreneurially, i.e.,
   more inclined to proactively create or transform markets and build
   ecosystems. As new technologies frequently require altered behaviour
   among customers and stakeholders, this capability is sometimes critical
   in order to succeed in a technological transition. Our contribution
   therefore lies in pointing out that not only may incentives to allocate
   R\&D resources differ among entrants and incumbents, firms might also
   have different incentives to engage in entrepreneurial activities of
   creating or transforming markets.}},

Journal = {{ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY-JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{As security vulnerabilities generated by the developments in information
   and communication technologies as well as emerging technologies can lead
   to severe loss in terms of individual and institutional aspects, the
   importance of information security has been increasing in recent years.
   Nowadays, digital information is considered as an important asset which
   must be appropriately evaluated and protected against all forms of
   unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, destruction, or
   denial. Since information security is more prominent and more important
   now than ever before, this growing awareness of digital information
   security has led societies to develop innovative ways of protecting
   their sensitive information. On the other hand, in today's digital
   world, keeping sensitive information secure is not as easy as it was in
   the past. In this regard, it is obvious that for all types of
   institutions there is a need for security software which provides the
   necessary security measures and policies for the protection and
   retrieval of sensitive digital information. To ensure information
   security, security software must have the ability to make logging of
   certain events. Through log files, some analysis can be performed to
   find out what kind of attacks were done by which users and when. In this
   respect, this study proposes a novel approach of recording traffic flow
   on the log files stored on a server to determine the changes made by
   unauthorized people/users on the log records, and this way ensures the
   security of the log records and contributes to digital forensics
   processes in terms of accuracy, integrity and confidentiality of the log
   records.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic timing uncertainties present in modern hardware platforms have
   motivated the use of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to timing analysis,
   however, the timing behaviour of a task may not entirely fulfil the
   necessary assumptions. To deal with this difficulty, randomisation at
   the hardware level has been proposed as a means of facilitating the use
   of statistical timing analysis. However, it has been shown that hardware
   randomisation does not solve all the analysis problems and importantly
   some projects may not wish to change the hardware that is used to
   support timing analysis. This paper presents an innovative approach,
   which does not require hardware randomisation or any special system
   feature, named Indirect Estimation in Statistical Time Analysis (IESTA).
   The main difference is that randomised hardware is performed before
   software instructions actually executes and is applied to parameters
   (e.g. cache state) only indirectly linked to timing. In contrast, IESTA
   adds its randomisation directly to the timing measures without affecting
   the way the software is executed. The IESTA approach is evaluated by
   experiments on two real case studies for which execution time
   measurements are taken from an embedded platform and from a Rolls-Royce
   Full Authority Digital Engine Controller.}},

Abstract = {{Elected officials and bureaucrats claim that Big Data is dramatically
   changing city hall by allowing more efficient and effective
   decision-making. This has sparked a rise in the number of ``Offices of
   Innovation{''} that collect, manage, use and share Big Data, in major
   cities throughout the U.S. This paper seeks to answer two questions.
   First, is Big Data changing how decisions are made in city hall? Second,
   is Big Data being used to address social equity and how? This study
   examines Offices of Innovation that use Big Data in five major American
   cities: New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and Louisville,
   focusing specifically on three dimensions of Big Data and social equity:
   data democratization, digital access and literacy, and promoting
   equitable outcomes. Furthermore, this study highlights innovative
   practices that address social problems in order to provide directions
   for future research and practice on the topic of Big Data and social
   equity.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the digital footprint project was to summarize, analyze and
   present the Zselic region's current web and social media identifiers and
   online representations. It also aimed to give recommendations for a more
   integrated digital identity. Based on the results, it shows that
   constructive and targeted messages and highlighted online platforms
   support the region's tourist activity, economy, and its cultural and
   natural values. Moreover, by creating more opportunities and workplaces,
   and by making companies join further networks, these factors also
   enhance the comfort of regional communities. This project was preceded
   by another study with a stronger theoretical emphasis.
   The study aims to answer two key questions. The first is: Can we find an
   integrated identification platform, data or representation set of the
   Zselic region? The second question is: Which interactive platforms and
   contents represent the digital identity of the Zselic region? Our
   research method was, on the one hand, focusing on keyword frequencies,
   search and hit rates and, on the other, content and representation
   analysis. The research process is repeatable. However, the constantly
   changing digital environment, the ongoing updated contents and data flow
   might produce different outputs.
   Our results, nonetheless, did not point out an integrated or common
   platform acting as the Zselic region's single digital identity. On the
   other hand, we could recognize and analyze subject networks and regional
   profiles via well-defined web nodes and hubs, crosslinked contents,
   cumulative search and hit data, social media pages and visual
   representations. Based on these, we can draw up an interpretative and
   decisive web-based subject network defined by independent sources and
   their bottom-up or top-down communication. Our recommendations emphasize
   the strengths of the online communication about the Zselic region. We
   suggest that regional players need to focus on the strongest online
   nodes with functional or content summaries and with existing cumulative
   search and hit histories. Moreover, in order to increase the comfort of
   regional communities, it is necessary to facilitate their activities on
   social media platforms. Finally, the introduction of further innovations
   and the involvement of the younger generation will also be unavoidable.}},

Title = {{Smart cities and their domains - Future challenges for urban
   researchers?}},
Journal = {{TER ES TARSADALOM}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{89-105}},
Abstract = {{During the last decade, smart cites become a fashionable subject of
   urban development conferences and urban policy forums. Both in the
   international scientific literature and public media, discourse about
   smart cities and their development became considerably popular. This
   multidisciplinary theme attracts researchers from three main
   disciplines. The first is telecommunication engaging with the
   technological infrastructure of smart cities (ICT engineers,
   programmers, architects). The second is ecology which deals with urban
   sustainability and viability issues (ecologists, environmentalist
   professionals). The third discipline is social sciences (sociologists,
   regional scientists, geographers, economists) investigating the social
   consequences of smart cities' development.
   The first part of this paper reviews the history and main
   characteristics of the smart city as a notion in the international
   literature. It highlights that the role of ICT development and the rise
   of postindustrial new middle class fundamentally affect trends of smart
   city visions. Afterwards, it presents those smart city domains which are
   highly relevant for development strategies. Among them are hard domains
   where ICT engineering, computing and big data are crucial, and soft
   domains where the role of social inclusion, participation and democracy
   is more important. This part of the study highlights those linkages
   between social sciences and smart city development which can act as
   research fields for regional and social researchers. Every smart city
   domain provide promising research themes where the solidity and raison
   d'etre of ``smart{''} ICT solutions can be tested by social scientists.
   Finally, the last part of the paper seeks to pinpoint those type of
   challenges which researchers of space and society need to face if they
   would like to study smart city development and counsel their innovation.
   It particularly highlights three issues: refocusing towards the
   ``smart{''} world, learning to handle ``big data{''} and building
   relationships with IT firms and programmers for a multidisciplinary
   teamwork. Because of the increasing role of the digital world and of the
   ubiquity of the internet in social life, trying to answer these
   challenges are and will be the essential issue for urban researchers in
   the 21st century.}},

Pages = {{363-384}},
Abstract = {{The image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, also known as Our Lady of
   Guadalupe, has been reproduced countless times since its supposed
   miraculous creation in 1531. In the early modern period, artists often
   established the accuracy of a copy through the use of templates, careful
   analysis and physical contact with the original image. In more recent
   decades, the use of digital images has offered potentially limitless
   reproduction of the original seemingly without a degradation in quality
   in subsequent digital copies. By situating the creation of digital
   copies within the broader framework of the historical reproduction of
   the Virgin of Guadalupe, this article will examine how digital
   reproductions have affected religious experience and how they are
   negotiated by the Catholic Church. A digital reproduction of the Virgin
   of Guadalupe known as the Peregrina will serve as a case study for
   understanding how specific digital images are legitimized through a
   careful balancing of tradition and innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Instrumentation containing classical pointer gauges will be increasingly
   replaced by digital, freely programmable clusters. Trends set by
   consumer products like tablets and smartphones, as well as requirements
   for ``Safety, Economy and Networking{''} will drive the automotive
   commercial vehicle market in future. The driver expects a clearly
   understandable representation of information in real time, and no
   information overload. Continental provides solutions leading to a fast
   and high-quality implementation of a graphical user interface: a design
   idea, a first draft which leads to an implementation into the commercial
   vehicle.
   Interaction between instrumentation and driver, including seamless
   adjustment with further displaying units for telematics, mirror
   replacement, infotainment and camera systems is of importance. A
   holistic and fully integrated Human Machine Interface is the key to next
   generation instrumentation. Advanced driver assistance functions,
   combined with object detection and driver monitoring systems are further
   modules towards a Human Machine Interface for highly automated driving.
   The new technical solutions are demonstrated in the Continental
   Innovation Truck. Customers and drivers can experience the Freely
   Programmable Cluster FPC, mirror replacement by digital cameras, turn
   assist, surround view and driver monitoring systems and other
   innovations installed.}},

Abstract = {{Today's telematics systems have evolved into intelligent fleet
   management solutions. Innovative developments that deliver comprehensive
   information to all stakeholders of the supply chain about the trucks,
   trailers, drivers and cargo, in one single platform. Numerous truck and
   trailer mounted sensors generate data, which is sent to the back office
   in real time. At the moment, both familiar as well as new telematics
   players are working at an unprecedentedly fast pace towards further
   connecting vehicle mounted, intelligent safety and efficiency systems
   while ambitiously looking at ways to aggregate other types of
   information, specifically related to ``vehicle-to-vehicle{''} and
   ``vehicle-to-infrastructure{''} communication. Only by making
   intelligent use of new, digital technologies can fleet management be
   lifted to a higher level. But while collecting fleet information may not
   be new, harnessing these ``big data{''} at today's expanding volumes,
   analyzing them intelligently and translating them into insights with
   real practical use for fleet operators is the next big challenge.
   Finally, the growing presence of the Internet of Things provides great
   potential in the future, one of which involves autonomous driving.}},

   case study}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL LIBRARY PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{339-360}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this case study is to demonstrate a current
   model, as well as explore future models, for integrating institutional
   repositories (IRs) in higher education goals at the University of
   Toledo.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study that uses literature
   review as an exploratory framework for new approaches while reflecting
   on existing literature to present the current practical framework for
   using IRs.
   Findings - The digital environment has pushed academic institutions
   toward new strategies for curating their record on scholarship and
   preserving their heritage collections, using their IRs. Innovative
   approaches are also vital to curating the IR content digitally to
   facilitate access to those contents in ways that was not possible a few
   decades ago. Surveys and existing literature point to increasing uses of
   IRs despite abstinence from considering open access for scholarly
   activity among faculty concerned about copyright, plagiarism and
   sustainability. Staffing and funding IR initiatives are important
   factors in sustaining the curation of scholarship in the digital
   environment.
   Practical implications - IRs with open access publishing, expert gallery
   and digital library features place academic libraries in a central role
   as partners in digital scholarship.
   Originality/value - This case study presents an original approach to
   incorporating the IR into the curation of digital content while also
   considering potential uses of knowledge management approaches for data
   and knowledge sharing in an academic environment.}},

Abstract = {{The Industry 4.0 is the industrial revolution based on
   Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS) in the context of Factory of Future. The
   digital innovation is not an exclusivity of new and advanced technology
   and production processes. The traditional production processes and
   plants are evolving following this digitalization combining the long
   experience and the new fast methods to improve the production
   efficiency, to accelerate the fine-tuning and real-time adjustment of
   the process parameters oriented to the zero defect quality.
   Manufacturing current trends show an improvement in demand for light
   products considering the material substitution for complex structural
   parts, the design and technology innovation as well as the evolution in
   smart production. Due to the high number of process variables involved
   and to the non-synchronisation of all process parameters in a unique and
   integrated process control unit, High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) is one
   of the most ``defect generating{''} and ``energy-consumption{''}
   processes in EU industry showing less flexibility to any changes in
   products and in process evolution. In both, sustainability issue imposes
   that machines/systems are able to efficiently and ecologically support
   the production with higher quality, faster delivery times, and shorter
   times between successive generations of products.
   The FP7-MUSIC project (funded in the frame of the Call FoF-ICT-2011.7.1
   Smart Factories: Energy-aware, agile manufacturing and Customization) is
   giving a new age to the traditional multi-stages production processes
   such as High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC). The use of sensors, the
   totally integrated systems, as well as the data mining and cognitive
   model are the key ingredient of the MUSIC project to be a reference in
   the Industry 4.0 context.}},

Abstract = {{The results presented in the article are the first Polish analysis of
   startups, which are considered as a source of innovation and which are
   gaining in importance in the country's economy. In order for the country
   to efficiently support this group, more insight into the most important
   features characterising it, for instance location, used legal forms,
   employment and its forms, sources of financing and other resources,
   propensity to export or sources of innovation must be gained. Thus, the
   conducted study was aimed at identifying and characterising the
   population of economic entities considered as Polish startups according
   to applied criteria. In order to do so, a database of those entities was
   created, an original research questionnaire was prepared and a
   nationwide survey was conducted in collaboration with the Startup Poland
   foundation. Subsequently, a segmentation analysis was performed in order
   to isolate conspicuous classification groups and to identify important
   features in each group. The presented research results constitute the
   beginning of regular analyses in that scope.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the creation of a Transdisciplinary Design Studio
   ((TDS)-S-2) for Collaborative Research and Education (CORE) in the
   Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas Tech University and a
   study of this pedagogy for undergraduate engineering students. More
   specifically, this paper highlights a project-based TD design class
   which encouraged small student research groups to take on new behaviors
   of work-collaboration and teamwork-to solve complex problems. To create
   engagement in the class, an active learning and design-based research
   pedagogy was incorporated. Three main components (digital learning,
   creativity tools \& techniques, and domain experts) of the TD design
   studio were examined for their contribution to student learning. We
   highlight the overlooked role of transdisciplinary design training in
   the undergraduate research experience and make specific reference to the
   impact of these pedagogical techniques on the learning outcomes for both
   Caucasian and under-represented minorities. Students' collaboration and
   creativity skills (TD skills) were tested and the results are presented.
   The ultimate goal of the TDclass is to promote the creative, innovative,
   and divergent thinking of students.
   This research study validated that TD-methods support the learning of
   underrepresented groups: transdisciplinary practice showed positive
   impact on underrepresented minority students' learning.}},

   digital economy}},
Journal = {{KYBERNETES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1425-1451}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to explore the digital economy in the fields
   of the most promising new technologies: information and communication
   technologies, biotechnology and nanotechnology. It highlights the
   convergence of nano-, bio-, info- and cognitive (NBIC) technologies by
   developing a model for the accurate evaluation of different types of
   options in the development process of convergent technologies.
   Design/methodology/approach - The empirical research is based on
   theoretical analysis and case studies. The authors conducted six
   in-depth interviews. The study covered different research projects led
   by centres of excellence, competence centres and institutions that
   support the transfer of innovations in the economic and business
   environment.
   Findings - The research findings prove that there is a convergence of
   NBIC technologies that can be observed and modelled. The created
   evolutionary model of NBIC convergence, also based on the theory of real
   options, allows a proper evaluation of the entire convergence process.
   Practical implications - For enterprises and scientific research
   institutions, the NBIC model could represent the starting point for
   developing further concepts of investment evaluation. The model also
   considers the indicators of the innovation system, which, in addition to
   the marketing area, include regulatory challenges of companies (
   competition, copyrights, patents, taxation, etc.).
   Originality/value - This paper enhances the understanding of new
   technologies in a digital economy. The purpose of this study is to
   clarify the principal factors for the effective observation and
   measurement of the convergence phenomenon. It also offers suggestions
   for improvement of the research and innovation system in the new
   economy.}},

Abstract = {{One effective way to teach arithmetic more interestingly and make it
   easier to learn is through the use of instructional materials. These can
   help students master certain mathematical skills, particularly
   multiplication and division, often considered difficult amongst primary
   school pupils. Nevertheless, the insufficiency of appropriate
   instructional materials causes difficulty in understanding how to use
   the proper technique or apply the concept, especially in multiplication.
   With this in mind, this study investigated whether the innovative and
   creative instructional material designed to assist and enhance numeracy
   skills, namely the Multi-vide Ruler kit, could increase students'
   ability in solving multiplication and division questions and whether it
   affected their interest in solving numeracy problems. Participants in
   this study included ten PROTIM (Program Tiga M {[}Three M Program] -
   membaca {[}reading], menulis {[}writing] dan mengira {[}calculate])
   students, 9-10 years old, who had difficulties in reading, writing and
   arithmetic. In order to get appropriate support for qualitative
   research, a pre and post-test containing ten basic mathematical
   operations, was implemented together with the Multi-vide Ruler Kit. The
   findings of the qualitative case study, with the pre and post-tests,
   showed significant differences in their achievement and interest in
   two-digit multiplication and division operations. The results suggest
   that this approach could improve PROTIM student's ability to solve basic
   mathematical operations. What was most encouraging was the increase in
   students' interest in solving numeracy problems.}},

   broad input about the potential impacts of digitalization in the three
   focus areas. As a result of small-group brainstorming about how each
   area of digitalization could inform, enable, or disrupt a specific
   aspect of research and technology management, the research teams
   identified a number of possible effects of digitalization, including
   increased consumer and customer intimacy, greater speed to market,
   broader use of open innovation, leveling of the information playing

Abstract = {{OVERVIEW:Virtual experimentation and simulationthe use of mathematical
   models and computer-based simulations to replicate the behavior and
   performance of physical systems and traditional experimentshas been
   steadily growing over the past two decades, driven by continual
   developments in technology and techniques. Virtual experimentation and
   simulation can enable companies to innovate more effectively and
   efficiently and build competitive advantage. However, the development
   and implementation of virtual capabilities is not simple and not without
   pitfalls; some companies have struggled to fully leverage these
   technologies. What is currently missing from the knowledge landscape is
   a common measure of where an organization stands with regard to its
   virtual capabilities and of what parameters drive effective use of
   virtual experimentation and simulation. To fill this gap, we offer a
   preliminary maturity matrix, a framework that can be used to judge an
   organization's maturity and effectiveness in developing and deploying
   virtual experimentation and simulation capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{OVERVIEW: This study explores the concept of big data and whether, and
   to what extent, it might affect R\&D management in the future. Through
   extensive discussions to dissect the nature of big data and to achieve a
   common understanding of what it represents, a research framework was
   constructed to analyze the impact of big data based on its potential to
   inform, enable, and transform or disrupt R\&D management across four
   dimensions: strategy, people, technology, and process integration. A
   literature review, interviews with experts, and case studies of
   organizations using big data demonstrate that this phenomenon will have
   significant implications for R\&D and innovation management, although
   the nature and extent of that impact is somewhat uneven among different
   industry sectors.}},

Abstract = {{Relevance: This research becomes relevant because global information
   modifications dramatically change current socio-economic relations
   marked by doctrines of world economy at each stage of social progress.
   Purpose: This paper addresses some of the modifications that have gained
   greatest recognition in recent decades and are most closely associated
   with innovation developments in society.
   Methods: The method of historical economic progression and a synthesis
   of methodological approaches have identified underlying patterns in
   society's global innovation-based economic growth.
   Findings: The research has found that the theory of innovation society
   can and must be considered as an integral part of the post-industrial
   theory. It has proved, however, that `new economy' is the hallmark of
   society at its current stage. It offers an essentially new approach to
   the mechanisms and a rate of information-based dissemination of
   innovations. Four factors have been determined to serve as background
   for the transition to a new economy (knowledge economy), such as market
   liberalization, an increase in capital mobility, market globalization,
   the emergence of the digital environment as a common communication
   network. In estimating the effect of global innovation modifications, it
   has been identified that industrialized countries enjoy greatest
   benefits from contributing to the global reach of innovations in
   information economy, which enables them to reduce costs of production
   and focus on the output of most profitable high technology products, and
   outsource labor- and pollutionintensive industries to developing
   countries. The industrialized world, however, could also be affected by
   integrated global innovation processes which, unless controlled, would
   increase unemployment and make financial markets more volatile. This is
   what has been happening at present in the acute migration and critical
   financial processes.
   Practical significance. The paper concludes that in order to conduct an
   effective economic policy, any government should thoroughly consider
   major factors of global innovation modifications, such as production,
   science and technology, business, economic, information, politics,
   society and culture.}},

   different logistics service functions. The definition of the term
   logistics centre differs between countries and implies different
   functionalities. Locations are often selected randomly and business
   models are opportunity driven, especially in highly dynamic and less
   regulated new emerging economies. In particular Freight Villages as a
   special form of logistics centres have a high impact on regional
   development and serve as cargo generator for freight corridors.
   Consideration of general principles how to establish Freight Villages
   could improve the effectiveness of these logistics centres along freight
   corridors.
   Methods: Based on a literature review a comprehensive and hierarchical
   definition of logistics centres will be discussed and applied. From
   experiences in the development of logistics centres in several
   countries, especially in Germany and Lithuania, challenges and concepts
   concerning regulatory framework, determination of location and business
   and financing models are discussed.
   Results: Concerning the definition of logistics centres a hierarchical
   definition is applied which comprises different levels of logistics
   centres depending on the scope of the value adding and the
   functionality. As general principles for the development of Freight
   Villages the active role of the state, master planning, objective
   location finding, participation and co-operation of different
   stakeholders in the business model and a stepwise scheme for financing
   are introduced. Major trends for the future development of Freight
   Villages are the digitalization of supply chains, the application of new
   intermodal technologies and of innovative telematics systems, solutions
   for low emission and electro mobility, especially in connection with
   city logistics, and the collaboration of Freight Villages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper dwells upon transmedia storytelling as a cutting-edge
   tourist-oriented approach to promote a territory in a smart perspective
   with a focus on the power of a hashtag campaign within a pilot Instagram
   tour occurred in 2015. Starting from the belief that involvement,
   participation and sharing are useful key to most industries and sectors,
   and especially to tourism, we study in-depth Salentoupndown case, as a
   successful example of 2.0 initiative in terms of creating new models for
   public engagement, visitor meaning-making (i.e. travel generated
   content) through the application of the ``legal informatics by design
   and by default{''} logic, on the assumption that no digital solution
   today can be conceived without assessing it as by law enacted. Data
   collection and analysis show how Salentoupndown becomes, in terms of
   reach, exposure and engagement through the social media channels, a
   viral tourism web-based event. By integrating the conceptual discussion
   on the adoption of technology-based innovations in the tourism sector
   with a 2.0 tourist-oriented empirical experience, the study provides
   useful insights on the practical implementation of future location-based
   transmedia storytelling projects.}},

Abstract = {{Digital humanities and smart economy strategies are being seen as an
   important link between tourism and cultural heritage, as they may
   contribute to differentiate the audiences and to provide different
   approaches. Carnide is a peripheral neighbourhood of Lisbon with an
   elderly population, visible traces of rurality, and strong cultural and
   religious traditions. The academic project e-Carnide concerns its
   tangible and intangible cultural heritage and the data dissemination
   through a website and a mobile app, with textual and visual information.
   The project aims to analyse the impact of technological solutions on
   cultural tourism development in a sub-region, involving
   interdisciplinary research in heritage, history of art, ethnography,
   design communication and software engineering and the collaboration
   between the university and local residents in a dynamic and innovative
   way. Framed by a theoretical approach about the role of smart economy
   for the cultural tourism development in peripheral areas, this paper
   focuses on a case study, dealing with documents, interviews and
   observations, in order to understand how the e-Carnide project evolves.
   The study comprises an analysis about the strengths, weaknesses,
   opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis) of the project in view to
   realize its social and cultural implications and to appreciate how it
   can be applied in other similar and enlarged projects. Results of the
   research indicates that the new technological strategies can promote the
   involvement of the population in the knowledge of its own heritage as a
   factor of cultural and creative tourism development centred on an
   authentic and immersive experience of the places.}},

Abstract = {{This paper debates the information and tourism promotion of rural
   tourism, particularly the Country Homes in Madeira Island, focusing on
   the link between information and tourism promotion and the profile of
   this visitor. Through the interconnection of the visitor profile, in the
   context of demand and travel arrangements, and the current tourist
   promotion of Madeira's Country Homes, it was our intention to
   demonstrate the fragility and the crucial relevance of innovation in the
   sphere of information and tourism promotion of the rural tourism in the
   digital tourist era. In the absence of studies of this nature on the
   island of Madeira, we used the combination of qualitative and
   quantitative methods, in order to pursuit our goals. Those methods
   consisted in launching questionnaire surveys, semi-structured
   interviews, field work and bibliographical and documentary research.
   This research allowed us to conclude that the rural tourism should focus
   heavily on innovation, improving information and tourist promotion
   through the use of new information and communication technologies and
   networking, in order to contribute to its sustainable development.}},

Abstract = {{Design is a human activity that encompasses a broad array of tasks. In
   engineering design, individual efforts can be aggregated into teams to
   maximize collective progress. Effective teamwork, however, requires
   extensive management, organization and communication. Furthermore,
   modern challenges encompass complicated multi-disciplinary problems with
   faster schedules, fewer resources, and greater demands. Design, as a
   process, can be dissected into characteristic phases. Within each phase,
   design solutions are gradually developed. Technological tools have
   prioritized the structured analyses of the detailed and final design
   phases and have proven to be powerful multipliers for effective design
   efforts. It has long been the case, however, that major commitments of
   intangible resources are made as a result of efforts in the less
   emphasized earlier phases. These commitments and lack of modern toolsets
   for requirement development and conceptual design activities materialize
   as major sources of design pitfalls, both in industry and on student
   design projects. This paper presents a digital Ecosystem for Engineering
   Design Learning as a comprehensive, yet flexible, framework for capstone
   design teams. The digital Ecosystem has been developed as a feasible
   technology to bolster student information management, teamwork,
   communication, and proficiency in fundamental design principles, and as
   a technology capable of alleviating rework and process-related
   productivity interruptions. Its primary innovation, for capstone
   applications, is the ability to assess design work automatically against
   the design process, as well as against ABET compliant learning
   objectives, and provide prompt advisories in case of design oversights.
   The digital Ecosystem is compared to tools for project management, team
   communication, and requirement management.}},

Abstract = {{Participatory approaches to genomic research manifest along a continuum
   from bottom-up citizen-science initiatives designed to liberate
   scientific inquiry from the constraints of traditional research
   institutional contexts and professional practices to top-down
   investigator-initiated studies designed to expose the public to
   scientific research processes and build its support and enthusiasm for
   genomic research. With foundations as varied as open science,
   crowdsourcing, patient advocacy, social media, the digitization of
   health, and the neoliberalization of academic research, a range of
   ethical frameworks inform the modes of participatory genomic research.
   Using illustrations from citizen genomic science, patient advocacy, and
   investigator-led and government-initiated genomic research efforts, we
   argue that as participatory genomic research pushes the conventional
   research boundaries toward a more democratizing ethos, it challenges
   scientific practices and the ethical conduct of genomic research both
   within and outside of the traditional sites of biomedical innovation.}},

Abstract = {{The knowledge related to the progress in the technological development,
   expressed as the number of patents registered by residents and
   non-residents, is of vital interest on the part of researchers,
   technology centers and government institutions. With this, it is
   possible to establish strategies routed to the increase of technology
   management and the invention with a view to minimize the gaps between
   developing countries and those highly innovative. This investigation is
   an analysis of the number of patents registered by the different
   continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin (Latin America and the
   Caribbean, North America), Oceania, for the decades of the 80, 90 and
   the first of 2000. On the basis of the information disclosed by the
   World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO in relation to information
   technologies such as: technology computing, digital communication,
   telecommunications and audiovisual media. Noting that the analysis was
   performed for residents and nonresidents. Used multivariate analysis of
   variance MANOVA with contrast canonical orthogonal type, using the
   general linear model GLM, with transformation of data based on the
   family BOX-COX. Highly significant difference was found between the
   Asian continent, with regard to the other geographical areas evaluated,
   in the number of patents registered for the variables mentioned above (p
   < 0.0001). The main conclusion is that there is a large gap between
   Asia, North America and Europe with regard to Africa, Oceania and Latin
   America, in the number of patented inventions in this area of knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to compare two digital international
   institutional repositories to find convergences and divergences in
   regards to the administration and operation of data, information and
   content. Also, it contributes to broaden the panorama and knowledge
   related to the importance and impact of digital repositories in Higher
   Education Institutions (Instituciones de Educacion Superior - IES). The
   repositories studied belong to the Dissemination Service of Intellectual
   Creation (Difusion de la Creacion Intelectual - SEDICI), main
   institutional repository of La Plata National University (UNLP),
   Argentina and Kerwa, main institutional repository of the University of
   Costa Rica (UCR), Costa Rica. A methodological quantitative focus was
   developed to accomplish the investigation objective. The information was
   collected through questionnaires applied to the people responsible of
   the administration of both repositories and a bibliographical revision
   of electronic documents, such as articles published in congresses,
   international magazines, among others. The analysis was implemented
   following these criteria and characteristics: resources representation,
   interoperability, normalization, visibility, preservation, among others.
   It was concluded that digital institutional repositories have become an
   innovation trend for IES. They use and promote technological tools to
   produce significant changes in regards to information use and
   management. Also, the digital repositories analyzed converge in aspects
   such as: software, metadata, normalized numbers, resources
   representation, accessibility, identifier, author rights, contents
   deposit, searchers and preservation. They diverge in regards to:
   interoperability, digitalization process, remote deposit, visibility,
   licensing and divulgation.}},

Abstract = {{Heritage institutions house cultural and research content, which is the
   key source to stimulate soft innovation. Despite the potential, heritage
   collections are mostly inaccessible via digital mediums. We analyse the
   macro, meso and micro conditions of heritage organizations across Europe
   to identify the key determinants that foster soft innovation as
   reflected by the share of collection digitization and online
   publication. We find that organizations respond positively to an
   environment of high consumer digital literacy and sustainable resource
   allocation that enables slack, skilled staff and long-term strategic
   planning. Innovation is thus, in fact, enhanced by digital literacy from
   both producers and consumers.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates a Korean English as a foreign language (EFL)
   student teacher education programme which is intended to develop
   prospective teachers' digital literacy and to help them understand
   innovative pedagogy of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in
   Korean EFL context. This paper presents ideas of effective curriculum
   development for a CALL-integrated EFL student teacher training programme
   while helping student teachers make effective and creative use of
   digital technologies both in their own language learning and in their
   future language teaching. Local voice and insight of implementing CALL
   into Korean EFL educational context was provided as well as global
   perspectives in CALL. The results revealed that the use of CALL could
   promote Korean EFL student teachers' confidence in developing
   technological skills and pedagogical expertise. This study may have
   implications that this CALL-integrated EFL student teacher training
   course can pinpoint and fill the existing gap between the current and
   upcoming educational situation regarding the use of CALL in Korean EFL
   context and help student teachers consider themselves as confident and
   competent users of CALL for the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores a fundamental principle of digitizing traditional
   cultural designs to introduce a model to develop a digital design tool
   with three strategies (and five possible scenarios) for expanding
   traditional designs. The study structures pattern designs by analysing
   certain rules of traditional Korean bojagi textile designs and
   converting them into explicit rules in computational design. A bojagi
   design tool (implementing eight different schemes and allowing choice of
   colours and textures) was developed by the authors to show the
   advantages of using a computational design that combines traditional
   principles with today's modern digital technology. The tool was then
   examined by four groups (designers, merchandisers, traditional bojagi
   craft practitioners, and random customers) in Korea. The findings
   resulting from the interviews suggested that the tool can generate most
   of original bojagi designs that will be suitable for current fashion and
   interior markets and even extend it as a marketing and educational tool.}},

Abstract = {{Humanities researchers have been looking for new tools and strategies to
   overcome what has been called, in recent years, a crisis in the
   humanities. These efforts maintain that it is possible to change the
   widespread view that humanities fields are arcane or irrelevant by
   changing conceptual frames in ways that show the humanities to be
   useful, accessible and actionable. Specifically, researchers have been
   claiming for the humanities frames and concepts from the sciences, such
   as the humanities labs that signal (in both name and design)
   quantifiability, verifiability and functionality. This tactic of
   borrowing categories from the sciences is part of a larger tactical turn
   that we may call the scientification of the humanities. The new field of
   the digital humanities, in particular, is a central site for this turn.
   With a focus on digital humanities practices, this article aims to
   describe the tactical meanings, in the humanities, of the borrowed
   concepts data, collaboration and laboratory, all of which strategically
   frame the humanities as a practical, innovative and profitable field.
   Ultimately, I show that the trajectory of scientification in the
   humanities follows a path from concepts to transformation.}},

Abstract = {{Digital fabrication and 3D Making' are prominent recent additions to
   school curricula, hastened by the increased affordability of Computer
   Assisted Design software and devices such as 3D printers. It is
   increasingly argued that classroom use of these technologies can
   re-orientate schools towards forms of skills and knowledge appropriate
   for contemporary industry, STEM education and Maker culture'. Amidst
   such rhetoric, questions are raised about how these technologies are
   being used in schools, and the extent to which this represents new'
   and/or innovative' forms of education. This paper presents an
   ethnographic investigation of a 3D printing course enacted in an
   Australian high school. These curricular activities are considered from
   three different perspectives: (i) the artefacts and devices involved in
   the project; (ii) the surrounding social and educational contexts; and
   (iii) the activities and practices implicit in the implementation of the
   project. These different levels of analysis highlight the complexities
   of technology-based schooling - not least the ways in which possible
   technical and/or pedagogical innovations' associated with 3D printing
   are shaped by the situational constraints of school contexts. The paper
   concludes by considering the likely future(s) of 3D printing and other
   forms of digital fabrication within the institutional confines of
   school.}},

Abstract = {{Art has been developed and diversified with the technological
   innovations throughout the centuries. The computers and digitalization
   that develops due to the electronic technology are changing the culture
   structure of the societies. The relationship between human and machine
   is getting closer and technology becomes indispensable. New technologies
   has created a new field of experience for art. The link between the
   digital universe and human beings is shaped globally by industrial,
   economic and ideological trends. The digital structure, which overturns
   the concepts of time and space, transforms life. Electronic art and
   computer art, which have been seen since the middle of the 20th century,
   are evaluated with similar approaches to the criticisms of photography
   in the past. Visualization, visual aesthetics and visual perception will
   be important in the new world to be established with Industry4.0, which
   is expected to create a great transformation in the 21st century. This
   is a big change and an opportunity for art. In this paper, computer art
   based on basic electronic and computer systems, the directors of this
   field and the processes of digital art formations are examined through
   the first examples.}},

Pages = {{13-18}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Interdisciplinary perspectives and collaboration in technology
   research are regarded as vital for producing effective and usable
   solutions that meet real needs. The purpose of this paper is to draw
   upon the fifth seminar in an Economic and Social Research Council funded
   series in the UK on ``Innovative Technologies for Autism{''}. This
   seminar focused on the contributions that different disciplines can make
   to the field of autism and technology, and offers some interesting
   avenues for future research.
   Design/methodology/approach - A synthesis of key messages from the
   speakers' talks is presented, interspersed with comments and
   observations from delegates which were written on post-it notes during
   the day and shared amongst the group.
   Findings - Interdisciplinarity can be conceptualised in many different
   ways and is not simply about academic contributions. Collaborative
   research involving genuine stakeholder participation can provide fertile
   grounds for respecting and exploring individual differences and needs.
   Investigating the uses of existing technologies as well as developing
   innovative ideas and prototypes through inclusive design are important
   avenues for future research.
   Originality/value - This paper offers a rare glimpse into a range of
   perspectives within a broad field of research and draws out some
   important connections between these different viewpoints. There are
   valuable avenues for collaboration and further exploration that would
   extend research in productive ways.}},

Abstract = {{Pervasive and networked use of digital technologies has disrupted
   business strategies, industry structure and emergence of newer
   organizational forms with firms increasingly competing as software based
   ecosystems increasingly driven by convergence, changing materiality
   relationship between form and function of products and inter firm
   relationships.
   Decomposition of digital ecosystems into core and complementary module
   can potentially enable combinatorial innovation and asymmetric business
   models of platform providers and complementors. The layered modular
   architecture of digital artifacts, modularity and generativity of the
   ecosystem architecture help the evolutionary changes to the ecosystem
   through voluntaristic innovation by heterogeneous contributors which is
   a critical driver of ecosystem success.
   In this study using multi-theoretic lens of resource based view,
   platform architecture, strategic logic of opportunity and strategy as
   practice we develop a nomological network to explore the impact of
   platform architecture on complementor firm performance and posit a
   mediating role of firm's dynamic capabilities enabling competitive
   action.}},

Abstract = {{The Fifth Generation communication technology is considered to be the
   most advanced and technically innovative entry in the progression of
   wireless communication. Starting from the preliminary phase of
   evolution, when hardwired telephones were replaced by mobile systems,
   till the cutting-edge where the all-IP standards have substituted the
   broadband and digital technologies, the communication world has observed
   a significant development. In this paper, we are discussing the vision
   of 5G and its future scope in Indian market. The introduction discusses
   the prospects of the fifth generation. It gives a glimpse of the key
   features of the earlier generations (1G-4G)and the driving forces for
   5G. Further, the architecture section discusses the implementing
   technologies like Massive MIMO and Spatial Modulation that are capable
   of resolving the general issues encountered by the earlier generations.
   The third and last part focusses on the visions of 5G and its scope in
   Indian telecom market.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to describe two themes of information and
   knowledge management in building corporate memory through curation in
   complex systems. The first theme describes the skillsets of new memory
   curators: curation: appraisal; strategist and manager. The second theme
   describes four concepts that support information management in complex
   systems: David Snowden's just-in-time process; Polanyis personal
   knowing; Wenger's transactive memory system; and David Snowden's ASHEN
   database schema.
   Design/methodology/approach - Academic journals and professional
   publications were analysed for educational requirements for information
   professionals in complex adaptive systems.
   Findings - The skills described should be readily applied and useful in
   a complex adaptive system with the four concepts described. The four
   concepts displayed features indicating each separate concept could be
   aligned and integrated with the other concepts to create an information
   sharing model based on synergy between reasoning and computing.
   Research limitations/implications - Research is needed into the
   capability and potential of folksonomies using recordkeeping metadata
   and archival appraisal to support peer production information and
   communication systems.
   Originality/value - The author has not found any research that links
   archival appraisal, user-generated metadata tagging, folksonomies and
   transactive memory systems governance policy to support digital online,
   co-innovation peer production.}},

Abstract = {{Defense Media Activity (DMA) is the Department of Defense's (DoD) direct
   line of communication for news and information to U.S. military forces
   worldwide. The agency informs DoD audiences, entertains DoD audience
   overseas, trains Public Affairs and Visual Information professionals,
   and manages the DoD's visual information or audiovisual records.
   The central audiovisual archive of the Department of Defense (DoD) holds
   imagery - still and motion media dating to the 1890s, with millions of
   images ranging from World War I to current operations in the Middle
   East. The Defense Imagery Management Operations Center (DIMOC) of the
   Defense Media Activity centrally collects, processes, disseminates and
   archives these audiovisual records documenting the many activities of
   the Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. military around the globe. In
   an effort to make the entire DoD collection publicly available online,
   and as a cascading effect of the DMA digitization and storage contract
   initiated in 2013, DIMOC has developed and implemented a process to
   address a large portion of the collection that has not been reviewed for
   public release.
   This paper is a follow-on to the 2016 IS\&T: Archiving Conference paper
   titled ``Unlocking the Archive: The Defense Department's Plan to Make
   Unreleased Audiovisual Records Public,{''} which explored the historical
   context for the mixed DoD collection and the innovative solutions
   implemented by DIMOC to overcome barriers to clearing this content for
   public access. Specifically, this paper will focus on the implementation
   and standard operating procedures (SOPs) and processes implemented into
   DIMOC's workflow. The paper will also discuss the DoD's risk assessment
   for each review area: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Operational
   Security (OPSEC), Sensitive Subject (SS) and Public Affairs Guidance
   (PAG), and a Presidential Executive Order (EO) that established a
   mandatory 25-year review for declassification. Tied closely to DIMOC's
   contracted asset management system, the use of (metadata) automation and
   workflow process reengineering are results of the imagery collection's
   analysis conducted for this new public release responsibility.}},

Abstract = {{The quadrennial International Conference on Equine Exercise Physiology
   (ICEEP) allows focused presentations of a variety of horse exercise-and
   performance-related research data in cardiorespiratory, muscle,
   biomechanics, nutrition, genomics, and applied physiology. The most
   diverse section of the ICEEP meeting has been termed variously `Applied
   Exercise Physiology' (ICEEP 8 and 9), `Applied Physiology: Training
   Methods, Exercise Testing and Selection' (ICEEP 7), or `Applied
   Physiology of Athletic Performance' (ICEEP 6 and earlier). The next
   ICEEP meeting is scheduled to be held in Australia in 2018. In this
   subspeciality of equine exercise physiology, scientists attempt to apply
   or put into practical field use the techniques and tools developed in
   the more basic sciences in order to assess the performance, training,
   and injury of horses working and performing under true, non-laboratory
   conditions. The real test of the value of this subspeciality will be the
   increased application and sustainability of the use of laboratory
   techniques in the assessment of equine athletes in field settings. This
   review summarises exercise physiology findings prior to the widespread
   use of equine laboratory treadmills which have tethered investigators to
   the laboratory, and explains and illustrates newer, more portable, often
   digital technological developments which have allowed investigations to
   move out of the laboratory and back to the field setting where horses
   train and compete on a daily basis.}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture (SM) content is one of the most important environmental
   variables in relation to land surface climatology, hydrology, and
   ecology. Long-term SM data-sets on a regional scale provide reasonable
   information about climate change and global warming specific regions.
   The aim of this research work is to develop an integrated methodology
   for SM of kastanozems soils using multispectral satellite data. The
   study area is Tuv (48 degrees 40'30{''}N and 106 degrees 15'55{''}E)
   province in the forest steppe zones in Mongolia. In addition to this,
   land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI) from Landsat satellite images were integrated for the
   assessment. Furthermore, we used a digital elevation model (DEM) from
   ASTER satellite image with 30-m resolution. Aspect and slope maps were
   derived from this DEM. The soil moisture index (SMI) was obtained using
   spectral information from Landsat satellite data. We used regression
   analysis to develop the model. The model shows how SMI from satellite
   depends on LST, NDVI, DEM, Slope, and Aspect in the agricultural area.
   The results of the model were correlated with the ground SM data in Tuv
   province. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between
   output SM and SM of ground truth for agricultural area. Further research
   is focused on moisture mapping for different natural zones in Mongolia.
   The innovative part of this research is to estimate SM using drivers
   which are vegetation, land surface temperature, elevation, aspect, and
   slope in the forested steppe area. This integrative methodology can be
   applied for different regions with forest and desert steppe zones.}},

Title = {{Beyond autism and technology: lessons from neurodiverse populations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{43-48}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on the sixth seminar in
   a seven-seminar series entitled, Innovative Technologies for Autism:
   Critical Reflections on Digital Bubbles, funded by the UK Economic and
   Social Research Council. The aim of this particular seminar was to
   reflect upon the implications from neurodiverse communities for the
   development of technology for autism.
   Design/methodology/approach - Presentations from key researchers and
   parental perspectives are reviewed, highlighting contemporary issues in
   neurodiverse populations that have important implications for autism.
   Findings - Whilst there are many conditions associated with autism, most
   commonly intellectual disability (learning difficulties), this is not
   reflected in research. In addition, for child-based research,
   researchers are at least a generation older than participants and have
   had different digital-childhoods. Involving neurodiverse populations
   within participatory design sessions can address both of these issues.
   Understanding the context of the issues that the participatory design
   sessions address is crucial for developing participatory design
   principles that extend from one condition to another. This includes
   understanding when findings based upon verbal populations can be
   extended to non-verbal populations.
   Originality/value - This paper offers up-to-date insights into how
   design principles from one condition extend to different conditions.
   Universal interaction and neurodiversity HCI are considered. This is
   important within neurodiverse populations, especially given the high
   rates of additional conditions that are associated with autism. Whilst
   the majority of autism research has involved verbal populations, the
   benefits of technology can extend to non-verbal populations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the
   main messages and key questions for further research arising from the
   seven-seminar series entitled, ``Innovative technologies for autism:
   critical reflections on digital bubbles{''}, funded by the Economic and
   Social Research Council in the UK.
   Design/methodology/approach - A synthesis of the main ideas is
   presented, drawing on the presentations, discussions, participant
   feedback, and short papers from across the seminar series, which took
   place between November 2014-2016.
   Findings - There were many positive examples where technologies were
   positioned and used as facilitative ``bridges{''} between ideas,
   communities, understanding, and experiences. Researchers and community
   stakeholders also emphasised the importance of taking different
   perspectives and working in stronger partnerships with each other. Four
   overarching research questions were developed from these themes to
   provide a roadmap for future research, relating to: responsible
   innovation, technology-enabled social interaction, learning and
   pedagogy, and engagement.
   Originality/value - The findings and methodologies produced by the
   Digital Bubbles seminar series, available on the project website

Title = {{Mobile lecturers, mobile students: an exploratory study in a blended
   architectural technology context}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{748-778}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review mobility-oriented
   criteria that inform the on-the-move use of digital technology. It
   addresses aspects of mobile technology-enhancement learning and the
   perceived differences between mobile lecturers and mobile learners in a
   higher education (HE) context in an Architectural Technology domain.
   Design/methodology/approach - A review of literature comprising journal
   and peer-reviewed conference papers, books and e-articles published
   between 2009 and 2016 was conducted. The review was supplemented by the
   administration among facilitating lecturers (n = 3) and a cohort of
   undergraduate students (n = 14) of custom-designed survey
   questionnaires, comprising open-ended and closed items. Qualitative
   analysis via ATLAS.ti of literature sources and questionnaire-based
   feedback led to a theoretically grounded codebook enhanced by
   empirically based items.
   Findings - Qualitative analysis of literature sources and respondent
   feedback produced guidelines for mobility in HE environments and led to
   a set of 32 criteria grouped pragmatically in six themes, namely: mobile
   technology; stakeholder outlook; effectiveness; facilitation; capability
   and interactivity. Furthermore, perceived differences between mobile
   lecturers and mobile students emerged and informed institutional
   decisions regarding mobility in educational contexts.
   Research limitations/implications - The study was limited in the
   following ways: although the all facilitating lecturers (3) and the
   enroled cohort of students (14) was selected, this sample is small. The
   institutional comprises several campuses, faculties and departments
   covering a wide spectrum of domains. However, the study was purposively
   and conveniently limited to a single innovative and blended,
   undergraduate Architectural Technology programme. Face-to-face
   interviews were not feasible limiting primary data collection to online
   survey questionnaires; and finally, the study was not longitudinal but
   designed to be based on a ``slice in time{''} context.
   Practical implications - Strategic, tactical, and operational
   stakeholders such as institutional leadership; administrators;
   courseware designers; lecturers; and students benefit from this study.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the body of knowledge by
   speaking to capabilities of mobile technology in a digital milieu. It
   guides practical mobility considerations in HE environments and supports
   competitive advantage decision-making. The paper establishes awareness
   of mobility differences between mobile lecturers and mobile students
   thus highlighting concepts associated with the ad hoc use of mobile
   technology among HE stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{Technological changes in the digital age require schools to integrate
   innovative technologies in learning and the curriculum. This study
   analyzes data collected from elementary schools toward the end of the
   second and the third years of the national program for the gradual
   integration of ICT in Israeli schools. The study examines how school
   principals and ICT coordinators assess the systemic changes that have
   occurred in their schools. The parameters explored were collaboration
   (intraschool vs. interschool collaboration), digital content (using vs.
   designing digital content), and e-communication (within the teaching
   staff vs. between staff and families). An online questionnaire was
   distributed to the entire district of the Ministry of Education. The
   analysis was carried out on a total of 358 schools. Regression analysis
   showed that intraschool collaboration, digital content use and design,
   pedagogical update of class websites, and e-communication within the
   teaching staff explained 47.7\% of variance in the general quality of
   ICT integration. It seems that school ICT leaders assess the general
   quality of ICT integration according to internal factorsin terms of
   collaboration within their schools and online interactions with
   colleaguesrather than external factorscollaborative activities between
   schools or e-communication with students and parents.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate
   knowledge replication-imitation speed differentials in the context of
   patents as the target knowledge.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study analyzes patent citations in
   the electric digital data processing class employing an accelerated
   failure-time model.
   Findings - This study finds that replicators can turn the private aspect
   of knowledge into an advantage against imitators with respect to the
   speed of knowledge transfer, even after the knowledge is codified in a
   patent. Specifically, being a replicator provides no knowledge transfer
   speed advantage over imitators. Instead, a joint consideration of
   knowledge characteristics and organizational boundaries is necessary
   when explaining knowledge replication-imitation speed differentials.
   Thus, ``organizational advantage{''} in knowledge transfer is knowledge
   characteristic-specific rather than general.
   Originality/value - This study illuminates the differential effects of
   organizational boundaries on knowledge transfer by investigating both
   replication and imitation in conjunction with each other, which has been
   a weakness in previous studies. This study also investigates knowledge
   transfer speed, another void in extant research.}},

Title = {{Making sense of comments on YouTube educational videos: a self-directed
   learning perspective}},
Journal = {{ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Through the lens of self-directed theory, the purpose of this
   paper is to investigate if social technologies such as YouTube will be
   viable to disseminate educational instructions and in the process
   empowering learners to take charge of their learning.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 150 educational videos on
   YouTube were selected and 29,386 comments extracted using the authors'
   customized extraction software application. Sentiment and qualitative
   content analyses were performed.
   Findings - Results indicate that YouTube can play important roles in
   facilitating online self-directed learning (SDL) as the findings
   uncovered a variety of learning and social affordances of YouTube.
   However, caution should be exercised as high views and well-commented
   videos might not imply quality and credibility. This study concludes
   that YouTube generally provides a conducive a learning environment that
   affords learners the resources to meet their SDL objectives.
   Research limitations/implications - To the best of knowledge, this is
   the first study that investigates SDL in social media by combining both
   qualitative content and sentiment analyses. The study shows that such a
   hybrid approach of combining two diverse analytical techniques provides
   an innovative means to make sense of comments expressed in social media.
   Practical implications - The results will help educational institutions
   and policy-makers to craft better programs for public education and
   create policies to help self-directed learners in evaluating online
   video resources.
   Originality/value - Despite a wealth of literature on the use of
   technologies to support learning, the majority of work done to date has
   dealt in the classroom context. Studies on SDL using educational content
   on YouTube are limited. Hence, this research contributes by providing
   insights on how educational institutions can move toward the direction
   of building collaborative digital learning platforms with relevant
   educational instruction and resources to enable users to participate in
   lifelong self-learning and education.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the increasing demand for knowledge of multidisciplinary
   endeavours under digitalization of society, there is an increasing need
   for development of flexible innovative educational programs. For this
   purpose, we offer a computer application for development of the
   educational program content. This computer application is implemented on
   the basis of the topological sorting algorithm. The efficiency of this
   algorithm compared to others is obvious because it promotes the course
   of learning, which avoids duplication of modules (theme) and keeps the
   logical sequence of the educational material learning. The computer
   application presented allows to create an individual learning course,
   taking into account the prerequisites and postrequisites of elective
   disciplines and multi-disciplines.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{47-66}},
Abstract = {{The present paper investigates the location patterns and the effects
   co-working spaces generate on the urban context, issues that have been
   neglected by the existing literature. The focus is on Milan, the core of
   the Italian knowledge-based, creative, digital, and sharing economy, and
   the city hosting the largest number of co-working spaces in Italy. The
   paper addresses three main questions: (1) Where are the main locations
   of co-working spaces in Milan? (2) Are there any transformative effects
   of co-working spaces, respectively at the urban scale and at the very
   local scale? (3) What are their impacts in terms of spatial
   transformation and in terms of innovation in practices (for instance,
   work, leisure, or culture)? Desk research showed that location patterns
   of co-working spaces resemble those of service industries in urban
   areas, with a propinquity to the so-called creative clusters. Field
   research shed light on urban effects, such as the participation of
   workers in co-working spaces in local community initiatives, their
   contribution to urban revitalization trends, and micro-scale physical
   transformations. The paper, therefore, helps to fill the gap in the
   literature about the location patterns of these new working spaces and
   their urban effects at different scales, both in terms of urban spaces
   and practices.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Integration of knowledge and communications, the movement
   for open access to knowledge lead to the emergence of factors that
   update the philosophy of functioning and development of university
   libraries. There is a need to comprehend the ongoing innovations in the
   activities of university libraries in the world. Purpose. The study
   assumes understanding of the substantial changes in the library services
   for scientists related to Open Access and the new role of university
   libraries - a partner in the production, preservation and spread of
   knowledge. Methodology. On the basis of empirical and theoretical
   methods, the features of modern university libraries are considered.
   They include shift of the priority vector towards the services for an
   author-scientist and support of the philosophy of open access to
   knowledge. The study identifies and analyzes the anthropological aspects
   of communicative and informational awareness of reality by university
   researchers and librarians. The realities of modern services for
   scientists of Ukraine are examined based on the experience of the
   Scientific and Technical Library of Dnipropetrovsk National University
   of Railway Transport named after Academician V. Lazaryan. The
   observations and surveys of scientists, librarians, publishers of
   scientific periodicals allow analyzing the anthropological aspects
   concerning new digital library services. The aspects affect: 1)
   relationship between communicants; 2) explanations of why it is the
   authors-researchers who have been at the center of the attention of
   libraries, why they are provided with exactly these services and exactly
   in this way; 3) levels of impact of new services on both scientists and
   librarians. Originality. It is established that in the process of
   communicative and informational awareness of reality, there are changes
   in the dimension of scientists and university librarians, namely, the
   ways of their behaviour and the communicative features associated with
   the development of Open Access and the new role of university libraries
   as partners in the production, preservation and spread of knowledge.
   Conclusions. The leading role of university libraries in the
   implementation of digital initiatives of scientific communication, based
   on free access to knowledge, leads to changes: 1) in the dimension of
   scientists and librarians, namely, the ways of their behavior and
   communicative features; 2) in the emotional, psychological, physical
   states of librarians as intermediaries between two conflicting
   requirements - ensuring stability in the activities of the library and
   the need for changes in the services it provides.}},

Abstract = {{Blockchain is attracting more and more attentions from many kinds of
   fields, such as finance, industry, and theory researchers. Rather than
   viewing blockchain as a novel technology, we should think it as an
   innovation for managing digital society, which provides fundamental
   principles to support democratically distributed applications. Based on
   the design and application of the Energy Internet, this paper analyzes
   the core architecture of the initial blockchain technology, and combines
   the security of the public chain with the efficiency of the private
   chain, solving the poor efficiency problem of the initial blockchain by
   using the high efficiency of private chain. At the same time, it
   inherits the security and non-tampering of initial blockchain. This
   paper designs a new hybrid blockchain storaging mode that is Block
   Static Storage(BSS, internal structure is N+X hybrid blockchain,
   following can be referred to as N+X HBC), for purpose that improving the
   overall efficiency of the Internet running, achieving decentralized
   supervision, and provoding a credible, safe and efficient performance of
   the Energy Internet in the storage of its massive data, as well as a
   huge business system.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the current
   positioning of online banking in Spain.
   Design/methodology/approach - Netnography, a new technique for obtaining
   information.
   Findings - The collection and analysis of 261 valid messages from two
   online consumer portals enables us to observe the existence of two
   competitor groups and two types of attributes. On the one hand,
   consumers perceive online banking as competitors depending on their
   size; and on the other hand, negative (or positive) aspects are
   compensated (or accepted) as a result of greater (or lesser)
   profitability. This means that different forms of value creation are
   offered with online banking clients.
   Originality/value - The methodology used represents an innovative way to
   determine the positioning of online banking and could be extended to
   other digital products.}},

Title = {{Reinvention of Publishers' Revenue Model-Expectations of Advertisers
   towards Publishers' Products}},
Journal = {{MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Publishers have to reconsider their revenue model. Facing a massive
   decline in the circulation of newspapers and magazines over the past
   years, publishers have lost not only readers but also many advertisers.
   Thus, publishers are faced with both changed customer expectations as
   well as difficulty in generating profit. Users are increasingly less
   willing to pay for digital products and their expectations of digital
   content have changed: They would like to contribute their own content as
   well as to comment or share with others. Furthermore, advertisers can
   choose from a greater variety of options for placing adverts,
   particularly on social media and other online platforms. Therefore, many
   publishers struggle with the questions: How to earn money? What is the
   revenue model of the new business model? In order to determine the
   implications for publishers' revenue models, we assume that advertising
   companies are going to play a prominent role in the new business model.
   Hence, this paper focuses on publishers' services for advertising
   companies and therefore the expectations of advertisers towards
   publishers' services. In particular, this preliminary qualitative study
   explores advertisers' marketing interests in communities of readers who
   simultaneously contribute to discussions. Therefore, (1) a pre-study was
   conducted followed by (2) qualitative interviews with managers from
   advertising companies in Germany. Our initial findings confirm that
   advertisers could play an important role in the revenue model of
   publishers if they meet the expectations of advertisers who expressed
   their interest in both, using communities for customer research as well
   as interacting with users directly. The results also identify other
   possible services that publishers could offer advertisers in conjunction
   with addressing communities of contributing readers.}},

Title = {{The future of student life: participating}},
Journal = {{ON THE HORIZON}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{177-180}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - A research project exploring emerging student needs explored
   six aspects of student life: living, learning, working, playing,
   connecting and participating. Participating is explored here. This
   aspect focuses on the ways that students may become active citizens by
   participating in civic life. Insights are gained as to how students may
   engage with universities and governments and how they will contribute to
   the public sphere. Themes such as voting, (h) activism, transparency and
   digital strategies to improve governance are explored. This paper aims
   to summarize two scenarios about the Participating domain from the
   Student Needs 2025+ project and highlight implications for the future of
   higher education.
   Design/methodology/approach - A modified version of the University of
   Houston's ``Framework Foresight{''} method was used to explore the
   future of six aspects of future student life.
   Findings - The ability of students and citizens to innovate and affect
   change should not be underestimated. The maker movement and the ``life
   hacking{''} meme are symbols of the hidden societal energy available to
   governments to improve the world and solve our pressing issues. For this
   to be effective, the role of the hacker, and hacktivism in general as a
   form of civic participation, should be reframed as a positive
   contributor of change. The relationship between governing bodies and
   activism is at a crossroads. The current age of interconnectivity offers
   tremendous potential for governing bodies to include civil contributions
   and innovation in a powerful, net-positive way. However, the status quo
   is so often the opposite and those who are being governed are perceived
   as a threat. There is a need for key players and leaders to creatively
   act according to innovative paradigms and principles that strategically
   reconcile the hacked and the hacking for the greater good of society.
   Research limitations/implications - In terms of research limitations,
   the paper is focused on the needs of students and does not purport to be
   an exhaustive analysis of all of the issues influencing higher
   education. It views the future of higher education through the lens of
   students and their emerging needs.
   Originality/value - This paper explores student life in its totality as
   a way to more accurately identify student needs in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Health disparities among sexual minority adults ages 50 and older have
   been documented. Factors such as lifetime discrimination and
   internalized stigma may deter sexual minority individuals from seeking
   health services. Several studies suggest that health information
   technology may facilitate health education and outreach to populations
   whose health behaviors are affected by stigma such as older sexual
   minority people. This study examined the role of sexual minority
   identity as a factor that is associated with health information
   technology use. Data from the 2013-2014 National Health Interview Survey
   (NHIS) were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to
   compare the odds of using technology as a resource for health
   information between sexual minority versus heterosexual US adults aged
   50 and older. Adjusting for sociodemographic variables and health
   variables, sexual minority participants had increased odds of using
   computers to look up health information on the Internet (OR=2.01, 95\%
   CI 1.53-2.64), using computers to fill a prescription (OR=1.97, 95\% CI
   1.36-2.85), and using computers to communicate with health-care provider
   by e-mail (OR=2.13, 95\% CI 1.55-2.92), compared with heterosexuals.
   Findings reveal greater use of health information technology among older
   sexual minority adults when compared to their heterosexual counterparts.
   While sensitive, competent providers and culturally appropriate
   prevention services are essential to meeting the needs of aging sexual
   minority populations, health information technology use may be an
   innovative means of reducing disparities in information access as
   structural changes are implemented.}},

Journal = {{REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{179-200}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to outline the ongoing development,
   implementation and evaluation of a digital research notebook designed to
   support hybrid and online approaches to information literacy development
   in one-shot, course-integrated and full course instruction.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes the authors'
   collaborative creation of the research notebook and its evolution from a
   collection of online modules to a student-centered online learning tool
   focused on supporting the reflective research and writing process. A
   small random sampling of notebooks was used for assessment of student
   learning and the notebook's effectiveness.
   Findings - Hybrid approaches to library instruction that leverage direct
   assessment of student work as well as opportunities for students to
   reflect on their research process facilitate both student learning and
   increased understanding for library staff of how students experience the
   research and writing process.
   Practical implications - The development of instructional tools to
   extend the ``one-shot{''} model can lead to a variety of instructional
   innovations and open up opportunities to explore and develop new
   approaches. Including opportunities for students to reflect and provide
   feedback on their experience of the research and writing process offers
   important insights often missed by purely quantitative assessment
   methods.
   Social implications - Use of the research notebook opened up more time
   during face to face instruction time for deeper learning, critical
   information literacy and discussions of social justice issues related to
   information production and access.
   Originality/value - The paper presents an innovative, adaptable and
   scalable approach to addressing common challenges faced by information
   literacy instruction programs.}},

   unprecedented speed imposed by technological innovation, from which the
   Internet has emerged at a greater pace. To interpret correctly the
   changes that have ensued, it is essential to rule out any technological
   impetus by which these new conditions can now dictate related
   assessments in design processes. The ability to achieve new knowledge
   and produce endless combinations seems to lead to a path based on a
   shared work; it is no coincidence that this era is called the Learning
   Society and/or Network Society, due to recent endeavours showing utterly
   new and unexplored paths. In a situation like this, the architect must
   seek new ways that would allow his/her communicative tools to be
   explicit in what the architecture wants to express professionally under
   the empowering conditions of the Learning/Network Society. That seems to
   be the only way to relocate the architect in a more interactive sphere
   that in the end would lead to a more communicative architecture in tune
   with the expectations of society. The main characteristics of a global
   culture, built via the Internet are participation, dissemination and
   interaction. Within the given scenario, architecture can help transform
   those features into a path accessible to all mankind; this could be
   regarded as a new contemplation of collective thought. The urgent task
   is therefore to draw a new responsibility for the architect by which a
   particular architectural idea crosses the expectations of the self,
   becoming more accessible to all. Architecture is all about experience,
   which in turn reflects an almost sacred world; yet this said world is
   now recovered and translated into a constant exchange among electronic
   flows, whose spatial properties are based on current conditions. As such
   the most desired urban life is also expected to take part in an
   interdependent and yet complementary milieu of urbanity in flux. There,
   the architect should play a major role: a challenging design process
   that would interplay completely with endless images in order to
   constantly reinvent their roles, acquire new knowledge and skills, to be
   able to distinguish what must be done selectively. To be able to reveal
   how and to what extent the architect could now pose a new professional
   reflection, this study is designed to receive such responses from an
   array of renowned architectural firms in Europe to fully understand how
   the internet as an instrument of knowledge generation, and thus
   dissemination, visibly affects the orthodoxies of design processes. It
   is proven that the vast scale of information flux available provide
   rather sketchy frameworks; therefore, it is almost impossible to find a
   solid base of departure that offers an opportunity to design at
   distance, replacing the old-fashion face-to-face generative procedures
   which in the end restrain some of the faculties of design processes such
   as collective thought. Crafting an ill-defined base and an unbalanced
   interaction between the role-players in different cultural contexts, the
   research shows that digital technology is certainly an opportunity to
   master some of the shortcomings of design processes; however, it is not
   a totalizing phenomenon as such issues as doubts, uncertainties, and
   ambiguities still largely remain on the drafting table.}},

Abstract = {{Rural and urban areas are linked. A basic definition of rural-urban
   linkages is that they consist of flows (of goods, people, information,
   finance, waste, information, social relations) across space, linking
   rural and urban areas (Cecilia, 2015). Economically, rural and urban
   areas are linked by the reciprocal exchange of unprocessed and processed
   products, with both areas acting as mutually reinforcing markets {[}1].
   Perhaps a less descriptive definition is of the functional links between
   sectors (agriculture, industry and services). The latter is central to
   structural change taking place in both rural and urban areas.
   Additionally, rural and urban economies exhibit symbiotic relationship.
   Cecilia {[}2] notes ``in many regions of the world we are witnessing an
   increase in production, especially of perishable and high-value products
   such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, responding to urban demand{''}.
   This is especially the case in rural areas that are well connected to
   urban markets by transport links, communications and electricity, and by
   networks of local traders (Cecilia, 2015). This is especially true with
   Dairy Industry.
   The dairy industry exhibits mini ecosystem of rural and urban linkage.
   The dairy industry plays an important role for both rural and urban
   dwellers: a) a major source of rural employment (12\% to 14\% of world
   population {[}6]), b) consistent non-seasonal source of income with
   immediate cash returns, c) major urban consumer staple and d) major
   contributor of agriculture GDP in developing countries. In many
   developing countries, dairy industry employees majority of workforce
   from rural and have direct influence on rural and urban commerce. As per
   the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations {[}3],
   ``more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products;
   the majority of these people live in developing countries{''} {[}2].
   It's clear from the above, urban and rural areas have symbiotic
   relationship and in order to make urban areas smart, aka Smart Cities,
   it is imperative that the linkage of urban, in this case rural areas,
   needs be Smart entities, aka. Smart Villages. For making Smart Village,
   according to Viswanadham {[}7] ``the existing infrastructure and
   services (such as Power, Water, Buildings, Retail, Health care, etc.)
   need to be upgraded and in building the new ones. This requires
   standardization, use of IT
   In this research paper, we propose innovative approach to develop dairy
   IoT sensor network that enables Smart dairy, making Smart Villages a
   reality. We offer development of Smart Dairy IoT Sensors that not only
   identify cattle related health issues but also enable data and
   information sharing with dairy farmers for better predicting milk
   production and improvement of productivity. In addition, the data
   collected from IoT sensor and analytics models play pivotal role in
   preventing spread of viral flus and cattle health issues. Finally, the
   data collected from our IoT Dairy sensors and analytics will enable
   digital transformation at village level thus enabling cities smarter.
   The paper presents prototyping solution design as well as its
   application and certain experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Digitalization has changed media and retail industry in the last decades
   dramatically. Currently the focus switched to physical products enhanced
   or completely re-thought by digitalization. These products are called
   smart and connected products by Porter and Heppelmann, as they have
   smart components (i.e. computing power) in the product and are connected
   to a product cloud. By that, the products are enhanced with a strong
   service component. Since the late 90's, there was a substantial amount
   of research on product-service systems (PSS). In this position paper we
   analyze the research on PSS and apply it to smart and connected

Abstract = {{Media convergence has been mapped from a variety of perspectives, with
   scholars tracing the impact of digital convergence, for example, on
   everything from texts to consumption. Yet, few have examined how the
   rise of a convergent media landscape is impacting funding in and across
   contemporary media industries. It is important to examine such a
   relationship, and to assess ways in which convergent characteristics of
   connectivity, hybridity and networked society have informed approaches
   to funding across media sectors. This introductory article to this
   special issue ``Funding and Management in the Media Convergence Era{''}
   briefly outlines the approaches of the five authors. Individually, each
   article examines innovations in funding across a variety of different
   media sectors and platforms, looking across contemporary children's
   television, public service broadcasting, crowdfunded news and
   journalism, film production in Greece, and Japanese animation.
   Altogether, the articles in this special issue explore the broader
   implications of a contemporary media culture that is more sharable,
   hybridized, and connected on traditional funding models.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in distributed information technologies are providing
   the means to capture and process abundant data, and to reveal
   associations between variables describing the
   crop-environment-management interaction. This review describes the
   determinants and moderating factors influencing how much value a crop
   producer and his or her advisor can derive from data, and information
   derived from data. We describe the social, technological, and
   entrepreneurial processes needed to progress the nonlinear pathway from
   data to an on-farm decision, and explore the meaning of actionable
   knowledge; that is, knowledge that can be acted upon and applied to
   solve a real-world problem. We argue that effective decision support is
   also a system that supports the learning needs of crop producers and
   their transactions with trusted advisors. Crop protection, the sub-set
   of crop management used to mitigate crop loss, is used to illustrate
   current approaches and technologies to support farmers' decisions. We
   describe how situational awareness and actionable knowledge could be
   improved through use of emerging platform technologies, advances in
   artificial intelligence, consideration of farmer decision style,
   knowledge capture and maintenance, and embedding technology in
   human-centered services. Implications for the conduct of research and
   development are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an initial report on research, still in progress,
   aimed at the creation and archiving of video testimonies on the memories
   of childhood and school among Italians born in the 1940s and 1950s.
   During this critical period, Italian schools were still based on
   pedagogical models as well as on teaching practices from previous
   decades; however, they were also making the first tentative experiments
   with innovation and launching significant processes of democratisation.
   Oral testimonies of the experiences of pupils are therefore an
   undoubtedly valuable source for researchers involved in the complex
   process of creating the collective memory of school. Archived
   collections contain a wealth of written and audio-visual documents in
   which these life stories can be found. Normally, however, at least in
   the Italian setting, these are ego-documents collected and organised
   according to other research categories, to which the scholastic
   experience only serves as background. Memories of the time spent at the
   school desk were not considered central to the account and often remain
   part of a much broader context, from which it normally emerges only
   incidentally. Thus, school years were not the focus of the research.
   This contribution is therefore an attempt to make an initial
   presentation of a project involving the creation and collection of
   numerous video interviews in which memories of school and childhood were
   the main topic right from the interview planning stage. The ultimate
   goal of the research is to create a digital video archive of memories
   about school and education.}},

Abstract = {{The very fast evolution of the application field in microelectronics
   requires the adaption of higher education to engineer and master
   students in order to answer to the industrial, ``Research and
   Development{''}, and economical needs. In parallel, the development of
   our digital society, which proposes more and more massive open on-line
   courses, maintains the students in a theoretical knowledge. Therefore
   higher education must increase practices and know-how. This has been
   done in the framework of the French national network for education in
   microelectronics and nanotechnologies (GIP-CNFM), which adopted a
   strategy to promote innovative practices in the microelectronics.
   Through the microelectronics evolution, several examples are given to
   justify that practice and know-how are the pillar of technical higher
   education.}},

Abstract = {{This review provides an overview of the operations and impacts of mobile
   money in the developing world. Over the past decade, mobile money has
   become a ubiquitous tool in some developing economies, allowing
   individuals to digitally transact money without formal bank accounts.
   The impacts, where documented, have been sizeable: For example, poverty
   decreased by two percentage points in Kenya. However, adoption still
   lags in many economies and, even where there is universal adoption,
   product innovation over the rails of these digital accounts has been
   slow. The review concludes by discussing what the future of mobile money
   in developing economies may look like and, thus, where the most exciting
   opportunities for research may be.}},

Abstract = {{Interlinked and autonomous manufacturing systems provide new
   opportunities in smart manufacturing. Today's manufacturing system
   design processes and architecture still are based on traditional
   engineering methods and can hardly cope with increased system
   complexity. Hence new cyber physical production systems (CPPS) design
   and architecture principles as well as corresponding validation and
   verification methods are necessary. This paper presents firstly a new
   architecture design approach for modularised design of CPPS. Secondly,
   new capabilities in designing with modular construction kits, simulating
   functional behaviour and validating with virtual, functional prototype
   are introduced. Thirdly, a proposal for the development approach and
   virtual validation is presented and risks as well as challenges are
   discussed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of CIRP.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to develop a new measurement
   technique without touching the measured object. Digital Image
   Correlation (DIC) is an advanced measurement technique used to measure
   the displacement of particles with very high accuracy. This powerful
   innovative technique is used to correlate two image segments to
   determine the similarity between them. For this study, three
   geometrically similar beam specimens of different sizes were cast and
   tested under three-point bending in a closed loop servo-controlled
   machine with crack mouth opening displacement control with a rate of
   opening of 0.0005 mm/sec. Digital images were captured before loading
   (unreformed state) and at different instances of loading and analyzed
   using correlation techniques to compute surface displacement, crack
   opening and sliding displacement, load-point displacement, crack length
   and crack tip location. It was seen that crack mouth opening
   displacement and vertical load-point displacement computed using DIC
   analysis match well with those experimentally measured.}},

Abstract = {{The present article draws the history of how the seal casts collection
   of the National Archives of Belgium (NAB) was created and accumulated in
   the course of the years and gives a short presentation of the cast
   production process. This first section is followed by a short overview
   of the collection as such and how it was digitised and published online
   from 2009 to 2015. This article will give technical information about
   casting methods and highlight the process of casting production. We will
   explain which periods were the most successful for the production of
   castings and why. Many reasons explain why this campaign of reproduction
   did not follow the same rhythm over the last 150 years. Explaining our
   digitalization of the castings is primarily aimed at offering a
   methodological reflexion for those who want to embark on a similar
   project. Finally, the seal matrices collection and the 3D-digitisation
   project that started in January 2015 will be presented. This project is
   technically innovative as it uses 3D digitalization. We will demonstrate
   that it leads to interesting findings which could involve other Belgian
   federal institutions or any institution keeping a collection of matrix
   seals. Refs 17.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The Physical Internet (PI) is an emerging concept that applies
   the Digital Internet as a design metaphor for the development of
   sustainable, interoperable and collaborative freight transport. With the
   aim of aiding researchers and policy makers in their future efforts to
   develop efficient logistics systems, the purpose of this paper is to
   present a review of the existing literature on the PI, to critically
   discuss the concept and to outline a research agenda.
   Design/methodology/approach - The literature review investigates
   scientific papers, project reports, specifications and other
   publications related to PI. In total, 46 publications were finally
   analyzed. The approach used in this paper is technology adoption by
   firms. The authors examine the PI based on four factors: organizational
   readiness (technological blueprints), external pressure (promised
   effects), perceived benefits (business model) and adoption.
   Findings - A growing number of strategies, blueprints and specifications
   have been developed for PI, yet there are no currently developed models
   that illustrate how the move from the entrenched logistics business
   models to the PI could ensue. There is a lack of understanding of the
   business models needed that can involve critical actors and promote the
   adoption of the PI concept.
   Research limitations/implications - While using the internet as a
   metaphor for reimagining physical transports is certainly exciting, this
   review and analysis suggest that several research questions need to be
   addressed before further PI blueprint work is carried out.
   Practical implications - The ``grand challenge{''} of sustainability in
   logistics needs to be addressed and improved, but the authors' analysis
   suggests that, to some extent, it is uncertain how the PI will
   contribute to improving sustainability, and why logistics service
   providers should engage in PI. Policy makers and practitioners are
   provided with critical issues to consider in the practical development
   and adoption of the concept.
   Originality/value - This paper provides an outsider and
   technology-adoption perspective of PI research, as well as important
   implications for policy makers and researchers.}},

   education serves a critical role. Within a rapidly changing health care
   landscape, matriculated students now benefit from pedagogical
   innovations supporting integrated care, particularly interprofessional
   education, and working professionals must not be excluded from this
   transformation. University-based digital instructional programs can
   support the learning needs of working professionals, providing an
   alternative and complement to brick-and-mortar classrooms and ad hoc
   onsite trainings. This paper describes the structure, content, digital
   approach, and outcomes of a continuing education program in integrated
   behavioral health and primary care, housed in a school of social work at
   a major university. The challenges of interprofessional digital
   education are described and future directions are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Digital screen is the main pattern of the digital revolution. Around the
   world schools and universities, changes printed pages in favour of
   digital screens, creating innovative platforms for learning and
   assessment methodologies, however many others keep the traditional
   approaches of teaching and printed textbooks. The new paradigm of
   learning is focused on development the vital competence for
   sustainability. Although educational system has been opened by the
   globalisation, the diversity of digital screens is a big challenge for
   this process. How digital affects the opening process of the educational
   system and, therefore, changes the behaviour? This scientific question
   inspired the ideas presented in this chapter. The aim of this chapter is
   to compare the features of digital screen with the intention of
   multiliteracies' learning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the progress of the Horizon 2020 STORM project,
   started in March 2015. The objective of this project is to develop and
   demonstrate a generic district heating and cooling network controller.
   Generic in this sense means that the controller is applicable to widely
   spread 3rd generation, but also very innovative 4th generation networks.
   Therefore, the controller will be tested in a traditional district
   heating scheme but also in an advanced low-temperature network.
   The controller influences the demand of the network to achieve a certain
   objective. STORM focuses on three objectives: (i) a peak shaving
   objective used to minimize the use of often polluting peak boilers; (ii)
   a cell balancing objective striving to balance a cluster of consumers to
   producers of excess heat or/cold; and (iii) a market interaction
   objective, applicable for heat/cold producers with a connection to the
   electrical grid (heat pumps or CHPs), maximizing the profit for the
   producer by switching these devices based on the electricity price.
   To guarantee the generic applicability of the controller, self-learning
   control techniques are used. These techniques have the advantage that
   they `learn' the behavior of the network by themselves without the need
   to be extensively tuned at the installation (plug-and-play
   installation).
   To date, the focus was on algorithms for a forecast module of the
   heat/cold consumption of the network. These algorithms are already
   implemented in the controller platform and were running in real-time in
   one of the demonstration sites. Also, a tracking module was already
   developed and is currently tested. This module which will try to match
   the actual network consumption to this optimal consumption profile by
   distributing the control signals to the right heat consumers. Next step
   is the implementation of a planning module, which determines the optimal
   consumption profile, taken into account the forecasts. (C) 2017 The

Pages = {{1766-1780}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to devise and then test a
   theoretical model to illustrate the effects of the increasing importance
   of social media on consumer behavior and market equilibrium in
   differentiated food industries.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors use game theory to model the
   strategic use of social media by firms producing high-value food
   products. The authors test the predictions of the theoretical model by
   means of a survey of 722 randomly selected Italian food consumers using
   an online questionnaire.
   Findings - The model predicts that, as social media become more and more
   influential, consumers using the new media become more informed, and
   their concern about food quality attributes increases. At the same time,
   the consumers using mass media only receive less information and they
   prefer cheaper products to the high value one. As a result, the
   emergence of social media favours market segmentation and the hypotheses
   tested were: Social consumers are, on average, more informed than mass
   consumers and more concerned about environmental issues than mass
   consumers. The data support the theoretical model.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to the debate about the impact
   of information from interested sources on market equilibrium, providing
   an innovative analysis of the role of social media.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to increase understanding about the
   co-creation of digital facilities management (FM) services with and for
   FM during a construction project.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports a case study on the
   co-creation of a digital facilities management service during the
   Mission Bay medical center construction project for the University of
   California, San Francisco. The sub-contractors and the FM team
   co-created a quick-response (QR) code system for valves on the project.
   This digital service is now used by the FM team for training purposes
   and in emergency situations when information on valves and their service
   areas is quickly needed. Researchers made on-site observations,
   conducted 84 interviews and reviewed archival data in 2012, 2014 and
   2016.
   Findings - The findings show that a successful co-creation process
   consists of three elements: a dialogue between the project parties, the
   creation of shared context between the project parties and the creation
   of shared understanding about the FM's needs and the service providers'
   ways of satisfying those needs. The study describes ways to promote
   these elements.
   Originality/value - Previous studies emphasize the need for digital FM
   but few explain how FM teams can be involved in creating digital
   services for them. This paper describes how to co-create digital FM
   services with and for FMin the context of a construction project.}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence of new technologies the area of education is also
   growing very fast. By using new innovations teaching and learning has
   become technically very strong. Learning is becoming tech learning or
   e-learning. Educators and students are getting very smart and hence
   study and learning is also becoming smart. Maximum available learning
   systems don't involve pen and paper based learning. Due to the emergence
   of ICTs in the learning atmosphere it doesn't indicate that our
   traditional education methodologies have become outdated. Smart study is
   such a stage which allows students continue to learn in smart way by
   using smart pens and papers. Using smart paper and pen the contents
   written on the paper can be converted into digital format. Smart study
   using pen and paper is helpful for practicing handwriting in same
   traditional manner. This paper presents a smart study platform which
   combines work with printed and digital contents.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on the sociology of expectations and sociology of conventions,
   this paper explores issues of worth and value in the bioeconomy, and the
   promissory character of contemporary capitalism. Arguing that the
   literature on biocapital has paid insufficient attention to geographical
   differentiation in capital accumulation strategies, this paper situates
   the consumer genomics firm 23andme in the entrepreneurial culture of
   Silicon Valley. The paper suggests that in Silicon Valley the
   relationship between moral worth and economic value is mediated through
   the concept of disruptive innovation, which functions as both
   ideological construct and a set of commercial practices utilized by the
   founders of start-up firms and the venture capitalists who invest in
   them. Analyzing 23andme's status as a unicorn firm, the paper describes
   how the recent increase in private investment capital in Silicon Valley
   has led to a new model of business development for start-ups and
   considers its implications for corporate governance.}},

Pages = {{979-995}},
Abstract = {{Location has proven axiomatic as an economic variable throughout human
   history. Tobler's first law of geography introduced the importance of
   location; in that, near things are more related than far things. In an
   age of digital economies, a new research frontier exists where
   everything is more related to everything else and has an increased
   economic value from spatially enabled technology. The accessibility of
   digital-spatial information has brought economic geographers to a new
   understanding of markets within a Digital Earth framework. The
   importance of location to economic value can be expected to grow as the
   Internet of Things develops in sophistication. New business models enter
   and disrupt established markets with innovative spatially enabled
   approaches. A successful penetration of established markets suggests a
   new business model for financial and functional utility by engaging
   spatially enabled assets. The second law of geography is introduced as a
   conceptual framework to comprehend the economic potential of spatially
   enabled information. A comparative analysis of non-spatial versus
   spatial web agents provides a quantitative framework to demonstrate the
   benefits of the Digital Earth economy.}},

Abstract = {{Image registration is the key technology of digital imaging
   applications, it is used widely. We researched the image registration
   techniques in this paper. Based on the basis of D-Nets image
   registration algorithms, we propose a new innovation. We turn first to
   process image, so we can get synthetic images of original images and
   enhanced images. Then we extract SIFT feature in the original image.
   Next, in order to reduce noise of the image, we use the Gauss filter to
   process the synthesized image. Then we do experiments with synthetic
   images in the process of image registration. In this process, we use the
   D-Nets algorithm to achieve. Compared to the existing method, it can
   greatly improve the accuracy and recall.}},

Abstract = {{Developments shaping digital journalism seem to speeding up at the start
   of the 21st century. Social media enable radical new ways to gather and
   verify sources and information. Hardware and software power innovative
   storytelling formats, combining platforms and channels, adding
   interactivity to the news experience. And the global news industry is
   quickly becoming a networked industry, with startups and other forms of
   entrepreneurial journalism springing up all over the world. In this
   essay, I consider a possible future for digital journalism by briefly
   reviewing first findings from a series of case studies of 21 new
   small-sized journalism enterprises operating in 11 countries (spread
   across 5 continents). The overarching research question: seen through
   their eyes, what does the future of (digital) journalism look like? The
   answers are hopeful.}},

Abstract = {{This article uses the work of Bernard Stiegler to understand how
   widespread digitisation has influenced the transmission of ephemeral and
   marginalised feminist histories and archives, using as a case study my
   experience of creating a low-budget feminist digital archive in the
   first decade of the twenty-first century, the Women's Liberation Music
   Archive (WLMA). I explore how the WLMA benefitted from unique
   transmission conditions enabled by digitisation, namely widened access
   to recorded matter that had become inoperable within feminist
   communities, technically, socially and culturally. I then go on to
   examine two areas that pose both threats and possibilities for the
   sustainability of digital archives in the long term. The first issue
   relates to the position of low-financed digital archives within the
   volatile dynamics of change that propel the innovation-driven market
   economy. The second relates to metadata and how digital technologies
   present an opportunity to re-think the terms of categorisation used to
   describe information within networks of association and reference.
   Finally, I argue that acquiring the technical skills to take care of
   digital information will perform a key role ensuring digital archives
   can survive in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Archaeology is by its nature strictly connected with the physical
   landscape and as such it explores the inter-relations of individuals
   with places in which they leave and the nature that surrounds them.
   Since its earliest stages, archaeology demonstrated its permeability to
   scientific methods and innovative techniques or technologies.
   Archaeologists were indeed between the first to adopt GIS platforms
   (since already almost three decades) on large scale and are now between
   the most demanding customers for emerging technologies such as digital
   photogrammetry and drone-aided aerial photography.
   This paper aims at presenting case studies where the ``3D approach{''}
   can be critically analysed and compared with more traditional means of
   documentation. Spot-light is directed towards the benefits of a
   specifically designed platform for user to access the 3D point-clouds
   and explore their characteristics. Beside simple measuring and editing
   tools, models are presented in their actual context and location, with
   historical and archaeological information provided on the side. As final
   step of a parallel project on geo-referencing and making available a
   large archive of aerial photographs, 3D models derived from
   photogrammetric processing of images have been uploaded and linked to
   photo-footprints polygons. Of great importance in such context is the
   possibility to interchange the point-cloud colours with satellite
   imagery from OpenLayers. This approach makes it possible to explore
   different landscape configurations due to time-changes with simple
   clicks.
   In these cases, photogrammetry or 3D laser scanning replaced, sided or
   integrated legacy documentation, creating at once a new set of
   information for forthcoming research and ideally new discoveries.}},

   (France) in collaboration with the Spanish National Agency for
   Scientific Research (CSIC, Spain). The main objective of the project is
   to develop innovative Tools for the conservation of the Mediterranean
   red coral, Corallium rubrum. PErfECT was funded by the Total Fundation.
   The adaptation of digital photogrammetric techniques for use in
   submarine is rapidly increasing in recent years. In fact, these
   techniques are particularly well suited for use in underwater
   environments. PErfECT developed different photogrammetry tools to
   enhance the red coral population surveys based in: (i) automatic
   orientation on coded quadrats, (ii) use of NPR (Non Photo realistic
   Rendering) techniques, (iii) the calculation of distances between
   colonies within local populations and finally (iv) the use of plenoptic
   approaches in underwater conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the used of close-range photogrammetry and
   terrestrial laser scanning technologies as an innovative technology for
   acquiring the three-dimensional data of an ancient cave paintings. The
   close-range photogrammetry technology used in the research was divided
   in two categories which are the UAV-based close-range photogrammetry and
   the terrestrialbased close-range photogrammetry. The UAV-based
   technology involved with the used of calibrated Phantom 4 System while
   the terrestrial-based technology involved with the calibrated Sony F828
   digital camera and pPhotoModeler software. Both stereo and convergent
   image acquisition techniques were used to acquire the images of the
   paintings. The ancient cave paintings were also recorded using
   terrestrial laser scanning technology. In the research, the FARO Focus
   3D terrestrial laser scanner was used to capture the three-dimensional
   point clouds and images of the paintings. The finding shows that both
   close-range photogrammetry and laser scanning technologies provide
   excellent solutions to map and to record the ancient paintings. As
   compared to the conventional method, both close-range photogrammetry and
   terrestrial laser scanning technology provide a non-contact solution for
   data acquisition and the data was recorded in digital format for better
   protection and security.}},

Abstract = {{Hackathon-style events are increasingly used to facilitate
   cross-disciplinary learning and innovation in the media industries.
   Based on an observational study of a hackathon organized as part of the
   film festival Nordic Panorama (NP) we analyse the challenges in using
   the hackathon format to facilitate cross-disciplinary learning and
   innovation for filmmakers, developers and designers. We find that many
   participants experienced frustrations resulting from a lack of
   programming skills and their expectation that the hackathon should
   result in something digital'. Additionally, ideals for authorship
   embedded in the working cultures of film and TV professionals impeded
   the team's ability to involve all participants on an equal footing. As
   implications for future hackathons we suggest organizers should consider
   using tools for end-user development and generative toolkits to
   facilitate digital making and collaborative learning. We also suggest
   similar events should avoid including project owners if the group work
   is based on existing projects.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter I discuss students' difficulties in algebra, considering
   in particular those students affected by developmental dyscalculia (DD)
   (Butterworth in Handbook of Mathematical Cognition. Hove, UK: Psychology
   Press, 2005; Dehaene in The number sense: How the mind creates
   mathematics. New York, Oxford University Press, 1997). Focusing on
   algebraic notions such as unknown, variable, algebraic expression,
   equation and solution of an equation, I will describe possible processes
   of meaning making in students with low achievement in mathematics, or
   even diagnosed with DD including adult learners. This involves
   considering algebra not only in its syntactic aspects but also in its
   semantic ones. The assumption on which the work is based, is that some
   difficulties in learning algebra could be due to the lack of meaning
   attributed by the students to the algebraic notions. Basing the analyses
   on studies both in the domain of cognitive psychology and in the domain
   of mathematics education, I will show how students with DD can make
   sense of the algebraic notions considered above, thanks to tasks
   designed within AlNuSet exploiting its semiotic multi-representations
   based on visual, non-verbal and kinaesthetic-tactile systems. AlNuSet
   (Algebra of Numerical Sets) is a digital artifact for dynamic algebra,
   designed for students of lower and upper secondary school.}},

Abstract = {{Given the explosive growth of digital collections and the digital
   transformation of services in libraries, the need for management
   education in library and information science programs has grown.
   However, I contend in this article that confusion abounds like the
   ``Tower of Babel{''} for LIS programs to accomplish this goal. A one
   size fits all approach does not work. Instead, management theory and
   principles need to be LIS-centric in accord with present day needs and
   conceptions. Management education also needs to be linked with
   scientific rigor to practice to meet the needs and expectations of LIS
   students. Rather than delivering management education that speaks the
   language of business, the content needs to resonate with the conditions
   for managing in the LIS context and to be supportive of the values of
   the LIS field. The article provides examples from research on management
   and innovation in libraries and other information-rich contexts. It also
   illustrates the types of issues that management education in LIS
   programs should address to deepen our understanding of the essential
   principles needed to manage information and knowledge.}},

Title = {{Vision and advocacy of optoelectronic technology developments in the

Pages = {{330-348}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review of
   laser scanning and 3D modelling devices, modes of delivery and
   applications within the architecture, engineering, construction and
   owner-operated sector. Such devices are inextricably linked to modern
   digital built environment practices, particularly when used in
   conjunction with as-built building information modelling (BIM)
   development. The research also reports upon innovative technological
   advancements (such as machine vision) that coalesce with 3D scanning
   solutions.
   Design/methodology/approach - A synthesis of literature is used to
   develop: a hierarchy of the modes of delivery for laser scan devices; a
   thematic analysis of 3D terrestrial laser scan technology applications;
   and a componential cross-comparative tabulation of laser scan technology
   and specifications.
   Findings - Findings reveal that the costly and labour intensive
   attributes of laser scanning devices have stimulated the development of
   hybrid automated and intelligent technologies to improve performance.
   Such developments are set to satisfy the increasing demand for
   digitisation of both existing and new buildings into BIM. Future work
   proposed will seek to: review what coalescence of digital technologies
   will provide an optimal and cost-effective solution to accurately
   re-constructing the digital built environment; conduct case studies that
   implement hybrid digital solutions in pragmatic facilities management
   scenarios to measure their performance and user satisfaction; and
   eliminate manual remodelling tasks (such as point cloud reconstruction)
   via the use of computational intelligence algorithms integral within
   cloud-based BIM platforms.
   Originality/value - Although laser scanning and 3D modelling have been
   widely covered en passant within the literature, scant research has
   conducted a holistic review of the technology, its applications and
   future developments. This review presents concise and lucid reference
   guidance that will intellectually challenge, and better inform, both
   practitioners and researchers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on the evolving field of
   hybrid services within the customer service domain. The distinguishing
   characteristic of hybrid services is its rapid advancements and
   intersection of technology innovations mixed with customer service
   approaches.
   Design/methodology/approach - Extensive research and analysis has
   identified numerous models to measure service quality and most of these
   models are derived from the SERVQUAL. Since SERVQUAL is not clearly
   focused to analyze the customer's experience, the authors have used
   mixed methods of data collection. The two sources of data are both
   primary and secondary data. Primary source of research is
   semi-structured feedback with key operations manager and front line
   employees involved in the business process outsourcing industry.
   Secondary source of data is based on case studies of organizations
   engaged in information technology and ecommerce.
   Findings - In this study, the author suggests multivariate hybrid
   pathways to streamline and deliver exceptional customer experience,
   which enhances the customer retention and firm's competitive advantage.
   This study emphasizes on the imminent growth of hybrid services within
   the customer service domain. The distinguishing characteristic of hybrid
   services is its rapid advancements and intersection of technology
   innovations mixed with customer service approaches. The customers'
   interactions with a firm are gaining proportional complexity due to the
   intercourse of human and technology interactions.
   Originality/value - This study integrates the diverging but distinct
   pathways that influence customer experience. The study is centralized on
   the theme that there is a progressive dependence of human interactions
   with technological developments. It highlights the advent of new digital
   technologies that are the catalyst for personalized customer
   experiences.}},

Title = {{The effect of industrial competition on employment A Porter's approach
   to the study of industrial clusters in Mexico}},
Journal = {{COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{410-432}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study investigates the existence of Marshall, Jacob and
   Porter's type of externalities in Mexico. We measure the impact of
   industrial specialization, competition and diversity on employment
   growth for the period 2004 to 2008.
   Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on data from 41
   highly dynamic industrial clusters originally obtained by applying
   Porter's (1998) methodology. We use a cross-section specification
   estimated via instrumental variables and two-stage least square
   estimation (2SLS) to control for endogeneity.
   Findings - On average, we find that industrial specialization exerts a
   negative impact on employment growth within states and within clusters,
   indicating that traded industries in Mexico carry very little
   innovation, operate in early stages of the life cycle, face high costs
   of employment reassignation or exhibit low adaptability. A negative
   impact of specialization on employment conforms with Jacobs (1969) type
   of externalities and confirms what other studies have found in France
   (Combes, 2000), Korea (Lee et al., 2005) and the USA (Delgado et al.,
   2014). The authors also find that competition generates more employment.
   Research limitations/implications - Industrial data at the sub-branch
   level were obtained from the Economic Census (EC) of the National
   Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI). The EC information for
   2004 was still not fully compatible with the North America Industry
   Classification System (NAICS), with 262 of the 309 data at the
   fourth-digit level aligned to the USA. In addition, industrial
   information from the EC is recorded every four years, which prevents
   this study to use panel data techniques and it makes it impossible to
   use time series methods.
   Practical implications - Policymakers can clearly identify competition
   forces having a significant impact on employment growth. This can orient
   policymakers to implement measures to encourage the development of some
   of these clusters, as well as to identify some of the sources that drive
   specialization, competition and diversity.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to the debate on the
   existence of Marshallian (MAR), Jacobian and Porter externalities. This
   is the first study using the definition of traded clusters in Mexico,
   which allows the authors to identify how specialization, competition and
   diversity forces drive the dynamics of regional employment growth.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to seek answers to questions on
   how equity of information literacy and learning outcomes have evolved
   with the ongoing advances in technologies in teaching and learning
   across schools. The authors' report on a five-year long bring your own
   device (BYOD) journey of one school, which was one of the earliest
   adopters of one-to-one learning devices in New Zealand.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a socio-cultural ecological lens for
   analysis, a longitudinal study has investigated aspects of how
   digital/information literacy, computer self-efficacy, and nature of
   technology usage are transforming school and classroom curriculum
   practices.
   Findings - Findings of this study reveal a significant shift in social
   and academic boundaries between formal and informal learning spaces.
   One-to-one learning devices provide the link between school and home, as
   students take more ownership of their learning, and teachers become
   facilitators. Curricula changes and proper technological support systems
   introduced in the school structures have given agency to students
   resulting in greater acceptance of the BYOD policy and extensions to
   learning beyond formal classroom spaces. Digital divide amongst learners
   has evolved beyond equity in access and equity in capabilities to become
   more inclusive, thereby paving the way for equity in learning outcomes.
   Research limitations/implications - This study has been conducted in a
   school which is located in a relatively high socio-economic region. To
   achieve a more holistic view, there is a need for further studies to be
   conducted in schools from low socio-economic communities.
   Originality/value - This paper adds to the existing literature by
   sharing teacher reflections on their use of innovative pedagogies to
   bring changes to classroom curricular practice.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a scientific research which is subjected to the
   hypothesis that the development of self-control through the use of
   mobile technology can be integrated in the educational process, to
   overcome the difficulties associated with learning and development of
   different competences and to support personal development and minimizing
   of habits that impede successful implementation. The analysis focuses on
   the study of the didactic potential of mobile technology for the
   development of self-control in different situations.
   The aims and objectives of the survey described in this article are
   directly related to:.
   Improving of self-control in the working environment of persons employed
   in occupations with a lot of professional stress - in the work of
   teachers, social workers, medical workers, etc.;.
   Improving the effectiveness of teaching and professional realization of
   students who are future psychologists;.
   Enhancement of well-being and life satisfaction and achieving a
   healthier life;.
   Providing online mobile digital resources for the development of
   self-control;.
   Increasing the knowledge on the possibilities for the development of
   self-control, using innovative teaching technologies.
   The end result of the conducted scientific and applied research from the
   fields of psychology, mobile technology and didactics is a package that
   contains the following elements:.
   Conceptual model of self-control;.
   Scenarios and exercises to develop self-control using mobile
   technology;.
   Audiovisual and multimedia resources for mobile devices in accordance
   with the developed scenarios and exercises for self-control
   development;.
   Tools to assess the development of self-control and tools to assess the

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the results of an educational
   innovation project that aims to analyse and organise the transversal
   competences found in the curricula designed for the Pedagogy degree
   programme. For this purpose, the situation was assessed by triangulating
   data from different educational stakeholders. The sample, therefore, was
   composed of three groups of participants: 1) professional educators who
   work outside the University of the Basque Country, 2) the Pedagogy
   degree programme's teaching staff, and 3) students in the Pedagogy
   degree programme. Following a thorough contrastive analysis of the
   information, we concluded that there are transversal competences such as
   teamwork and oral and written communication that are invariably present
   in numerous modules. However, there are other transversal competences
   that are rarely present or receive less attention, as is the case with
   creativity, digital competence, leadership, and self-directed learning
   and entrepreneurship. The differences in the amount of attention paid
   and the weight given to the various competences are a clear call to
   action: educators must redefine and organise the design of their
   curricula, along with the assessment of and the work done with
   transversal competences in the different modules of the Pedagogy degree
   programme.}},

Abstract = {{In a world characterised by globalisation, talent constraints and
   development of new digital technologies, human resource management has
   to change rapidly.
   As public administration, both at central and local level is searching
   for innovative ways to reform, it is imperative that human resource
   managers assist, survive and thrive in the new public sector.
   After the accession into the EU in 2007 and due to the economic crisis
   2008, the reform process of civil service had to be guided by a series
   of commitments assumed by Romania on the international and national
   level, involving changes of the civil service system.
   The current paper aims to present an introspective overview of how human
   resource management in the public sector has changed and continues to
   change within a complex environment in Romania since 2007.
   The paper is addressing issues concerning the changes in human resource
   management in the public sector, highlighting the challenges,
   opportunities and key successful factors.
   The paper will also emphasise the managing role of National Agency of
   Civil Servants and human resource departments from public institutions,
   the reform of civil service system in the current political and economic
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{In Romania, nearly half the population lives in rural areas, therefore
   it is difficult to associate concepts like smart cities and Internet of
   Things to the local government's priority list. Nonetheless, recently
   there have been various initiatives to increase access to information
   using ICT methods in the rural communities as well. The purpose of this
   paper is not to exhaustively measure the already adopted means, but
   simply to provide a series of items considered barriers to ICT projects
   meant to contribute to these communities' development. By researching
   the studies conducted so far (in Romania, there are about 2700 communes,
   these being the lowest administrative units), it was observed that the
   digital divide is found in 100\% of these areas. At the urban level,
   mainly in the big cities, pilot projects for developing digital literacy
   among the senior population had a relatively high success. This type of
   programs has been initiated at the level of the communes with higher
   living standards, generally the ones located near large cities. Their
   success, though surely less visible than in the cities, is notable. The
   majority of these programs have the educational and health fields as
   targets. This article aims to show these programs' implementation degree
   in Romania, providing as examples the most successful cases that help
   the social innovation process. The intention is to generate a list of
   objectives that the initiators of these programs have to take into
   consideration during the programs' preparatory process.}},

Abstract = {{Post-Snowden, several highly-publicised events and scandals have drawn
   attention to the use of people's personal data by other actors and
   agencies, both legally and illicitly. In this article, we report the
   findings of a project in which we used cultural probes to generate
   discussion about personal digital dataveillance. Our findings suggest
   the prevailing dominance of tacit assumptions about the uses and
   benefits of dataveillance as well as fears and anxieties about its
   possible misuse. Participants were able to identify a range of ways in
   which dataveillance is conducted, but were more aware of obvious
   commercial and some government actors. There was very little
   identification of the types of dataveillance that are used by national
   security and policing agencies or of illegal access by hackers and
   cybercriminals. We found that the participants recognised the value of
   both personal data and the big aggregated data sets that their own data
   may be part of, particularly for their own convenience. However, they
   expressed concern or suspicion about how these data may be used by
   others, often founded on a lack of knowledge about what happens to their
   data. The major question for our participants was where the line should
   be drawn. When does personal dataveillance become too intrusive, scary
   or creepy? What are its drawbacks and risks? Our findings suggest that
   experimenting with innovative approaches to elicit practices and
   understandings of personal digital data offers further possibilities for
   greater depth and breadth of social research with all types of social
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{Since the use of ICT in everyday life is extensively widespread, the
   uninterrupted and ubiquitous hyperconnection is mediating in much of the
   communications and meetings that shaping the life of the contemporary
   individual and has become the natural way of being in the world, leading
   to new forms of sociability. The aim of this paper is to introduce the
   concept of virtual sociability as a framework for rethinking forms of
   sociality in the digital environment. The changes that technological
   innovation has operated in social interactions affect scenarios and
   processes, transforming the relationships established between the actors
   (liquid), the way in which the subject shown itself and interacts with
   others (from flexible identities) and enabling the formation of new
   affiliation practices and social bonding (virtual communities).}},

Abstract = {{The opportunities afforded through digital and communications
   technologies, in particular social media, have inspired a diverse range
   of interdisciplinary perspectives exploring how such advancements
   influence the way we live. Rather than positioning technology as
   existing in a separate space to society more broadly, the `digital
   society' is a concept that recognises such technologies as an embedded
   part of the larger social entity and acknowledges the incorporation of
   digital technologies, media, and networks in our everyday lives (Lupton
   2014), including in crime perpetration, victimisation and justice. In
   this article, we explore potential for an interdisciplinary concept of
   digital society to expand and inspire innovative crime and justice
   scholarship within an emerging field of `digital criminology'.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of digital information technology, the key
   ability of digital literacy has become a consensus of the new era.
   Combining digital literacy with college teaching practice and innovating
   a new mode of foreign language teaching are good for cultivating more
   comprehensive high-quality talents who will be suitable for the
   information age. At present, the domestic research on the reforms of
   college foreign language teaching has already taken shape while the
   research on college foreign language teaching from the perspective of
   digital literacy is rarely. Hence, based on the connotation and
   composition framework of digital literacy, this paper analyzes the
   necessity of applying digital literacy in foreign language teaching
   reform. Finally, from the perspective of digital literacy, this paper
   puts forward the innovative mode of college foreign language teaching
   reform, with a view to providing reference for the training of Chinese
   compound foreign language talents.}},

Abstract = {{Special education is an indispensable part of the education system in
   our country. The implementation of a people-oriented national policy and
   the development of humanism, as well as the ``inclusive education{''}
   concept of widespread and rapid development, has gradually increased the
   social concern for disadvantaged groups. With the rapid development of
   computer and network technology, computer digital teaching has also
   become an important and promising new field in education. Therefore, the
   introduction of intelligent theory will promote the rapid development of
   education reform, comprehensive improvement, and an innovative teaching
   model, thus contributing to the development of special education. First,
   the current research status of the subject was investigated and
   understood. A consultation of the existing literature has led to a
   mastery of the background of the subject. Then, the theory and
   technology related to the theme were explored, analyzed, and introduced.
   A digital education system of the multiple intelligences of special
   children based on computer theory was constructed. Finally, the system
   was specifically tested to prove the characteristics, and the results
   were processed by statistical methods. The feasibility, validity, and
   effectiveness of the system were explained in detail with the specific
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The continuously growing use of digital services has provided social
   scientists with an expanding reservoir of data, potentially holding
   valuable insights into human behavior and social systems. This has often
   been associated with the terms ``big data{''} and ``computational social
   science.{''} Using such data, social scientists have argued, will enable
   us to better understand social, political, and economic life. Yet this
   new data type comes not only with promises but with challenges as well.
   These include developing standards for data collection, preparation,
   analysis, and reporting; establishing more systematic links between
   established theories within the existing body of research in the social
   sciences; and moving away from proofs-of-concepts toward the systematic
   development and testing of hypotheses. In this article, we map these
   promises and challenges in detail and introduce five highly innovative
   contributions collected in this special issue. These articles illustrate
   impressively the potential of digital trace data in the social science
   all the while remaining conscious of its pitfalls.}},

Abstract = {{The Muon g-2/EDM proposed experiment at J-PARC is a promising and
   innovative attempt at the field of Precision Physics. The sensitivity
   goal of 0.1 ppm will test the limits of our current understanding, and
   may probe for Beyond the Standard Model observations. This paper seeks
   out to investigate the computational techniques required by the
   experiment. The GEANT4 {[}1] framework was used to simulate the detector
   setup, according to the experiment's Conceptual Design Report (CDR)
   {[}2]. This allowed to observe the event hierarchy in different
   energies, generate signal hit data, and construct an event-selection
   algorithm. ROOT and GDML enabled us to use the geometry and parsed
   output data in a platform-independent way. Using techniques pertaining
   to Machine Learning and Image Feature extraction, such as the Canny Edge
   detection and the Hough Transform, we were able to construct a generic
   representation of `track families' from each event category. Finally,
   the modular GENFIT2 {[}3] framework was used to implement the Kalman
   Filter {[}4] along with an Deterministic Annealing Filter (DAF) {[}5]
   and the Runge-Kutta stepper to reconstruct tracks from a few digitized,
   smeared singular event data.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to analyze the application of information
   processing technology in university libraries in the big data era. The
   original 2D virtual environment based on text and images is gradually
   transforming into an increasingly realistic and detailed 3D virtual
   environment. Several domestic studies have reported on the construction
   of virtual libraries. After analyzing feasibility and challenges, the
   author proposes a three-step strategy for developing a virtual library:
   preparation, pilot modeling, and application. Virtual libraries have
   gained the attention of researchers in linguistics, business, medicine,
   and education; they have presented an innovative perspective in
   theoretical and practical research in these fields. Virtual libraries
   have also provided an interactive platform for situational teaching,
   experiential teaching, and multiple practical teaching forms, such as
   virtual classroom, virtual experiment, and skill training, in network
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{With the progress of information technology, social network media is
   also constantly taking innovations and changes. The promotion of public
   production news and interactive ability is promoting the integration of
   the news industry and digitization. The crowd-funding news enters the
   public view in 2013; the breakthrough of its news production mode has
   created a new perspective of the development of the news industry. The
   crowd-funding news is a kind of collective news which combines the
   intelligence with capital production; it redefines the relationship
   between the producer and the public, and has a profound impact on the
   people's consciousness and behaviors. However, in recent years, the
   development of the practice of the domestic crowd-funding news has
   suffered the official and institutional constraints, the public lack
   awareness and participation. This paper mainly analyzes that the
   domestic crow-funding news is facing difficulties, and it puts forward
   some reasonable proposals and solutions, in order to provide some
   references for the practice of Chinese crowd-funding news, and promote
   the development and perfection of Chinese crowd-funding news.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of Internet development, big data has been largely
   developed and used along with the application of cloud storage, cloud
   computing and other technology, and has demonstrated a huge commercial
   value in E-commerce. The development of big data industry makes
   substantive progress in the innovation of the form and model of
   E-commerce. In this context, this paper analyzes the current situation
   of E-commerce development, the developing trend of E-commerce, and the
   factors that restrict the development of E-commerce. This paper also
   puts forward an innovative concept that ``the enterprises should guide a
   flow from valuing the sales volume to valuing dataset, from expanding
   capital to integrating database, from entitative business model to
   digital business model, from large-scale manufacture to on-demand
   customization, and to produce more intelligent and more ecological
   products{''}. In so doing, the E-commerce development in the era of big
   data will be promoted in reform.}},

Abstract = {{Application of the computer aided design ( CAD) systems reduced duration
   of innovation cycle in the area of new motorcar development from 8-10
   years in the past to 4-6 years presently. Another consequence of the CAD
   implementation is a fact that some of simpler modifications of the car
   body shapes, i.e., the so-called facelifts, are applied already two or
   three years after the beginning of a new model production. With regard
   to a fact that the motorcar is a result of mutual cooperation between
   the designer and constructor, the designer's ideas are impressed into
   the modelling material (clay) or they are presented on paper in the form
   of sketches. The next step is already up to technicians, i.e., they have
   to transform these ideas into the real 3D data fields in order to
   prepare tools for the production of the individual motorcar parts. This
   paper describes an example of exact modelling according to the drawing
   documentation.}},

Abstract = {{Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing the way we
   work and play. Such changes are evident in the design, construction and
   operation of large construction projects. Programs such as building
   information modelling (BIM) and various other innovative digital
   technologies and engineering systems are changing the way we materialise
   all aspects of construction projects. This proliferation of ICT and
   digital technologies facilitated the adoption of various innovative
   approaches in processes and various ICT systems throughout a project
   life-cycle and across its supply chain. This has great implication on
   construction firms providing a new challenge by reconfiguring their
   resources to rise to the new challenges of large construction projects.
   ICT is changing three different aspects of large scale projects. As a
   tool during the build, i.e. BIM, for the ongoing building functionality
   i.e. BMS and lastly benefiting occupants experience. The integration of
   these three ICT aspects are forcing firms to rethink their current ICT
   management systems. Through a case study in a large scale healthcare
   project, this paper uses a case study to investigate the application of
   various innovative ICT and digital technology systems on the dynamic
   capabilities of a construction firm and across the supply chain of a
   project. The case study presented is the New Royal Adelaide Hospital
   (nRAH) in South Australia. This is a joint venture project under a
   Public Private Partnership agreement to design and construct AUS\$ 1.85b
   hospital. The case study showed that various challenging examples of
   functional complexity exists that required innovative process management
   approaches by the construction firm to withstand the test and trial of
   such a complex project, to successful completion. This has further
   contributed to the elevation of the dynamic capabilities of the
   construction firm as well as to its overall reputational assets and
   branding, nationally as well as internationally. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Innovative production methods and advanced manufacturing techniques
   slowly but certainly seem to find a way to be introduced in Architecture
   thanks to the progressive tools for computational design which enhance
   digital fabrication processes and programming. In this context Mass
   Customization refers to the possibility to evolve from already existing
   systems to the novel ones that can be personalized, without increasing
   their cost and causing the new technologies to emerge.
   Among various manufacturing techniques, Additive Manufacturing (AM) is
   considered a revolutionary technology that offers a new freedom in
   Architecture and expands the range of possibilities for design,
   production and performances of novel architectural forms, construction
   systems and materials employed. The main advantage of Additive
   Manufacturing is the quasi total freedom in organizing material
   deposition, where the matter can be placed only where structurally
   needed and in that way provide interesting scenarios in the optimization
   of construction components and new forms of printed tectonics.
   This paper will analyse an experimental case study of a 3d printed clay
   brick designed and manufactured with innovative technologies in order to
   respond to the new requirements of market and introduce new perspectives

Abstract = {{In 2015 the Government of India announced an ambitious mission to
   develop 100 smart cities throughout the rapidly urbanising country. As
   part of this mission, the Government has initiated ICT based citizen
   engagement through a dedicated website - MyGov.in. The disparity in
   digital infrastructure between different socio-economic demographics is
   a challenge for cities in emerging economies wishing to implement smart
   city policies. Our research explores the relationship between active
   civic engagement and the availability of basic digital infrastructure
   and socio-economic standards in Indian cities. This study provides
   insights on factors that lead to the success or failure of cities'

Abstract = {{Office buildings in contemporary architecture usually have a high value
   of window to wall ratio (WWR) determining transparent facade as the most
   important part of the building facade to control solar gains, thermal
   losses and visual comfort. Therefore, in order to fulfill strict
   National energy regulations and LEED requirements, facades require a
   proper balance between transparent and opaque or shaded surfaces to
   avoid overheating, optimizing daylighting aspects and outdoor
   perception. Concrete is usually used in building sector for primary
   structure or secondary structure of cladding solutions. With new
   concrete materials and innovative digital fabrication process is
   possible to rediscover concrete for high performance facade/shading
   solutions. The aim of this paper is the development of high performance
   concrete static shading system using computational design approach and
   its optimization, by genetic algorithms, based on several parameters
   such as radiation control, outdoor view and daylight indexes and energy
   performance.
   After the development of a geometry definition managed with a parametric
   modelling approach (Rhinoceros and Grasshopper), genetic algorithm
   optimization were used in order to define the openness's sizes and their
   cutting angle to minimize solar radiation entrance during year,
   maintaining outdoor view. The possible geometric alternatives were part
   of a sensitivity analysis with Radiance and Energy-plus engine to assess
   the shading system performance in terms of daylighting and energy use.
   In order to evaluate their performances a study case, a single office
   unit placed in Milan (Italy) was defined, considered with wall facing
   outdoors, having a WWR of 86\%, and five surfaces adiabatic. The results
   shows that using this approach is possible to develop an effectiveness
   shading solution able to control radiation over the year and likewise
   guarantee a high performance regarding the outdoor perception and visual
   comfort. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The current paper monitored the graduates of Payame Noor University
   (PNU) and the project has been done in the institute for open and
   distance learning. Most of the countries in the world deal with the
   issues of employment. The task is more complicated in the third world
   countries for the variety of factors, which some of them are unknown to
   the third world countries. Today, the country's macro management seek
   for scientific methods to identify and control the problematic factors
   in employment. Besides, they tend to convert challenges into
   opportunities to accelerate the development move. Universities and
   higher education institutions undertake missions such as knowledge
   production, training of specialised manpower needed by the society,
   technology development, innovation, and creativity. Nowadays, experts
   believe that sustainable development is only achieved through the
   application of modern knowledge and advanced technology. The labour
   market is one of the four markets defined in the economics that the
   presence of human factor differentiates it from other markets such as
   money market, capital market, and commodity market. Excess supply of
   manpower compared to its demand in the labour market is one of the main
   reasons of unemployment, especially youth unemployment. Thus, continuity
   of unemployment and its increasing double-digit rate over the past few
   decades in different countries reflects non-equilibrium in supply and
   demand and is a sign of structural problems of the market. In this
   research, after discussing the challenges and opportunities of higher
   education system in the employment of students, the effective factors
   are divided into two groups of internal and external factors. Finally,
   the demographic variables will be considered separately according to
   these factors. (C) AIMI Journals}},

Abstract = {{Increased accessibility of advanced technology, the targeted use of
   online learning platforms, student flexible learning expectations and
   the pressures of faculty budget constraints and priorities have called
   into question the effectiveness of traditional tertiary teaching and
   learning models. The tertiary education context must evolve at a pace
   consistent with the growing expectations and requirements of an
   innovative society. A teacher-led research project was devised to
   navigate through some of the complexities and implications associated
   with necessary pedagogical change in response to the transitioning
   digital tertiary environment. The development and implementation of
   blended learning and team teaching strategies were introduced into the
   pedagogy of a tertiary pre-service teacher education methods class. This
   paper reports on three sequential years of findings, which will explore
   student understandings of blended learning and team teaching and the
   overall impact they had on their learning in this context.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a read-in integrated circuit (RIIC) for infrared
   scene projectors, which compensates for the voltage drops in ground
   lines in order to improve the uniformity of the emitter current. A
   current output digital-to-analog converter is utilized to convert
   digital scene data into scene data currents. The unit cells in the array
   receive the scene data current and convert it into data voltage, which
   simultaneously self-adjusts to account for the voltage drop in the
   ground line in order to generate the desired emitter current
   independently of variations in the ground voltage. A 32 x 32 RIIC unit
   cell array was designed and fabricated using a 0.18-mu m CMOS process.
   The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RIIC can output a
   maximum emitter current of 150 mu A and compensate for a voltage drop in
   the ground line of up to 500 mV under a 3.3-V supply. The uniformity of
   the emitter current is significantly improved compared to that of a
   conventional RIIC.}},

Abstract = {{Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a relatively new 3D mammography
   technique that promises better detection of low contrast masses than
   conventional 2D mammography. The parameter space for DBT is large
   however and finding an optimal balance between dose and image quality
   remains challenging. Given the large number of conditions and images
   required in optimization studies, the use of human observers (HO) is
   time consuming and certainly not feasible for the tuning of all degrees
   of freedom. Our goal was to develop a model observer (MO) that could
   predict human detectability for clinically relevant details embedded
   within a newly developed structured phantom for DBT applications. DBT
   series were acquired on GE SenoClaire 3D, Giotto Class, Fujifilm AMULET
   Innovality and Philips MicroDose systems at different dose levels,
   Siemens Inspiration DBT acquisitions were reconstructed with different
   algorithms, while a larger set of DBT series was acquired on Hologic
   Dimensions system for first reproducibility testing. A channelized
   Hotelling observer (CHO) with Gabor channels was developed The
   parameters of the Gabor channels were tuned on all systems at standard
   scanning conditions and the candidate that produced the best fit for all
   systems was chosen. After tuning, the MO was applied to all systems and
   conditions. Linear regression lines between MO and HO scores were
   calculated, giving correlation coefficients between 0.87 and 0.99 for
   all tested conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, it is necessary to train professionals to address today's
   changing in the labor market and promote the competitive economy. As a
   result of using an interactive training tool, the sector's
   competitiveness as well as the staff's qualification would be improved
   through the promoting learning with Open Educational Resources (OER) and
   their access to the professional. Training the professionals will
   promote the competitive economy and will facilitate the mobility and
   professionalization of the personnel particularly in increasing sectors
   such as wind energy.
   The ICT tools are a valuable solution for the wind energy sector
   considering that wind farms are often located in remote areas and an ICT
   training tool would facilitate the staff's qualification from every
   place.
   Providing information and advices about the operational (installation
   and maintenance) skills will improve notably the qualification of the
   staff involved in the wind sector, promoting an innovative training to
   consolidate the sustainability of this sector specially now when in
   addition of new installed power a revamping of the existing wind farms
   is needed in many European countries. In parallel the tool being
   developed within this work would learn from the experience and from the
   best practices. Enhancing digital integration in training will improve
   the demands of the current market.}},

Abstract = {{With the rising concerns about global warming, climate change and the
   rapid development in the renewable energy industry, many higher
   educational institutes such as engineering and technological schools
   around the world have started to offer various educational programs
   related to sustainable energy pedagogical topics. The knowledge of
   renewable energy will be a crucial part of scientific literacy for the
   future; hence it is an absolute necessity to develop easily accessible
   and flexible-learning approaches in order to succeed in this. Due to
   various factors, today, the digital online education concept is becoming
   very popular, both as blended on-campus and as stand-alone studies.
   Moreover, the traditional teacher driven education system is being also
   challenged and new student oriented teaching approaches are currently
   being identified and practiced by various educational experts. This
   paper discusses a case study developed by applying the learner-centered
   teaching concept and implemented as part of an online learning course
   offered for one month (14 hours of learning time was recommended per
   week) focusing on renewable energy technology innovations for five
   student groups in three countries. The methodology section of this paper
   discuss the application of aligned teaching methodology for designing
   and constructing the course, content deployment of an existing learning
   management tool and the implementation and course evaluation. Finally,
   the assessments were graded and results were analyzed to identify
   success of the new educational concept applied A survey questionnaire
   was also prepared to receive the thoughts about online learning courses
   and their experience with the online course performed From an overall
   point of view, the evaluation and the results exemplify the success and
   the acceptance of the offered online course by the participants
   providing good average grading and positive opinions of the method of
   implementation. Participants also expressed their greater enthusiasm and
   interest of participating in such online courses for renewable energy
   engineering, as many of the topics offered through the course are
   lacking in their existing or past study curriculums.}},

Abstract = {{While there is growing recognition of the need to support young learners
   as they develop computational thinking (CT) skills, this paper advocates
   for an increased focus on computational identity (CI) and digital
   empowerment (DE) in particular, as we posit that these CT skills will
   help young learners become self-motivated, innovative creators. When
   nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to
   provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development
   tools. This paper advances two key approaches to address these issues:
   1) A critical computational literacy approach to engage youth in
   developing personally meaningful applications that have impact in the
   real world; 2) the use of a tool, like MIT App Inventor, that lowers
   barriers to creating useful, impactful technology. Using two case-based
   studies, we show how these two approaches have supported youth in
   developing applications that respond to meaningful challenges in their
   communities and helped them to establish their computational identities
   and digital empowerment.}},

   materials to be used in the digital portal imaging systems in the
   radiotherapy applications is to research the GOS material production
   that has been activated with the rare earth elements (RE), to produce
   the scintillation detectors that have a rapid imaging process with a
   lesser radiation and higher image quality from these materials and to
   apply the radiographic imaging systems. The GOS: Tb3+ showed high
   emission peak and high x-ray absorption properties which have been
   determined for application to mammography and dental radiography. In
   this study, Gd2O2SO4: Tb3+ phosphors were fabricated by the sol-gel
   method that is a unique technique and not previously applied. Besides,
   the structural characterization of GOS: Tb3+ has been investigated. The
   strongest emission peak located at 549 nm under 312 nm UV light
   excitation was appeared on the GOS: Tb3+ phosphor particles. The

Abstract = {{Mobile devices have been the driving force behind some of the most
   important semiconductor innovations in the past decade. In fact,
   iPhone's 10 year anniversary is coming up in June 2017. Machine
   intelligence and digital photography will continue to be main
   differentiating features that influence consumers' purchasing choice of
   mobile devices. It is also known that the rate of scaling (Moore's law)
   has been slowing down since 20nm process nodes were introduced for both
   logic CMOS and memory (DRAM, flash) processes. Memory and thermal
   constraints have been the main bottlenecks for users' perceived
   performance. Here we look at the memory architecture in consumer
   devices, such as Chromebooks and Pixel phones. We start from high-level
   use cases, such as interfacing with Google's personal assistant ({''}OK
   Google{''}), taking high dynamic range (HDR) pictures or recording 4K
   videos ({''}camera app{''}). We then dive into full-system architecture
   simulation, performance and power analysis. Finally, we discuss a few
   future research areas in architecture and technology.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter analyses the extent to which the rights to health and food
   under the crc can guide the restriction of marketing of high fat, salt
   or sugar (HFSS) foods to children. HFSS food marketing is considered
   problematic as it is a contributory factor to increasingly high levels
   of obesity in Europe and beyond. Recent advances in digital technology
   raise new challenges, calling for an innovative approach, with
   experiences in the EU, including the UK and Sweden, highlighting the
   complexity of regulation. The author analyses the approach of the crc
   Committee, the Special Rapporteurs on the Right to Food and Health, the
   who and civil society with a view to establishing a `child rights'
   approach to HFSS marketing. In light of the neglect of this issue and
   the crc Committee's unique position, it is recommended that the
   Committee take an active role in emphasising hfss marketing as a rights
   concern that is contrary to the child's rights to health and food, and
   best interests. Framing freedom from hfss marketing as a right has the
   potential to transform this public health issue into a legal
   responsibility that requires action from States Parties.}},

Abstract = {{Despite progress with the food-associated health agenda in the public
   health and clinical domains, much remains to be done in Indonesia. There
   are reasons to be optimistic which include economic development,
   increasing literacy, progress towards universal health coverage and
   community organizational arrangements across the archipelago which focus
   on health through some 10,000 puskesmas. These community health centres
   are variably staffed with voluntary cadres from the community, bidans
   (nurses) and general medical practitioners. For more effective
   prevention and management of nutritionally-related health problems,
   innovative community and clinical nutrition research and expertise is
   required. With rapid urbanisation, the growth of the digital economy,
   increasing socio-economic inequity and climate change, there are
   imperatives for ecologically sustainable, non employment dependent
   livelihoods which provide energy, food, water, education and health care
   security. A relevant health care workforce will include those who
   research and practice clinical nutrition. Here we gather together an
   account of an extensive body of published and emerging literature which
   makes a case collectively for a more ecological approach to nutrition
   and health and how it might revitalise the Indonesian and other health
   care systems.}},

Abstract = {{Digitization of buildings requires the systematic handling of a variety
   and volumes of data. It is a common vision to aim for coordinated
   homogenization of data structures, enabled by the classification of
   information. This paper studies the role of building information
   standards for classification in digitization of the building life cycle.
   It draws on science and technology studies of information technology
   standards, big data and building information modelling (BIM) in building
   research. The approach is based on performativity of standards for
   information systems, viewing performativity as potentially non-linear
   and multiple. The five-year design process of a large hospital in
   Denmark is examined as episodes of performance of the building
   information standard, particularly one recent standard, the Cuneco
   Classification System (CCS). The study shows that despite client
   demands, several building information standards are active over time: an
   expansive' design brief process adds user demands and uses room
   classification. Another process diminishes the design brief more than
   50\%, with several standards in use. The client's facilities management
   system, which performs the structuring of data backwards' into the
   design process, makes architects and engineers (but not contractors) use
   CCS. This fragmentation of performing standards is denoted multiple
   performativities' and includes temporal and compartmental
   performativity.}},

Journal = {{BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION}},

Pages = {{665-680}},
Abstract = {{The digital integration of built-environment practices aims to bridge a
   large variety of organizations to improve building delivery and
   operation. However, recent research on building information modelling
   (BIM) reported organizational challenges arising from digital
   integration. This suggests a need to develop a critical perspective on
   digital-integration-driven organizational change. Adopting a
   practice-based approach, this paper exposes the practice-level
   phenomenon responsible for the ongoing change to develop a critical
   understanding and enable better interventions. The concepts of
   simplification' and systematization' of digital integration are
   developed from previous literature and then used to explore and
   interrelate the practice-level experiences of digital integration (i.e.
   the experience of the change from within) and the emerging patterns of
   interactions (i.e. the picture of the change from outside) in a
   BIM-enabled design project. The concept of ordering in disguise' is
   proposed to capture this phenomenon. It shows that practitioners
   experience digital integration as various task-specific instances of
   unresponsive technology. However, they are unaware that their ongoing
   efforts to accommodate it actually further reinforce digital
   integration's simplification and systematization. This makes the
   unresponsiveness of technology harder to challenge, and ultimately
   forces the organization to change and adapt to it. Implications for
   management of practice are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{The need for technological and administrative innovation is a recurrent
   theme in the UK construction-reform agenda, but generic improvement
   recipes are beginning to give way to a more focused prescription:
   building information modelling (BIM). The current strategy is to mandate
   the use of BIM for government projects as a way of integrating the
   design, construction and operation of publicly procured buildings. This
   aspiration represents a partial turn away from a focus on managerialist
   agendas towards a belief in the power of digital practices to achieve
   the aspiration of integrated working, collaboration and innovation, a
   trend that is being reflected globally in relation to both national and
   firm-level policy interventions. This paper subjects this so-called BIM
   revolution' to critical scrutiny. By drawing on theories of the digital
   divide, a critical discourse is developed around the ways in which
   political reform agendas centred on BIM might not stimulate innovation
   on a wider scale, but could act to disenfranchise small firms that are
   unable (or unwilling) to engage with them. This critical analysis
   presents important new research questions around the technocratic
   optimism that pervades the current reform discourse, the trajectory of
   industry development that it creates and the policy process itself.}},

   the offered method in the form of a security index, reflects the actual
   situation in the checked object and gives the chance to estimate
   influence of dangerous production factors. This approach to assessment
   will allow reacting quickly to the processes taking place in the

Title = {{Enhancing Health Risk Prediction with Deep Learning on Big Data and
   Revised Fusion Node Paradigm}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{With recent advances in health systems, the amount of health data is
   expanding rapidly in various formats. This data originates from many new
   sources including digital records, mobile devices, and wearable health
   devices. Big health data offers more opportunities for health data
   analysis and enhancement of health services via innovative approaches.
   The objective of this research is to develop a framework to enhance
   health prediction with the revised fusion node and deep learning
   paradigms. Fusion node is an information fusion model for constructing
   prediction systems. Deep learning involves the complex application of
   machine-learning algorithms, such as Bayesian fusions and neural
   network, for data extraction and logical inference. Deep learning,
   combined with information fusion paradigms, can be utilized to provide
   more comprehensive and reliable predictions from big health data. Based
   on the proposed framework, an experimental system is developed as an
   illustration for the framework implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the use of mobile devices in tandem with television is a
   common place for media consumers. The main motive behind this behavior
   is the never-ending human desire for connection, interaction, and
   communication. They alternate between different media ``broadcasting{''}
   devices to enhance their content viewing experiences and enrich their
   social interactions. Social media and video viewing media are some of
   the main platforms users employ for sharing and expressing, stating
   their opinion and posting. The purpose of this essay is to shed light to
   the needs that lead users to be always connected to social media and
   explain how the theory of planned behavior applies to our expectation
   for their actions. Moreover, as surveys bear out that internet users
   multitask, we are giving from our working experience an innovative path
   for using media in a creative way and of course vent for further
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The Oulu EduLAB is a permanent and innovative EdTech (education
   technology industry) pre-incubator and incubator higher education
   training program based at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences in
   Finland. The curriculum of the Oulu EduLAB is based on the LAB studio
   model (Heikkinen and Stevenson, 2016) which can be characterized as a
   project-based and problem-based training program with entrepreneurship
   at its core. With its first full cohort enrolled in January 2016, this
   program has become a hub for digital prototyping in the education sector
   in Finland. Three key factors make the Oulu EduLAB unique. Firstly, it
   is a full-time program that allows students from any degree program to
   complete their studies in a project-based format and create startups at
   the same time. Secondly, it is interdisciplinary in nature which brings
   together participants from fields such as information
   systems/programming, graphic design, business and education. And
   thirdly, the program is offered in English which means that participants
   are drawn from around the world. The Oulu EduLAB is part of a larger
   series of incubator programs at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences
   called Oamk LABs (www.oamklabs.fi). This paper highlights the Oulu
   EduLAB as a case study and provides an overview of the structures and
   content of the program. Based on the on-going expansion of this program
   both in Finland and internationally, it represents an innovative model
   that is relevant both for practitioners interested in redesigning higher
   education programs, and for academics interested in interdisciplinary
   models of entrepreneurship education.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of lecturers are experimenting with innovative
   computer-mediated approaches to foreign languages teaching (FLT),
   dramatically altering the ways students interact with learning content.
   This comparatively common acceptance of digital learning technologies
   has enlarged the integration of multimedia teaching and learning tools
   into the traditional, face-to-face classroom setting, thus blended
   approach to content supply in FLT has experienced extensive progress in
   higher education. The article deals with the practice of usage of the
   most popular multimedia technological tools, such as Prezi, Google
   Slides, PowerPoint, in foreign languages teaching at higher educational
   institutions. In the course of research surveys were made to determine
   the types of collaboration and evaluation preferred by the students,
   their expectations from foreign language learning process, which, in
   their turn, gave grounds to point out the factors promoting
   intensification of the teaching process in the context of blended

Abstract = {{In the context of the new economy, organizations are forced to learn and
   to reinvent themselves in order to become more competitive. Don Tapscott
   (2015, p. 17) states that the new economy is characterized by the use of
   exclusively digital information and it represents ``a knowledge economy
   based on the application of human know-how to everything we produce and
   how we produce it{''}. Thus, new economy means the digitalization of
   companies on a structural level: human resources management, R\&D,
   marketing, IT security, e-management and e-business integrative models.
   This implies a new shift in the organizational design, rethinking of
   operational processes, m-marketing strategies, digital competencies,
   analytical and mobile technologies. Florina Pinzaru (2016, p. 27)
   indicates that, we must acknowledge that we are now at the crossroads
   and that managers should think of the mutations that we start to face as
   the world rushes to become digitally interconnected{''}. Our research is
   based upon the following fundamental question: the Romanian business
   environment is ready for this type of digital maturity and what are the
   main challenges that it faces at this point? In order to answer these
   questions, we used a double approach: on the one hand, we used content
   analysis based upon the articles from Romanian business newspapers
   (Capital, Financial Magazine, BIZ Magazine); on the other hand, a
   qualitative approach, through the interviews with various managers in
   order to see if the Romanian business environment is ready for this type
   of digital maturity and what are the main challenges that is facing at
   this point. Despite this positive trends, we noticed major disruption
   between industries concerning investments in IT \& research and
   development. When it comes to embracing new business models focused on
   driving innovation through sharing knowledge and information,
   multinationals from Romania follow the global strategy, whereas Romanian
   companies lack collaboration with local hubs or platforms for developing
   new ideas and products.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in digital technologies - 1) mobile technology, 2)
   cloud computing, 3) big data, 4) social media, and 5) the Internet of
   Things - show that these so-called BIG Five technologies are
   increasingly transforming organizations by enabling business innovation.
   This paper aims to explore if these technologies are used strategically
   by these organizations. The novelty of this paper is in providing an
   understanding of the interplay of the five digital technologies and
   their potential to enable business innovation (i.e. process innovation,
   product/service innovation, and business model innovation) by using
   examples from industry (as found in our literature review). A structured
   literature study is performed for the big five technologies individually
   and in relation to digital strategy. The theoretical contribution is a
   three level e-leadership model directed to customer orientation. As a
   practical contribution we show seven cases analysed by four independent
   research assistants in which social media strategies overall score high
   on a Likert scale and big data scores high in some cases but low in
   other cases. The combined mobile, cloud and Internet of things
   technologies show overall an above average score. The third contribution
   confirms recent literature that big five technology implementations are
   still too much process oriented. In only two cases a shift toward
   product orientation was found.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the digital publishing industry of China has rapidly
   developed. The construction of the digital publishing base is the
   important mode of developing the digital publishing industry advocated
   by the government. By now, 14 national digital publishing bases have
   been completed in China and the relevant digital publishing industrial
   cluster has been basically established. Some measures such as building
   of the collaborative mechanism to promote cooperation, attaching
   importance to the scientific and technological innovation and
   strengthening of the interdisciplinary talent training, etc. are
   presented to deal with some problems in the development of the bases
   such as low relevance and cooperative level, lack of scientific and
   technological innovation and lack of the interdisciplinary talents of
   the digital publishing industry, etc.}},

Title = {{Organizational adoption of digital information and technology: a
   theoretical review}},
Journal = {{BOTTOM LINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{33-46}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to review previous studies on how
   organizations, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), adopt
   digital information and technology, especially on the drivers and the
   outcomes of the adoption itself.
   Design/methodology/approach - The present study follows a literature
   review design. Previous studies that examine SMEs' digital information
   and technology adoption are taken into account in building the
   conclusion.
   Findings - The review reveals that digital information and technology
   that is used for marketing-related position allows SMEs to be more
   competitive. In general, there are three main theories that have been
   used to understand the adoption process (i.e. diffusion of innovation
   theory, technology-organization-environment framework and institutional
   theory). These theories should be used in conjunction with each other to
   better explain the adoption process. Additionally, there are three
   characteristics (i.e. innovation, firm and environmental) that are
   related to the risks and barriers of the adoption process.
   Originality/value - This theoretical review is among the few that put
   forward the findings reported in research articles on the digital
   information and technology adoption process within SMEs. Moreover, this
   paper summarizes the issues (i.e. drivers, outcomes, risks and barriers)
   related to the adoption process.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyzes new forms of professional organizations. Those
   professionals select and manage street equipment in Paris. In connection
   with recent technical innovations within the field of street equipment
   (such as digital street equipment or reversible street equipment), the
   classical and normative process that aims to implant those pieces of
   equipment in Paris is quite destabilized. New professional figures with
   various skills have to work and collaborate with the municipal services
   of Paris. These, in return, have to learn doing with those
   professionals. Territorial skills and expertise face various skills
   embodied by professionals, sometimes far from urbanism, but less
   constrained in their practice. Finally, this article shows that
   professional practices are not so fluctuating but that they need to be
   analyzed through organizational transformations.}},

Title = {{Digitalization of learning resources in a HEI - a lean management
   perspective}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{680-694}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Lean is considered as a major management approach for
   improving operational productivity and organizational performance. It is
   a systemic philosophy that emphasizes on fulfilling customer needs,
   waste minimization, and a commitment to a culture of continual
   improvement. In recent years, many higher education institutions (HEIs)
   have leveraged on the use of technology to provide flexibility in
   learning and just-in-time training for learners in the efforts to
   improve both the internal processes of course delivery and enhance the
   provisions of education quality. In recognizing these trends in HEIs,
   the purpose of this paper is to identify the key factors that facilitate
   the conversion of printed learning resources to e-learning resources in
   a HEI.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a qualitative exploratory
   case study approach and examined a unique case of a HEI that is
   undergoing the transformation process from printed learning resources to
   digital sources to simplify the processes involved in educational
   service delivery and operational complexity. Data sources include
   semi-structured interviews with key personnel directly involved in the
   project of converting printed learning resources to digital sources,
   notes taken from informal discussions, and secondary data such as
   minutes of meetings, learning resource archives, and relevant
   literature. A retrospective perspective was adopted in the case analysis
   since the HEI has already completed 50 percent of the conversion phase
   when this study was carried out.
   Findings - Abductive reasoning approach and well-established lean
   principles were used to make sense of the digital transformation process
   of the HEI. Based on the retrospective case analysis, the authors found
   evidence that characterizes lean management principles and identifies
   the critical factors (CFs) that have facilitated the HEI to achieve the
   key milestones in the conversion journey. These include common vision,
   top management support and leadership, timely information sharing, and
   relationship management with key stakeholders in the transformation
   processes.
   Research limitations/implications - Since this research is an
   exploratory case study, the results obtained cannot be generalized.
   Future research can be conducted to provide an impact analysis of the
   potential risk factors of a system that employs only the use of e-study
   materials. In addition, future studies can also assess the quality of
   the learning services that is supported by the e-resources by gathering
   student feedback on their e-learning experience that is supported by the
   online digital learning resources and learning management system.
   Practical implications - This study provides managerial insights into
   the levers to engender the transformation from a traditional print
   learning resources model to leaning with digital e-learning resources.
   The insights into the CFs aid education managers to introduce process
   innovations and encourage behavioral changes that will benefit learners,
   instructors, and administers.
   Originality/value - The study is one of the first to apply lean
   management principles in making sense of the transformation processes
   involved in the use of digital innovation in higher education context.
   The findings provide a holistic view of the process transformations.}},

Title = {{All that is solid melts into air: the servicescape in digital service
   space}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{226-235}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The emergence of new social media is shifting the market place
   for business towards virtual market space. In the light of the emerging
   digital space for new forms of marketing, the traditional servicescape
   concept is critically examined. This paper aims to show why servicescape
   concepts and attitudes need to be adapted for digital media.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, the authors explain how the
   traditional servicescape concept adds meaning to a service provider's
   value-proposition by modifying customer expectations and customer
   experience. Second, recognising that the environment for service is no
   longer bound to a physical place, the authors discuss the implications
   of the epistemic shift involved.
   Findings - The authors' examination shows that digital service space
   challenges traditional concepts about what constitutes a customer
   experience and derived value. The authors conceptually ``zoom out{''}
   into a virtual service eco-system and show with exemplar examples why
   the servicescape in digital space is more socially embedded and
   necessarily more fluid in its time-space design. In the more advanced
   sites, interactions between various artificial bodies (avatars) are
   co-created by controlling off-line participant-actors; yet, these
   participant-actors remain strangers to each other at an off-line level.
   This is entirely a new and radical development of old times.
   Research limitations/implications - The research findings are based on
   scholarly research of the relevant literature, from practitioner
   reports, and evidence emerging from the examination of many digital
   web-sites. It has not been the authors' intention to objectively
   represent current servicescape functionalities but more to indicate the
   major directions of change with exemplar examples. The future cannot be
   predicted, but their interpretive conclusions suggest major challenges
   in service marketing and management logic ahead. New forms of digital
   servicescape are still being created as technology and service
   imagination enables, so further research interest in virtual
   atmospherics can be expected.
   Practical implications - Social media platforms are enabling
   organisations to learn more about their customers and also to engage
   them more. In these changing times, bricks and mortar stores would be
   well advised to review their servicescape presence to allow and
   encourage engagement with the more involved consumers. And, by
   integrating their digital space into their physical place, bricks and
   mortar stores might take on more relationship oriented processlike
   characteristics, both in the digital space and in their physical places,
   with developments on one platform leading to possible service
   innovations on the other.
   Social implications - The digital era is changing consumer behaviour.
   Service managers need to take into account that many customers are
   already equally as engaged with digital-space social networks as they
   once were with bricks and mortar stores. The more time consumers as
   participant-actors spend in social networks, the decision on what and
   where to buy is decided by interactions with friends and other
   influencers.
   Originality/value - New forms of digital servicescape are being created
   as technology and service imagination enables. Further scholarly
   research interest in virtual atmospherics can be expected, impacting on
   the authors' sense of place, and self-identity.}},

Title = {{Dynamic cataloguing of the old Arabic manuscripts by automatic
   extraction of metadata}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{251-270}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to obtain online access to the
   digitised Arabic manuscripts images, which need to use a catalogue. The
   bibliographic cataloguing is unsuitable for old Arabic manuscripts, and
   it is imperative to establish a new cataloguing model. In the research,
   the authors propose a new cataloguing model based on manuscript
   annotations and transcriptions. This model can be an effective solution
   to dynamic catalogue old Arabic manuscripts. In this field, the authors
   used the automatic extraction of the metadata that is based on the
   structural similarity of the documents.
   Design/methodology/approach - This work is based on experimental
   methodology. The whole proposed concepts and formulas were tested for
   validation. This, allows the authors to make concise conclusions.
   Findings - Cataloguing old Arabic manuscripts faces problem of
   unavailability of information. However, this information may be found in
   another place in a copy of the original manuscript. Thus, cataloguing
   Arabic manuscript cannot be done in one time, it is a continual process
   which require information updating. The idea is to make a
   pre-cataloguing of a manuscript, then try to complete and improve it
   through a specific platform. Consequently, in the research work, the
   authors propose a new cataloguing model, which the authors call
   ``Dynamic cataloguing{''}.
   Research limitations/implications - The success of the proposed model is
   confronted with the involvement of all actors of the model. It is based
   on the conviction and the motivation of actors of the collaborative
   platform.
   Practical implications - The model can be used in several cataloguing
   fields, where the encoding model is based on XML. The model is
   innovative and implements a smart cataloguing model. The model is useful
   by using a web platform. It allows an automatic update of a catalogue.
   Social implications - The model prompts the user to participate and
   enrich the catalogue. The user could improve his social status from a
   passive to an active.
   Originality/value - The dynamic cataloguing model is a new concept. It
   has never been proposed in the literature until now. The proposed
   cataloguing model is based on automatic extraction of metadata from user
   annotations/transcription. It is a smart system which automatically
   updates or fills the catalogue with the extracted metadata.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of a new educational paradigma has led to the revision of
   the elements that have traditionally participated in the learning
   process. The emergence of Information and Comunication Technologies has
   eased the access to new types of educational materials that are causing
   a global revision of the contents' production and methodologies to
   implement in the classroom. The publishing world and the leaders of the
   different educational levels have to face the challenge of given an
   answer to this process of change. This is currently a debate in many
   schools. The aim of this study is to analyse school leaders' perception
   of the digital content, their more relevant features and their impact in
   the educational world in the short and middle term. It is usually the
   leaders of the schools who make decisions in relation to the training
   plans aimed at technical and methodological improvement. To do this, the
   study is based on a methodological descriptive design backed by a
   survey. Among the conclusions we highlight the need for adaptability of
   digital contents to different contexts and the requirement of teachers'
   training in the pedagogical use of ICT through a solid and sustained
   formation programme as a strategy to implement this innovation in a
   larger methodological framework.}},

Abstract = {{The globalization has meant a change in styles of communicative

   of Japan and Norway}},
Journal = {{TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT- PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{286-303}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The paper aims to add knowledge on the status of the welfare
   technology field. Politicians in mature economies expect welfare
   technologies - especially digital technologies - to contribute to
   bridging the gap between an increasing number of elderly and a shrinking
   work force. Theoretically, the paper deals with welfare technologies in
   a digital infrastructure perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach - A multilevel and comparative study was
   conducted to understand the interplay of high-level policies and
   implementation projects and highlight key issues through comparative
   analysis of different national approaches. Japan and Norway were the
   chosen countries because they are both in the forefront in the use of
   welfare technologies.
   Findings - Findings reveal similarities between the two countries, which
   are echoed in many other countries: although government expectations are
   high, the field of welfare technology is still in its infancy and only
   rather simple solutions (such as safety alarms) are widely used. Key
   differences in innovation strategies for welfare technology in the two
   countries are highlighted, where Japan seem to be aiming for a vertical
   integration through large corporations' solutions, whereas Norway aims
   for a more open innovation arena through standardization.
   Originality/value - From a practical point of view, the two countries
   have something to learn from each other, but, in particular, both
   countries are recommended - together with other similar countries - a
   more platform-oriented approach. Theoretically, it is shown that a
   successful implementation of welfare technologies should adopt a digital
   infrastructure approach and exploit the generative mechanisms of this
   approach.}},

Title = {{Innovation and ICT use by firms and households in the EU A multivariate
   analysis of regional disparities}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{424-448}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the existence of
   patterns that combine innovation and information and communication
   technologies (ICT) use, and the factors explaining them in the European
   Union.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors use data for firms and
   households at the regional level in the EU-27. Factorial and cluster
   analyses are used to the determine combined patterns for both dimensions
   and to elaborate a taxonomy of the European regions, respectively.
   Finally, the multiple discriminant analysis serves to identify the
   factors that characterize the patterns detected.
   Findings - The results show the existence of three regional clusters
   that capture different combinations of patenting and ICT use. Research
   and development (R\&D) expenditure in the business sector, government
   quality, gross domestic product per capita, the number of researchers,
   and employment by the highest level of education attained are the key
   variables explaining the disparities in innovation and ICT use in the
   European regions.
   Research limitations/implications - The conclusions point to the key
   role played by business R\&D and knowledge resources within an
   institutional framework that facilitates actions oriented to benefiting
   regions through both knowledge creation and knowledge diffusion derived
   from the combined activities of innovation and ICT use.
   Originality/value - The paper provides for the first time a
   characterization of the European regions that jointly considers
   innovation and ICT use. It also contributes to the literature by
   exploring differences in ICT use by households and firms, and the
   factors explaining them. The study can provide new insights into the
   design of public policies that may consider the common factors that
   explain combinations of innovation and technology use.}},

Pages = {{503-519}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Chronic consumption practice has been greatly accelerated by
   mobile, interactive and smartphone gaming technology devices. The
   purpose of this paper is to explore how chronic consumption of
   smartphone gaming produces positive coping practice.
   Design/methodology/approach - Underpinned by cognitive framing theory,
   empirical insights from 11 focus groups ( n = 62) reveal how smartphone
   gaming enhances positive coping amongst gamers and non-gamers.
   Findings - The findings reveal how the chronic consumption of games
   allows technology to act with privileged agency that resolves tensions
   between individuals and collectives. Consumption narratives of
   smartphone games, even when play is limited, lead to the identification
   of three cognitive frames through which positive coping processes
   operate: the market-generated, social being and citizen frames.
   Research limitations/implications This paper adds to previous research
   by providing an understanding of positive coping practice in the
   smartphone chronic gaming consumption.
   Originality/value - In smartphone chronic gaming consumption, cognitive
   frames enable positive coping by fostering appraisal capacities in which
   individuals confront hegemony, culture and alterity-morality concerns.}},

Abstract = {{A galvanometer laser beam scanning system is an essential element in
   many laser additive manufacturing (LAM) technologies including
   Stereolithography (SLA), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and Selective
   Laser Melting (SLM). Understanding the laser beam scanning techniques
   and recent innovations in this field will greatly benefit the 3D laser
   printing system integration and technology advance. One of the
   challenges to achieve high quality 3D printed parts is due to the
   non-uniform laser power density delivered on the materials caused by the
   acceleration and deceleration movements of the galvanometer at ends of
   the hatching and outlining patterns. One way to solve this problem is to
   modulate the laser power as the function of the scanning speed during
   the acceleration or deceleration periods. Another strategy is to
   maintain the constant scanning speed while accurately coordinating the
   laser on and off operation throughout the job. In this paper, we
   demonstrate the high speed, high accuracy and low drift digital scanning
   technology that incorporates both techniques to achieve uniform laser
   density with minimal additional process development. With the constant
   scanning speed method, the scanner not only delivers high quality and
   uniform results, but also a throughput increase of 23\% on a typical LAM
   job, compared to that of the conventional control method that requires
   galvanometer acceleration and deceleration movements.}},

Abstract = {{The need for expert teachers and innovation in teaching and learning
   practices remains the most important requirement of the current
   education innovation. Education should step toward creative and
   technical teaching/learning practice. Application of innovative and
   advance education is the foremost requirement of today's generation.
   This paper proposes a quality empowerment framework to develop the
   concept of capacity building (CB) and innovative practice (IP)
   programmes. CB serves to train teachers, enable school administrators,
   and develop experts in the field of education. Well-trained teachers
   deliver advance education, create child-friendly environments in the
   classroom, and apply innovative methods in teaching. IPs bring expansion
   in the education innovation, use technology-based approaches in teaching
   and learning, and help students deal with modern technological world.
   The research model proposes to notify implication of CB and IP
   programmes in education, resulting creative, technical, and innovative
   teaching and learning practices in education. Purposed two factors CB
   and IP lead to capacitate education stakeholders and implicate
   creational and methodical practice in education system. Finally,
   implication of CB and IP in education brings innovative and creative
   change in teaching/learning practice, produce educational experts,
   create smart students, and apply innovation in education practices.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH COMMUNICATION}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1093-1103}},
Abstract = {{Public health efforts focused on Latina youth sexuality are most
   commonly framed by the syndemic of teen pregnancy and sexually
   transmitted infections, a narrow and often heteronormative focus that
   perpetuates silences that contribute to health inequities and overlooks
   the growing need for increased education, awareness, and support for
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. This
   article presents findings from the project Let's Talk About Sex: Digital
   Storytelling for Puerto Rican Latina Youth, which used a culturally
   centered, narrative-based approach for analyzing participants' own
   specifications of sexual values and practices. The strength of digital
   storytelling lies in its utility as an innovative tool for
   community-based and culturally situated research, as well as in its
   capacity to open up new spaces for health communication. Here we present
   two coming out case studies to illustrate the value of digital
   storytelling in supporting the development of meaningful and culturally
   relevant health promotion efforts for LGBTQ-identified Puerto Rican
   Latina youth across the life span.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports on a study conducted in rural areas in order to
   understand the perceptions of the participants on the implementation of
   two technological resources in educational institutions for skills
   development in the agricultural sector: Social Networks and Digital
   Library. The research was carried out by applying the mixed method in a
   parallel convergent design, using three instruments: characterization
   survey, focus group interview, and satisfaction survey. The experiment
   was undertaken in three institutions located in the Department of
   Cundinamarca, Colombia and 63 students between 14 and 17 years of age
   from 10th grade participated. The results allowed to establish three
   criteria which influence innovation processes when technological tools
   are used. The first criterion relates to labor skills which generate
   opportunities, roots and sense of belonging of students regarding their
   regions and location as well as better quality of life. The second
   criterion was established with respect to how elicit student
   interaction-the topics used should be relevant to students. The third
   criterion relates to the improvement of the technological means, since
   connectivity shortcomings limit the use of technological resources. The
   study concludes that it is necessary to adapt the educational process to
   the conditions and context of students.}},

Abstract = {{Chairside computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)
   technology requires an effective technical basis to obtain dental
   restorations with optimal marginal accuracy, esthetics, and longevity in
   as short a timeframe as possible. This article describes a compact,
   5-axis milling machine based on an innovative milling technology (5XT
   five-axis turn-milling technique), which is capable of achieving
   high-precision milling results within a very short processing time.
   Furthermore, the device's compact dimensioning and state-of-the-art mode
   of operation facilitate its use in the dental office. This model is also
   an option to be considered for use in smaller dental laboratories,
   especially as the open input format enables it to be quickly and simply
   integrated into digital processing systems already in use. The
   possibility of using ceramic and polymer materials with varying
   properties enables the manufacture of restorations covering all
   conceivable indications in the field of fixed dental prosthetics.}},

Abstract = {{A new paradigm of digital projection is on the horizon, based on
   innovative emissive screen that are made fully transparent. It can be
   readily applied and convert any surface to a high image quality emissive
   digital display, without affecting the surface appearance. For example,
   it can convert any glass window or windshield to completely see-through
   display, with unlimited field of view and viewing angles. It also
   enables a scalable and economic projection display on a pitch-black
   emissive screen with black level and image contrast that rivals other
   emissive displays such as plasma display or OLED.}},

Journal = {{LIGHT \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{79-87}},
Abstract = {{Examples of use of solar (natural) light as a factor of forming dynamic
   (kinetic) architecture are considered. These examples show that use of
   natural light is popular, and methods of its use and embodiment are
   widespread. It is noted that kinetic orientation is put forward by many
   design proposals through the use of natural illumination both when
   building rotation, and when modifying the configuration of architectural
   objects or their facade structures, thus changing their natural light
   consumption mode. It is a recognized fact that with the development of
   new original solutions using kinetic methods based on natural
   illumination requires reconsidering approaches to the formation of
   building facades. Modern digital technologies and innovations for
   collecting and adjusting natural light become important. In particular,
   this concerns a complex integrated ecological system of automatic
   control and self-control, which is used to increase comfort, to decrease
   costs and reduce energy consumption.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{1552-1568}},
Abstract = {{By changing the relations of production and exhibition, networked
   Internet (digital, peer-to-peer) distribution offers ways to experiment
   with representations different from legacy (linear, one-to-many) network
   distribution. To advance a theory of value in representation, I founded
   the platform Open TVbeta to develop queer, intersectional television in
   Chicago and online. I present a framework for assessing representational
   value through case studies of producing and exhibiting three local,
   queer, artist-driven pilots in Chicago. I argue that small-scale
   development processes restructure the politics of representation in
   television and art, allowing us to see value and innovation where it has
   historically been hidden in performances of cultures, organizations, and
   technologies of exhibition.}},

Title = {{Creative Appropriations in Hybrid Spaces: Mobile Interfaces in Art and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{1705-1728}},
Abstract = {{Research on the use of mobile technology in developing countries often
   highlights how they serve as strategies to bridge the digital divide and
   foster economic development. However, mobile technology appropriation in
   the Global South is not limited to these cases, as evidenced by Brazil's
   well-established media arts community, which has embraced mobiles as
   interfaces for art making since the early 2000s. Based on fourteen
   in-depth interviews with mobile communication researchers and media
   artists in Brazil between 2011 and 2013, this article investigates the
   creative appropriation of mobile technologies in the production of
   hybrid spaces. Our results reveal that these creative appropriations,
   namely mobile art and locative art, can be described through four main
   nodes of articulation: motivations, creative processes, sponsorship, and
   promotion. The experimental nature of these projects invites us to look
   at the Brazilian media art scene as a materialization of a circuit of
   innovative mobile culture and as an indication that investigations about
   technological appropriation in the Global South must be expanded to
   include motifs other than the already-known utilitarian purposes.}},

Abstract = {{China's 13th Five-Year Plan (FYP) is the first chance for the Xi-Li
   administration, which assumed leadership at the 18th Party Congress, to
   solidify a new course. Notably, ICT is the highest priority sector in
   the 13th FYP. This article highlights the ascent of the Internet in
   China's national strategy. It illustrates why and how ICT
   development-accelerated by the spread of high-speed Internet-is tasked
   to underpin China's rise as a global power and its internal
   transformation. More important, drawing on the geopolitical economy
   approach that emphasizes the economic roles of states in sustaining and
   animating the capitalist world order on the one hand, and the digital
   capitalism literature that deems the political economy of ICT as an
   increasingly primary dimension of global capitalism on the other, this
   article sets up a conceptual framework for interpreting this key policy
   document and China's ICT policy in general.}},

Abstract = {{With the advancement of eGovernance and development of mobile governance
   services, plenty of services are being made available online. In many of
   services, using simple username password kind of authentication,
   citizens need to prove their identity online. In order to prove their
   identity for such services in the online environment, a user needs to
   prove in ownership of certain information or token that links their
   natural identity to an online account for the access to such services.
   This is called e-authentication; it is usually followed by
   identification with a valid ID card/token etc. to the authority issuing
   the credential. Online authentication implies user's control of valid
   credentials (e.g. username-password, OTP, digital keys, BIOMETRICS
   etc.), which are issued either by the Trusted Authorities. Here we are
   introducing an innovative way of secure authentication, One Time Mobile
   Originated PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), which is basically a way to
   ensure that an electronic data is from genuine user. In this paper we
   will explain how One Time Mobile Originated PKI can be used to securely
   authenticate any online user.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Health is driving the uptake in wearable devices replete with
   biometric sensors. Digital Health is concerned with improving hwnan
   health by utilizing such high-profile applications of wearable and
   implantable technology, web and email, mobile technology and social
   networking, and data management and analytics. As one of the most
   significant drivers of the consumer health-tech revolution, Digital
   Health innovation occurs at the intersection of consumer products,
   advanced technology, medicine, and big data. The multi-industry,
   multi-discipline, and multinational character of Digital Health,
   requires a unique environment in which innovation can occur. Investors
   and entrepreneurs from the tech sector, health care, and conswner
   products are creating these new environments. This paper surveys the
   most interesting Digital Health innovation ecosystems and the funding

Title = {{THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATION ON BRAND EQUITY: THE
   EVIDENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{963-983}},
Abstract = {{The paper examines the influences of different forms of brand
   communication through social media on elements of brand equity in the
   case of environmentally friendly products. The research was conducted
   from April to June, 2016 in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
   and included 778 respondents in the main research. The results show that
   firm-created social media communication and personal involvement
   inventory have a positive influence, while user-generated social media
   communication negatively influences the elements of brand equity. Also,
   brand awareness and associations, perceived quality and behavioural
   loyalty are under the strongest positive influence of firm-created
   social media communication, while word of mouth and commitment are under
   the strongest positive influence of personal involvement inventory.
   There are no significant differences of such influences between food and
   fashion brands. Not only that the paper examines influence of social
   media communication on brand equity for environmentally friendly
   products for the first time, but it also uses an innovative model which
   includes all possible aspects of social media communication and treats
   loyalty, as element of brand equity, as a multidimensional construct.
   Recommendations given within this paper can be relevant not only for
   marketers of environmentally friendly products but also for potential
   social promotion of green consumption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper mainly put forward the mode of identification and secure
   payment based on face recognition from a face bio-identification
   perspective. With the technology of face recognition, the general
   framework of mobile commerce and the management processes are designed
   and constructed in this paper. The proposed management solution of
   anonymous payment, based on face identity, is an important method for
   m-commerce privacy protection. Users only need a payment expression to
   replace traditional payment, random verification code input and other
   cumbersome process, which not only frees mobile users from remembering a
   lot of numeric passwords but also avoids potential hazards, such as
   password disclosure, forgotten, lost and illegal access. This paper
   presents an innovative digital solution to the secure payments in mobile
   commerce, which greatly enhances the safety and efficiency of mobile
   payment system and boosts the rapid and humanistic development of mobile
   commerce by technological means.}},

Abstract = {{Urgency to embed awareness of sustainability principles and practice
   across society, and need for digital literacy and advocacy for
   sustainability are reshaping ESD. These, together with developments in
   learning and teaching, demand new tools to support implementation of
   project-based learning and more interactive approaches. This
   investigation explores the evolution of susthingsout. com, an online
   magazine for students, academics and expert practitioners, developed by
   the University of Worcester. This comprises two parts; the first, a
   private site specifically for students involved in sustainability
   learning on-campus; the second, an open-access site developed to deliver
   sustainability information and good practice across campus, community
   and not-for-profit and commercial organisations. This paper involves
   only the private site i.e. the equivalent of an in-house VLE
   specifically designed to support the teaching of sustainability to
   multi-disciplinary first and second year undergraduate students. It
   reports on the progress of the VLE, following three years of use and
   initial improvements, in terms of the student support and engagement, as
   well as considering the practical issues affecting these. The results
   fall into four categories of pedagogical, operational, cultural and
   external factors, which are synthesised to capture and share emerging
   knowledge of good practice offering insights to other developers of
   online sustainability materials.}},

Abstract = {{A Abstract art is a powerful medium of expression but simultaneously a
   very poor means of visual communication. In an effort to physically
   experiment with symbolic yet innovative thoughts or ideas in geometric,
   abstraction art, the researcher investigates the potential, value, and
   uses of building simple three-dimensional (3D) objective interpretations
   of reality available to touch.
   This paper describes the primary objectives of a one semester
   project-based learning proposal involving Alexandrian middle-school
   students or young learners. The project integrates 3D modeling/printing
   into creative activities so middle-school students or young learners can
   learn the functional aspects of abstract geometric forms and
   compositions and how to design and print 3D models.
   Drawing on the literature that explores the true potential of the
   technology that transfers 3D digital modeling to tactile solid objects
   by building them up in layers, the paper discusses the need for future
   research to develop artistic understanding of 3D printing and how it
   affects the physical reality of the explored forms and materials.
   Given the feasibility of 3D printing technologies and how these
   developments continue to expand, the researcher notes that the use of 3D
   printing geometric art models can be a powerful supplement for creating
   abstract geometrical design with touch input. 3D printers are adding new
   flexible materials that engage the imagination of middle-school students
   or young learners and allows them to create or interact with visual
   representations of concepts and turn them into a tangible reality where
   `seeing' and `making' intersect, and where possibility becomes reality.}},

Abstract = {{Over 42 million people suffer from peripheral neuropathy: deterioration
   of the nerves in the peripheral nervous system which controls the flow
   of information from the central nervous system (the brain and spinal
   cord) to other parts of the body, especially the extremities. Peripheral
   neuropathy may be caused by autoimmune diseases, metabolic and endocrine
   disorders, diabetes, cancer, chemotherapy, alcoholism, and more. One
   symptom of peripheral neuropathy is a lack of ability to sense
   temperature especially in the extremities such as fingers and toes. If a
   peripheral neuropathy patient's finger is entered into a high
   temperature unsafe zone, the patient does not have the quick reaction to
   move away from the heat source. This makes even simple daily activities
   such as cooking and operating machinery dangerous as patients are highly
   susceptible to injury like burns and frostbite, leading to ulcers and
   more complications.
   The current market offers several treatment options for peripheral
   neuropathy individuals such as Ultimate Neuropathy Treatment System,
   dermal hand aid, ReBuilder, and laser treatment. Products to prevent
   burns are rare, and include non flammable gloves that are bulky and
   limited to industrial use. Our research included talking to health care
   professionals, individuals with peripheral neuropathy, surveys, and
   online research. We determined a gap exists in the market for a
   non-invasive, cost-effective technology that prevents burns and
   frostbite to the fingers and toes.
   The TeCNail is an innovative product which aims to prevent injuries to
   individuals suffering from peripheral neuropathy. TeCNail seamlessly
   prevents users from burns by alerting them if their fingers enter an
   unsafe temperature range of 0 degrees C to 44 degrees C. The TeCNail
   features an infrared temperature sensor, a microprocessor, a
   light-emitting diode (LED), and a speaker. In case a user is moving
   their hand into the area outside the safe temperature range, the TeCNail
   alerts the user in real time by producing a beeping sound with the
   built-in speaker and by blinking the LED. The alerted user will then
   proceed to remove their digits from this environment, which effectively
   prevents potential skin trauma.}},

   By this way, it is expected that the participants can work in an open
   co-working space, where they can interact with each other. Additionally,
   the participants will be assisted to assess the business aspects of any
   potential idea. The outcome of such an activity is the increase of
   possibility for participants to find a revolutionary concept, which can
   result to new and sustainable applications and/ or services. Moreover
   the target group exceeds the usual Earth Observation professionals, and
   focuses also in professionals of other disciplines, where the use of
   Earth Observation data can create novel technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Partial Discharge (PD) or Partial Breakdown (PB) analysis is one of the
   most widely used methods to determine the state of electrical power
   insulation systems. An alternative method to measure PD is presented in
   this paper. In this proposed approach, data are obtained from electrical
   charge signals displaced by partial discharges on dielectric elements,
   pin type insulators. An electrical assembly consisting of a high voltage
   (HVAC) source, a blocking impedance, a capacitive divider and a
   measurement impedance was designed to obtain data. The signal detected
   by the measurement impedance is displayed on a high-end oscilloscope,
   the visualization instrument has the possibility of accessing the
   management software; therefore, it was possible to implement a bandpass
   finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter of a higher order than one
   hundred. The output of the filter presents the components of typical
   signals in partial discharges produced inside the dielectric material.
   Different analyzes were performed by using data segmentation which
   allows affirming that this approach is valid for its implementation. It
   this case, this method is innovative and appropriate for application in
   laboratories where there does not exist PD analyzers.}},

Abstract = {{Game-based learning (GBL) is a popular innovative pedagogical framework
   for developing Computational Thinking (CT) skills. The base idea is to
   use games to help create awareness and generated needed CT skills and
   abilities; in short, it is ``games for CT{''} approach. This is however,
   one part of the equation for understanding and developing CT in our
   modern digital age. The other part of the equation lies in using ``CT
   for games{''}. This paper addresses this perspective to aid in the
   understanding and framing of the elusive CT concept. In ``CT for
   games{''}, this paper highlights and draws attention to using CT for
   developing games instead of using games to develop CT. The core
   contributions of the paper are a ``CT for games{''} proposed framework;
   selected variants of health games and observations of ``Rebel
   Design{''}. Readers can benefit from a perspective with a different
   focus and increase awareness and understanding of CT with the hope of
   grooming future leaders with required CT problem-solving skills and
   abilities and applying ``Rebel Design{''} for games.}},

Abstract = {{Social networking is rapidly growing so much so that it has become a
   driving force for governments to access data which allows citizens
   without any restrictions over the World's social media. In 2015, the
   Thai government released a three year Digital Government Development
   Plan. This plan is a performance guideline of the e-government and for
   the open government data of the country. Several countries have
   conducted research on the Open Government Data Assessment but their
   research does not suit the context of Thailand. Therefore, the purpose
   of the present review and research presentation is to assess and
   evaluate the degree of development of the Open Government Data
   components that exist in the country. The methodology used in the
   evaluation and validation of this research consist of interviewing
   officials of top government management agencies responsible for
   e-government and the Digital Government Development Plan in Thailand.
   This research identified nine key components: Policies and Plans, Laws
   and regulations, Organization, Enterprise architecture, Capabilities
   enhancement, Open government principles, Technology infrastructure,
   Innovation and participation of citizens. Detailed components of each
   topic and subtopic are provided below}},

Abstract = {{The European Project ECO (E-learning, Communication, Open-Data) seeks to
   develop an educational model that is horizontal and bidirectional,
   portraying the new reality of the MOOC. On the basis of the principles
   of equity, social inclusion, accessibility, autonomy and openness, the
   empowerment of the students becomes real with this training proposal,
   breaking down the barriers of the digital scenario of the course in
   order to have an impact, through social media, on the social layer.
   Taking the educational momentum of the ECO MOOC's, the results presented
   in this study have been analyzed using a quantitative methodology using
   the analysis of an intentional sample with the data obtained in the
   first round of courses. This type of analysis aims to identify the
   traits that have characterized this educational model and the demand
   that has been demonstrated with development on a pedagogical level. As
   we can see, this study has made it clear that ECO has massively
   increased the presence of MOOC's, not only on a European level but also
   in other countries, even in those that are in the process of
   development. This training has been implemented successfully within the
   teaching sphere with the clear objective of encouraging the discovery of
   open resources and strategies for the improvement of educational
   quality, offering the possibility of creating their own courses as a
   means to share knowledge with other teachers. As a result, the success
   of the MOOC and publicizing of the same are determined by the
   experience, the conformity with the contents and the degree of
   satisfaction of the students participating, becoming a publicist of the
   same in its different social spaces. The European Project ECO is
   presented as a model of accessible learning that allows not only a
   universal design, but also its openness and the participation in this
   education for all citizens.}},

Abstract = {{The recent introduction of digital mobile technologies in society and
   especially among young people is a challenge for teachers, and it could
   represent an opportunity for greater academic achievement. This article
   presents research on the educational use of Geolocation and Augmented
   Reality applications with mobile digital devices in Secondary Education
   and Vocational Training educational stages. This investigation tries to
   find out if it is possible to use these technologies on students' mobile
   devices to reach a better education. The paper begins with a review of
   these developments from a formative dimension. Then, a macro descriptive
   and quantitative study of 1,832 students is developed in order to
   determine what type of digital devices they have, subsequently teachers'
   views about functionality and educational value of digital devices are
   analyzed. The results clarify the type and penetration of these devices
   in the three educational stages analyzed, and the data suggests the
   possibility of implementing these technologies as students' devices have
   advanced operating systems and appropriate GPS hardware. From the
   teachers' perspective, the reluctance to use these devices can be
   overcome with an initial integration of tasks outside the school and in
   non-contact activities. Together with the m-learning characteristics of
   spatiotemporal delocalization, innovative features arise in educational
   methodology derived from systems that drive noncompetitive collaborative
   relationships. Augmented Reality appears as a motivating power element
   in the educational tasks, opening doors to autonomous, non-linear
   exploration of virtual worlds that now incorporate a high surprise
   component for the user. On the other hand, Geolocation serves in the
   exploration of work environments, geo-spatial referencing, and
   individualized monitoring of distance tasks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper makes a distinctive contribution to the current debates
   concerning the role of personal mobile technologies (PMTs) in public
   education. It does this through drawing attention to the imperative to
   integrate digitally-mediated personalised education with
   teacher-mediated pluralised education. Premised on the notion that
   children's learning needs to be both tailored to individuals'
   aspirations (i.e. personalised) and participatory, entailing the
   consideration of multiple perspectives (i.e. pluralised), the argument
   is made that for optimal learning outcomes, both personalisation and
   plurality need to be integrated when deploying PMTs in schools.
   Vygotsky's theory is mobilised to provide a theoretical rationale for
   emphasising the vital role educators play in harnessing PMTs to support
   the development of traditional as well as new, 21st-century skills, and
   for the argument that personalisation and pluralisation need to be
   conceptualised as complementary forces within 21st-century education
   reform. A community project, which deployed PMTs, is used to exemplify
   how personalised and pluralised educational goals can be integrated and
   pursued within teaching-learning activities mediated by innovative
   technologies and educational professionals.}},

Abstract = {{The digitalization of our economy, with the spread of smartphones and of
   electronic commerce, entails a general acceleration of payments. On the
   one hand, new technologies lead to changes in customer habits, who make
   Internet purchases anywhere and at any time. Customers also expect to
   pay for and receive their purchases as fast as possible. Suppliers, on
   the other hand, wish to have the certainty to be paid as soon as they
   release their goods and services. The first solution proposed by banks
   was to use debit or credit banking card to pay the purchases on Internet
   using now a 3D secure architecture. This solution is widely implemented
   but seems to reach some limits in term of number of merchant connected
   and in term of number of frauds. New technologies stimulate innovation
   in payments, and contribute to the expectation for instant payments. In
   term of distant payment, instant payment could be a good solution to be
   substituted to the card payment}},

   healing. In the current study, we demonstrated that injection of naked
   cmRNA, diluted in a glucose-containing solution, into tendons resulted
   in high protein expression in healthy and experimentally-injured
   tendons. Injection of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7)-encoding
   cmRNA resulted in a significantly higher expression of BMP-7 protein and
   reduced formation of collagen type III, compared to vehicle control.
   Moreover, in a large animal model, reporter protein expression was
   detectable not only in healthy, but also in experimentally-injured,
   severely inflamed tendons. Summarising, these results demonstrated the
   potential of cmRNAs encoding for therapeutic proteins as a new class of
   drugs for the treatment of tendon disorders.}},

Abstract = {{This article scrutinizes the dominant discursive formations within
   digitization of cultural heritage in Danish cultural policy, with the
   Danish Cultural Heritage' portal serving as a case. The paper analyzes
   how the portal frames users' participation potentials and how this
   relates to the objectives of the portal and official Danish digitization
   strategies issued in the period of 2007-2015. Furthermore, the article
   incorporates interviews with experts working with the portal and the
   digitization strategies in order to gain a closer understanding of the
   transformation from policy to reality. Even though discourses on
   participation and user engagement are detected within official cultural
   policy documents, the dominant discourses are those of administrative
   and managerial effectiveness and cooperation as well as increased
   production, innovation, and competition. A similar pattern emerges on
   the portal, where focus is on digitization and preservation rather than
   access and use. The interactions between technology, user/usage, and
   content are thus tailored on premises of read only' and sit back and be
   told' cultures rather than on the user-engaging read write' and making
   and doing' cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Models envisaged by policy makers and sustainability scientists
   cooperatively produce tools with desired practical implications. Models
   presented in the volume are summarized, with existing policy methods for
   resource management and Global perspective for resource planning methods
   in context. Models are discussed firstly in the framework of learning
   environments as an opportunity to test and practice sustainability,
   combining different tools from models, case studies, and scenarios.
   Sustainability asks for a multi-scale pragmatics; key elements of the
   multiple scale approach representing common ground in existing practice
   and frontier research have been identified. Two case studies are
   presented as a meta-summary of the issues presented in the book, being
   Rural South Asia (with special reference to India), and analysis of
   mega-diverse countries in Latin America, with special focus on Ecuador.
   India's case study offers an account of policies implemented by the
   Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs
   (MTA) since 1947, creating sustainable models for biodiversity and
   natural resource management. To comprehend the methods of resource
   sustainability usage in the present era, while enhancing resource
   utilization capacity of traditional practices, a tribal (indigenous
   communities) village-'Ajanta' (Western India)-is elaborated upon. The
   Latin America case study focuses on declinations of the buen vivir (good
   living) concept and the debate between putting nature to the service of
   a nation (extractivism) and Yasunization, the neologism coined in
   Ecuador by a civil society seeking territorial innovation combining
   community engagement, biodiversity conservation, and environmental
   justice.
   Through the macro-cosmic to micro-cosmic approach, a `north-south',
   `developed versus developing regions' dichotomy and possible areas of
   accord for resource management and sustainability in the global
   perspective is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Scholastic confessional religious instruction has a considerable joint
   responsibility when it comes to the upbringing and education of
   generations to come. That is why Islamic religious instruction in
   Austria too has been seeking to stay engaged in the latest discourse on
   religious education and its teaching principles through both the
   publication of the new and skills-based Islamstunde {[}Islamic religious
   class] schoolbook series and the inclusion of media-related and didactic
   innovations in the concept. Precisely because new media motivate,
   facilitate independent and reflective learning, allow new teaching
   concepts and enable the integration of authentic problems into learning
   situations. The present article illustrates, by way of example, how
   learning and teaching with new media can be implemented in Islamic
   religious instruction by drawing on the concept as presented in
   Islamstunde.}},

Abstract = {{Main objective of this work is to suggest some easy procedures to solve
   typical non-linear problems of analytical photogrammetry, which are also
   frequent in digital photogrammetry. In particular, we propose a
   two-steps procedure based on two phases: Relative Orientation and
   Absolute Orientation, both characterized by non-linear functions. It is
   firstly necessary to form the model, finding the solution of the
   Relative Orientation, and then to reconstruct the object considering the
   solution of the Absolute Orientation. Once validated the technique of
   orientation of two images, a procedure for the orientation of three
   images is proposed. In particular, the introduction of a third image
   allows avoiding human decision to find the final solution. In order to
   find an easy solution for three-image orientation, each model coming
   from two images of a triplet is analysed, computing the relative
   orientation bby using an exhaustive research of preliminary values of
   its parameters. This non-conventional approach supplies the orientation
   of two images, taking into account a priori information among four base
   solutions. Once each model is relatively registered, the absolute
   orientation is computed by using a linear parameterization. We did a
   comparison between the method of the three photogrammetric images and a
   method of Computer Vision.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of information technology, images can be
   easily copied, modified, and re-released. This paper proposes a
   copyright protection method based on the main feature of digital images
   by using SIFT algorithm. It aims to prevent the image which main feature
   information is stored in database from being abused. The innovation
   point is to store feature information instead of images with much
   redundant information, which can accelerate matching. It can be judged
   whether a picture infringes copyright by extracting its main feature
   information, then comparing with those in database. The experiment
   results show that this method can resist tampering attack such as JPEG
   compression, noise, and geometric distortion.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the article. The aim of the article is the prioritizing of
   sales channels forming by retailers with the development of modern
   information and communication technologies. Development of practical
   recommendations for implementing an integrated approach to sales, based
   on the use of omni-channel marketing.
   The results of the analysis. Modern realities determine the necessity of
   the marketing innovations introduction in marketing policies of
   retailers. New channels of communication and sales appear under the
   influence of rapid development of information and communication
   technologies, global internet environment and the acceleration of
   informatization. Along with the development of Internet and digital
   marketing the approaches to formation of sales channels in retail have
   evolved.
   Depending on the chosen tools of Internet marketing, digital means and
   their relationship omni-channel or multi-channel sales strategy can be
   used. The basis of multi-channel strategy is the principle of channels
   linearity, the basis of omni-channel strategy is maximum integration of
   channels. Omni-channel strategy is an integrated approach to business
   processes on customer service, based on a coherent concept, a single
   platform of all selected channels to promote products and services. This
   approach allows the customer to freely move from one channel to another,
   thus obtain the necessary information to compare and choose the product,
   to make the decision and purchase.
   To implement an integrated approach to sales in retail trade enterprises
   need to: develop marketing strategy based on the use of traditional
   instruments and digital marketing; maximize the use of digital channels
   and means of communication as well as the interaction with potential
   buyers; direct efforts to all channels to enhance brand value; study not
   only purchasing, but digital behavior of customers in determining the
   availability of digital devices, how they use mobile apps, their
   readiness to use such apps when buying; ensure a high level of customer
   service and continuous optimization of interaction processes with
   customers; monitor off-line and on-line competitors; develop and
   implement creative ideas during the design and development of digital
   content, marketing activities; involve experts from the digital
   marketing (marketing analytics, IT specialist, specialist in SEO,
   SMM-marketing, specialist and etc.), create appropriate organizational
   structure for the enterprise departments, services; ensure a high level
   of integration and the relationship between sales channels.
   Conclusions and directions of further researches. The traditional
   (off-line) stores have been and remain an important part of the
   infrastructure of the consumer market, but in response to rapid changes
   in the environment and innovation in information and communications
   field they should intensify and expand the arsenal of marketing tools of
   interaction and impact on consumers. In this connection the stores that
   will offer customers new conceptual solutions, trying to expand the
   channels of access to their products and services, to provide a new
   service, will have the opportunity to build customer equity, its
   retention, and on this basis they will ensure a clear competitive
   advantage, the possibility of expanding their own market share, as a
   result to increase revenues, profits; increase the effectiveness of the
   financial, economic and marketing activities.
   Research in omni-channel marketing are at an early stage, so most
   theoretical, methodological and practical aspects of enforcement and
   implementation require further study. It is necessary to focus on the
   development of conceptual frameworks and models used for omni-channel
   strategies, mechanisms of interaction between different channels,
   justification of omni-channel structures of sale.}},

Title = {{Tendencies and features of development of companies in digital epoch}},
Journal = {{MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{289-299}},
Abstract = {{The aim of the article. To provide theoretical and methodological basis
   of the development of new tendencies and features of development of
   companies in digital epoch.
   The results of the analysis. The initial thesis of the article is the
   analysis of main tendencies of leading companies' development in the
   period of digital technologies emergence, that is a key to the
   understanding of the direction, traditional business should be
   transformed in.
   Nowadays for learning new concepts, strategies, methods that are
   annually put forward in the world today people spend much time and money
   in the field of corporate and individual education. However, the target
   audience of business literature often turns out devoid of understanding,
   what is actually behind the appeals to change the company management
   model. This article shows that knowledge of methodological basis for the
   analysis of the transformation processes in the digital epoch will allow
   to form a view of why these changes are occurring. The acquisition of
   theoretical knowledge concerning this process, in turn, will cause the
   adoption of reasonable managerial decisions, based on a deep
   understanding of the nature of ongoing transformations.
   By using the istrument of dialectical logic the author explains the
   appearance of elements of a new organic integrity development, which
   develops in depths of the system of economic relations. In the current
   practice this is manifested in new conditions and the nature of the
   joint activities of people. Their development is largely stipulated by
   the further process of socialization of production on the basis of
   digital technologies. It was formed the following relationship: nowadays
   the level of public communication in the process of production,
   distribution, exchange and consumption of goods directly depends on the
   usage of technologies for work with information.
   The work contains the concretization of the hypothesis, according to
   which nowadays in the digital epoch a new relational system is forming,
   in this system a central place is occupied by a human and his
   intellectual capacity. It is shown that information is the element from
   which a new historical type of organic matter unfolds. The logic is the
   following: while the development of the system of interindustrial and
   interpersonal relationships in the digital epoch, the information is
   converted into knowledge and knowledge is transformed into the
   competence. In turn, the competence is not just knowledge and skills of
   the person or company, it is an integrating category. It captures the
   essence of a new type of organic matter, which arises in the present
   system of economic relations.
   The study of activities of the leading subjects of global economic
   transformation shows that the availability of information, which
   increases as far as digital technologies are rapidly spreading,
   highlights knowledge and abilities. They become the most important
   sources of company operating performance in rapidly changing conditions.
   As the current practice shows, people get necessary competences from
   interacting with the nature and other people using new digital platform
   for the information exchange. The development of such interaction
   platforms, new ways of people coordination and associated creation of
   values nowadays can be singled out in a separate period, which is
   covered by the digital epoch.
   1Conclusions and directions of further researches. Further analysis
   should be directed to the world's leading companies, which are directly
   related to the information, its transmission, storage, protection,
   generation, accumulation and management. These companies that are
   engaged in information and communication technologies are the
   transitional forms in which the current system of economic relations is
   beyond the limits, colliding with the system ``man-intelligence{''}.
   Among the promising directions scientific and theoretical understanding
   are required by the issues concerning the transition to open models of
   company management that conform an information and network form of
   interaction. This work presents the fragment of the cloud of key
   directions that are developing in various forms in relation to
   employees, customers, partners, competitors, and others (by means of the
   formation of cooperative relations in the process of innovations
   formation, in the organization of production, marketing, training,
   investment, insurance etc.).}},

Title = {{Computer and mobile technology interventions for self-management in
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}},
Journal = {{COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by airflow
   obstruction due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to
   noxious particles or gases, for example, cigarette smoke. The pattern of
   care for people with moderate to very severe COPD often involves regular
   lengthy hospital admissions, which result in high healthcare costs and
   an undesirable effect on quality of life. Research over the past decade
   has focused on innovative methods for developing enabling and assistive
   technologies that facilitate patient self-management.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions delivered by computer and
   by mobile technology versus face-to-face or hard copy/digital
   documentary-delivered interventions, or both, in facilitating,
   supporting, and sustaining self-management among people with COPD.
   Search methods
   In November 2016, we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised
   Register (CAGR), which contains trial reports identified through
   systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane
   Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase,
   CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO, and we handsearched respiratory journals and
   meeting abstracts.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials that measured effects of remote
   and Web 2.0-based interventions defined as technologies including
   personal computers (PCs) and applications (apps) for mobile technology,
   such as iPad, Android tablets, smart phones, and Skype, on behavioural
   change towards self-management of COPD. Comparator interventions
   included face-to-face and/or hard copy/ digital documentary
   educational/self-management support.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors (CMcC and MMcC) independently screened titles,
   abstracts, and full-text study reports for inclusion. Two review authors
   (CMcC and AMB) independently assessed study quality and extracted data.
   We expressed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) and standardised
   mean differences (SMDs) for studies using different outcome measurement
   scales.
   Main results
   We included in our review three studies (Moy 2015; Tabak 2013;
   Voncken-Brewster 2015) with a total of 1580 randomised participants.
   From Voncken-Brewster 2015, we included the subgroup of individuals with
   a diagnosis of COPD (284 participants) and excluded those at risk of
   COPD who had not received a diagnosis (1023 participants). As a result,
   the total population available for analysis included 557 participants;
   319 received smart technology to support self-management and 238
   received face-to-face verbal/ written or digital information and
   education about self-management. The average age of participants was 64
   years. We included more men than women because the sample from one of
   the studies consisted of war veterans, most of whom were men. These
   studies measured five of our nine defined outcomes. None of these
   studies included outcomes such as self-efficacy, cost-effectiveness,
   functional capacity, lung function, or anxiety and depression.
   All three studies included our primary outcome -health-related quality
   of life (HRQoL) as measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) or
   St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). One study reported our
   other primary outcomes - hospital admissions and acute exacerbations.
   Two studies included our secondary outcome of physical activity as
   measured by daily step counts. One study addressed smoking by providing
   a narrative analysis. Only one study reported adverse events and noted
   significant differences between groups, with 43 events noted in the
   intervention group and eight events in the control group (P = 0.001).
   For studies that measured outcomes at week four, month four, and month
   six, the effect of smart technology on self-management and subsequent
   HRQoL in terms of symptoms and health status was significantly better
   than when participants received face-to-face/ digital and/ or written
   support for self-management of COPD (SMD -0.22, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) -0.40 to -0.03; P = 0.02). The single study that reported HRQoL at
   12 months described no significant between-group differences (MD 1.1,
   95\% CI -2.2 to 4.5; P = 0.50). Also, hospitalisations (logistic
   regression odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95\% CI 0.8 to 3.2; P = 0.19) and
   exacerbations (logistic regression OR 1.4, 95\% CI 0.7 to 2.8; P = 0.33)
   did not differ between groups in the single study that reported these
   outcomes at 12 months. The activity level of people with COPD at week
   four, month four, and month six was significantly higher when smart
   technology was used than when face-to-face/ digital and/ or written
   support was provided (MD 864.06 daily steps between groups, 95\% CI
   369.66 to 1358.46; P = 0.0006). The only study that measured activity
   levels at 12 months reported no significant differences between groups
   (mean 108, 95\% CI -720 to 505; P = 0.73). Participant engagement in
   this study was not sustained between four and 12 months. The only study
   that included smoking cessation found no significant treatment effect
   (OR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.43 to 2.66; P = 0.895). Meta-analyses showed no
   significant heterogeneity between studies (Chi(2) = 0.39, P = 0.82; I-2
   = 0\% and Chi(2) = 0.01, P = 0.91; I-2 = 0\%, respectively).
   Authors' conclusions
   Although our review suggests that interventions aimed at facilitating,
   supporting, and sustaining self-managment in people with COPD and
   delivered via smart technology significantly improved HRQoL and levels
   of activity up to six months compared with interventions given through
   face-to-face/ digital and/ or written support, no firm conclusions can
   be drawn. This improvement may not be sustained over a long duration.
   The only included study that measured outcomes up to 12 months
   highlighted the need to ensure sustained engagement with the technology
   over time. Limited evidence suggests that using computer and mobile
   technology for self-management for people with COPD is not harmful and
   may be more beneficial for some people than for others, for example,
   those with an interest in using technology may derive greater benefit.
   The evidence, provided by three studies at high risk of bias, is of poor
   quality and is insufficient for advising healthcare professionals,
   service providers, and members of the public with COPD about the health
   benefits of using smart technology as an effective means of supporting,
   encouraging, and sustaining self-management. Further research that
   focuses on outcomes relevant to different stages of COPD is needed.
   Researchers should provide clear information on how self-management is
   assessed and should include longitudinal measures that allow comment on
   behavioural change.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the research findings from a year-long
   investigation funded by a Digital R\&D for the Arts grant. The
   overarching aims of this research project were to understand how arts
   and cultural organisations can access mixed-reality environments and
   digital technology for creative play and learning, and how they can
   enable children and young people to access meaningful digital realm
   engagement. The article starts by introducing the underlying
   philosophical and cognitive framework built from embodiment philosophy,
   gaming theory and digital pedagogy that helped the research team
   determine what was meant by meaningful engagement in mixed reality. This
   is woven into an analysis of the four action-research case studies,
   followed by a discussion on the potential future areas for
   investigation. The conclusion evaluates how the resultant Pop Up Play
   product (free software download, supporting materials and bespoke
   digital creative play framework http://thesparkarts.co.uk/popupplay/)
   can be considered an environment for communications skill development,
   innovative thinking and immersive exploration through experiential play.}},

Pages = {{648-671}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to establish a cyber physical
   environment for digital product design and manufacturing. To realize
   this goal, the specific issue of integrating design knowledge-based
   system (KBS) and 3D printing (3DP) system is focused. A graphics
   generation method is thereby developed to transform the KBS outputs into
   graphical format which can be directly read and manufactured by 3DP
   system.
   Design/methodology/approach - A graphics generation method is proposed
   in this paper. Through organizing alphanumeric outputs of the
   consultation session with a design KBS into parametric format, the
   consultation results can be directly used by computer-aided design (CAD)
   tools to generate graphical models which can be further exported into a
   3DP system to produce physical objects.
   Findings - The proposed graphics generation method can be effective to
   link design KBS and 3DP. Therefore, the seamless connection between
   design and prototyping systems can be realized, which further lays the
   communication foundation for a cyber physical environment for digital
   design and manufacturing.
   Originality/value - This study provides research insights about
   potential cyber physical system applications in digital design and
   manufacturing area. Moreover, this paper contributes an effective
   technique to integrate design KBS and 3DP.}},

Title = {{Digitalization as institutional work: a case of designing a tool for
   changing diabetes care}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{227-243}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - E-health tools for patients aim to change current care
   practices. However the role of IT in transforming health care is not
   straightforward. The purpose of this paper is to understand how this
   change process unfolds and what characterizes the process by which
   visions of new care practices become inscribed into digital tools.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted a qualitative research
   design and it is based on an interpretive case study on the
   digitalization of a tool for diabetes care used in a hospital in Norway.
   Data have been collected via interviews and observations. Digitalization
   activities are understood as institutional work in order to examine the
   relation between the decisions taken in the design process and the
   intended change of the practices of diabetes care.
   Findings - The study identifies three types of activities of
   institutional work: inscription of self-reflection, inscription of
   legitimation and inscription of new usage. The analysis of these
   activities shows how the vision of patients' more active, learning and
   reflection-oriented role is inscribed into digital technology; how
   institutional work strives both for change and for legitimation thus
   smoothing the transition to a new institutional arrangement; and how
   institutional work relates to digital materiality.
   Originality/value - The study contributes to the institutional theory
   literature by conceptualizing digitalization as institutional work
   toward changing institutions. It also contributes to the IS literature
   on digitalization by providing an analysis of how the affordances of
   digital materials support the work toward new institutions.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Multiple challenges remain in achieving sustainability of
   digital health innovations, with many failing to realise their potential
   due to barriers to research, development and implementation. Finding an
   approach that overcomes these challenges is important if society is to
   derive benefit from these new approaches to healthcare. Having been
   commissioned by local authorities, NHS Trusts, prisons, charities, and
   third sector providers across the UK, Breaking Free Group, who in 2010
   launched Breaking Free Online (BFO), a computer-assisted therapy
   programme for substance misuse, have overcome many of these challenges.
   This has been possible through close collaborative working with partner
   organisations, to overcome barriers to implementation and
   sustainability. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper synthesises findings from a
   series of qualitative studies conducted by Breaking Free Group in
   collaboration with health and social care charity, Change, Grow, Live
   (CGL), which explore barriers and facilitators of implementation and
   sustainability of BFO at CGL. Data are analysed using thematic analyses
   with findings conceptualised using behavioural science theory.
   Findings - This partnership has resulted in UK wide implementation of
   BFO at CGL, enhanced focus on digital technologies in substance misuse
   recovery, and a growing body of published collaborative research.
   Originality/value - Valuable lessons have been learnt through the
   partnership between Breaking Free Group and CGL, which will be of
   interest to the wider digital health community. This paper outlines
   those lessons, in the hope that they will provide guidance to other
   digital health developers and their partners, to contribute to the
   continued evolution of a sustainable digital health sector.}},

Abstract = {{The digital revolution has impacted the study of innovation in
   organizations in such a way that research on organizational
   ambidexterity needs a more phenomenon-driven approach. In light of this
   identified need, this article examines the performance of small- and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in South Korea based on their balance in
   exploration and exploitation activities. A 2 (explorative: hi, low) x 2
   (exploitative: hi, low) conceptual framework is introduced to depict
   four types of combined ambidexterity in firms and hypothesize that
   short- and long-term performances vary among these types of firms. Data
   from more than 2800 hi-tech manufacturing SMEs in South Korea were
   collected to empirically test the conceptual framework. The results
   confirmed the hypothesized difference in performance. Firms indeed vary
   in degrees of explorative and exploitative innovation and thus have
   positive but imbalanced impact on their performance. Firms that are high
   (low) in both explorative and exploitative innovation perform best
   (worst) in longer-term growth. Firms that tilt toward exploitative
   innovation perform best in short-term profit. The article concludes with
   important managerial and policy implications.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - One of the most innovative library services recently
   introduced by public and academic libraries, the technology of 3D
   printing, has the potential to be used in multiple educational settings.
   The purpose of this paper is to examine how this novel library digital
   service motivates students' learning, and to investigate managerial
   issues related to the introduction of 3D printing services at a
   medium-size urban community college library with restricted funding.
   Design/methodology/approach - Since Fall 2014, the LaGuardia Library
   Media Resources Center has been offering a portable consumer-end 3D
   printer for classroom use. This paper provides historical context for
   the implementation of 3D printing as a service offered by librarians and
   discusses how the community college library managed 3D printing services
   to support class curriculum. At the end of the three-semester-long
   project students were asked to volunteer to take a survey conducted by
   the librarian and the class instructor.
   Findings - The results of the student survey demonstrated that library
   3D printing services significantly promoted students' motivation to
   learn. The conceptual model of a makerspace should be an essential part
   of the twenty-first century academic library. To help make that possible
   this paper examines certain challenges and limitations faced by
   librarians when introducing 3D printing, including dedicated space
   management, professional education, and personnel availability.
   Originality/value - During the project described students were able to
   use library services to print out and study complex engineering and
   biology models in 3D. The proper planning and management of this
   innovative service allows academic librarians to enhance class
   curriculum by providing the means of transforming theory into physical
   reality.}},

Abstract = {{Government agencies have been slow to adapt to evolving technologies and
   the increasing use of decentralized, digital currencies for illegal
   acts. Virtual black markets are spawning rapidly, and just as one gets
   taken down dozens more appear in its place. Current regulations and
   methods of law enforcement are outdated and must be reformed and
   recalibrated in order to keep up with the innovative techniques of
   virtual black-market administrators and anonymous users. Despite the
   urgency of such reform, it must be accomplished while maintaining
   fundamental privacy rights and avoiding inhibiting new technologies.
   This Note explains how users are able to abuse digital currencies, such
   as bitcoin, for illegal purposes and analyzes the current methods used
   to catch these users. It then argues for a reformation of
   law-enforcement and legislative efforts so that resources may be focused
   efficiently on addressing the issue.}},

Abstract = {{In search of innovative approaches to raise climate change awareness
   among digital natives, online and serious games are gaining currency as
   new platforms for communication, education and social change. Thanks to
   their interactivity and immersive narrative, games have capacity to
   convey to young people the problems that they will be facing in the
   future and enable them to experience these problems directly through the
   game. In addition, online games can offer the possibility to be
   implemented in educational contexts as a didactic tool for teachers.
   This study aims a) to present a checklist with validated evaluation
   criteria identified through the Delphi method; and b) to conduct a
   qualitative evaluation of communicative and educative elements of a
   sample of 24 online climate change games targeting youth and produced in
   Spanish. Our findings suggest that the games evaluated seem to be on the
   right path, making the topic of climate change local, visual and
   connected, although there is still room for improvement in terms of
   contents, gameplay and didactics. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{This preface by the guest editors provides a situated overview of the
   purpose, structure and methodologies of the contributing articles on
   Chinese animations in this special issue. Aiming to reconfigure Chinese
   film studies through historical and theoretical inquiries about the
   relationship between the animated and the cinematic, the special issue
   introduces a nascent perspective on Chinese animations by offering
   rigorous and stimulating studies on the forms, genres and materiality of
   animation, as well as on the technological and ontological conditions of
   animated moving images in the age of digital new media. The preface also
   provides a brief historical overview of Chinese animation and animation
   studies, generating dialogues with diverse approaches to Chinese
   animation at home and abroad. Whereas the socio-historical contexts of
   Chinese animation highlight its ideological functions, the contributing
   authors in this special issue present fresh visions and innovative
   studies of Chinese animation as a crucial cultural form with
   transnational popularity and unique aesthetics.}},

Abstract = {{Digitisation forms a part of Industrie 4.0 and is both threatening, but
   also providing an opportunity to transform business as we know it; and
   can make entire business models redundant. Although companies might
   realise the need to digitise, many are unsure of how to start this
   digital transformation. This paper addresses the problems and challenges
   faced in digitisation, and develops a model for initialising digital
   transformation in enterprises. The model is based on a continuous
   improvement cycle, and also includes triggers for innovative and digital
   thinking within the enterprise. The model was successfully validated in
   the German service sector. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Large quantities of data are now being generated, collated and processed
   within schools through computerised systems and other digital
   technologies. In response to growing concerns over the efficiency and
   equity of how these data are used, the concept of open data' has emerged
   as a potential means of using digital technology to democratise data
   access and use within whole school communities. Drawing on participatory
   design research in two Australian secondary schools, this paper explores
   the possibilities of making existing school data openly available in
   digitised form for teachers, administrators and students to access,
   interpret and use. The results of these interventions - while only
   partially successful - provide valuable insights into the technical,
   informatic, organisational and social issues surrounding the use of data
   in schools. The paper concludes by considering the practical and
   theoretical limitations of attempting to democratise data engagement
   within school settings.}},

Abstract = {{Digitization and the rise of Open Access publishing is an important
   recent development in academic communication. The current publishing
   system involves challenges with cost, where many universities are forced
   to cancel journal subscriptions for economic reasons, as well as access,
   as scholars and the public alike often lack access to research published
   in paywalled subscription journals. Open Access publishing solves access
   problems, but not necessarily cost problems. Universities and
   researchers are currently in a challenging, interstitial stage of
   scholarly publishing. Subscription journals still dominate scholarly
   communication, but a growing imperative to fund and support Open Access
   alternatives has recently emerged. Stakeholders including faculty,
   university administrators, publishers, students, scientific funding
   institutions and librarians and governments alike currently strategize
   and compete for their professional and economic interests in the broader
   publishing system. Four main trends are proffered that will characterize
   the future of scholarly publishing: 1) antagonism with professional
   scholarly associations; 2) changes and innovations to peer review; 3)
   Scientific/Intellectual Movements around Open Access publishing and 4)
   new professional niches in the publishing landscape. This article
   suggests potential trajectories and outcomes for these various conflicts
   over the costs and benefits of academic publishing}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increased awareness of consumers in sensorial and nutritional
   quality of frozen foods, the freezing technology has to seek new and
   innovative technologies for better retaining the fresh like quality of
   foods. In this article, we review the recent developments in smart
   freezing technology applied to fresh foods. The application of these
   intelligent technologies and the associated underpinning concepts have
   greatly improved the quality of frozen foods and the freezing
   efficiency. These technologies are able to automatically collect the
   information in-line during freezing and help control the freezing
   process better. Smart freezing technology includes new and intelligent
   technologies and concepts applied to the pretreatment of the frozen
   product, freezing processes, cold chain logistics as well as warehouse
   management. These technologies enable real-time monitoring of quality
   during the freezing process and help improve product quality and
   freezing efficiency. We also provide a brief overview of several sensing
   technologies used to achieve automatic control of individual steps of
   freezing process. These sensing technologies include computer vision,
   electronic nose, electronic tongue, digital simulation, confocal laser,
   near infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance technology and
   ultrasound. Understanding of the mechanism of these new technologies
   will be helpful for applying them to improve the quality of frozen
   foods.}},

Abstract = {{Lefebvre's triadic conception of spatial practice, representations of
   space and representational spaces provides the theoretical framework of
   this article, which recognises a productive relationship between space
   and social relations. Its writing stems from a current and ongoing
   qualitative study of innovative teaching and learning practices in new
   technology-rich flexible learning spaces, characterised by large open
   spaces, permeable boundaries and diverse furnishings emphasising student
   comfort, health and flexibility. Schooling in the twenty-first century,
   certainly in the developed world, is required to ensure that children
   and school-leavers have appropriate life-long skills in preparation for
   participation in the twenty-first century knowledge economy. This world
   is characterised as complex and dynamic, deeply influenced by
   globalisation and the revolution in digital technology. Developing these
   skills calls into question outmoded' transmission models of teaching and
   requires teachers and school leaders to approach their work in radically
   new ways. Open school design encourages flexibility in learning and
   teaching, and allows collaborative, team teaching, with designers
   claiming significant educational benefits. This arrangement of multiple
   classes using innovatively designed, technology-enriched common space,
   facilitated by multiple teachers, working in collaborative teams, is
   far-reaching in its likely implications for community expectations and
   responses, relationship-building, assessment, student learning,
   teachers' work and initial teacher education.}},

Title = {{Control systems in outsourcing new product development: role of
   globalization and digitizability}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{312-328}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to propose that
   the nature and degree of control during new product development (NPD)
   outsourcing depends upon its initiation stage or implementation stage;
   second, to delineate the moderating effect of globalization and
   digitizability that further influence the link between NPD stage and
   control systems.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose a conceptual framework
   and develop a series or propositions.
   Findings - The nature and degree of control systems required in NPD is
   contingent upon the stage of the NPD process and this relationship is
   moderated by the degree of globalization and digitizability.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper offers a conceptual
   platform that can be explored in future empirical research. The paper
   offers a series of propositions as well as measurement items to enable
   this task.
   Practical implications - The research underscores the idea that
   instituting appropriate control systems in outsourcing NPD is a complex
   process that requires careful consideration of the nature of the
   activity, the nature of the control and firm strategy.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first to conceptually examine the
   domain of the three-way intersection of NPD stage-gate process,
   outsourcing relationships and control systems. By doing so, the authors
   extend each of the three individual research domains in new directions
   as well as enhance the understanding of the interrelationships among
   these three domains.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{551-571}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Past integrated marketing communications (IMC) frameworks have
   established brand contacts as important sources of information and
   feedback. This paper aims to discuss how the presence of multiple brand
   stakeholders and the proliferation of digital media increase the amount
   of brand information generated exponentially. When a firm fails to
   harness this information, it risks misalignment between brand identity
   and brand image, which, in turn, tarnishes brand-equity.
   Design/methodology/approach - Past IMC frameworks are reviewed and
   extended to identify specific brand contact points between multiple
   stakeholders that hold significant potential to dynamically reconfigure
   brand identity. Theoretical propositions regarding the IMC function's
   role in managing these contact points to generate brand-equity are
   offered.
   Findings - The brand contacts described and their successful integration
   into a firm's brand-equity strategy extend current IMC-based
   brand-equity models and suggest fruitful, novel avenues for creating
   brand-equity. Further, these brand contacts offer practical examples of
   how the scope of marketing communications can be redefined.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to the body of research on
   the elevation of IMC to a strategic level function. In addition to the
   synergistic communication of the brand offering, IMC needs to play a
   pivotal role in coordinating the contacts between the brand and
   stakeholders, and in extrapolating relevant brand insights from these
   contacts.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain has
   introduced new challenges, chief among them, fighting the international
   criminal trade in fake medicines. As the manufacture, supply, and
   distribution of drugs becomes more complex, so does the need for
   innovative technology-based solutions to protect patients globally.
   Areas covered: We conducted a multidisciplinary review of the
   science/health, information technology, computer science, and general
   academic literature with the aim of identifying cutting-edge existing
   and emerging `digital' solutions to combat fake medicines. Our review
   identified five distinct categories of technology including mobile,
   radio frequency identification, advanced computational methods, online
   verification, and blockchain technology.
   Expert opinion: Digital fake medicine solutions are unifying platforms
   that integrate different types of anti-counterfeiting technologies as
   complementary solutions, improve information sharing and data
   collection, and are designed to overcome existing barriers of adoption
   and implementation. Investment in this next generation technology is
   essential to ensure the future security and integrity of the global drug
   supply chain.}},

Title = {{Parameter Estimation of Convolutional and Helical Interleavers in a
   Noisy Environment}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{6151-6167}},
Abstract = {{Forward error correction (FEC) codes followed by an interleaver play a
   significant role in improving the error performance of the digital
   systems by counteracting random and burst errors. In most of the
   applications, interleaver and EEC code parameters are known at the
   receiver to successfully de interleave and decode the information bits.
   However, in certain non-cooperative applications, only partial
   information about the code and interleaver parameters is known.
   Furthermore, in cognitive radio applications, an intelligent receiver
   should adapt itself to the transmission parameters. Hence, there is a
   need to blindly estimate the EEC code and interleaver parameters in the
   mentioned applications from the received data stream with the
   availability of partial knowledge about the transmission parameters at
   the receiver. In this paper, a blind recognition of convolutional and
   helical interleaver parameters is carried out using innovative
   algorithms for unsynchronized, convolutionally encoded data in the
   presence of bit errors. In addition, the proposed algorithms also
   estimate the starting bit position for achieving proper synchronization.
   In a nutshell, it has been observed from the numerical results that the
   interleaver parameters have been estimated successfully over erroneous
   channel conditions from the proposed algorithms. Finally, the
   performances of the proposed algorithms for both the interleavers
   considering various bit error rate values have also been analyzed.}},

Title = {{Simulating Craftwork in Contemporary Architecture}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MODERN CRAFT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{37-57}},
Abstract = {{This article discusses how contemporary architects reinterpret
   traditional craft practices such as ironwork, woodwork, stonework,
   knitting, lacework, and paper craft in their building designs. It
   explores the Polish Expo Pavilion in Shanghai (2010) and Nottingham
   Contemporary (2009) in terms of digital design and manufacturing
   technology. In both buildings, the architects simulate the craftwork of
   paperwork and lacework on the facades of their buildings. Through the
   virtuosic use of CAD (computer-aided design) and CAM (computer-aided
   manufacturing), they expand the field of contemporary ornament by
   reintroducing traditional craftwork. The study argues that digital
   technology contributes to contemporary architecture as a tool for
   restoring traditions of craftwork, as much as an innovative medium for
   rendering images and presenting architecture. Simulating craftwork or
   reinterpreting handicrafts at the scale of a whole building positions
   history in a contemporary context. Renouncing Adolf Loos' remark on
   ornament as wasted labor and time, the digitally fabricated ornament is
   produced effortlessly, requiring little human labor. Yet, the worker's
   natural irregularity, or ``maker's stamp{''} in John Ruskin's terms, are
   missing from these digital fabrications: there is no defect, or trace of
   an architect's presence in digital craftwork. Being devoid of such
   criteria that usually characterize craft, the paper states that mastery
   is redefined in the age of advanced digital technology and probes the
   current emphasis given to the digital image and its surface effects.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In recent years, a range of innovative interventions for
   drug abuse treatment has been developed. The aim of the present study
   was to evaluate the effectiveness of video-based education on prevention
   of relapse and to investigate the factors that play important roles.
   Methods: This is a before-after interventional design which was carried
   out on 40 addict clients who were admitted in the three addiction
   clinics in the city of Bojnourd, North East of Iran. All participants
   completed the questionnaire before watching the educational package
   digital video/versatile disc (DVD)1 and booklet1 as a pretest and one
   month after watching the DVD2 and reading booklet2 as a post test. The
   questionnaire contained 25 questions covering five factors, including
   family's roles, items, treats, attitude toward behavior, friend's roles,
   and self-efficacy. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
   (SPSS)-16 software was applied for data analysis
   Results: The results showed that 73\% of clients have remained without a
   history of drug intake during treatment. Family roles (U = 62.5, p =
   0.011) and self-efficacy (U = 63.5, p = 0.013) were significant
   determinant factors for the effectiveness of the addiction treatment
   program.
   Conclusion: This study emphasized the effectiveness of the video-based
   education in retention of addiction treatment. It showed that the
   video-based education was an effective tool to increase family roles and
   self-efficacy in the clients.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Digital disruption offers an innovative opportunity to address
   housing affordability issues through the use of market design theory and
   two-sided matching markets. The purpose of this paper is to scope a
   model for how ``uberisation{''} can revolutionise the traditional
   apartment delivery model in Australia, leading to improved housing
   affordability.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses semi-structured interviews
   with operators of online real estate platforms and deliberative
   developers to examine how the principles of ``uberisation{''}, that is
   two-sided matching markets, are driving innovation in the apartment
   supply process.
   Findings - Findings confirm that real estate internet platforms and
   deliberative developers innovators are informed by the benefits of
   aggregating demand to reduce development risk, thus enabling apartments
   to be provided at a substantially lower price than by traditional
   methods.
   Research limitations/implications - The number of interviews is small
   reflecting the limited number of market actors currently engaged in the
   innovations investigated.
   Originality/value - This research is innovative as it introduces
   theoretical understandings gained from market design theory and applies
   those concepts to disrupt the apartment development process.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationships
   between digital technology, tangible/intangible assets and marketing
   capabilities to gain more insight into the factors related to small-and
   medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs') growth in the UK. Based on the
   resource-advantage theory, this research addresses the question ``to
   what extent does digital technology influence marketing capability which
   leads to companies' growth?{''}
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were gathered through 21 in-depth
   interviews with managers from different multinational organizations and
   six focus groups with employees.
   Findings - The study identifies the two key components of digital
   technology as information quality and service convenience. In addition,
   the relationships between digital technology, tangible/intangible assets
   and marketing capabilities perform the significant role of facilitator
   of a company's growth.
   Research limitations/implications - The focus on UK SMEs limits the
   generalizability of the results. Further studies should be conducted in
   other sectors and country settings to examine the associations
   identified in the current study.
   Originality/value - This study identifies the main impacts of digital
   technology on intellectual/physical assets. While managers and employees
   have specified that marketing capability is significant for
   organizations, there are a few other areas of concern with regard to
   consequences related to a company's growth, competence and core
   competence, particularly in an SME's setting.}},

Title = {{Managing electronic records across organizational boundaries The
   experience of the Belgian federal government in automating investigation
   processes}},
Journal = {{RECORDS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-83}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the reasons
   behind the relatively poor level of implementation of e- services. To
   this end, records management procedures in a particular Belgian federal
   administration - the Belgian Federal Public Service (FPS) Employment,
   Labor and Social Dialogue - will be studied. Based on this concrete and
   relevant case study, the authors examine how cross-organizational
   differences in terms of the implementation speed of digital workflows
   can hinder the development of innovative e-services. By doing so, the
   authors raise relevant questions about the efficacy of digital workflows
   and work processes. The impact on the consultation and exchange of
   government records among public services and toward citizens will be
   examined as well.
   Design/methodology/approach - In the context of an on-going four-year
   research project named HECTOR (Hybrid Electronic Curation,
   Transformation and Organization of Records), the study is conducted from
   an interdisciplinary approach, closely combining information sciences
   and law. Moreover, this approach also has implications on information
   sciences through the integration of archival principles at an early
   stage of conception of hybrid (paper-based and digital-based) records
   management strategies, instead of confining archivists to a depository
   and preservation role. This ``integrated archival{''} approach is highly
   encouraged to anticipate best practices for the long-term preservation
   of records (Rousseau and Couture, 1994). Furthermore, the project adopts
   a bottom-up approach based on an exploratory analysis of the
   particularities of hybrid records management within a project called ``
   e-PV{''} led by the FPS Employment, Labor and Social Dialogue to draw
   general conclusions that could eventually be applied to other public
   services. In this case study, standardized surveys were used to collect
   information from a manager perspective, followed by in- depth interviews
   with field workers.
   Findings - The miscellaneous reasons for the aforementioned poor level
   of implementation are a continuously decreasing public budget, a
   strongly rooted resistance to change, the difficult but inevitable
   cross-organizational relations between public administrations, the legal
   uncertainties arising from a fast-changing digital environment and the
   political autonomy in the decision-making process of the different
   public entities. As a consequence, the substantial differences between
   the many public administrations lead to a lack of interoperability not
   only at a technical level but also at an organizational level. The many
   local and other non-connected initiatives that this situation has
   generated do not help fostering collaboration either. The absence of
   well-established records management policies is interpreted both as a
   cause and a consequence of some of the factors mentioned before.
   Research limitations/implications - Research is carried out within
   Belgium's particularly complex administrative context, where competences
   are not only spread but also shared at multiple levels (national and
   regional) and in multiple domains (legislative and executive).
   Consequently, the political decision-making process is also highly
   complex. Nevertheless, the observations and the findings of the study
   are deemed to be applicable to any administrative structure (both
   national and international ones).
   Originality/value - This paper outlines the constraints of an almost
   completely implemented eGovernment initiative which may guide other
   public administrations in the development of their own e- services, as
   well as showing them the importance of taking into account records
   management and archiving principles. The multidisciplinary approach
   represents a significant added value.}},

   sources has to be properly collected, integrated and shared. In this
   paper, a real district scale example of urban sharing ecosystem based on

   that can be synergically applied to different sectors relevant to the
   urban context, e. g., energy and transportation, in order to create

Abstract = {{The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a severe global health
   problem. Tackling this problem requires the prudent prescribing of
   antimicrobials. This is promoted through Antimicrobial Stewardship
   Programs (ASPs). In this position paper we describe i) how a
   socio-technical multidisciplinary approach (based on the CeHRes Roadmap)
   can be applied in the development and implementation of Antimicrobial
   Stewardship technologies and ii) how this approach can be of value to
   support Antimicrobial Stewardship in practice. The CeHRes Roadmap
   entails five different phases to explore and test how an eHealth
   technology can be tailored to the target group and successfully
   implemented in practice: i) contextual inquiry, ii) value specification,
   iii) design, iv) operationalization, v) evaluation. In this position
   paper we describe the lessons learned from research and practice to
   guide future developments of technology based ASP interventions. Since
   AMR is a huge wicked problem on a global level, it requires innovative
   methods and models to empower general public and professionals to be
   proactive rather than reactive in a digitalized world. We highlight how
   to combat the dangerous rise of antimicrobial resistance in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation in learning and teaching is an everyday requirement in
   contemporary higher education (HE), especially in challenging subjects
   such as mathematics. Teaching mathematics to students with limited
   experience of formal mathematical instruction is a good example of a
   demanding pedagogical undertaking where innovatory practice can help HE
   teachers rise to the challenge. This paper presents an innovative
   game-based learning approach to the teaching of basic mathematics in HE
   through the example of a first-year mathematics module of the BSc
   Computer Science course offered by the Aberystwyth University (UK).
   Excellent examination results and positive student feedback concerning
   the learning experience point to the value-addedness of this approach in
   HE and it is, therefore, offered here as an example of good teaching
   practice to be disseminated more widely in the sector.}},

Abstract = {{The paper critiques the focus of creative industries policy on
   capability development of small and medium sized firms and the provision
   of regional incentives. It analyses factors affecting the
   competitiveness and sustainability of the games development industry and
   visual effects suppliers to feature films. Interviews with participants
   in these industries highlight the need for policy instruments to take
   into consideration the structure and organization of global markets and
   the power of lead multinational corporations. We show that although
   forms of economic governance in these industries may allow sustainable
   value capture, they are interrupted by bottlenecks in which ferocious
   competition among suppliers is confronted by comparatively little
   competition among the lead firms. We argue that current approaches to
   creative industries policy aimed at building self-sustaining creative
   industries are unlikely to be sufficient because of the globalized
   nature of the industries. Rather, we argue that a more profitable
   approach is likely to require supporting diversification of the
   industries as feeders' into other areas of the economy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to interrogate the potential and challenges in
   interdisciplinary working across disciplinary boundaries by examining a
   longitudinal partnership designed to research student experiences of
   digital technologies in undergraduate medicine established by the
   authors of this paper (one from Education and the other from Medical
   Education). The paper is situated in current methodological trends
   including the changing value of replicability and evidence-based methods
   and increases in qualitative and mixed methods studies in medical
   education, whilst education research has seen growing encouragement for
   randomized controlled trials and large-scale quantitative studies. A
   critical analysis of the partnership interactions is framed by Holland's
   positional and imagined identities, negotiated across `figured' worlds
   and the concept of epistemic games that guide knowledge construction. We
   consider social, political and cultural challenges; and how `in-between'
   sites of knowledge were established where the academic identity of each
   was shaped by engaging with the other and new theoretical,
   methodological and ethical understandings were co-constructed. The paper
   concludes that despite the ongoing challenges, `bottom-up' partnerships
   can contribute to a growth in interdisciplinarity which might itself be
   understood as a boundary object. Interdisciplinarity necessitates
   improvisation and boundary crossing and can, therefore, always be
   considered a matter of negotiation, creativity and collaboration.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{1-4}},
Abstract = {{China's economic reform has been successful, making it become a major
   economic power. Largely relied on low-cost investment, cheap and
   abundant labour and use of natural resources to support growth, China
   has faced a number of challenges including high debt to GDP, demographic
   changes and environmental degradation, along with income inequality,
   corruption and rent-seeking activities. In recent years, China's
   economic growth rate has fallen from the historic double-digit rate to
   6-7\%. Chinese Government has attempted to rebalance its economy to
   achieve a ``new normal{''} of slower but more sustainable economic
   development. This special issue aims to raise discussions concerning the
   ways in which further reform of the Chinese economy can be conducted in
   the context of challenges and opportunities of the new normal. The issue
   comprises five papers that exhibit special insights of interest,
   including the discussions on drivers of economic growth, the role of
   government policy played in economic growth in the coming decades, the
   importance of innovation and government institutions in firm
   performance, the impact of capital structural on firm competitiveness,
   as well as the relationship between the use of social networks and wages
   of rural-urban migrant workers.}},

Title = {{Research Strategies for Biomedical and Health Informatics}},
Journal = {{METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{E1-E10}},
Abstract = {{Medical informatics, or biomedical and health informatics (BMHI), has
   become an established scientific discipline. In all such disciplines
   there is a certain inertia to persist in focusing on well-established
   research areas and to hold on to well-known research methodologies
   rather than adopting new ones, which may be more appropriate.
   Objectives: To search for answers to the following questions: What are
   research fields in informatics, which are not being currently adequately
   addressed, and which methodological approaches might be insufficiently
   used? Do we know about reasons? What could be consequences of change for
   research and for education?
   Methods: Outstanding informatics scientists were invited to three panel
   sessions on this topic in leading international conferences (MIE 2015,
   Medinfo 2015, HEC 2016) in order to get their answers to these
   questions.
   Results: A variety of themes emerged in the set of answers provided by
   the panellists. Some panellists took the theoretical foundations of the
   field for granted, while several questioned whether the field was
   actually grounded in a strong theoretical foundation. Panellists
   proposed a range of suggestions for new or improved approaches,
   methodologies, and techniques to enhance the BMHI research agenda.
   Conclusions: The field of BMHI is on the one hand maturing as an
   academic community and intellectual endeavour. On the other hand
   vendor-supplied solutions may be too readily and uncritically accepted
   in health care practice. There is a high chance that BMHI will continue
   to flourish as an important discipline; its innovative interventions
   might then reach the original objectives of advancing science and
   improving health care outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Waterway transport, depending on the availability of safe controls,
   navigation and communication systems, is obliged to pay special
   attention to the technological updating of industry, the implementation
   of high-performance automation systems, the use of innovative
   technologies. To store and transfer such vast amounts of information
   relevant automation system is required, which allows making the entire
   procedure of processing the documents of various kinds safe. Thus, the
   development of information technologies in transport companies and, in
   particular, on ships is directly related to the establishment of
   information processing systems. The scope of this paper is the
   development and analysis of algorithms for implementation of the digital
   watermark (DWM) on the basis of the brightness modulation in blocks of
   graphic documents, allowing at the same time providing covert insertion
   of any sequence of a given amount of information and authentication of
   the image, in which Digital Watermark was incorporated. To enhance the
   robustness of embedded digital watermark attachments, it is required to
   apply the same transformations in compression of graphic documents in
   stegoalgorithm like in the compression algorithms for these files. (C)

Abstract = {{Increasingly the convergence of natural environment (land, water, air
   and life), built environment (housing, buildings, transportation and
   infrastructure) and digital environment (computing power, the internet,
   big data, and technology) is shaping the economies and societies. Smart
   living is taking root. Mass customization of products and services is
   preferred over mass production. Businesses wish to serve an individual
   customer at a competitive cost comparable to the mass production cost,
   with shortest possible development time and production time. This
   requires manufacturing to change from a more labour intensive processes
   to information technology enabled mechanical processes. Digital
   manufacturing is a broader concept of manufacturing innovation in which
   the digital and material advancements enable the company to conceive
   products in a desired style and quantity in time scales shorter than the
   conventional methods while efficiently managing the entire product
   lifecycle. It is about defining manufacturing processes and managing
   manufacturing process information via full digital product definition.
   It encompasses visualization, manufacturing simulation, ergonomic and
   human factor analyses, holistic view of product and process design, and
   product design sensitive to the process constraints and capabilities.
   This article emphasizes the need and driving forces for adopting digital
   manufacturing, transformation of manufacturing to smart manufacturing,
   present applications and future scope of digital manufacturing. (C) 2016

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Segregation determination in the asphalt pavement is an issue causing
   many disputes between agencies and contractors. The visual inspection
   method has commonly been used to determine pavement texture and in-place
   core density test used for verification. Furthermore, laser-based
   devices, such as the Florida Texture Meter (FTM) and the Circular Track
   Meter (CTM), have recently been developed to evaluate the asphalt
   mixture texture. In this study, an innovative digital image processing
   approach is used to determine pavement segregation. In this procedure,
   the standard deviation of the grayscale image frequency histogram is
   used to determine segregated regions. Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA)
   is then implemented on the obtained standard deviations from image
   processing to classify pavements into the segregated and nonsegregated
   areas. The visual inspection method is utilized to verify this method.
   The results have demonstrated that this new method is a robust tool to
   determine segregated areas in newly paved FC9.5 pavement types.}},

Abstract = {{The digital revolution is transforming contemporary society. Connective
   intelligence is an emerging property deriving from the embedding of
   intelligence into the connected data, concepts, applications, and
   people. Furthermore, the progress in behavioral-basic robotics opens new
   fields of innovative investigation.
   In this challenging context, might it make sense to provide machines
   with dreaming-like functions? Indeed, machine inactivity can be
   assimilated to the sleep state of living beings. Furthermore, when
   dreaming, we can interact with what we take to be other individuals and
   things and, in certain respects, the same happens in the virtual world.
   This paper highlights some new directions that have emerged in the field
   of Artificial Intelligence, focusing on the total Turing test and

Abstract = {{This article analyses dissertations produced by the first class of the
   Master's Program in Education: Theory and Practice of Teaching from
   Universidade Federal de Parana (UFPR, Brazil), emphasizing the identity
   construction of this teacher education program. We considered these
   proposals and the research results as possible contributions to the
   school reality that qualify the goals of the Program. On the basis of
   documentary analysis of the 19 dissertations defended in 2015 by the
   first class of master students, which are catalogued in the digital
   collection of the UFPR Library, we looked for the effects of the
   research instrumentation offered by the Program, the capacity of
   reflection, autonomy, elucidation of own experiences and possible
   interventions in the authors' professional contexts. We grouped
   dissertations in three thematic axes: the first analyses possible
   experiences in a field; the second analyses instruments from outside the
   field; the third analyses the environment. In the concluded studies we
   could identify: i) tendencies to explore experience as a way to
   contribute to the field; ii) tendencies to privilege technology to
   innovate practice; iii) tendencies to problematize the school
   environment in its effects and counter-effects upon professional
   development and conditions of professionality.}},

   we conduct a Toulminian analysis of arguments made at a
   cross-disciplinary symposium at Duke Law School on information goods and
   the public domain. We find that there are two logics underlying
   arguments on issues related to information goods: what we describe as
   digital and analog logics. We also identify five argument
   categoriesprofit motive, economic efficiency, innovation, ethics and
   fundamental rights, and temporalityand two different time frames used
   for judging impactsproximal and distal. We conclude with a number of
   theory-generating propositions and a provocation for our conceptions of

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HERITAGE STUDIES}},

Pages = {{408-420}},
Abstract = {{The democratisation of heritage through digital access is a
   well-documented aspiration. It has included innovative ways to manage
   interpretation, express heritage values, and create experiences through
   the `decoding' of heritage. This decoding of heritage becomes
   democratised, more polyvocal than didactic exhibitions, and less
   dependent on experts. However, the decision of what `heritage' is and
   what is commissioned for digitisation (the encoding) is not necessarily
   a part of this democratisation. This paper will consider how
   digitisation reinforces the Authorised Heritage Discourse through the
   lens of Stephen Lukes' three (increasingly subtle) dimensions of power:
   conflict resolution, control of expression and shaping of preferences.
   All three dimensions have an impact on how public values are represented
   in heritage contexts, but the introduction of digitisation requires more
   resources, expertise and training within established professional
   discourse. Social media may have a positive impact on the first two
   dimensions, but can reinforce hegemony. Alternatives are subject to
   epistemic populism. The role of digitisation and social media in the
   democratisation of heritage needs to be better understood. Questions
   regarding the nature and process of digital interaction, in terms of
   whose heritage is accessible, affect the very issues of democratisation
   digitisation appears to promote.}},

Abstract = {{Methods and principles of Lean Production have become the major concepts
   to create highly efficient processes since the early 1990s. Due to its
   high effectiveness by reducing complexity and focusing on value-adding
   tasks, the Lean concept is still successful. Nevertheless, its
   changeability to produce highly customised products is limited. Industry
   4.0 describes the vision of a smart production which can meet these
   future market requirements. Enablers are innovative information and
   communication technologies and the integration of all production
   entities into a common digital network. Lean Automation is the
   application of Industry 4.0 technologies to Lean Production methods in
   order to combine benefits from both domains. First proprietary Lean
   Automation solutions exist, but to enhance changeability in production,
   a common, unified communication interface is required. This paper
   presents the ongoing work towards an interface for digitising Lean
   Production methods using Cyber Physical Systems.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines relationships between economic and social
   inequality and digitally mediated communication. Differences between
   instrumental and critical approaches in the digital divide literature
   are considered to highlight the limitations of the former approaches and
   the ways these are reflected in European policy. What we know about the
   relationship between technological innovation and society and its
   consequences for economic and social inequality is summarised and
   emerging expressions of inequality between humans and their digital
   machines are discussed. With computational models, algorithms and
   machine learning becoming more pervasive, it is argued that human beings
   are at risk of losing the ability to control the digitally mediated
   environment. Policy measures create incentives for small shifts in
   corporate digital platform strategy that amount to tinkering with the
   overall direction of technological innovation. The article emphasises
   the need for an inclusive dialogue to reveal potential alternative
   directions that might take better account of what people value in their
   digitally mediated lives.}},

Title = {{An ECC-Based Blind Signcryption Scheme for Multiple Digital Documents}},
Journal = {{SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{The popularity of the Internet has comprehensively altered the
   traditional way of communication and interaction patterns, such as
   e-contract negotiations, e-payment services, or digital credential
   processes. In the field of e-form systems, a number of studies
   investigate the ability of the blind signature to fulfill the basic
   properties of blindness and untraceability. However, most literatures
   exploring the blind signature mechanisms only address research and
   technology pertaining to single blind signature issues. Further, most of
   the topics only deal with signing rather than encryption. Thus, we
   propose a new blind signature scheme for multiple digital documents
   based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Our scheme incorporates the
   design of signcryption paradigm into the blind signature scheme to
   strengthen high levels of security. This innovative method also enhances
   computational efficiency during processing multiple electronic documents
   since the ECC provides a shorter key length and higher processing speed
   than other public-key cryptosystems on equivalent secrecy. The analysis
   results show that the present scheme achieves better performance at low
   communication overheads as well as with higher level of security. By
   helping the design of the intrinsic properties, the proposed
   cryptosystem can be applied to many areas to protect sensitive data in
   ubiquitous computing environments.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of reading is a key element of sociocultural activities.
   Importantly, reading is ``built in{''} media consumption in general. No
   less important is that the media environment of modern society has been
   going through a profound transformation last 5 to 7 years. Within these
   circumstances, the project focusses on the following research questions.
   What is the place of reading (newspapers, magazines, books both printed
   and electronic) in today's media consumption? How television and various
   online activities affect reading? What determines electronic book
   consumption nowadays? What are the social consequences of ever more
   popular digital reading?
   Empirical data came from representative surveys of communication
   behavior of urban population in Russia (15+ years old; year 2010:
   N=3000, and 2014: N=2100). Formalized personal interviews at home have
   been used. Several statistical procedures used for testing our
   hypotheses, including logistic regression.
   The research proves that using electronic devices for reading books,
   newspapers and magazines is gaining popularity among Russian audiences.
   We found that preference for digital reading is primarily predicted by
   sociodemographic variables, incumbent practice of other media usage, and
   ownership of new communication devices. Social implications of digital
   reading are analyzed using concepts of media displacement and
   mediatization. We assume that digital reading is changing earlier
   practices of text perception as well as cognition in general. The
   results are discussed within the context of today's discourse about the
   place of reading in connection with: information overload of
   contemporary people; diminishing traditional consumption of books;
   traits of new digital generations; and the dilemma of ``book{''} versus
   ``screen{''} culture which is an essential part of modern and postmodern
   personality. Discussing Russian prospects, we use cross-country
   comparisons that allow us to show the varying pace of innovation in book
   consumption and the role of social and cultural context.}},

Abstract = {{Strasbourg IHU is a surgical centre dedicated to the management of
   digestive diseases, specialized in minimally invasive technologies. This
   organisation produces and aggregates large amounts of information, which
   needs to be shared within IHU. This organisation decided to create a
   dedicated digital service to fulfil three goals: share information
   stored within a knowledge base, get up-to-date pertinent news about the
   minimally invasive surgery sector, and allow interactions among the
   large variety of profiles (experts, surgeons, companies, etc.).
   IS4RI is a structure that supports the design, development, integration
   and use of information systems to help research and innovation. IS4RI
   implemented CERIF as a data structure for the knowledge base, using a
   web-based platform and dedicated specific modules to integrate the
   market watch and social networking functions. This paper describes the
   analysis and realisation phases of the project, with a focus on the use
   of CERIF as a structure for a knowledge base. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Title = {{Conquering in emerging markets: critical success factors to enhance
   supply chain performance}},
Journal = {{BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},

Pages = {{570-593}},
Abstract = {{Purpose- In the context of emerging economies, the purpose of this paper
   is to seek the critical success factors (CSFs) of supply chain and
   identify their relationships to enhance the supply chain performance
   (SCP) in a sample of Indian manufacturing firms.
   Design/methodology/approach-On the basis of a comprehensive literature
   review, the authors conducted this study and proposed a new model of
   antecedent and outcomes for SCP in emerging markets. The empirical data
   for this study were drawn from a survey of 227 Indian firms, resulting
   in a response rate of 52 percent. The method of confirmatory factor
   analysis was applied to refine the CSFs and SCP scale for empirical
   analysis. The data were analyzed by employing the structural equation
   modeling technique.
   Findings- The results reveal that all the identified CSFs, namely,
   agility, flexibility, flexible innovation, information and communication
   technology, collaboration among conglomerate divisions, process
   structure, and training and leadership programs, are positively
   associated with SCP. The empirical study of 227 Indian firms lent good
   support to the hypotheses and validates it by the data analysis.
   Consequently, these findings highlight the prominence of these factors
   of supply chain for gaining a sustainable competitive advantage in
   emerging market scenario.
   Research limitations/implications- The study emphasizes on CSFs in
   emerging markets that will help to boost the organization's SCP through
   agility and flexibility in supply chain. This study is applicable for
   growing markets in which there is ample amount of resources.
   Originality/value- As economic growth stagnates in developed economies,
   emerging markets grow at near double-digit rates. Somehow, this study is
   pioneer in terms of enhance SCP in emerging market scenario. Moreover,
   the outcome of the study could provide empirical evidence of the effects
   of CSFs on SCPs.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine theoretically and
   empirically what type of leadership facilitates e-business adoption in
   large manufacturing firms. The digital transformation of firms requires
   leadership that can promote the adaptive quality of organizational
   culture.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an empirical study
   using two key informants from a sample of 181 incumbent firms.
   Findings - The authors find significant evidence that adaptive culture
   is the vehicle by which transformational leaders positively influence
   e-business adoption.
   Originality/value - Given the digital economy's external pressures, many
   e-business adoption processes fail due to organizational factors
   originating in leadership and its capability to change followers'
   values, norms, and motivations. To solve this problem, the authors
   propose a model that explains how transformational leadership first
   plays a key role in changing characteristics of culture and then
   facilitates e- business adoption.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of research activity of trainees' activation in the
   educational-research laboratory ``Electric Circuits{''} using innovative
   methodological solutions and digital technologies is considered. The
   main task is in creation of the unified experimental research
   information-educational environment ``Electrical Engineering{''}. The
   problems arising during the developing and application of the modern
   software and hardware, experimental and research stands and digital
   control and measuring systems are presented. This paper presents the
   main stages of development and creation of educational-research
   laboratory ``Electrical Circuits{''} at the Department of Electrical
   Engineering of NRNU MEPhI. The authors also consider the analogues of
   the described research complex offered by various educational
   institutions and companies. The analysis of their strengths and
   weaknesses, on which the advantages of the proposed solution are based,
   is held.}},

Abstract = {{How do violent world events motivate online news-seeking? And are
   dynamics similar across national publics? For answers, I unobtrusively
   measured four years of U.S. and Pakistani Internet searches about drone
   strikes merged with data on strikes, news coverage, and related events.
   Results show news-seeking in both countries rises after strikes kill top
   militant leaders and after major drone-related events. News coverage
   responds similarly to events, and news independently mobilizes searches.
   Thus, news-seeking in both countries jointly reflects audience interests
   and news agenda-setting dynamics. Methodologically, Google Trends
   provides innovative means to study online news-seeking with unobtrusive,
   cross-national measures complementing other methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a focused collaborative learning and teaching
   research project between the Dance Department at Middlesex University
   and partner institution London Studio Centre. Informed by Belinda
   Allen's research on creative curriculum design, dance students and
   lecturers shared innovative learning opportunities to enhance the
   development of the creative dance graduate. The key motivation was to
   explore practices in the modules on both institutions' undergraduate
   programmes in which choreography is located. Interdisciplinary, peer and
   audience discussions surrounding students' work were fostered during
   Scratch nights and via hash-tag chats on Twitter. In this discussion we
   demonstrate that these discursive and participatory practices have value
   for future dance artists entering the professional field. We evaluate
   the research outcomes with focus on language, critical confidence and
   risk taking with the view of better shaping students' overall learning
   opportunities in a collaborative dance network to support their
   individual development as artists.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to identify asbestos-containing materials (ACM) through
   the use of innovative technology such as aerial hyperspectral sensors.
   The development of operational methodologies and ad hoc processing were
   also applied for the purpose of this study. The activity was part of the
   ICT Living Labs DroMEP project carried out by Water Research Institute
   of the National Research Council (IRSA-CNR) and Servizi di Informazione
   Territoriale S.r.l. (SIT Srl). This was funded by the Apulia Region to
   support the growth and development of specialized SMEs in offering
   digital content and services. Uncontrolled abandoned wastes pose a
   threat to the human health and ecosystem. The presence of harmful or
   dangerous substances released without any control can become a dangerous
   source of pollution. Many areas of the Apulia region generally, in
   southern Italy, are subjected to this type of phenomena because most
   often, these areas are not easily accessible to Authorities for the
   control and management of the territory. Land monitoring and
   characterization operations would be carried out in a very long time and
   would require significant financial resources and considerable effort if
   done by conventional methods. The project activities include the testing
   and integration of several technologies already available, but not
   engineered for specific purposes. The work has been focused on the
   development of a methodology with a defined and high reliability capable
   of identifying the presence of ACM in various piles of rubbish abandoned
   in agro-ecosystems. The developed methodology analyses the spectral
   behaviour of ACM highlighting and emphasizing certain features through
   the use of a procedure based on an if-then-else control structure. It
   also allows the selection of the most effective features to combine that
   significantly reduces the number of false positives.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Latin America, in general terms, is a continent with
   several contextual levels, which depend on historic, economic, political
   and social characteristics. Despite all this, there are spects - such as
   digital divide- that occur again, to a greater or lesser extent, in the
   different Latin American countries. This digital divide promotes
   partially disconnected - and thus, invisiblesocieties, and tends to slow
   down possibilities of innovation and development of digital journalism.
   Methodology: In this study, and from the methodology proposed by
   Rodriguez, Codina \& Pedraza (2012), we have analysed the management of
   interactivity in the main cybermedia in Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador in
   2016. Results and conclusions: The results show a generally low
   implementation of interactivity options in digital ecosystems in these
   three Latin American countries.}},

Title = {{TEACHERS' READINESS TO IMPLEMENT DIGITAL CURRICULUM IN KUWAITI SCHOOLS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{105-126}},
Abstract = {{Aim/Purpose The goal of this study was to investigate how Kuwaiti
   teachers perceive their own readiness to implement digital curriculum in
   public schools, and the factors that affect Kuwaiti teachers' readiness
   to implement digital curriculum from their perspectives.
   Background In order to shift from the traditional instructional
   materials to digital and more innovative resources, teachers have to be
   prepared for the transformational curriculum. Teachers need to acquire
   all the technical and pedagogical skills that enable them to integrate
   digital technology effectively and efficiently into the school
   curriculum.
   Methodology Using a mixed-method research methodology, a random sample
   of 532 teachers participated in an online survey to determine the level
   of their readiness. In addition, semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with a sub sample of the participants (21) to explore the
   factors that affect their readiness. The researchers developed and
   implemented a technology readiness survey in two domains (technical and
   pedagogical).
   Contribution The study demonstrated that Kuwaiti teachers were not
   highly ready to implement the digital curriculum, and some issues should
   be considered to ensure the digital curriculum is effectively
   implemented.
   Findings Teachers are moderately ready for implementation of the digital
   curriculum in both components of readiness (technical and pedagogical).
   Teachers identified some factors that that hinder their readiness. These
   factors are related to time constraints, knowledge and skills,
   infrastructure, and technical support.
   Recommendations for Practitioners This paper will guide curriculum
   decision makers to find the best ways to help and support teachers to
   effectively implement the digital.
   Future Research Follow up studies may examine the effectiveness of
   teacher education programs in preparing students teachers to implement
   the digital curriculum, and the role of education decision makers in
   facilitating the implementation of the digital curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an innovative process to fabricate Cu foil parts via
   temperature-assisted laser micropeen forming (LMPF). A systematic
   experimental apparatus, including laser device, temperature controller
   and forming unit, was established. LMPF experiments of Cu foil were
   performed at temperatures of 25, 100, 130,160 and 190 degrees C,
   respectively. The associated morphologies of specimen were observed by a
   digital microscope, and the effects of temperature on contour shape and
   forming limit, as well as the springback under warm conditions were
   analysed. A nanoindentation test was performed on the deformed specimens
   to study the variation of nanohardness and elastic modulus at different
   temperatures. The results show that temperature-assisted LMPF can
   significantly improve the microforming precision by comparing the
   surface profiles. In addition, the nanohardness and modulus were both
   increased in the formed region while compared with as-received material.
   An optimal forming temperature of 160 degrees C was obtained, and the
   forming precision can be increased by 38\%. The investigation provides a
   theoretical and technical reference for engineering applications of warm
   LMPF of metal foils.}},

Abstract = {{A good deal of research and practice on digital innovation public sector
   projeCts takes for granted a stability change dichotomy which positions
   these two phenomena as opposite and difficult to conciliate. In this
   area There is a shortage of studies focusing on how projects as the main
   vehicles for digital innovation could mediate between change and
   stability in the public sector. To address this gap this paper proposes
   Discursive Institutionalism (DI) to better understand the dynamics of
   this type of projects. A case study of a multi-actor project in the
   Albanian context extends the scope of the analysis to the transitional
   institutional environment in which the project unfolded. Findings
   suggest that large-scale multi-actor digital innovation public sector
   projects can not only be seen as temporary endeavors but also as
   strategic points of interaction for multifaceted stakeholders whose
   ideas and discourses could converge at levels of policies, programs and
   philosophies in order to keep required stability in the face of change.
   Using DI, a number of propositions are formulated and empirically
   validated to draw insights and implications for future project policy
   formulation, research and practice. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Feedback is known to have a large influence on student learning gains,
   and the emergence of online tools has greatly enhanced the opportunity
   for delivering timely, expressive, digital feedback and for
   investigating its learning impacts. However, to date there have been no
   large quantitative investigations of the feedback provided by large
   teams of markers, feedback use by large cohorts of students, nor its
   impact on students' academic performance across successive assessment
   tasks. We have developed an innovative online system to collect
   large-scale data on digital feedback provision and use. Our markers
   (n=38) used both audio and typed feedback modalities extensively,
   providing 388 +/- 4 and 1126 +/- 37 words per report for first- and
   second-year students, respectively. Furthermore, 92\% of first year and
   85\% of second-year students accessed their feedback, with 58\%
   accessing their feedback for over an hour. Lastly, the amount of time
   students spent interacting with feedback is significantly related to the
   rate of improvement in subsequent assessment tasks. This study
   challenges assertions that many students do not collect, or use, their
   feedback. More importantly, we offer novel insights into the
   relationships between feedback provision, feedback use and successful
   academic outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{From 2013-2015, I was a Mitacs Elevate postdoctoral fellow with Mozilla.
   The program of research aimed to foster digital literacy capacities
   among youth and informal educators in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and
   specifically examined the extension of the Mozilla community's free and
   open source software production practices to build a digital literacy
   network called Hive Toronto. This article presents results from a
   document analysis (n = 21) of applications, blogs, and other materials
   revealing how the people, challenge, practices, and results associated
   with social innovation unfolded through research with Hive Toronto.
   Based on these findings, the article demonstrates that tensions linger
   between industrial and social innovation funding, but that there is
   space for critical and activist research when building such
   partnerships.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{143}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is the only
   potentially curable form of pulmonary hypertension. Rapid and accurate
   diagnosis is pivotal for successful treatment. Clinical signs and
   symptoms can be nonspecific and risk factors such as history of venous
   thromboembolism may not always be present. Echocardiography is the
   recommended first diagnostic step. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a
   complementary tool that can help to identify patients with milder
   abnormalities and chronic thromboembolic disease, triggering the need
   for further investigation. Ventilation/perfusion (V'/Q') scintigraphy is
   the imaging methodology of choice to exclude CTEPH. Single photon
   emission computed tomography V'/Q' is gaining popularity over planar
   imaging. Assessment of pulmonary haemodynamics by right heart
   catheterisation is mandatory, although there is increasing interest in
   noninvasive haemodynamic evaluation. Despite the status of digital
   subtraction angiography as the gold standard, techniques such as
   computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging are increasingly
   used for characterising the pulmonary vasculature and assessment of
   operability. Promising new tools include dual-energy CT, combination of
   rotational angiography and cone beam CT, and positron emission
   tomography. These innovative procedures not only minimise misdiagnosis,
   but also provide additional vascular information relevant to treatment
   planning. Further research is needed to determine how these modalities
   will fit into the diagnostic algorithm for CTEPH.}},

Abstract = {{Along with other cultural organizations, newspapers, through waves of
   digital disruption, have become subject to a dominant narrative of
   crisis. But newspapers have long participated in change. A
   constructivist approach, qualified by consideration of media
   materiality, draws attention to diverse but essential processes of
   innovation around them. We see a contraflow of migration from digital to
   print, opening up a shared media space; bonding strategies are bringing
   multimedia to ink on paper, while bridging via boundary objects such as
   QR (Quick Response) codes are connecting the two. Among other
   initiatives, development of automation of news production and
   experiments with transparency are further evidence of an active embrace
   of change by newspapers that calls into question the discourse on their
   demise. This analysis inductively develops a nuanced account of the role
   of the newspaper as an object and as an institution. It suggests a
   hybrid, multifaceted, enduring presence of print in the complex media
   ecology of the future.}},

Title = {{Lighting assessment of ergonomic workstation for radio diagnostic
   reporting}},

Abstract = {{Within the diagnostic process, in the activities in which digital
   radiology systems are utilised, image display devices play a very
   important role. Such devices have to guarantee high performances in
   order to maintain the diagnostic quality of the displayed images and
   present them so that they can be observed optimally. In order to ensure
   the appropriate performance to the users, not only the image display
   device but also the whole workstation should be designed properly.
   Particular attention should be paid to the lighting conditions, to avoid
   compromising the radiologist's ability to observe the displayed images.
   The aim of this study is to assess the lighting of some workstations
   used for diagnostic radiology reporting, in order to obtain information
   about the visual interaction between worker and device and prevent
   health risks. A detailed analysis of the lighting of adjustable and
   nonadjustable workstations used for diagnostic radiology reporting was
   carried out in different rooms of the Radiology Department at the
   ``Felice Lotti{''} Hospital in Pontedera (Pisa, Italy). The analysis was
   carried out thanks to in situ measurements (objective analysis) and the
   submission of an evaluation questionnaire to a sample composed by 16
   radiologists (subjective analysis).
   From the obtained results it has been possible to point out that, in
   nonadjustable workstations the absence of a dedicated lighting system
   very often reveals the inadequacy of the general lighting in
   guaranteeing correct lighting conditions for the radiologists during the
   reading of the diagnostic monitors. As measure to reduce the visual
   fatigue of the radiologists, the use of a supplementary adjustable
   innovative LED backlight system was proposed. The use of the LED
   backlight system allows complying the requirements of the Technical
   Standards and mitigate the difference of luminance in the field of view
   of the radiologist. Due to that the use of the LED backlight system has
   been positively perceived by the examined sample, a significant part of
   whom has ascribed to this use a reduction in the visual fatigue. (C)

Title = {{Factors impacting the adoption of m-banking: understanding brand India's
   potential for financial inclusion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ASIA BUSINESS STUDIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{22-40}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study has been to understand brand India's
   potential for financial inclusion in the future. As, digital channels
   like mobile banking (m-banking) are likely to provide better coverage
   and more cost-effective services to the unbanked population of India.
   Conventional banking might not be cost-effective for low-ticket-size
   transactions, hence financial inclusion, which is on the ``Digital
   India{''} agenda of the Government of India (GoI), might not be
   feasible. However, to understand brand India's potential for financial
   inclusion in the future, it would be essential to understand Indian
   customers' attitudes toward m-banking, especially those who have not yet
   adopted it. This would bring out the potential of m-banking as a channel
   to drive financial inclusion based on customers' intentions to adopt it.
   Until every Indian has access to a wider range of financial services,
   there cannot be financial inclusion. Similarly, until every Indian
   adopts digital channels to access a wider range of financial and
   non-financial services, the GoI's initiatives for ``Digital India{''}
   cannot be realized. Furthermore, a review of the literature suggests
   that there are very few studies concerning m-banking worldwide and still
   fewer in the context of India.
   Design/methodology/approach - The present study used IBM SPSS and Amos
   software to test the conceptual model developed using secondary data.
   Findings - The findings of the study suggest that subjective norm,
   output quality and personal innovativeness have impacts on the perceived
   usefulness of, and attitudes toward, the ultimate adoption of m-banking.
   Originality/value - The paper is the original work of the authors. An
   attempt has been made to integrate all the existing literature on
   m-banking to develop a complete model for the technology's adoption.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of the article are the psychological and anthropological
   issues related to the design and deployment of innovative forms of
   educational anthropopractice in the modern media environment. The author
   analyzes the possibilities of humanitarian technologies from the point
   of view of prospects of their use in media educational space. Personal
   development, self-determination, freedom of choice of creative forms of
   self-realization, continuous education in the context of radical changes
   in the environment of a growing and professional development - is
   conceptualized as a ``pedagogical task{''}. The meaningful frame of the
   author's essay on the means and opportunities of personal development in
   the modern media environment are formed by the analysis of factors of
   medial transformations of the universal conditions of the development of
   culture and civilization. The author emphasizes such features of changes
   in the socio-cultural environment as the increase in uncertainty,
   complexity, velocity and diversity of flows of information; formation of
   mass culture of appearance; hypertext structure, the dominance of the
   simulacra and the predominance of the visual language of the Digital
   Universe; a new ``digital{''} formats of interaction and cooperation and
   so on. The consideration of this issue in psycho-anthropological terms
   brings to the fore the issues of development consciousness/awareness,
   values, ideals, subjectivity and positional feature of their own
   existence; reflexive-hermeneutic ability of the creative consciousness
   of themselves. The article describes the conceptual basis and practical
   principles, the author's reflexive-positional approach to situations
   conducive to personal development in the media environment. The author
   shows the importance of developing the capability to understand
   metaphorical language of media image as the necessary basis for the
   formation of subject position socio-cultural identity and philosophical
   ideals. A brief review of authors ` media education technologies is
   given: scene-activity-modeling technology and media hermeneutic.
   According to the author challenges spiritual, cultural and civil
   self-determination in search of their own socio-cultural identity and
   ways of self-realization can and must be resolved by the means and in
   the environment of media education practices, the
   theoretical-methodological design, the reflection of which seems
   necessary and timely.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{56-67}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to evaluate how different acquisition
   geometries and reconstruction parameters affect the performance of four
   digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) systems (Senographe Essential - GE,
   Mammomat Inspiration -Siemens, Selenia Dimensions - Hologic and Amulet
   Innovality - Fujifilm) on the basis of a physical characterization.
   Average Glandular Dose (AGD) and image quality parameters such as
   in-plane/in-depth resolution, signal difference to noise ratio (SDNR)
   and artefact spread function (ASF) were examined.
   Measured AGD values resulted below EUREF limits for 2D imaging. A large
   variability was recorded among the investigated systems: the mean dose
   ratio DBT/2D ranged between 1.1 and 1.9.
   In-plane resolution was in the range: 2.2 mm (1)-3.8 mm (1) in chest
   wall-nipple direction. A worse resolution was found for all devices in
   tube travel direction.
   In-depth resolution improved with increasing scan angle but was also
   affected by the choice of reconstruction and post-processing algorithms.
   The highest z-resolution was provided by Siemens (50 degrees, FWHM = 2.3
   mm) followed by GE (25 degrees, FWHM = 2.8 mm), while the Fujifilm HR
   showed the lowest one, despite its wide scan angle (40 degrees, FWHM =
   4.1 mm).
   The ASF was dependent on scan angle: smaller range systems showed wider
   ASF curves; however a clear relationship was not found between scan
   angle and ASF, due to the different post processing and reconstruction

Abstract = {{Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare the
   accuracy and time efficiency of an indirect and direct digitalization
   workflow with that of a three-dimensional (3D) printer in order to
   identify the most suitable method for orthodontic use. Method and
   Materials: A master model was measured with a coordinate measuring
   instrument. The distances measured were the intercanine width, the
   intermolar width, and the dental arch length. Sixty-four scans were
   taken with each of the desktop scanners R900 and R700 (3Shape), the
   intraoral scanner TRIOS Color Pod (3Shape), and the Promax 3D Mid cone
   beam computed tomography (CBCT) unit (Planmeca). All scans were measured
   with measuring software. One scan was selected and printed 37 times on
   the D35 stereolithographic 3D printer (Innovation MediTech). The printed
   models were measured again using the coordinate measuring instrument.
   Results: The most accurate results were obtained by the R900. The R700
   and the TRIOS intraoral scanner showed comparable results.
   CBCT-3D-rendering with the Promax 3D Mid CBCT unit revealed
   significantly higher accuracy with regard to dental casts than dental
   impressions. 3D printing offered a significantly higher level of
   deviation than digitalization with desktop scanners or an intraoral
   scanner. The chairside time required for digital impressions was 27\%
   longer than for conventional impressions. Conclusion: Conventional
   impressions, model casting, and optional digitization with desktop
   scanners remains the recommended workflow process. For orthodontic
   demands, intraoral scanners are a useful alternative for full-arch
   scans. For prosthodontic use, the scanning scope should be less than one
   quadrant and three add itional teeth.}},

   transmedia production and collaborative processes that arise within its
   development. Also, successful experiences that are committed to the
   incursion of this new practice in education are discussed. It is
   concluded that as the transmedia production trends have become a social
   phenomenon that comes amid digital convergence, offering opportunities
   to see and rethink reality through creative and collaborative writing;

Abstract = {{This article discusses an innovative experiment in transforming citizen
   journalism from a general discourse to a specific set of criteria that
   can be reproduced in classroom settings. Specifically, it discusses how
   the Rio de Janeiro-based non-governmental organization Viva Rio created
   a set of classes called Citizen Health Journalism that attempted to
   train community health workers (titled ``health agents{''}) in the
   technical and philosophical dimensions of this mode of journalistic
   production. The classes looked to capitalize on the unique identities of
   these agents. Recruited from the favelas (or unincorporated urban slums)
   of Rio to be public health workers within their own communities, these
   individuals had both the life experiences (as residents) and
   professional experience (as healthcare workers) to offer unique insights
   about their communities. Drawing on an in-depth analysis of training
   materials and participant observation in 2013 at the training courses, I
   argue that while turning citizen journalism into a curriculum can help
   make the discourse more accessible to neophytes, it also potentially
   sacrifices the convictions and attitudes that encourage individuals to
   act as citizen journalists in the first place.}},

Abstract = {{In May 2013, Wired celebrated the magazine's 20th anniversary by
   restating Louis Rossetto's claim from the first issue that `{''}{[}t]
   here are a lot of magazines about technology{''}. Wired is not one of
   them' (from http://www.wired.com/magazine/wired-20th-anniversary/;
   accessed on 3 July 2013). This article agrees by arguing that Wired in
   its formative years also should be seen as a men's lifestyle magazine,
   which-in contrast to the category's usual focus on fashion, sex and
   leisure-was characterised by a specific type of anticipatory and utopian
   engagement with innovation and technology that sought to carve out a
   better life by breaching the boundaries between work/leisure and
   writer/reader. By focusing more broadly on technology as `culture' Wired
   thus allowed for a negotiation of masculinity premised on both work and
   production and leisure and consumption and thus a new way of weaving the
   `authentic' into the contemporary and digital landscape of consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the feasibility of
   using the Evernote note-taking application in research consultation as a
   way to respond to the challenges of doing research in the twenty-first
   century digital environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study examines the results of surveys
   conducted at the time of research consultation and at the end of the
   semester when the students had completed the research needed for their
   assignments.
   Findings - The study found that students are open to having a tool like
   Evernote used in the research consultation and that the tool can be
   helpful in organizing the information and search terms discussed in the
   consultation.
   Research limitations/implications - Due to the size of the sample in the
   study, further research with a larger sample size should be conducted.
   Practical implications - This paper outlines a promising method of
   collaborating and documenting resources in the research consultation.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to show the methodological route carried
   out to develop a questionnaire to estimate the educational digital
   skills of students of a Mexican public university as well as to show
   evidence of construct validity through structural equation modeling. The
   development of a questionnaire based on four dimensions is described:
   management of information, communication, organization and portable
   technology. We draw on expert consultation for the delimitation of the
   factors, the development of reagents and the estimation of an indicator
   of unambiguity. A preliminary analysis based on structural modeling of
   equations is applied to obtain evidence of validity of the developed
   scale. The questionnaire was applied to a random sample of 350 students.
   Additionally, we propose a conceptual model for the construct of digital
   skill, which showed the expected congruency between the observed
   variables and the proposed structure. After an initial application we
   were able to obtain acceptable values in three of the goodness of fit
   indices (RMSEA, GFI and AGFI), with the exception for Chi-square and
   possibilities were identified for adapting the scale based on the
   modification rates derived from the AMOS program. The information
   obtained will improve the proposed scale. Determining the digital skills
   of the students is a current interest in the search of innovation and
   efficiency of educational activities.}},

Abstract = {{Spain is a country with a wide tourist heritage. All the public

   cultural tourism.
   The methodology used to accomplish this task is based on reverse
   engineering, tool that allows us to know details of its shape, texture,
   construction details and geo-referenced positioning. Inverse engineering
   will help us to create a digital catalogue with all the formal
   characteristics of the objects and tourist spaces. It will be possible
   then to reproduce them in a three dimensional way for different uses.
   Reverse engineering is also an excellent tool for innovation and a
   teaching strategy to acquire the skills required for design and

Abstract = {{Wikipedia is an open educational resource that connects writers and
   editors to diverse discourse communities around the world. Unwarranted
   stigma is attached to the use of Wikipedia in higher education due to
   fears that students will not pursue rigorous research practices because
   of the easy access to information that Wikipedia facilitates. In studies
   referred to in this paper, undergraduate writing students are taught
   about the need to interrogate any information they find on Wikipedia
   just as they would other online source material. They are inducted into
   fact checking, editing and creating Wikipedia articles as a means to
   analyse source material critically and to advance their research,
   writing and digital literacy. Meanwhile, in a postgraduate course in
   magazine studies, instead of writing essays, students are promoting
   Australian magazines and print culture by writing Wikipedia entries
   about Antipodean magazines and their editors. These courses experiment
   with new approaches to formative and summative assessment; promote group
   research, collaborative and participatory writing, writing across
   networks and negotiating discourse communities; and challenge students'
   perceptions about peer review and the legitimacy of Wikipedia.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The unobserved benefits of digital technologies are described
   as digital dark matter. Product service systems (PSSs) are bundles of
   products and services that deliver value in use, which is unobserved but
   generates benefits. This paper aims to empirically quantify digital dark
   matter within PSSs and correlates that measure with national
   competitiveness.
   Design/methodology/approach - A novel methodology establishes the link
   between customer needs and a product and digital service portfolio
   offered across ten developed economies. The case context is the music
   industry where product and services are often substitutes - a
   cannibalistic PSS. Consumer information is obtained from a unique
   database of more than 18,000 consumer surveys. Consumer demand for
   digital formats is modelled and predicted through logistic regressions.
   Findings - The work provides inverse estimations for digital dark matter
   within PSSs by calculating the gap between supply and demand for digital
   offers - described as the business model challenge. The USA has the
   lowest business model challenge; the home of major companies developing
   digital technologies. Digital dark matter is shown to be positively
   correlated with national competitiveness and manufacturing
   competitiveness indices.
   Practical implications - The success of a cannibalistic PSS requires
   good understanding of market demand. Governments embarking on soft
   innovation policies might incentivise the development of
   service-orientated business models based on digital technologies.
   Originality/value -Work expands theory on the concept of digital dark
   matter to the PSS literature. Empirically, a novel method is proposed to
   measure digital dark matter.}},

   investor relations}},
Journal = {{CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{133-148}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze antecedents of listed
   corporations' propensity to adopt online shareholder platforms. It
   differentiates two strategic investor relations (IR) frames, shielding
   and engaging, and explores their effect on ICT adoption.
   Design/methodology/approach - Findings are based on a survey of 82
   corporations listed on the Swiss, German and Austrian stock exchanges.
   The authors apply multiple linear regression analysis to test a
   multi-faceted adoption model.
   Findings - The authors find that resource constraints, familiarity with
   online media and efficiency considerations drive listed corporations'
   willingness to adopt online shareholder platforms. Beyond these
   operational antecedents, strategic considerations significantly affect
   adoption: IR functions geared toward shareholder engagement are more
   likely to apply interactive platforms, while IR departments geared
   toward shielding the corporation from shareholder interventions will be
   less attracted to the participatory affordances of online media.
   Research limitations/implications - This study is limited in scope to
   corporations listed on the Swiss, German and Austrian stock exchanges
   and cannot account for antecedents distinct to other regulatory
   environments.
   Practical implications - IR functions need to carefully develop and
   apply communication strategies, which in turn will inform ICT adoption.
   The authors find that IR departments geared toward a two-way symmetrical
   communication model are more attracted to the participatory affordances
   of online platforms. Thereby, they are more likely to innovate by
   employing current digital applications.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to research on the benefits
   of digital media to two-way symmetrical and dialogic corporate
   communications. It is the first study to explore these relationships in
   the context of IR. It further contributes to research on the strategic
   role of IR by developing and applying two distinct strategic frames to
   the subject of ICT adoption in IR.}},

Title = {{THE REINVENTED JOURNALIST The discursive construction of professional
   identity on Twitter}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL JOURNALISM}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{61-81}},
Abstract = {{Today, there is much academic discussion about how journalism and
   journalists are affected by rapid change and convergence in the work
   context. Considering the fundamental transformations of the media
   ecology brought about by digitization and the advent of social media, it
   has been assumed that journalists are more or less compelled to reinvent
   their professional role and identity. We know a good deal about how
   social media is adopted by journalists, mostly through survey and
   interview studies investigating self-perceptions of identity in terms of
   norms and values. There are also some case studies, predominantly in the
   form of (quantitative) content analyses, exploring the (innovative) uses
   of Twitter. However, we still have little knowledge about how the
   professional identity of journalists is discursively constructed-how, in
   specific detail, traditional norms and ideals are discursively
   reinforced or challenged-in the Twitter flow. With a discourse
   theoretical and methodological approach, this article aims to contribute
   to our understanding of the discursive construction of professional
   identity on Twitter by qualitatively analyzing tweets from the most
   widely followed journalist in Sweden. The analysis of the most active
   j-tweeter can yield important clues as to what journalism may be in the
   process of becoming. The article identifies discourses that (1)
   reinforce the watchdog identity, (2) challenge the watchdog identity,
   (3) reinforce the disseminator/explicator identity, and (4) reinforce
   transparency but challenge professional identity. It concludes that the
   reinvented journalistic identity includes discursive processes that both
   shape and are shaped by Twitter in a dialectical relationship.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-35}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to determine the technical requirements for
   copyright protection of theses and dissertations for proposing a model
   for applying in Iran's National System for Theses and Dissertations
   (INSTD).
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a mixed research
   methodology. The grounded theory was used in the qualitative phase, and
   a researcher-made checklist was applied in the quantitative phase for
   surveying the status of the INSTD. Research population included INSTD as
   well as six information specialists and copyright experts. Data were
   analysed by using open, axial and selective coding.
   Findings - Based on data extracted from the completed checklists, some
   technical requirements had been provided in the system. The technical
   requirements that interviewees pointed out included the following two
   main classes: technical components and technical-software
   infrastructures, explored in the phase of the grounded theory. The
   individual categories included access control, copy control,
   technical-software challenges, protecting standards, hypertext transfer
   protocol secure, certificate authority, documentation of thesis and
   dissertation information, the use of digital object identifiers, copy
   detection systems, thesis and dissertation integrated systems, digital
   rights management systems and electronic copyright management systems.
   Research limitations/implications - Considering the subject of this
   study, only the technical aspect was investigated, and other aspects
   were not included. In addition, electronic theses and dissertation (ETD)
   providers were not well aware of copyright issues.
   Practical implications - Using the technical requirements with high
   security is effective in the INSTD to gain the trust of the authors and
   encourage them to deposit their ETDs.
   Social implications - The increased use of the system encourages the
   authors to be more innovative in conducting their research.
   Originality/value - Considering the continued violation of copyright in
   electronic databases, applying technical requirements for copyright
   protection and regulating users' access to the information of theses and
   dissertations are needed in the INSTD.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{28-38}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a vocational
   scientific constructivist concept meant for shaping competence-based and
   networked teaching and learning in vocational education and training
   (VET).
   Design/methodology/approach - VET must enable learners to shape work
   within the context of conceptions based on the development of society.
   Refresher trainings cannot realise this. Concepts need a shaping
   competence-based and networked approach. Teaching and learning networks,
   learning projects and digital media are the keys to this approach.
   Findings - The focus of the planned concept lies on shaping
   competence-based teaching and learning. This can be realised with
   innovative teaching and learning networks. Digital media can support
   this. The planned concept will be justified. The systematic planning of
   an exemplary learning project will be discussed.
   Practical implications - This paper lays the ground to evaluate the
   relevance and range of shaping competence-based and networked teaching
   and learning.
   Originality/value - The concept was (co-)developed by the University of
   Rostock. It was tested in first learning projects. These experiences are
   taken into account. The aim is to emphasise that the intended approach
   is a justified educational strategy in colleges, companies and other
   places of learning dealing with VET.}},

Abstract = {{Recent scholarly work has enhanced our understanding of how new path
   development activities are enabled or constrained by regional
   environments', made up of pre-existing industrial structures, knowledge
   organizations, support structures and institutional configurations. This
   paper moves beyond overly static views on regional environments. We
   develop a dynamic perspective by analysing conceptually and empirically
   how a constraining environment can be transformed into one that enables
   the development of new growth paths. The paper offers a typology of
   various modes of change, including layering, adaptation and novel
   application that are used by key actors to manipulate' the regional
   support structures to facilitate new regional industrial path
   development. The conceptual framework is applied to a case study of the
   digital games industry in the region of Scania, southern Sweden. Our
   findings suggest that the creation of a more enabling environment for
   the growth of the digital games industry has been the outcome of
   multi-scalar processes and combinations of various modes of change
   employed by a few key individuals operating in the newly emerging path.}},

Abstract = {{Technology use in apparel retail stores is on the rise and is changing
   the way that employees work and customers shop. In spite of increased
   use, advanced technology deployed within apparel retail stores has yet
   to match the rapid pace of growth for technologies adopted by apparel
   consumers enabled by mobile devices and sophisticated digital
   applications. The goal of this research was to explore the perspectives
   of apparel retail store employees on technology use and its relationship
   to effectively carrying out current and future (innovative) job
   responsibilities. Three technologies traditionally not found within US
   apparel retail stores, but emerging as part of the retail store
   environment, were examined by apparel retail employees in a lab setting.
   The technologies included a 3D body scanner, product configurator
   software, and social media. Seven themes emerged from the analysis and
   reflected how employees envisioned using these advanced technologies in
   their work. Themes included: (1) communication and relationship
   building, (2) creativity, (3) customization and personalization, (4)
   efficiency and accuracy, (5) engagement and experience, (6) fun and
   interest, and (7) sizing and fit. Concluding recommendations provide
   insights into how these themes could benefit the employee. customer
   interaction, as well as offer direct benefits to employee job
   satisfaction, retailer profitability, and customer loyalty.}},

Abstract = {{In digital pathology, to address color variation and histological
   component colocalization in pathology images, stain decomposition is
   usually performed preceding spectral normalization and tissue component
   segmentation. This paper examines the problem of stain decomposition,
   which is a naturally nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem in
   algebra, and introduces a systematical and analytical solution
   consisting of a circular color analysis module and an NMF-based
   computation module. Unlike the paradigm of existing stain decomposition
   algorithms where stain proportions are computed from estimated stain
   spectra using a matrix inverse operation directly, the introduced
   solution estimates stain spectra and stain depths via probabilistic
   reasoning individually. Since the proposed method pays extra attentions
   to achromatic pixels in color analysis and stain co-occurrence in pixel
   clustering, it achieves consistent and reliable stain decomposition with
   minimum decomposition residue. Particularly, aware of the periodic and
   angular nature of hue, we propose the use of a circular von Mises
   mixture model to analyze the hue distribution, and provide a complete
   color-based pixel soft-clustering solution to address color mixing
   introduced by stain overlap. This innovation combined with
   saturation-weighted computation makes our study effective for weak
   stains and broad-spectrum stains. Extensive experimentation on multiple
   public pathology datasets suggests that our approach outperforms
   state-of-the-art blind stain separation methods in terms of
   decomposition effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Partially edentulous dentition presents a challenging problem for the
   surgical planning of digital dental occlusion in the field of
   craniomaxillofacial surgery because of the incorrect maxillomandibular
   distance caused by missing teeth. We propose an innovative approach
   called Dental Reconstruction with Symmetrical Teeth (DRST) to achieve
   accurate dental occlusion for the partially edentulous cases. In this
   DRST approach, the rigid transformation between two symmetrical teeth
   existing on the left and right dental model is estimated through
   probabilistic point registration by matching the two shapes. With the
   estimated transformation, the partially edentulous space can be
   virtually filled with the teeth in its symmetrical position. Dental
   alignment is performed by digital dental occlusion reestablishment
   algorithm with the reconstructed complete dental model. Satisfactory
   reconstruction and occlusion results are demonstrated with the synthetic
   and real partially edentulous models.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of digital technologies for services in manufacturing has
   often been posited, but current literature has neglected to explain how
   companies can leverage digital methods to increase their service
   offering. In this article we contribute to current theory by examining
   how digitization can enable servitization for manufacturers. By
   performing a multiple-case study at four manufacturing SMEs, we provide
   evidence for a priming and a capability effect. In terms of priming, we
   find that specific digitization options lead to three servitization
   pathways: industrial, commercial and value servitization. Through a
   dynamic resource-based lens, the barriers, dynamic resource
   configurations and competitive benefits specific to each pathway are
   discussed. Finally, this paper offers managers insight on successfully
   reaching higher service levels through development of digital assets,
   and on the skills necessary to further integrate into customers'
   processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Marking a decade of exciting interdisciplinary internet research, this
   is the 10th Information, Communication and Society special issue that
   features research generated by the annual Association of Internet
   Research (AoIR) conferences. This issue consists of eight provocative
   articles selected from \#AoIR2016, the 17th annual conference, held at
   the Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Germany from 5-8 October 2016. The
   \#AoIR2016 conference theme Internet Rules! invited participants to
   address the complex interplay of digital technologies, business models
   and user practices. For some, the Internet rules! Others are ruled by
   the internet. Reflecting the emergent focus during the conference, this
   special issue addresses the Internet as a set of connected platforms
   that have various technical, social, cultural, political and figurative
   meanings, and seeks to understand rules as a set of normative values.
   Offering a primer on platform values, the contributions share a
   commitment to social justice, offer innovative theoretical interventions
   and empirically ground the workings of platform values from various
   scholarly perspectives. They show how normative digitally networked
   technologies are mutually shaped by top-down decisions such as the
   profit-oriented workings of algorithms that differentially value some
   users over others and bottom-up user practices that both sustain and
   subvert value-laden mechanisms.}},

   Creation with a Focus on Sub-Saharan Africa}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES \& INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{33-51}},
Abstract = {{Increasing digital connectivity has sparked many hopes for the
   democratization of information and knowledge production in sub-Saharan
   Africa. To investigate the patterns of knowledge creation in the region
   compared to other world regions, we examine three key metrics: spatial
   distributions of academic articles (traditional knowledge production),
   collaborative software development, and Internet domain registrations
   (digitally mediated knowledge production). We find that, contrary to the
   expectation that digital content is more evenly geographically
   distributed than academic articles, the global and regional patterns of
   collaborative coding and domain registrations are more uneven than those
   of academic articles. Despite hopes for democratization afforded by the
   information revolution, sub-Saharan Africa produces a smaller share of
   digital content than academic articles. Our results suggest the factors
   often framed as catalysts in the transformation into a knowledge economy
   do not relate to the three metrics uniformly. While connectivity is an
   important enabler of digital content creation, it seems to be only a
   necessary, not a sufficient, condition; wealth, innovation capacity, and
   public spending on education are also important factors.}},

Title = {{Can Digital Discussion Support Tools Provide Cost-Effective Options for
   Agricultural Extension Services?}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES \& INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{52-68}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural extension that delivers timely, targeted, and
   cost-effective support to farmers will help ensure the sustainability
   and adaptive capacity of agriculture, enhancing both food security and
   environmental security. Leveraging advances in agriclimate science and
   adult education, innovative digital technologies offer signi cant new
   opportunities to engage with farmers and to support decision making. In
   this study, animated video clips (machinimas), developed using the
   Second LifeTM virtual world gaming platform, model conversations around
   climate risk and critical on-farm decisions in the Australian sugarcane
   farming industry. Early evaluation indicates that this is an engaging
   format that promotes discussion by leveraging farmers' natural modes of
   information gathering and social learning. Comparison with conventional
   extension practices indicates that these discussion support tools may be
   a costeffective addition to existing approaches. The format's delta
   exibility means machinimas are readily updated with new information and
   customized to meet the needs of different farmer groups. Rapid growth in
   digital access globally and the scalability of such approaches promise
   greater equity of access to high-value information, critical to better
   risk management decision making, at minimal cost, for millions of
   farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Big data and sophisticated algorithms enable software to handle
   increasingly complex tasks, such as detecting fraud, optimizing
   logistics routes, and even driving cars. Beyond technical tasks,
   algorithms enable new ways to organize work. In this article, I suggest
   a distinction of optimizing-oriented and open-ended systems leveraging
   big data and examine how they are shaping organizational design. The
   optimizing-oriented systems, typically based on numerical data, enable
   smarter control of well-defined tasks, including algorithmic management
   of human work. Open-ended systems, often based on textual data or
   visualizations, can provide answers to a broad range of managerial
   questions relevant to effective organizing, thereby enabling smarter and
   more responsive definition of tasks and allocation of resources and
   effort. Algorithms processing conversations that naturally take place in
   organizations can form `computer augmented transparency', creating a
   host of potential benefits, but also threats. These developments are
   leading to a wave of innovation in organizational design and changes to
   institutionalized norms of the workplace.}},

   and online banking, contain features that are likely to influence how
   people choose to pay. The purpose of this paper is to understand the
   factors that impact payers' choice of payment instruments.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through in-depth interviews using the
   repertory grid technique, the authors explored 15 payers' perceptions of
   six payment instruments, including coins, banknotes, debit cards, credit
   cards, mobile payments, and online banking. The approach draws heavily
   on organizational systematics to better understand payers' choice of
   payment instruments.
   Findings - A four-category taxonomy of payments was developed. The
   authors refer to the taxonomy as the 4Ps: the purchase, the payer, the
   payment instrument, and the physical technology. The taxonomy comprises
   16 payment characteristics consisting 76 payment features that influence
   payers' instrument choice. One characteristic not known in prior
   research was identified - that is, ``cancellation{''} - a characteristic
   more frequently associated with digital payment instruments than with
   cash or checks.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that payers
   view payment instruments in amuch broader sense, including context,
   control, or cultural beliefs. Consequently, the authors suggest that
   researchers try to understand the essence of an innovation before
   assuming any economic rationalism in human or organizational behavior.
   The authors also urge researchers to understand the underlying meaning
   behind constructs of interest; as this study has shown that concepts
   like context and convenience have many different interpretations.
   Practical implications - According to McKinsey (2014) there are over
   12,000 startups in the payment arena. For them, the taxonomy can
   function as a template for the design of payment instruments, as well as
   understanding the various factors that influence payer choice of payment
   instruments.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper is the 4Ps
   taxonomy of payments. The taxonomy builds on and extends the work by
   Hirschman (1982). Since this work, and despite recent trends in
   payments, there has not been a comprehensive investigation that takes
   into account more recent innovations in payment instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Targeting a series of advanced manufacturing technology (AMT)
   `interventions' provides the potential for significant step changes
   across the pharmaceutical value chain, from early stage `system
   discovery' and clinical trials, through to novel service supply models.
   This research explores future value network configurations which, when
   aligned with disruptive shifts in technology (process and digital), may
   enable alternative routes to medicines production and the delivery of
   additional value to `end-users', i.e. patients and health care
   providers. We draw on a categorisation of AMTs that may enable a shift
   from the traditional `batch' and centralised manufacturing paradigm of
   `make-to-stock', towards more re-distributed `continuous' manufacturing
   and `make-to-order' models. Despite reported benefits in the academic
   literature (e.g. reduced footprints, improved quality, enhanced
   flexibility and inventory savings), current adoption rates of continuous
   technologies in this sector remain low (c.5\%). This paper presents new
   data sources, in our study of AMT adoption in a global pharmaceutical
   context - assessing the barriers to implementation, and the pathways to
   delivering future continuous manufacturing scenarios. Our findings
   capture the high level of disparity in viewpoints, highlighting the
   uncertainties and transformational challenges ahead - in terms of
   opportunity areas, technological readiness and a future vision for the
   sector, as a whole.}},

Title = {{Development of an Educational Game to Set Up Surgical Instruments on the
   Mayo Stand or Back Table: Applied Research in Production Technology}},
Journal = {{JMIR SERIOUS GAMES}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Background: Existing research suggests that digital games can be used
   effectively for educational purposes at any level of training.
   Perioperative nursing educators can use games to complement curricula,
   in guidance and staff development programs, to foster team
   collaboration, and to give support to critical thinking in nursing
   practice because it is a complex environment.
   Objective: To describe the process of developing an educational game to
   set up surgical instruments on the Mayo stand or back table as a
   resource to assist the instructor in surgical instrumentation training
   for students and nursing health professionals in continued education.
   Methods: The study was characterized by applied research in production
   technology. It included the phases of analysis and design, development,
   and evaluation. The objectives of the educational game were developed
   through Bloom's taxonomy. Parallel to the physical development of the
   educational game, a proposed model for the use of digital elements in
   educational game activities was applied to develop the game content.
   Results: The development of the game called ``Playing with Tweezers{''}
   was carried out in 3 phases and was evaluated by 15 participants,
   comprising students and professional experts in various areas of
   knowledge such as nursing, information technology, and education. An
   environment was created with an initial screen, menu buttons containing
   the rules of the game, and virtual tour modes for learning and
   assessment.
   Conclusions: The ``digital{''} nursing student needs engagement,
   stimulation, reality, and entertainment, not just readings. ``Playing
   with Tweezers{''} is an example of educational gaming as an innovative
   teaching strategy in nursing that encourages the strategy of involving
   the use of educational games to support theoretical or practical
   classroom teaching. Thus, the teacher does not work with only 1 type of
   teaching methodology, but with a combination of different methodologies.
   In addition, we cannot forget that skill training in an educational game
   does not replace curricular practice, but helps.}},

Abstract = {{Facing the growing number of digital natives entering the classroom,
   business professors look for innovative ways to enhance the student
   learning experience. The authors focus on the online interactive
   learning tool LearnSmart (McGraw-Hill, New York, NY), and examine its
   impact on student learning effectiveness by testing the direct and
   indirect relationships among perceived competence, perceived challenge,
   instructors, perceived value, and satisfaction with LearnSmart.
   Constructionism served as the theoretical foundation for this study.
   About 215 students at a public university in the United States took the
   survey and 197 valid responses were received. Regression analysis
   results showed that the use of LearnSmart improved students' perceived
   competency, thus increasing their perceived value of using LearnSmart,
   as well as their satisfaction with LearnSmart. Perceived value was also
   found to mediate the impact of perceived competency on satisfaction with
   LearnSmart, and the instructor played a significant role in facilitating
   and improving student learning. Perceived challenge impacted student's
   perceived value of using LearnSmart, but it did not influence
   satisfaction with LearnSmart.}},

Title = {{The antecedents of creative article diffusion on blogs Integrating
   innovation diffusion theory and social network theory}},
Journal = {{ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},

Pages = {{70-84}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Bloggers often create digital content. Diffusion of the
   creative articles can make many bloggers or readers visit blog
   platforms. Restated, diffusion of the creative articles can assist blog
   service providers (BSPs) to retain bloggers and attract new bloggers.
   Thus, the research is conducted on creative article diffusion on blogs
   based on innovation diffusion theory and social network theory. The
   paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, an information system was
   used to collect 250 creative articles and social network data of these
   creative articles. Validity of the specific study hypotheses is tested
   by using multi-regression analysis.
   Findings - Analytical results indicate both observability and network
   density positively affect creative article diffusion, and ties-strength
   negatively affects creative article diffusion.
   Research limitations/implications - Since the interpersonal interactive
   mechanism of blogs differs from that of social network websites,
   bloggers establish different social networks which may influence
   innovation diffusion. However, different websites may have different
   interpersonal interactive mechanisms. Therefore, the results of this
   study should not be over-generalized.
   Practical implications - For diffusing information, BSPs may focus on
   blog articles with trackback rate below 10 percent among the
   friends-bloggers network and advertise these articles to make their
   trackback rate increase to 10-20 percent to reach the self-sustaining
   status. This strategy ensures the largest payoff from creative article
   diffusion.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the knowledge of social
   network and innovation diffusion on blog website and develops a model
   explaining how antecedents influence creative article diffusion.}},

Abstract = {{Progress in semiconductor technology in recent decades has been
   continuously innovative regarding renewable application. This paper
   presents fluctuationless output and increased energy captured by a
   permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based variable speed wind
   turbine system (VSWTS) through a composite action of peak power tracking
   (PPT) controllers in a closed-loop control of turbine speed and boost
   converter. Though the sensorless control of tip speed ratio (TSR) is
   preferred at most, incorporation of the high-speed digitized wind gauge
   replaces the complexity in the closed-loop drive of the turbine
   generator. The proposed concept includes control over solid-state
   converters (SSC) to eliminate switched-mode harmonics and thus DC link
   voltage is maintained at all levels. Fluctuations on the load side can
   be eliminated with a pulse width modulation (PWM) inverter. The circuit
   simulation proclaims PMSG voltage and boost voltage for different wind
   velocities to ensure real power control through optimal wind turbine
   speed and reactive power control through stabilized output voltage. Our
   investigation was performed on a 0.5 kW wind turbine generator and
   converter module to ensure the synchronized reactive power control at
   both SSC stages. Comparative test results were taken pertaining to the
   above discussion, which validates the performance of the proposed system
   in its typical area of application.}},

   devices such as smartphone, tablet, phablet. They are reflected in the
   assumption of new learning models, lifestyles, communication,

   Thus, the development of strategies to implement these new technological
   tools in the classroom is an opportunity to rethink the line educational
   practice with new features, demands and needs of diverse student. They
   are attending and take advantage of the possibilities offered by
   emerging technologies as augmented reality in a new mode of learning

Abstract = {{The question of surveillance and privacy is not exclusively restricted
   to the digital communication tools and has recently become widespread
   with technological innovations and taken the human actions under
   control. This results in the borders between public and private spheres
   becoming vague. At present, private sphere is publicized in the cyber
   space through self-preferred exhibitions and digital surveillance
   practices. At the vey heart of the ever-intensifying question of privacy
   in the 21st century lies the inner conflict between our physical
   civilization which has been developing for thousands of years and the
   cyber civilization which is still in the making. The motive of this
   conflict is that the users fail to totally internalize the digital space
   and its technical capabilities during communication. As a result, users
   make the personal information, which is important in the physical world,
   such as privacy, security and personal data available to others in order
   to be present in the cyber space. The present study deals with the
   concept of surveillance in terms of social control and power relations.
   In the same vein, this study discusses, based on literature review, the
   questions of privacy emerging as a result of the sovereigns, which hold
   the power, resorting to digital surveillance techniques while keeping
   the individuals' daily lives under their control through control
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the existence of combined patterns of regional
   innovation and the information and communication technologies (ICT) use,
   and the factors explaining them at a regional level in the European
   Union (EU). The use of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) allows us to
   identify two differentiated patterns of regional innovation and ICT use.
   The main pattern is defined by those regions combining high levels of
   ICT use and innovation. This pattern is mostly explained by
   institutional factors, such as the quality of government, and by
   region-specific characteristics, such as total employment in knowledge-
   intensive services, total research and development (R\&D), lifelong
   learning (LifeLong), and gross domestic product (GDP). We also
   identified a second pattern that corresponds with regions showing strong
   disparities between innovation and ICT use levels. This pattern is
   mainly determined by R\&D and by institutional variables such as
   government quality and fiscal decentralization. Our findings shed light
   on the factors that jointly explain innovation and ICT diffusion, and
   could be useful in the design of innovation and ICT diffusion policies
   at both regional and national levels.}},

Abstract = {{This article assesses the intention of chemistry teachers to integrate
   digital media in their classes. The evaluation was performed using a
   structured questionnaire after participation in two professional
   development actions. The formative sessions were designed with the aim
   of training the chemistry teachers for pedagogical integration of
   digital media in teaching chemistry in high school. The participants
   were 25 chemistry teachers from different regions of Brazil, who were
   participating in an international cooperation program for the
   professional development of teachers in Portugal. Data collection was
   conducted through questionnaires containing questions about the
   motivations for innovation in education, attitudes and beliefs in
   relation to the training actions and face the pedagogical integration of
   digital media in the chemistry discipline. The data analysis shows a
   remarkable behavioral intention of adopting the media which is
   positively correlated with the attitudes and perceptions of control and
   negatively with subjective norm. These results suggest that
   interventions focused on technical and pedagogical training centered on
   subject content are suitable for the professional development of
   teachers.}},

Abstract = {{An exploratory study on the use of the digital portfolio as an
   educational tool is presented. The experience focused on assessing the
   weaknesses, threats, strengths and opportunities of this tool based on
   the participants' assessments. Likewise, it seeks to know to what extent
   its use enhances skills and competences relevant in the European Higher
   Education Area, both individually and as a group. To do this, we
   conducted a study of descriptive nature through technical survey
   (questionnaire). The results show that this is a positively valued
   learning tool that favors issues such as accessibility to cooperative
   learning or economic and environmental cost savings without printing
   paper. We conclude therefore that the digital portfolio contributes to
   the process of teaching and learning, encouraging the students to he
   aware of this, and progressively bringing you to a more autonomous and
   responsible learning.}},

Abstract = {{FDA recently approved a 3D-printed drug product in August 2015, which is
   indicative of a new chapter for pharmaceutical manufacturing. This
   review article summarizes progress with 3D printed drug products and
   discusses process development for solid oral dosage forms.
   3D printing is a layer-by-layer process capable of producing 3D drug
   products from digital designs. Traditional pharmaceutical processes,
   such as tablet compression, have been used for decades with established
   regulatory pathways. These processes are well understood, but antiquated
   in terms of process capability and manufacturing flexibility. 3D
   printing, as a platform technology, has competitive advantages for
   complex products, personalized products, and products made on-demand.
   These advantages create opportunities for improving the safety,
   efficacy, and accessibility of medicines.
   Although 3D printing differs from traditional manufacturing processes
   for solid oral dosage forms, risk-based process development is feasible.
   This review highlights how product and process understanding can
   facilitate the development of a control strategy for different 3D
   printing methods.
   Overall, the authors believe that the recent approval of a 3D printed
   drug product will stimulate continual innovation in pharmaceutical
   manufacturing technology. FDA encourages the development of advanced
   manufacturing technologies, including 3D-printing, using science- and
   risk-based approaches. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{New democratic participation forms and collaborative productions of
   diverse audiences have emerged as a result of digital innovations in the
   online access to and consumption of news. the aim of this paper is to
   propose a conceptual framework based on the possibilities of Web 2.0.
   outlining the construction of a ``social logic{''}, which combines
   computer and communicative logics, the conceptual framework is
   theoretically built to explore the evolution of news consumption from a
   pure circulation of designed products towards a global conversation of
   proactive news designers. then, the framework was tested using an
   empirical database built by the PEW research Centre, which investigates
   the future of the news industry, through a large-scale survey with
   adults. results show significant differences (by age, gender and
   educational level) in the forms of participation, access and consumption
   of news. however, whilst immersed in the culture of Web 2.0 there is a
   low-level of user participation in news production; far from being
   proactive news designers, findings suggest that citizens are still
   located in the lower participatory levels of our conceptual framework.
   Conclusions suggest there is a need for media education providers to
   carry out training initiatives according to the social logic
   possibilities through proposed guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{In the paper, a CMOS pixel has been proposed for imaging arrays with
   massively parallel image acquisition and simultaneous compensation of
   dark signal nonuniformity (DSNU) as well as photoresponse nonuniformity
   (PRNU). In our solution the pixel contains all necessary functional
   blocks: a photosensor and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with
   built-in correlated double sampling (CDS) integrated together. It is
   implemented in standard 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. The size of the pixel
   with 9-bit resolution is 21 mu m x 21 mu m. Measurements of the 128 x
   128 pixel array confirm functionality of the proposed solution. CDS
   reduces dark FPN from 12 LSB (3\%) to 0.8 LSB (0.2\%) and light FPN from
   14 LSB (3.7\%) to 7 LSB (1.8\%). Further reduction of the light FPN (to
   similar to 1 LSB) was achieved by compensating PRNU using massively
   parallel innovative digital multiplication which features good
   resolution (1/511), does not disturb CDS executed at the same time, and
   can be implemented within a small pixel area.}},

Abstract = {{Symbolic knowledge-driven innovations can play an important role in the
   economic development of cities and regions. Cultural events and
   infrastructures can act as powerful connectivity engines, generating new
   connections, rewiring links, and repositioning
   institutions/cities/regions on the Internet map. Within this framework,
   this paper aims to contribute to the analytical understanding of
   culture-led repositioning. For this purpose we perform regression
   analysis with cultural networks (observational cross-sectional network
   data) from digital media for a specific cultural case study: the Basque
   Culinary Center (BCC), a higher education faculty of haute cuisine
   promoted by the University of Mondragon along with a group of
   Michelin-starred chefs. Results show that a cultural sector, such as
   haute cuisine, can contribute to structural changes in connectivity
   patterns, putting an institution/city/region on the media map. It is the
   connection (in the online press) of the BCC to the influential
   Michelin-starred chefs that can fuel the accumulation of press articles
   (media items) on the BCC; and it is precisely this accumulation of press
   articles that can impact BCC revenues. Put differently, the co-branding
   between the influential Michelin chefs and the BCC may have put the BCC
   on the press map, promoting new student registrations and fostering
   Basque haute cuisine. The main contribution of this article is a
   prototype of regression analysis to test repositioning with network
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Molecular tests that were once ancillary to the core
   business of cyto-histopathology are becoming the most relevant workload
   in pathology departments after histopathology/cytopathology and before
   autopsies. This has resulted from innovations in molecular biology
   techniques, which have developed at an incredibly fast pace.Areas
   covered: Most of the current widely used techniques in molecular
   pathology such as FISH, direct sequencing, pyrosequencing, and
   allele-specific PCR will be replaced by massive parallel sequencing that
   will not be considered next generation, but rather, will be considered
   to be current generation sequencing. The pre-analytical steps of
   molecular techniques such as DNA extraction or sample preparation will
   be largely automated. Moreover, all the molecular pathology instruments
   will be part of an integrated workflow that traces the sample from
   extraction to the analytical steps until the results are reported; these
   steps will be guided by expert laboratory information systems. In situ
   hybridization and immunohistochemistry for quantification will be
   largely digitalized as much as histology will be mostly digitalized
   rather than viewed using microscopy.Expert commentary: This review
   summarizes the technical and regulatory issues concerning the
   standardization of molecular tests in pathology. A vision of the future
   perspectives of technological changes is also provided.}},

Abstract = {{This work evaluates best practices for managing the corrosive effect of
   magnesium-chloride-based deicers on the metallic components of equipment
   fleets. The first part of this study evaluates the effectiveness of salt
   remover for washing bare metals. A dipdry test was employed to simulate
   the field conditions. Carbon steel (C1010), aluminum alloy (Al1100), and
   stainless steel (SS304L) were used in the test program to evaluate the
   use of water, soapy water, and a commercial salt remover in washing
   practices. The corrosion behavior of metals was studied using linear
   polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements.
   Digital photos and scanning electron microscopy revealed the surface
   morphology of corrosion coupons. The salt remover could significantly
   enhance the corrosion resistance of carbon steel and stainless steel in
   a 30\%-by-weight MgCl2 solution, but not that of the aluminum alloy.
   Further investigation focused on the evaluation of an innovative sugar
   beet by-product for use as a deicer additive. A modified dip-dry test
   was employed to simulate the field conditions. Bare and coated C1010
   samples were used to evaluate the potential anticorrosion benefits of
   this green deicer additive. The corrosion behavior of the samples was
   characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The use of
   sugar beet by-product can enhance the corrosion resistance of carbon
   steel and the mechanism of protection is the formation of a temporary
   protective layer on the metallic surface. (C) 2016 American Society of

Abstract = {{In recent years, instances of organizations failing to maintain digital
   confidentiality performance have greatly increased in frequency and
   monetary damage. While the global sourcing of activities in the
   development of digital assets is widespread, very little is known about
   how location-related factors may affect confidentiality outcomes.
   Addressing this, we empirically investigate two factors with rich
   theoretical bases and logical linkages to confidentiality: industrial
   agglomeration and national property rights protections. We conduct a
   large-scale, empirical study at the product level of analysis, and treat
   the confidentiality of a digital product as a performance outcome that
   is affected by the locations of the two key organizational entities
   involved in the product's development. We leverage modern, web-crawling
   methods to harvest secondary data from a major, illicit distribution
   channel for these products and combine these data with other secondary
   data involving legitimate commerce to derive a secondary measure of
   confidentiality performance. We find robust results, and demonstrate
   practical significance of our findings through scenario analyses based
   on actual data from our sample.}},

Abstract = {{As manufacturing companies pursue a servitization strategy, they are
   increasingly relying on developing digitalization capabilities to
   interact and co-create value with their customers. However, many lack an
   understanding of what constitutes digitalization capabilities and how
   they can create value with customers. To address these questions, the
   study builds on qualitative data from four industrial manufacturing
   firms to conceptualize three underlying subcomponents of digitalization
   capabilities, namely, intelligence capability, connect capability, and
   analytic capability. The study identifies and explains how
   digitalization capabilities enable value co-creation with customers
   through perceptive and responsive mechanisms. This study contributes to
   the servitization literature by showcasing how digitalization
   capabilities are enabling value co-creation in a business-to-business
   context. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Creating impact in the digital space: digital practice dependency in
   communities of digital scientific innovations}},

Abstract = {{Modern science has become collaborative and digital. The Internet has
   supported the emergence of scientific digital platforms that globally
   connect programmers and users of novel digital scientific products such
   as scientific interactive software tools. These digital scientific
   innovations complement traditional text-based products like journal
   publications. This article is focused on the scientific impact of a
   platform's programming community that produces these digital scientific
   innovations. The article's main theoretical argument is that beyond an
   individual's contribution efforts to these innovations, a new social
   structure affects his scientific recognition through citations of his
   tools in text-based publications. Taking a practice theory lens, we
   introduce the concept of a digital practice structure that emerges from
   the digital innovation work practice, performed by programmers who
   jointly work on a tool. This digital practice creates dependence forces
   among the community members in an analogy to Newton's gravity concept.
   Our model represents such dependencies in a spatial autocorrelative
   model. We empirically estimate this model using data of the programming
   community of nanoHUB in which 477 nanotechnology tool programmers have
   contributed more than 715 million lines of code. Our results show that a
   programmer's contributions to digital innovations may have positive
   effects, while the digital practice structure creates negative
   dependency effects. Colloquially speaking, being surrounded by star
   performers can be harmful. Our findings suggest that modeling scientific
   impact needs to account for a scientist's contribution to programming
   communities that produce digital scientific innovations and the digital
   work structures in which these contributions are embedded.}},

Abstract = {{Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging is a widely accepted method
   for resection control of glial tumors. Increasingly, it is also used
   during the resection of skull base tumors. Several studies have
   independently demonstrated an increase in the extent of resection in
   these tumors with improved prognosis for the patients. Technical
   innovations combined with the easier operation of this imaging modality
   have led to its widespread implementation. The development of digital
   image processing has also brought other modalities such as ultrasound

Abstract = {{We are investigating Toffler's \& Ritzer's ``prosumption{''} phenomenon
   in a sociological, economical, psychological and cultural approach. Our
   scientific initiative is dedicated to the manifestation of prosumption
   in cyberspace, limited to the virtual Android community gathered at the
   ``Xda-developers. com{''} ( XDA). The main objective of this research is
   to establish the Android prosumer profile. The main research questions
   are: What does prosumption mean? What are the characteristics of digital
   prosumption? Who are the digital prosumers? What is the Android prosumer
   profile? How are they organized? What forces affect prosumption in the
   Android socio-economic environment? Data collection tools were used,
   such as the non-participative observation method, in the quantitative
   version to identify phenomena that occurred in the XDA Android
   community; we designed and applied a questionnaire in the community; we
   used the random sampling method to establish the sample; statistical
   observation was used, based on findings of the questionnaire; content
   analysis was used to describe and quantify the community production;
   documentary research was used to define the main concepts. Our findings
   show that the Android prosumers fit into the concepts of consumer and
   producer. The Android prosumers are organized in open-source virtual
   communities, where some function as both consumers and producers.
   Handset manufacturers, service providers or even Google should increase
   their involvement in these communities to benefit from prosumers'
   capacity to innovate, rather than to settle for their ability to fix or
   adapt to devices shortcomings, but without disrupting the economic,
   technical or social evolution of the Android platform. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an innovative autofocusing criterion for the
   reconstruction of infrared digital holograms. This criterion has the
   advantages of fast, efficient and precision when determining the
   reconstruction distance of off-axis digital holography. This criterion
   is a mean-free high frequency calculation process. We focus on the
   problem of mean value drifting found in previous published methods and
   design our new approach to solve it. Unlike the previous methods perform
   well only with high quality holograms, our method is effective for both
   high and low quality holograms. Even when hologram is degraded by
   destructive interference, our method still performs well. This method
   helps to automatically determine the precise reconstruction distance,
   and we are sure that this technology can be applied in industrial
   applications in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{International Journal of Communication}},

Pages = {{429-451}},
Abstract = {{In the last decade, the Internet has become more widely diffused and
   mobile, developing into a more interactive, globalized space with
   greater potential for democratic participation and mobilization. An
   earlier study by Groshek (2010) found that from 1994 to 2003, the
   Internet had limited national-level democratic effects, which suggested
   that Internet diffusion should not be considered a democratic panacea,
   but rather a component of contemporary democratization processes.
   Updating those analyses, this study used the same sample of 72 countries
   to examine the democratic effects of the Internet and mobile phones from
   2004 to 2014 by replicating Groshek's time-series statistical tests.
   This study also found very limited evidence that emerging media
   diffusion resulted in augmented democratization, with only four
   countries-Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan-demonstrating greater
   democracy levels than were statistically predicted. Within a framework
   of diffusion of innovations and demand for democracy, this study extends
   the current understanding of emerging media's role in democratic
   development, and represents an important step in identifying the limited
   agency that emerging media diffusion has shown in cultivating democratic
   growth nationally.}},

Abstract = {{Since topics such as climate protection come more and more in focus to
   municipalities, as they are in the role to implement related processes,
   technical support systems in this area are powerful tools. The most
   obvious requirement is the implementation of a monitoring
   infrastructure, which helps to measure the current state of energy
   consumption in buildings, properties and far beyond, focusing on various
   sectors such as industry, mobility, waste, etc. Apart, there are
   requirements and connected technologies and solutions in the fields of
   Ambient Assisted Living or Smart Home, which can be considered
   separately from the infrastructure perspective. But, in future, digital
   services will continuously grow together, simply by the need of various
   requirements for data exchange in many use cases. In the work at hand we
   show that in certain areas topics such as IoT in energy management,
   Ambient Assisted Living or Smart Home solutions should not be considered
   as separate platforms, but as convergent building blocks of a connected
   infrastructure landscape. In the context of municipal climate
   protection, this approach is illustrated in an example case study by
   presenting a central platform, which allows municipal energy management
   in conjunction with other services. The development is illustrated based
   on an innovative software environment that brings the idea in productive
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Digital design and manufacturing are critical drivers of competitiveness
   but only few companies and organizations have the capability to support
   digitalization across the whole Product Lifecycle. In several cases the
   information flow is discontinuous, the roles and the issues are not
   properly defined, the tools are heterogeneous and not integrated in the
   company organization. An approach that considers an appropriate data and
   information organization, an efficient internal organization and the
   availability of integrated software tools that are implementing the
   industrial best practices, could innovate important and critical aspect
   of the industrial processes. This paper gives an overview of the main
   themes related to Knowledge Management in industrial context, focusing
   on product configuration process. The current role of the knowledge in
   product configuration will be discussed. Then, a brief overview on
   Knowledge-based Engineering will be presented. Regarding Knowledge Based

Abstract = {{The purpose of this exploratory study is to understand how technology
   innovations discussed with respect to the fourth industrial revolution
   diffuse within the supply chain. First, the main characteristic and
   interrelated features of the term ``Industry 4.0{''} are identified to
   come up with a definition. We understand that the fourth industrial
   revolution is characterized by the technological trends of
   digitalization, autonomization, transparency, availability of real-time
   information and collaboration. Based on the assumption, that all
   technological innovations addressing these characteristics, are
   contributing to diffuse the concept of Industry 4.0 in the supply chain,
   causal hypotheses are stated within a structural model to further
   discuss the diffusion-factors and barriers of implementation. All
   results are conceptually derived based on a structured literature
   review.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing markets for internet-traded furniture, but also economic
   concerns are main driving forces to considerably reduce the weight of
   wood-based furniture panels. Recent research and technological
   developments have led to an innovative one-step process which simplifies
   the typical multi-step process for production of foam core panels. Three
   layered sandwich panels (with particleboard faces and polymeric in situ
   expanded foam as core layer) can be produced by a one-step process
   without additional gluing between the face and core layers. As the
   morphology of the foam and hence its mechanical properties strongly
   depend on its chemical composition, as well as on the process parameters
   during expansion, there are no data available, so far, describing the
   foam of the novel panels. The aim of the proposed project is to
   determine the elastic properties of in situ expanded foams using 2D
   digital image correlation. The data can be used later on for the
   simulation of the elastic behavior of foam core particleboards by means
   of FEM to describe the short and long term behavior of the panels.}},

Title = {{The Epital Care Model: A New Person-Centered Model of Technology-Enabled
   Integrated Care for People With Long Term Conditions}},
Journal = {{JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is worldwide recognition that the future provision of
   health care requires a reorganization of provision of care, with
   increased empowerment and engagement of patients, along with skilled
   health professionals delivering services that are coordinated across
   sectors and organizations that provide health care. Technology may be a
   way to enable the creation of a coherent, cocreative, person-centered
   method to provide health care for individuals with one or more long-term
   conditions (LTCs). It remains to be determined how a new care model can
   be introduced that supports the intentions of the World Health
   Organization (WHO) to have integrated people-centered care.
   Objective: To design, pilot, and test feasibility of a model of health
   care for people with LTCs based on a cocreative, iterative, and stepwise
   process in a way that recognizes the need for person-centered care, and
   embraces the use of digital technology.
   Methods: The overall research method was inspired by action research and
   used an agile, iterative approach. In 2012, a living lab was established
   in a Danish municipality which allowed for the freedom of redesigning
   health care processes. As the first step, a wide group of stakeholders
   was gathered to create a layout for the reorganization of services and
   development of technology, based on established principles for
   innovative management of people with chronic conditions. The next three
   steps were (1) a proof of concept in 2012, (2) a pilot study, and (3) a
   feasibility study from 2013 to 2015, in which a total of 93 chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients were enrolled. Citizens
   were provided a tablet-based solution for remote follow-up and
   communication purposes, and access to a 24/7 response and coordination
   center that coordinated both virtual and face-to-face support for COPD
   management. In step five the initial model was extended with elements
   that support continuity of care. Beginning in the autumn of 2013, 1102
   frail elderly individuals were included and offered two additional
   services: an outgoing acute medical team and a local subacute bed
   function.
   Results: Based on the findings from the iterative process, and evolving
   technology and workflow solutions, we propose a robust and feasible
   model that can provide a framework for developing solutions to support
   an active life with one or more LTCs. The resulting Epital Care Model
   (ECM) consists of six stages, and serves as a template for how a
   digitally-enhanced health service can be provided based on patients'
   medical needs. The model is designed to be a proactive, preventive, and
   monitoring health care system that involves individuals in the
   management of their own health conditions.
   Conclusions: The ECM is in accordance with WHO's framework for
   integrated people-centered health services, and may serve as a framework
   for the development of new technologies and provide a template for
   future reorganization.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to the possibilities generated by digital technology a new
   scenario has emerged in which large groups of people are able to
   efficiently innovate and transform the traditional practices of
   companies and organizations. This article presents the results of
   research into the distribution and screening of films in Spain through a
   phenomenon known as theatrical on demand. In addition to a descriptive
   analysis, quantitative and qualitative data is presented to provide an
   evaluation of the economic, cultural, and social dimensions of this new
   relationship between audiences and movies. Commercial business
   innovation and social innovation are not separate concepts. An active
   society can serve as a vehicle new cultural experiences and new forms of
   marketing that provide access to independent productions that would
   otherwise be difficult to get to market through conventional
   distribution channels.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of the European Union's Innovative Medicines Initiative
   (IMI) project titled Web-Recognizing Adverse Drug Reactions (WEB-RADR;
   http://web-radr.eu), which focuses on the assessment of new data sources
   and the optimization of the collection of information on suspected
   adverse reactions in pharmacovigilance, a survey was performed in 182
   countries/jurisdictions in 2014 to 2015. The goal was to gather
   information on existing practices, guidance, and legal requirements on
   social media monitoring to identify potential safety issues related to
   medicines. The survey response rate was 100\%. The results revealed that
   80\% of the surveyed countries do not have such necessities despite the
   fact that 63\% of these countries have an established national
   pharmacovigilance system. Among the countries having an established
   pharmacovigilance system, only 29\% have specific requirements, most
   countries do have similar provisions as set out in the EU guidelines on
   Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP). A small subset of countries
   within the European Economic Area (EEA) have requirements that exceed
   those stated in GVP, namely, Italy, France, Sweden, and the UK. Outside
   the EEA, Turkey and the United States have also developed further
   guidance. The outcome of the survey will inform the development of a
   future policy framework on the further use of social media as new
   pharmacovigilance data source in the EEA. In addition, this paper
   elaborates on some current practical case management issues encountered
   by companies based on the existing regulatory guidance.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, new digital technologies have been introduced into our
   business and social environments, causing a major change that is
   recognized as the digital transformation. To better adapt to this trend,
   in 2015 Fujitsu launched FUJITSU Digital Business Platform MetaArc
   (hereafter, MetaArc), designed to integrate the latest information and
   communications technologies (ICTs) such as cloud computing, mobile
   technology, big data (analytics), the Internet of Things (IoT), and
   artificial intelligence (Al). MetaArc is a platform that realizes a
   seamless collaboration between two kinds of systems-those that create
   new innovations through connecting people and the physical environment
   (Systems of Engagement, or SoE) and those that enhance the efficiency of
   enterprise systems (Systems of Record, or SoR). Together, they make it
   possible to respond to changes in the business environment quickly and
   flexibly. MetaArc also offers a series of products useful for making a
   business grow. This paper introduces FUJITSU Cloud Service K5, the core
   cloud platform for MetaArc. It then outlines the platform's various
   component services and products and describes our cloud-centered
   strategies and efforts to maximize the value provided to our customers.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, due to rapid technological advancements such as big
   data utilization, cloud computing, mobile communications/devices, and
   social media, business owners have been urged to transform their
   information and communications technology (ICT) systems. However, many
   companies hesitate to embrace the ICT innovation because they have been
   incurring a lot of cost with the systems virtualization and integration
   they have carried out so far. To resolve this situation, Fujitsu
   proposes FUJITSU Integrated System PRIMEFLEX for Cloud K5 (hereafter,
   PFC-K5), an integrated private cloud solution. This solution is also one
   of the private cloud solutions of FUJITSU Digital Business Platform
   MetaArc. PFC-K5 provides an optimal combination of hardware and software
   for business operations on the cloud, and this solution is delivered to
   the business owners in a ready-to-use condition. PFC-K5 not only
   supports business operation lifecycle by providing optimal ICT systems,
   but also enables business owners to introduce the latest cloud
   technology to their ICT systems at low cost. Moreover, through
   infrastructure standardization and automation, business owners can use
   this solution to reduce their operational cost, and hence move forward
   with transforming their ICT system. This solution is based on the same
   technology as FUJITSU Cloud Service K5, making it possible to build a
   hybrid cloud environment. This paper describes an overview and the
   features of PFC-K5.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The FluoreCam system is based on an innovative approach to
   the quantification of enamel health termed fluorescence enamel imaging
   (FEI). Enamel is both highly mineralized and semi-translucent. Because
   of its mineral composition, enamel will fluoresce when exposed to
   certain light wavelengths. The semi-translucent nature of enamel results
   in different enamel densities emitting different levels of fluorescence.
   As a result, with FEI technology, one can measure the density of tooth
   enamel by measuring its fluorescence when subjected to specific light
   wavelengths.
   Purpose: To determine the ability of visual examination and the
   instrumental procedures of the FluoreCam to monitor molar-incisor
   hypomineralization (MIH) lesions.
   Subjects and Methods: This study involved children with MIH at the
   Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Marmara University. In total, 11
   patients with MIH were diagnosed on a visual MIH scale and evaluated
   with the FluoreCam. The equipment, data processing, and interaction
   between the equipment and operator were evaluated.
   Results: Fluorescent images recorded with the custom software, the
   clinical view, and digital numeric values were evaluated to assess the
   potential for use of the device in clinical practice.
   Conclusion: These preliminary data from an ongoing clinical study
   suggest that measurements with the FluoreCam are useful in monitoring
   MIH. This technique also provides visual and quantitative feedback to
   patients.}},

   that universities are experiencing, or may experience in the near
   future, a set of important changes brought about by technological and

   transformation of Higher Education Institutions is provided as well as a
   theoretical framework that breaks down the process of digital
   transformation into seven dimensions or spheres of activity.
   Additionally, the aspect of governance of the process of digital
   transformation is examined. For each of these eight levels, several
   variables are defined, eighteen in all. The theoretical model can be
   applied to the design of further empirical research, with both
   quantitative and qualitative approaches, for the rigorous and systematic
   analysis of the implications of digital transformation for Higher

Abstract = {{This paper aims to utilize a mixed-methods assessment for an innovative
   interdisciplinary course, Application Period, in a world-class Russian
   University. In order to examine how the cognitive (competency-based
   learning) and motivational (self-efficacy for interpersonal skills)
   concepts impact students' achievement in engineering education, an
   exploratory sequential design was conducted by firstly collecting
   qualitative data to signify the students' interactive learning process
   during the project-based collaboration and team communication.
   Subsequently, two instruments measuring the students' learning outcomes
   were built based on the previous qualitative data and preliminary
   learning objectives. The suggestions and implications are provided to
   specify how to employ competency-based learning and self-efficacy for
   interpersonal skills in teaching and how to assess those content
   knowledge and pedagogical skills in contemporary education.}},

Abstract = {{Circular economy as a business driver is growing in bio economy,
   industry and service business. That means great opportunity for all kind
   of businesses but at the same time a huge business transition. The
   opportunities of sustainability and circular economy have not been
   understood in full context and as new service innovation. Responsibility
   business management is an integrator on the path. The paradigm shift in
   the effective circular economy is the alteration of purchase behavior
   from ownership and selling of machines to offering of services. Obvious
   development activity is to increase the efficiency in supply network.
   Digitalization is rapidly increasing and enterprises must find new ways
   to innovate for business advantage. Through digital transformation, the
   use of new technologies like cloud, mobile, big data, and social
   networks with increasing intelligence and automation enterprises can
   capitalize on new business and optimization opportunities.
   Responsibility business leadership needs democratic innovation culture
   and co-innovation and co-evolution processes. This article introduces a
   concept tool for responsible business leadership. It helps to analyze
   co-evolution over the life cycle of business transition on circular
   economy by using Evolute, the intelligent web-based system, for managing
   human opinions and experiences as well as public-private-relationships
   and responsible business leadership capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The massive growth in digital devices and communication has spotlighted
   the wisdom of doing financial transactions through online banking. In
   developing Asian economies, online banking technology can strengthen
   financial systems by developing a solid connection between financial
   institutions and the local populace. Technology acceptance studies are
   under-researched in this region, especially with innovative models.
   Filling the gap, this paper uses a comprehensive model of extended
   Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), moderated
   by cultural variables. This will provide new insights into the
   determinants of technology acceptance by considering cultural effects on
   individual customers. The authors analyzed the model through structural
   equation modeling. The results validated performance expectancy,
   facilitating conditions, habit, perceived security, and price value as
   important antecedents of behavioral intentions. The cultural dimensions,
   collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance were found to be significant
   moderators in explaining behavioral intention and usage behavior for
   online banking.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the relationship between several indicators of
   ICT usage and digitalization and the relative demand for highly skilled
   workers. The data are based on two-digit industry-level information on
   seven European countries for the period 2001-2010. For manufacturing
   industries, static fixed-effects models show that the share of employees
   with internet broadband access, the diffusion of mobile internet access
   and the use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and automatic
   data exchange combined with electronic invoicing are all significantly
   and positively related to skill intensity in the industries observed.
   For service industries, only mobile internet usage intensity is
   significant. Specifically for manufacturing, a 10-point increase in the
   percentage of firms using ERP systems is associated with an increase in
   the share of highly skilled workers by 0.4 percentage points. These
   estimates indicate that the increase in ERP system usage during the
   period studied accounted for 30\% of the increase in the share of
   workers with a tertiary degree across manufacturing industries and
   countries. The results are robust with respect to the estimation method
   and the potential endogeneity of ICT.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents design and development of chassis along with the
   novel under run protection devices for commercial vehicles. The concept
   was experimentally validated as per govt. regulations.
   In today's commercial market, no customer wants to lose payload for his
   vehicle, and ends up overloading it. It not only leads to accidents, but
   also deteriorates the life of different vehicle components which are
   designed for specific loading.
   We have addressed this concern by converting cross members of frame and
   under-run protection devices for front as well as rear of the vehicle
   into aluminum materials with patented cross sections {[}1]. We have
   avoided the welding process and used high strength rivets. The riveting
   process used here is very suitable for the closed cross sections, as it
   is fastening operation where only the single side access is available.
   Finally with the introduction of aluminum cross members, Al FUPD and Al
   RUPD we have reduced the vehicle weight significantly resulting in 276
   kg payload increment, which will come as an additional benefit to the
   customer. It has been tested digitally as well as physically with
   satisfactory results as per VECV durability and endurance testing
   standard.}},

Title = {{Endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms using the Woven EndoBridge
   technique in a single center: preliminary results}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) is an innovative new technique for
   securing cerebral aneurysms. It is designed particularly for wide-necked
   bifurcation aneurysms that otherwise would be difficult to treat. There
   is a paucity of follow-up data in the literature due to the novelty of
   this technique. The authors reviewed their data from cases involving
   patients treated at Leeds General Infirmary with the WEB device. They
   assessed the safety and complication risk associated with the device and
   clinical and radiological follow-up outcomes in their patients. This is,
   to their knowledge, the first publication to include the new
   single-layer sphere device (WEB SLS) in addition to the original
   dual-layer (WEB DL) and the (nonsphere) single-layer (WEB SL) devices.
   METHODS Data from 22 patients who underwent 25 WEB treatments were
   analyzed. Of the 25 WEB procedures, 3 were performed on an acute basis,
   1 was performed on a semiacute basis, and the remaining 21 were
   elective. A novel 6-point scoring system called the Leeds WEB aneurysm
   occlusion scale was created to ensure accurate assessment based on the
   morphology of the WEB device. Outcome was assessed at follow-up by MR
   angiography with or without digital subtraction angiography and the
   modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
   RESULTS Deployment of the WEB device was successful in 22 (88\%) of 25
   procedures; 3 (12\%) of the attempts at WEB treatment were abandoned.
   One of the patients in whom treatment was abandoned underwent a
   successful second attempt. Immediately after the 22 procedures with
   successful deployment, 4 (18\%) of the patients had a complete occlusion
   of the aneurysm and WEB device; 10 (45\%) had varying degrees of
   occlusion within the WEB device but no aneurysm neck or remnant; 3
   (14\%) had a neck remnant; and 5 (23\%) had an aneurysm remnant. Of the
   patients with an aneurysm remnant, 1 had a complete aneurysm occlusion
   at 3-months follow-up. In total, 6 (27\%) patients had a residual
   aneurysm at 3-months radiological follow-up. One of these patients was
   admitted with hydrocephalus secondary to a recurrent aneurysm and later
   received a second WEB treatment with additional coiling. Only 1 patient
   developed new neurological symptoms. This patient went from an mRS score
   of 0 to a score of 1 and had radiological evidence of a thromboembolic
   event. Two patients showed radiological evidence of a new thromboembolic
   event on follow-up MRI but were clinically asymptomatic.
   CONCLUSIONS The WEB has shown itself to be a promising new device with
   the potential to increase the scope of treatment for difficult
   wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. The technique is safe, and short-term
   results show effective occlusion of complex aneurysms}},

Abstract = {{Big Data has emerged in the past few years as a new paradigm providing
   abundant data and opportunities to improve and/or enable research and
   decision-support applications with unprecedented value for digital earth
   applications including business, sciences and engineering. At the same
   time, Big Data presents challenges for digital earth to store,
   transport, process, mine and serve the data. Cloud computing provides
   fundamental support to address the challenges with shared computing
   resources including computing, storage, networking and analytical
   software; the application of these resources has fostered impressive Big
   Data advancements. This paper surveys the two frontiers - Big Data and
   cloud computing - and reviews the advantages and consequences of
   utilizing cloud computing to tackling Big Data in the digital earth and
   relevant science domains. From the aspects of a general introduction,
   sources, challenges, technology status and research opportunities, the
   following observations are offered: (i) cloud computing and Big Data
   enable science discoveries and application developments; (ii) cloud
   computing provides major solutions for Big Data; (iii) Big Data,
   spatiotemporal thinking and various application domains drive the
   advancement of cloud computing and relevant technologies with new
   requirements; (iv) intrinsic spatiotemporal principles of Big Data and
   geospatial sciences provide the source for finding technical and
   theoretical solutions to optimize cloud computing and processing Big
   Data; (v) open availability of Big Data and processing capability pose
   social challenges of geospatial significance and (vi) a weave of
   innovations is transforming Big Data into geospatial research,
   engineering and business values. This review introduces future
   innovations and a research agenda for cloud computing supporting the
   transformation of the volume, velocity, variety and veracity into values
   of Big Data for local to global digital earth science and applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we examine methodological innovation in the social
   sciences through a focus on researching the body in digital
   environments. There are two strands to our argument as to why this is a
   useful site to explore methodological innovation in the social sciences.
   First, researching the body in digital environments places new
   methodological demands on social science. Second, as an area of interest
   at the intersection of the social sciences and the arts, it provides a
   focus for exploring how social science innovation can be informed by
   engagement with the arts, in this instance how the arts work with the
   body in digital environments and take up social science ideas in novel
   ways. We argue that social science engagement with the arts and the
   relatively unmapped terrain of the body in digital environments has the
   potential to open up spaces for innovative social science questions and
   methods: spaces, questions and methods that have potential for more
   general social science methodological innovation. We draw on the
   findings of theMethodological Innovation in Digital Arts and Social
   Sciences (MIDAS)project a multi-site ethnography of the research
   ecologies of the social sciences and the arts related to the body in
   digital environments. We propose a continuum of methodological
   innovation that attends to how methods are moved across research
   contexts and disciplines, in this instance the social sciences and the
   digital arts. We illustrate and discuss the innovative potential of
   expanding and re-situating methods across the social sciences and the
   arts, the transfer of methods and concepts across disciplinary borders
   and the interdisciplinary generation of new methods. We discuss the
   catalysts and challenges for social science methodological innovation in
   relation to the digital and the arts, with attention to how the social
   sciences might engage with the arts towards innovative research.}},

Abstract = {{Staurozoan cnidarians display an unusual combination of polyp and medusa
   characteristics and their morphology may be informative about the
   evolutionary origin of medusae. We studied neuromuscular morphology of
   two staurozoans, Haliclystus `sanjuanensis' and Manania handi, using
   whole mount immunohistochemistry with antibodies against FMRFamide and
   a-tubulin to label neurons and phalloidin to label muscles. All muscles
   appeared to lack striations. Longitudinal interradial muscles are
   probable homologues of stalk muscles in scyphopolyps, but in adult
   staurozoans they are elaborated to inwardly flex marginal lobes of the
   calyx during prey capture; these muscles are pennate in M. handi.
   Manubrial perradial muscles, like the manubrium itself, are an
   innovation shared with pelagic medusae and manubrial interradial muscles
   are shared with scyphozoan ephyra. Marginal muscles of M. handi
   displayed occasional synchronous contraction reminiscent of a medusa
   swim pulse, but contractions were not repetitive. The nerve net in both
   species showed regional variation in density and orientation of neurons.
   Some areas labeled predominantly by atubulin antibodies (exumbrellar
   epidermis), other areas labeled exclusively by FMRFamide antibodies
   (dense plexus of neurites surrounding the base of secondary tentacles,
   neuronal concentration at the base of transformed primary tentacles;
   gastrodermal nerve net), but most areas showed a mix of neurons labeled
   by these two antibodies and frequent co-labeling of neurons. Transformed
   primary tentacles had a concentration of FMRFamide-immunoreactive
   neurons at their base that was associated with a pigment spot in M.
   handi; this is consistent with their homology with rhopalia of medusae,
   which are also derived from primary tentacles. The muscular system of
   these staurozoans embodies characteristics of both scyphopolyps and
   pelagic medusae. However, their nerve net is more polyp-like, although
   marginal concentrations of the net associated with primary and secondary
   tentacles may facilitate the richer behavioral repertoire of staurozoans
   relative to polyps of other medusozoans. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{This paper describes the current state of consumer-focused mobile health
   application use and the current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
   guidance on the distribution of consumer medication information (CMI),
   and discusses recommendations and considerations for the FDA to expand
   CMI guidance to include CMI in mobile applications. Smartphone-based
   health interventions have been linked to increased medication adherence
   and improved health outcomes. Trends in smartphone ownership present
   opportunities to more effectively communicate and disseminate medication
   information; however, current FDA guidance for CMI does not outline how
   to effectively communicate CMI on a mobile platform, particularly in
   regards to user-centered design and information sourcing. As evidence
   supporting the potential effectiveness of mobile communication in health
   care continues to increase, CMI developers, regulating entities, and
   researchers should take note. Although mobile-based CMI offers an
   innovative mechanism to deliver medication information, caution should
   be exercised. Specifically, considerations for developing mobile CMI
   include consumers' digital literacy, user experience (e.g., usability),
   and the quality and accuracy of new widely used sources of information
   (e.g., crowd-sourced reviews and ratings). Recommended changes to FDA
   guidance for CMI include altering the language about scientific accuracy
   to address more novel methods of information gathering (e.g., anecdotal
   experiences and Google Consumer Surveys) and including guidance for
   usability testing of mobile health applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Parameter estimation of block and helical scan interleavers in the
   presence of bit errors}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{20-32}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In data communication and digital storage applications, interleaver,
   which rearranges the encoded data stream, follows the channel encoder to
   prevent burst errors. In general, forward error correction (FEC) codes
   provide protection against randomly distributed errors, whereas
   interleaver provides protection against error bursts. To de-interleave
   the interleaved data, accurate information about the interleaver
   parameters is required at the receiver. However, in non-cooperative
   context, the parameters are either not known or only partially known at
   the receiver. Therefore, blind/semi-blind estimation of interleaver
   parameters is mandatory at the receiver in order to successfully
   de-interleave the interleaved data. In this context, this paper proposes
   innovative algorithms for the estimation of interleaver parameters such
   as interleaver period (or size of the interleaver matrix), number of
   rows and columns of the interleaver matrix, and helical array step size
   in the presence of bit errors provided the knowledge of type of
   interleaver is known at the receiver. In addition, it has been assumed
   that the block and helical scan interleavers follow a convolutional
   encoder. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Improvement of the visibility of concealed features in artwork NIR
   reflectograms by information separation}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{140-151}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Near Infrared (NIR) reflectography, coupled to visible (VIS) one, is a
   spectrophotometric imaging technique employed to probe both the inner
   and the outer layers of artworks. NIR reflectograms may partially
   contain information pertinent to the visible spectrum (due to the poor
   pigment transparency in NIR) and this decreases their comprehensibility.
   This work presents an innovative digital processing methodology for
   accentuating information contained in the infrared reflectograms. The
   proposed method consists of inducing minor changes in pixel intensity by
   suppressing VIS information content from NIR information content. The
   method creates such enhanced NIR reflectogram by extrapolating VIS
   reflectogram to a reflectogram recorded in NIR range and by subtracting
   it from the measured values in the near infrared spectral sub-band. As
   an extrapolator we suggest a feed forward artificial neural network
   (ANN). Significant results of improved visualization are exemplified on
   reflectograms acquired with a VIS-NIR (400, 2250) nm scanning device on
   real paintings such as Madonna dei Fusi attributed to Leonardo da Vinci.
   Parameters of the method, artificial neural network and separability of
   used pigments are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: Adolescents from urban, socioeconomically
   disadvantaged communities of color encounter high rates of adverse
   childhood experiences. To address the resulting multidimensional
   problems, we developed an innovative approach, Experiential
   Participatory and Interactive Knowledge Elicitation (EPIKE), using
   remote experiential needs elicitation methods to generate design and
   content requirements for a mobile health (mHealth) psychoeducational
   intervention. Methods: At a community-based organization in a
   northeastern city, the research team developed EPIKE by incorporating
   elicitation of input on the graphics and conducting remotely recorded
   experiential meetings and iterative reviews of the design to produce an
   mHealth smartphone story application (app) prototype for the
   participants to critique. The 22 participants were 13- to 17-year-olds,
   predominantly African American and female, from underresourced
   communities. Results: The four goals of the design process were
   attained: 1) story development from participant input; 2)
   needs-elicitation that reflected the patient-centered care approach; 3)
   interactive story game creation that accommodates the participants'
   emotional and cognitive developmental needs; 4) development of a game
   that adolescents can relate to and that which matches their comfort
   levels of emotional intensity. Conclusions: The EPIKE approach can be
   used successfully to identify the needs of adolescents across the
   digital divide to inform the design and development of mHealth apps.}},

Abstract = {{We are currently in a situation of significant changes, both in regard
   to the University level, with the establishment of the European Area of
   Higher Education, leading teachers to reconsider methodologies of a
   conventional character, and in regard to non-university educational
   levels, where the progressive provision of digital classrooms is
   gradually creating a culture change in educational institutions and its
   protagonists: teachers and students. Web 2.0 tools are being used in the
   context of methodological approaches with a clear collaborative nuance.
   All of this generating that these methodologies of collaborative
   learning through ICT's, regardless of the educational level, have a
   strong presence in processes of educational innovation. The article
   presents the notion that a non-University. Faculty has in relation to
   the collaborative learning methodology, focusing on assessment and
   expectations for the development of the curriculum. We also discuss
   knowledge possessing tools and collaborative work with ICT applications.
   These concepts and knowledge have been collected through an online
   questionnaire, allowing us to discover how current expectations of ICT
   to promote this type of learning are high, even though teachers have
   insufficient training for these perceptions to become real changes in
   daily center and classroom practices.}},

Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The rapid advances in the field of computational genomics and
   bioinformatics have motivated the development of innovative engineering
   methods for data acquisition, interpretation, and analysis. With the
   help of the later methods, many processes in molecular biology can be
   modeled and further analyzed. Identification and discovery of the coding
   regions in the genomic structure using computational algorithms is a
   clear example of such processes. This work proposes a novel application
   of well-known principles and concepts from communications theory and
   digital signal processing for the detection of protein coding regions in
   prokaryotic genomes. The proposed algorithm employs a polyphase complex
   mapping scheme to provide a numerical representation of the genomic
   sequences involved in the analysis. It then utilizes concepts in
   communications theory such as correlation, the maximal ratio combining
   (MRC) algorithm, and filtering to generate a signal whose peaks and
   troughs signify coding and noncoding regions, respectively. The proposed
   algorithm is applied to several prokaryotic genome sequences. Two
   Bayesian classifiers are designed to evaluate the performance of the
   proposed algorithm. The obtained simulation results show that the
   algorithm is able to efficiently and accurately identify protein coding
   regions with sensitivity and specificity values comparable to well-known
   gene detection methods in prokaryotes such as GLIMMER and GeneMark. This
   further proves the relevance of using communications theory concepts for
   genomic sequence analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the innovative design process and production of a
   novel scorpion-based hexapod robot. The robotic scorpion was designed to
   be as reproducible, modular and adaptable as possible, being produced
   strictly using digital production techniques and off-the-shelf parts.
   These production techniques ensure that the robot and all its components
   become easy to reproduce and adapt, making it possible for everybody to
   build their own hexapod robot or optimize the robot in future work. In
   addition to our digital production, some innovative, anatomy-based
   features were integrated in the robot to solve several problems related
   to other hexapods. The use of elastics in the legs, for example, solves
   the high energy consumption of the motors and gravitational separation
   caused by the heavy weight of the hexapod. Furthermore, the scorpion
   tail is actuated by one single servomotor, simulating antagonistic
   muscles with ropes. By integrating these nature-inspired solutions, in
   combination with digitally produced parts, we improve the performance of
   a previously designed hexapod.}},

Abstract = {{Relying on Jensen and Helles' model for studying the Internet as a
   cultural forum, this study aimed to explore the extent to which
   traditional media are displaced by innovative communication practices
   within the older audience of new media. The study was based on a
   cross-European survey of 1039 Internet users aged 60 years and up.
   Results indicated that older Internet users are significantly more
   inclined to use traditional mass media than new social media and prefer
   synchronous to asynchronous mass media. This audience, however, is not
   homogeneous, as four subsegments were identified. These groups differed
   in their media repertoires, sociocultural background and leisure
   preferences. The findings suggest that despite the increasing percentage
   of older Internet users, this audience tends to adhere to familiar media
   practices, with only a minority making intense use of new practices.
   With very few cross-national differences, this tendency appears to be
   universal, suggesting overall media use traditionalism and a
   second-level digital divide among the older audience.}},

   significant RT computation capabilities are essential. A single unit of
   RT simulator has limited simulation capabilities. The most common way of
   augmenting simulation capability is using a bank of locally connected RT
   simulators. However, creating a large-sized bank of RT simulators
   involves significant financial investments and hence may not be feasible
   at all research facilities. Power and energy systems research facilities
   that use RT simulators are at diverse physical locations. In addition to
   RT simulators, research facilities around the world house an array of
   facilities with unique power, energy, and control systems for innovative
   research. To leverage these unique research facilities, geographically
   distributed RT simulation based on Wide Area Network (WAN) is required.
   Typical RT simulators perform simulations with time-steps in the order
   of milliseconds to microseconds, whereas data latency for communication
   on WAN may be as high as a few hundred milliseconds. Such communication
   latency between RT simulators may lead to inaccuracies and instabilities
   in geographically distributed RT simulations. In this paper, the effect
   of communication latency on geographically distributed RT simulation is
   discussed and analyzed. In order to reduce the effect of the
   communication latency, a Real-Time Predictor (RTP), based on linear
   curve fitting is developed and integrated into the distributed RT
   simulation environment. Two geographically distributed digital RT
   simulators are used to perform dynamic simulations of an electric power
   system with a fixed communication latency and the predictor. Empirical
   results demonstrate the effects of communication latency on the
   simulation and the performance of the RTP to improve the accuracy of
   simulations. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This theme issue has the founding ambition of landscaping data ethics as
   a new branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related
   to data (including generation, recording, curation, processing,
   dissemination, sharing and use), algorithms (including artificial
   intelligence, artificial agents, machine learning and robots) and
   corresponding practices (including responsible innovation, programming,
   hacking and professional codes), in order to formulate and support
   morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right values). Data
   ethics builds on the foundation provided by computer and information
   ethics but, at the same time, it refines the approach endorsed so far in
   this research field, by shifting the level of abstraction of ethical
   enquiries, from being information-centric to being data-centric. This
   shift brings into focus the different moral dimensions of all kinds of
   data, even data that never translate directly into information but can
   be used to support actions or generate behaviours, for example. It
   highlights the need for ethical analyses to concentrate on the content
   and nature of computational operations-the interactions among hardware,
   software and data-rather than on the variety of digital technologies
   that enable them. And it emphasizes the complexity of the ethical
   challenges posed by data science. Because of such complexity, data
   ethics should be developed from the start as a macroethics, that is, as
   an overall framework that avoids narrow, ad hoc approaches and addresses
   the ethical impact and implications of data science and its applications
   within a consistent, holistic and inclusive framework. Only as a
   macroethics will data ethics provide solutions that can maximize the
   value of data science for our societies, for all of us and for our
   environments.

Abstract = {{We discuss the governing forces for analytics, especially concerning
   citizens' behaviours and their transactions, that depend on which of
   three spheres of operation an institution is in (corporate, public
   sector/government and academic). We argue that aspirations and missions
   also differ by sphere even as digital spaces have drawn these spheres
   ever closer together. We propose that citizens' expectations and
   implicit permissions for any exploitation of their data require the
   perception of a fair balance of benefits, which should be transparent
   (accessible to citizens) and justifiable. We point out that within the
   corporate sphere most analytics does not concern identity, targeted
   marketing nor any direct interference with individual citizens; but
   instead it supports strategic decision-making, where the data are
   effectively anonymous. With the three spheres we discuss the nature of
   models deployed in analytics, including `black-box' modelling
   uncheckable by a human mind, and the need to track the provenance and
   workings or models. We also examine the recent evolution of personal
   data, where some behaviours, or tokens, identifying individuals (unique
   and yet non-random) are partially and jointly owned by other individuals
   that are themselves connected. We consider the ability of heavily and
   lightly regulated sectors to increase access or to stifle innovation. We
   also call for clear and inclusive definitions of `data science and
   analytics', avoiding the narrow claims of those in technical sub-sectors
   or sub-themes. Finally, we examine some examples of unethical and
   abusive practices. We argue for an ethical responsibility to be placed
   upon professional data scientists to avoid abuses in the future.

Abstract = {{Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement has been developed rapidly for
   bioanalysis in recent years. However, the actual application for most
   existed PEC bioanalytical systems is still a challenge because the
   perfect solutions for sensing surface design, high-throughput detection,
   and portability are lacked. To successfully overcome these limitations
   and realize accurate, continuous screening and assessing on prognostic
   indicator of early stage cancer on the spot, an innovative and portable
   semiautomated support power-free photoelectrochemical (SP-PEC)
   immunosensing platform consisted with a miniature semiautomatic
   injection system and digital multimeter (DMM) readout is designed
   (prostate specific antigen, PSA, was used as the proof-of-concept
   analyte). Decahedral BiVO4 that decorated with Au nanocrystal on \{010\}
   facets (Au-BiVO4) by photodeposition is used as the photoanode materials
   to produce photocurrent signal under irradiation of micro laser light
   (5.0 w, lambda >= 380 nm). The monoclonal anti-PSA capture antibody
   (mAb(1))-functionalized Fe3O4 magnetic nanobeads (mAb(1)-MN) and glucose
   oxidase (GOx)/monoclonal detection antibody (mAb(2))-conjugated gold
   nanoparticle (GOx-AuNP-mAb(2)) are employed as immunosensing probe and
   signal probe, respectively. The H2O2 as an excellent holes scavenger
   that in suit generated from GOx oxidization glucose substrate
   significantly amplifies the photocurrent. The variation of instantaneous
   current value that registered as the signal of the immunoassay increases
   linearly with the logarithm of target PSA concentration increasing in a
   wide range from 10 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit
   (LOD) of 4.0 pg mL(-1). The SP-PEC immunosensing platform not only
   simplifies the assay process, but also improves detecting efficiency.
   The semiautomatic and portable SP-PEC analysis device allows analysis on
   spot and high-throughput continuous detection. Additional, we also gain
   deep insight into the relations between the specific shape as well as Au

Title = {{Can digital reinvention of ecological monitoring remove barriers to its
   adoption by practitioners? A case study of deer management in Scotland}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring is one of the key tools employed to help understand the
   condition of the natural environment and inform the development of
   appropriate management actions. While international conventions
   encourage the use of standardised methods, the link between the
   information monitoring provides and local management needs is frequently
   overlooked. This problem is further exacerbated when monitoring is
   employed in areas where there are divergent interests among stakeholders
   in land use and management. Such problems are found in the management of
   wild deer across Scotland, where monitoring, in the form of habitat
   impact assessments, have been introduced as an innovation in sustainable
   deer management. However, the uptake of habitat impact assessments has
   been limited. We used deer management in Scotland as a case study to
   explore whether reinventing habitat impact assessments, and hosting the
   system on a familiar digital platform (a mobile phone) could help to
   remove perceived barriers to the implementation of assessments. Using
   the diffusion of innovations as a theoretical framework three sets of
   workshops were conducted with participants representing different
   stakeholder interests. While the proposed digital system did address
   perceived barriers to the conduct of habitat monitoring, in addition it
   revealed underlying concerns on the use and purpose of habitat
   monitoring as a tool in land management. Such concerns indicate friction
   between scientific and management perspectives, which need to be
   considered and addressed if monitoring is to become more widely
   acceptable as a tool to inform the management of natural resources. (C)

Abstract = {{Continuous ceramic fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs)
   offer an innovative damage tolerant structural material for temperature
   regimes inaccessible to high temperature metals. However, when subjected
   to application environments, these materials exhibit damage and degrade
   over time depending on the severity of those conditions. The ultimate
   strength of CMCs is dictated by the properties of the load bearing
   fibers, but matrix cracking weakens the composite and can expose the
   load bearing fibers to harsh environments. The objective of the work
   performed was to develop a methodology for linking in situ detection of
   localized damage to final failure in continuous fiber reinforced CMCs.
   Initiation and growth of matrix cracking are measured and located
   linearly along the gage length via acoustic emission (AE) detection.
   High amplitude events at relatively low static loads can be associated
   with initiation of large matrix cracks. When there is a localization of
   high amplitude events in a given area, a measurable effect on the strain
   field can be observed. Full field surface strain measurements were
   obtained using digital image correlation (DIC). An estimation of the
   matrix cracking stress as well as localized areas of initiation were
   measured in real time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A quantitative model for dermal infection and oedema in BALB/c mice
   pinna}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pharmaceutical industry demands innovation for developing
   new molecules to improve effectiveness and safety of therapeutic
   medicines. Preclinical assays are the first tests performed to evaluate
   new therapeutic molecules using animal models. Currently, there are
   several models for evaluation of treatments, for dermal oedema or
   infection. However, the most common or usual way is to induce the
   inflammation with chemical substances instead of infectious agents. On
   the other hand, this kind of models require the implementation of
   histological techniques and the interpretation of pathologies to verify
   the effectiveness of the therapy under assessment.
   This work was focused on developing a quantitative model of infection
   and oedema in mouse pinna. The infection was achieved with a strain of
   Streptococcus pyogenes that was inoculated in an injury induced at the
   auricle of BALB/c mice, the induced oedema was recorded by measuring the
   ear thickness with a digital micrometer and histopathological analysis
   was performed to verify the damage. The presence of S. pyogenes at the
   infection site was determined every day by culture.
   Results: Our results showed that S. pyogenes can infect the mouse pinna
   and that it can be recovered at least for up to 4 days from the infected
   site; we also found that S. pyogenes can induce a bigger oedema than the
   PBS-treated control for at least 7 days; our results were validated with
   an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory formulation made with
   ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone.
   Conclusions: The model we developed led us to emulate a dermal infection
   and allowed us to objectively evaluate the increase or decrease of the
   oedema by measuring the thickness of the ear pinna, and to determine the
   presence of the pathogen in the infection site. We consider that the
   model could be useful for assessment of new anti-inflammatory or
   antibacterial therapies for dermal infections.}},

Abstract = {{Industry is the backbone of the European economy-producing 80\% of
   Europe's exports, accounting for 80\% of private Research, Technology
   Development and Innovation (RTDI) expenditures, and providing more than
   30 million jobs with additional 70 million in related sectors. Thus, the
   manufacturing sector plays a vital role in fostering economic growth and
   social welfare across Europe, and it has the potential to provide
   innovative solutions for the grand societal challenges. However,
   European Industry's share of added value has substantially decreased
   during the last decades. Against this backdrop, the European ManuFuture
   platform was created in 2003 to provide visions, scenarios as well as
   RTDI strategies and roadmaps for the re-industrialization of Europe.
   This article recapitulates the successful Vision 2020 generation and
   implementation process of the ManuFuture community. Based on a systemic
   assessment of the multi-actor, multi-governance-level and multi-sector
   policy approach, success factors are elaborated as guiding principles
   and framework for the upcoming Vision 2030 process. With reference to
   currently discussed issues in the European Research and Innovation area
   such as digitising industry and circular economy, this article concludes
   with some options to pursue the ``ManuFuture Road{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Many innovative experiments are designed to answer research questions
   about hip biomechanics, however many fail to define a coordinate system.
   This makes comparisons between studies unreliable and is an unnecessary
   hurdle in extrapolating experimental results to clinical reality. The
   aim of this study was to present a specimen mounting protocol which
   aligns and registers hip specimens in the International Society of
   Biomechanics (ISB) coordinate system, which is defined by bony landmarks
   that are identified by palpation of the patient's body. This would
   enable direct comparison between experimental testing and clinical gait
   analysis or radiographic studies. To represent the intact hip, four
   intact synthetic full-pelves with 8 full-length articulating femora were
   assembled and digitised to define the ISB coordinate system. Using our
   proposed protocol, pelvis specimens were bisected into left and right
   hemi-pelves and femora transected at the mid-shaft, and then mounted in
   bone pots to represent a typical experimental setup. Anatomical
   landmarks were re-digitised relative to mechanical features of the bone
   pots and the misalignment was calculated. The mean misalignment was
   found to be less than 1.5 degrees flexion/extension, ab/adduction and
   internal/external rotation for both the pelves and femora; this equates
   to less than 2.5\% of a normal range of hip motion. The proposed
   specimen mounting protocol provides a simple method to align in vitro
   hip specimens in the ISB coordinate system which enables improved
   comparison between laboratory testing and clinical studies. Engineering
   drawings are provided to allow others to replicate the simple fixtures
   used in the protocol. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Specific inhibition of histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) has been suggested
   as a promising option for the treatment of neuroblastoma and T-cell
   malignancies. A novel class of highly potent and selective HDAC8
   inhibitors with a pyrimido{[}1,2-c] {[}1,3] benzothiazin-6-imine
   scaffold was studied that is completely different from the traditional
   concept of HDAC inhibitors comprising a zinc binding group (ZBG), in
   most cases a hydroxamate group, a spacer, and a capping group that may
   interact with the surface of the target protein. Although lacking a ZBG,
   some of the new compounds were shown to have out-standing potency
   against HDAC8 in the single-digit nanomolar range. The
   pyrimido{[}1,2-c]{[}1,3] benzothiazin-6-imines also inhibited the growth
   of solid and hematological tumor cells. The small size and beneficial
   physicochemical properties of the novel HDAC inhibitor class underline
   the high degree of drug likeness. This and the broad structure-activity
   relationship suggest great potential for the further development of
   compounds with the pyrimido{[}1,2-c]{[}1,3] benzothiazin-6-imine
   scaffold into innovative and highly effective therapeutic drugs against
   cancer.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The financial industry has been strongly influenced by digitalization in
   the past few years reflected by the emergence of ``FinTech,{''} which
   represents the marriage of ``finance{''} and ``information
   technology.{''} FinTech provides opportunities for the creation of new
   services and business models and poses challenges to traditional
   financial service providers. Therefore, FinTech has become a subject of
   debate among practitioners, investors, and researchers and is highly
   visible in the popular media. In this study, we unveil the drivers
   motivating the FinTech phenomenon perceived by the English and German
   popular press including the subjects discussed in the context of
   FinTech. This study is the first one to reflect the media perspective on
   the FinTech phenomenon in the research. In doing so, we extend the
   growing knowledge on FinTech and contribute to a common understanding in
   the financial and digital innovation literature. These study contributes
   to research in the areas of information systems, finance and
   interdisciplinary social sciences. Moreover, it brings value to
   practitioners (entrepreneurs, investors, regulators, etc.), who explore
   the field of FinTech.}},

Abstract = {{Established inbound tour operators (ITOs) are being challenged by
   emerging competitors that have embraced technology-enabled innovations,
   including aspects that are associated with the collaborative or sharing
   economy. A variety of suppliers across the supply chain are now able to
   form a direct connection with customers through platform websites,
   thereby providing tech-savvy tourists with the capacity to create
   customized trips. Incumbent ITOs are now competing with emerging
   entrants that are responsive to customer needs because of their digital
   expertise. As the various provider categories have become less clear and
   as barriers to entry have fallen, tour service suppliers must consider
   the contemporary tourism `` ecosystem'' when formulating strategies. In
   the face of declining consumer demand for standardized tour products,
   there is an urgent need to consider changing tourist habits or tastes
   when introducing new in-destination options. In exploring the evolving
   features of the inbound tourism ecosystem, this paper draws upon the
   recent literature to focus on the distinguishing characteristics of
   innovative tour service and experiences. It identifies how tour
   suppliers respond to competitor actions, or embrace these features
   themselves. The authors adopt a multiple case study approach and
   assemble evidence from 17 examples of tourism start-ups in Taiwan. The
   paper concludes with implications for practitioners and suggestions for
   future research.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper wishes to investigate the perspective of Digital
   Natives (DNs), described in literature as ``informal experts'', in
   respect of digital strategies' implementation of destination management
   organizations (DMOs). In particular, focus groups of students and
   workers in the tourism field were asked to browse and discuss the
   website and social media presence of an Italian regional DMO (i.e.
   PromoTurismoFVG). Comments were collected and analyzed with the
   GABEK/Winrelan method for qualitative analysis. Results confirmed the
   DMO's adoption of a digital format but with limited social and
   consumer-generated-contents (CGC). DNs recognized the implementation of
   a Web 2.0 destination site in a rather traditional marketing mix
   strategy. Furthermore DMO websites and social media (SM) (i.e.,
   Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube) content analysis showed that
   the DMO lacks products and offers for the young market segment. The
   combination of limited social content and the weak attention to youth
   market makes the current digital DMO not attractive enough to the
   digital natives. The work highlights the importance on focusing on DN
   ``informal expertise'' in the planning and development of digital
   strategies, DMO websites and SM presence. Their proved social media
   knowledge and digital competences have to be considered as a key
   opportunity for DMOs and for the improvement of the destination
   marketing strategies. This research contributes to the academic
   discussion on SM/Web 2.0 implementation in destination management, by
   presenting an exploratory study on DNs' informal expert perspective
   supported by the use of GABEK/ Winrelan as an innovative method.}},

Abstract = {{Radio is by far the most accessible medium. With its mobility and
   availability, it attracts listeners by its simplicity and friendliness.
   The present information situation is characterized by the convergence of
   computers, mobile devices, telecommunication and broadcasting
   technologies and the divergence of different ways of delivering and
   storing media. Consumers are overwhelmed by new electronic gadgets
   appearing every year. They are astonished by new technical innovations
   that are being designed to ease their life and change their habits. Even
   the broadcasting sector itself is facing significant changes, especially
   a growing competition between the private and public sector. This
   article reviews the current status of analog and digital broadcasting
   technologies. It analyzes a case study of user expectations related with
   today's digital media, particularly radio transmission. We discuss the
   principal possibilities, limitations and user expectations related with
   digital audio broadcasting, as well as the economic, technological,
   regulatory and frequency management factors.}},

Abstract = {{Existing literature indicates that there is an urgent need both for
   second language acquisition (SLA) theory informed research in game-based
   learning (Reinders, 2012) and for vocabulary instruction research with

   settings (Spada, 2005). Under the framework of motivational dynamics in
   language learning (Waninge, de Bot, \& Dornyei, 2014) and designing a
   course as a multiplayer classroom (Sheldon, 2012), the researcher
   investigated an innovative pedagogy in a college level beginners Chinese
   course by using Quizlet(1), a web 2.0 flashcards website. The results
   demonstrate that vocabulary game competitions promote engaging
   vocabulary learning. The research proven pedagogy draws attention to
   strategies in tutorial CALL vocabulary instruction research and praxis
   for motivation and learning in an intact classroom. The findings shed

Title = {{Colaborative economy: a new market for the social economy}},
Journal = {{CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{This article is aimed at analysing the concept of collaborative economy.
   For that purpose it is important to analyse both the activities around
   this new way of developing economic activities and the business models
   used in practice. Based on American legal doctrine and experience, this
   analysis allows to understand the concept of collaborative economy which
   serves as a basis for the European Union survey in this field, e.g. the
   A European agenda for the collaborative economy drafted by the
   Commission. Furthermore, the revision of this concept enables to
   differentiate two ways of developing and implementing collaborative
   economy activities: those considered as general or traditional (despite
   it being a recent phenomenon), represented by the so-called ``platform
   capitalism{''}, and those being more innovative and respectful with the
   adjective ``collaborative{''}, used to define this new ``economy{''}.
   The latter focuses on platform cooperativism and connects collaborative
   economy with social economy.
   The article is structured into two parts. The first one comprehends the
   study of the collaborative economy phenomenon. The second part explores
   the relationship between the social and collaborative economy, focusing
   on the role of the cooperative society as the owner of digital
   platforms.
   Collaborative economy exists because of the possibility of connecting
   people and/or assets through Internet. The digital technology has
   facilitated the access to those tangible and intangible assets which
   remained unused. Digital platforms have built up the required trust to
   describe the collaborative economy as open, inclusive and global.
   The core activities of the collaborative economy are: collaborative
   consumption, which provides access to goods and / or services;
   collaborative production, in which groups, networks or individuals
   collaborate to design, produce or distribute goods; collaborative
   learning, open to any subject whith resources and knowledge shared to
   learn together; and collaborative finance, where loan or investment
   services are provided outside traditional financial institutions. New
   mechanisms for collaborative governance have recently also been
   included. Not to be confused with, different business models arisen out
   of this new way of organising economy. In our opinion, the business
   model will be determined by the type of activity performed by the
   platform regarding the provision of goods or services. Thus, the
   platform can act as a digital intermediary which connects suppliers and
   providers with users and facilitates their transactions. However, the
   platform can also act as a supplier of either the main product or
   service or supporting products or services. Only case-study will
   determine the business model and the legal framework which is
   applicable.
   The European Commission defines collaborative economy models as
   ``business models where collaborative platforms facilitate activities
   creating an open marketplace for the temporary usage of goods or
   services often provided by private individuals{''}. These business
   models involve service providers either sharing assets, resources, time
   and / or skills and who may be either private individuals offering
   services on an occasional basis ({''}peers{''}) or acting on a
   professional basis ({''}professional service providers{''}); the users
   of those services; and the intermediaries which connect providers with
   users and facilitate the transactions between them through an online
   platform ({''}collaborative platforms{''}).
   The way in which public opinion perceives the collaborative economy
   varies significantly. Many studies suggest that the collaborative
   economy does not have anything to do with the adjective
   ``collaborative{''} since platforms do not share, neither the property,
   nor the benefits with the users, those who really generate value within
   them. As a consequence of this, a new movement has emerged aimed at
   returning to the roots of collaboration and creating platforms in which
   ownership, profit and responsibility are truly distributed: this is the
   case of the platform cooperativism.
   American authors were the pioneers in surveying the relationship between
   co-operatives and collaborative economy. They concluded that the
   platforms owned by those who have really generated their value allow for
   a fairer distribution of the added value, create solidarity links among
   workers, and fights against the on-demand jobs. The debate is currently
   focused on how to turn collaborative economy companies into
   cooperatives, meaningless transformation as many examples of cooperative
   platforms set up by cooperatives have been encountered.
   The link between Cooperatives and the collaborative economy has also
   been underlined in some documents of the European Institutions. However,
   some issues such as the benefits of their interaction, or the use of the
   cooperative social form to avoid the risks of collaborative economy are
   issues which have not been explored yet. These options have been
   analyzed in two recent studies carried out by private entities. The
   first one, promoted by the Unipolis Foundation and Legacoop, analyses
   the convergence between cooperatives and the collaborative economy in
   Italy. The second study has been promoted by Cooperatives Europe and
   analyses a similar issue at a European level.
   The added value in cooperative platforms is generated by both, the
   members-suppliers and the members-users. Their effort is to be rewarded
   through cooperative returns. The cooperative platform faces the same
   problems as any other cooperative, especially in terms of funding.
   Although, the cooperative philosophy is an advantage, as it contributes
   to turn collaborative economy into something truly collaborative for
   suppliers and users.
   From a methodological approach, the most relevant legal doctrine on
   collaborative economy (mostly US-produced) has been reviewed, as well as
   the working documents and initiatives of the European Institutions.
   Particular attention has been given to the studies analysing the
   relationship between the collaborative economy and the social economy.
   The article offers, as a result, a consistent description of this new
   reality and the opening towards a new field of study with a focus on the
   cooperative.
   From a legal approach, collaborative economy cannot be analysed as a
   whole. It involves many aspects and affects different sectors of the
   legal framework of each State. The study of the economic and legal
   issues included in the concept of ``sharing economy{''} in the United
   States has helped to detect convergencies and differences with the
   economic and legal situation of the collaborative economy in Europe. As
   a consequence of this research it can be concluded that European States
   show a higher level of legal certainty and a better protection of the
   rights of users and providers/suppliers of goods and services. Moreover,
   the most recent studies on the links between the collaborative economy
   and the social economy have been carried out within the European
   framework, influenced by American research. All these studies have shown
   interesting examples of cooperatives owners of collaborative platforms.
   The main results of this research can be summarized as follows: the
   analysis of the different denominations of the collaborative economy and
   the different business models involved, the European approach to this
   new economy and the difference between organising collaborative economy
   in a capitalist or a cooperative way. The European agenda for the
   collaborative economy, launched by the European Commission in June 2016,
   shows that the collaborative economy and its agents have a secure
   regulatory framework in several European Directives, which contrasts
   with the general absence of regulation evidenced in the United States.
   Nonetheless, Europe and USA need to make some progress on fiscal and
   labour matters. These advances are intended to avoid situations of
   unfair competition between traditional businesses and the collaborative
   economy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a two -spiral action research approach (AR) in its
   analysis of the experience of a British University endeavouring to
   change and reposition itself in the context of fast pace external change
   in terms of innovation. Taking the European Union (EU) 2020 digital
   competence framework (Ferrari 2013), with its drive to address the huge
   EU digital skills gap as technological adaptation and use speed up and
   the call from the UK Government, employers, and students themselves to
   produce digitally competent graduates Higher Institutions need to
   consider their proposition. An action research approach, with its
   reflective stance, is relevant for complex and policy based studies, we
   argue, as the framework can encompass mixed methods techniques. Informed
   in conjunction with a `Panel of Experts', thought -leaders drawn from
   industry and academia, and incorporating a strong student voice, we
   believe the AR approach is key to offering insights and transparency in
   the quest for change. The transition from an initial top-down management
   approach to a kaleidoscopic middle-out partnership of the executive team
   with key internal stakeholders, including students, academic staff,
   librarians, learning technologists and IT specialists offers a new and
   inclusive approach offering the agility and the synergy that traditional
   models lack. Results indicate that strong research and technological
   leadership, building internal alliances with key stakeholders, focusing
   on the `middle out' and a partnership approach to working with the
   Students Union all contribute to a transformational and shared approach
   to institution-wide change at a time of complexity and contestation in
   Higher Education policy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the research design, methodology and methods
   employed in research conducted in the context of Higher Education
   Institutions (HEIs) and focuses on the Heads of e-Learning (HeLs)
   perspective about Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) by campus-based UK
   institutions. This paper aims to expand on the research design and the
   research methodology that was followed as part of this research, making
   a justified argument for mixed methods approaches in e-learning
   contexts. The background of this research and its research questions is
   outlined first to provide the context of this research. Following a
   review of the literature on TEL that informed this research, this paper
   provides an explanation of the researcher's worldview before discussing
   the chosen research design. The status of the findings and their
   generalisability based on the chosen methodology are then discussed. The
   research findings show that most universities represented in the survey
   offered various staff development opportunities to their academic staff
   in the effective use of TEL and that examples of innovative use of
   technology are evident in some areas in all participating institutions.
   Staff's digital skills and competencies coupled with a pedagogical
   underpinning as well as a supportive institutional culture were found to
   be the enablers for the effective implementation of TEL, according to
   the HeLs' expert informed responses. The paper is summarised and
   concluded making a case for the adoption of Mixed Methods Research (MMR)
   in e-learning settings.}},

Abstract = {{As an experienced face-to-face teacher, working in a small Crown
   Dependency with no Higher Education Institute (HEI) to call its own, the
   subsequent geographical and professional isolation in the context of
   Networked Learning (NL), as a sub-set of eLearning, calls for innovative
   ways in which to develop self-reliant methods of professional
   development. Jones and De Laat (2016, p.43) claim that NL is different
   from other eLearning sub-sets, for example, Technology Enhanced Learning
   (TEL) and Computer-Supported-Collaborative-Learning(CSCL) because of its
   ``focus on pedagogy and understanding how social relationships (and
   networked practices) influence learning rather than having a
   predominantly technical agenda for change in education{''}. NL, rather
   than TEL or CSL, therefore, locates the context for this paper. My
   intent was to develop a bespoke professional development framework to
   facilitate independent and self-directed NL teaching development. To
   scaffold my professional development autonetnography (ANG) was chosen to
   facilitate my learning. The concept of ANG was introduced by Kozinets
   Kedzior (2009) as an autobiographical extension to the ethnographic
   genre Netnography defined by Kozinets (2006) as an interpretive research
   methodology to examine online observations and interactions. Whilst
   recent researchers of digital learning claim that has potential to add
   to a growing body of knowledge that accepts the post-modern use of self
   as an insider researcher (Ferreira, 2012; Persdotter, 2013; Mkono,
   Ruhanen Markwell, 2015) none have explained how to undertake ANG. There
   appears here, to be a theory practice gap (Kessels and Korthagen, 1996)
   and the problem lies within the argument that there is no current theory
   upon which to practice ANG. This opportunity to examine more closely the
   subjective and reflexive insider researcher perspective of being an
   online scholar (as a learner or teacher) would respond to this gap in
   current eResearch knowledge. This paper uses meta-ethnography (Noblit
   Hare, 1988) as a method to systematically examine methodology relating
   to autoethnography, with the purpose of working towards developing a
   framework for undertaking ANG as an emerging eResearch methodology.
   Seven phases of meta-ethnography formed the method for synthesising
   autoethnographic methodological data and translating these into ANG
   methodological data. Findings from this synthesis are reported through
   the autoethnographic tripartite scheme of mimesis, poiesis and kinesis
   (Holman-Jones, Adams, Ellis, 2013a). From this synthesis, the
   autonetnographic ``1{''} framework was developed and forms a
   methodological basis for future ANG studies to examine teaching and/or
   learning scholarship in NL and the potential for considering adaptation
   of ANG for use in eLearning more generally.}},

Abstract = {{Rich Internet Applications that enable new ways of interaction with
   digital objects within multimedia scenes become important for
   educational communities. Such new ways of advanced human-computer
   interaction, in its different forms match the needs of formal education
   as well as lifelong learning in medicine, architecture, construction or
   cultural heritage management. This paper presents innovative multimedia
   annotation methods based on advanced human-computer interaction and (a)
   synchronous interpersonal collaboration features, focusing on e-learning
   activities. They have been implemented within eRAF (External Resource
   Annotation Framework) with the scope of going beyond the existing
   solutions by introducing new annotation types using external resources.
   Thus, anyone can easily annotate the own resources with additional
   information such as real-time handwriting, text and animation, or even
   audio/video sequences stored into public data repositories, or recorded
   adhoc, in order to create value-added interactive content.}},

Title = {{Ureterorenoscopy: current technology and future outlook}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to evaluate the current technology and designs
   of flexible ureterorenoscopes. We will review contemporary fiberoptic
   and digital ureteroscopes, including a discussion on ureteroscope damage
   and repair, and lastly present the projected future of flexible
   ureterorenoscopy. Ureterorenoscopy has evolved dramatically over the
   past several decades, which has led to landscape reshaping of stone
   disease treatment and upper tract pathology. Advancements in tip
   control, miniaturization of scopes, introduction of a digital chip on
   the tip, disposable devices to augment surgery, surgical
   experience/familiarity and most recently single use scopes are all
   independent factors that have increased flexible ureterorenoscopy
   adoption and success. We therefore detail the aforementioned and provide
   a view of future innovations. A review of literature from 1980 to 2016
   was performed by the two authors focusing on literature that details
   flexible ureterorenoscopy. Technology has significantly impacted the
   minimally invasive endourologic management of the urinary system. This
   review summarizes current literature on advances and modern technical
   achievements. We include a focus on new perspectives and future outlook
   in the field of managing upper urinary tract pathology with modern
   technologies. The advancements in flexible ureterorenoscopy are
   impressive and yet the challenges of this technology are equally
   daunting. Obstacles to overcome include improving durability, decreasing
   cost, further miniaturizing scopes size, and determining the role of
   single use scopes. Ongoing developments in other technology fields (such
   as virtual 3D imaging, wireless capsular endoscopy, robotics) continue
   to create both opportunities to improve the procedure but also threaten
   to replace ureterorenoscopy over time. This is an exciting time because
   of past achievements and future innovations in ureterorenoscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers are vulnerable to
   the threats of unintentional interference generated by other
   communication systems and intentional interference known also as
   jamming. In particular, the intentional transmission of Radio Frequency
   (RF) interference with the goal of disrupting one or more of the
   received GNSS frequency bands can disrupt the operation of GNSS
   receivers over a wide target area. This paper provides a comparison
   between two interference mitigation techniques at the digital signal
   processing level. The traditional adaptive notch filtering has been
   compared with a more innovative technique based on the use of the
   Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD). Using simulated GNSS jammed
   scenarios and a software-defined GNSS receiver, results indicate the
   benefits of WPD relative to notch filtering. Further tests using love
   interference signals, and both a software and commercial hardware
   receiver, demonstrate the benefits of WPD in terms of signal quality and
   position domain metrics. Copyright (C) 2017 Institute of Navigation.}},

Abstract = {{A new form of practice is developing in which cultural organisations are
   transformed from white cubes to hubs for social action and learning.
   Focus extends from the showing of art to its creation, and the
   empowerment and agency of communities through enactive learning. In this
   model the arts organisation acts as a catalyst for collaborative action
   and enquiry involving academia and a wider ecosystem of communities and
   stakeholders including the public, artists, digital creative industry,
   maker spaces and local government. The new model entails embedding of
   research, innovation and arts practice within the arts organisation
   itself. We illustrate the approach with examples of projects spanning
   mental health, physical disability, young people, veterans, children and
   parents, which have had a real impact on health and well-being of our

Abstract = {{Big Data is having a huge impact on journalism and communication
   studies. At the same time, it has raised a plethora of social concerns
   ranging from mass surveillance to the legitimization of prejudices such
   as racism. This article develops an agenda for critical Big Data
   research. It discusses what the purpose of such research should be, what
   pitfalls it should guard against, and the possibility of adapting Big
   Data methods to conduct empirical research from a critical standpoint.
   Such a research program will not only enable critical scholarship to
   meaningfully challenge Big Data as a hegemonic tool, but will also make
   it possible for scholars to draw upon Big Data resources to address a
   range of social issues in previously impossible ways. The article calls
   for methodological innovation in combining emerging Big Data techniques
   with critical/qualitative methods of research, such as ethnography and
   discourse analysis, in ways that allow them to complement each other.}},

   countries: a scoping review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH}},

Abstract = {{Background Poor governance impedes the provision of equitable and
   cost-effective health care in many low-and middle-income countries
   (LMICs). Although systemic problems such as corruption and inefficiency
   have been characterized as intractable, ``good governance{''}
   interventions that promote transparency, accountability and public
   participation have yielded encouraging results. Mobile phones and other
   Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are beginning to play
   a role in these interventions, but little is known about their use and
   effects in the context of LMIC health care.
   Methods Multi-stage scoping review: Research questions and scope were
   refined through a landscape scan of relevant implementation activities
   and by analyzing related concepts in the literature. Relevant studies
   were identified through iterative Internet searches (Google, Google
   Scholar), a systematic search of academic databases (PubMed, Web of
   Science), social media crowdsourcing (targeted LinkedIn and Twitter
   appeals) and reading reference lists and websites of relevant
   organizations. Parallel expert interviews helped to verify concepts and
   emerging findings and identified additional studies for inclusion.
   Results were charted, analyzed thematically and summarized.
   Results We identified 34 articles from a wide range of disciplines and
   sectors, including 17 published research articles and 17 grey literature
   reports. Analysis of these articles revealed 15 distinct ways of using
   ICTs for good governance activities in LMIC health care. These use cases
   clustered into four conceptual categories: 1) gathering and verifying
   information on services to improve transparency and audit-ability 2)
   aggregating and visualizing data to aid communication and decision
   making 3) mobilizing citizens in reporting poor practices to improve
   accountability and quality and 4) automating and auditing processes to
   prevent fraud. Despite a considerable amount of implementation activity,
   we identified little formal evaluative research.
   Conclusion Innovative digital approaches are increasingly being used to
   facilitate good governance in the health sectors of LMICs but evidence
   of their effectiveness is still limited. More empirical studies are
   needed to measure concrete impacts, document mechanisms of action, and
   elucidate the political and sociotechnical dynamics that make designing
   and implementing ICTs for good governance so complex. Many digital good
   governance interventions are driven by an assumption that transparency
   alone will effect change; however responsive feedback mechanisms are
   also likely to be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The role and usage of a certain technology is not imparted wholesale on
   the intended user community-technology is not deterministic. Rather, a
   negotiation between users and the designers of the technology will
   result in its particular form and function. This article considers a
   side effect of these negotiations. When a certain known technology is
   used to convey a new technological concept or model, there is a risk
   that the paradigm associated by the users with the known technology will
   eclipse the new model and its affordances in part or in whole. The
   article presents a case study of this ` paradigmatic regression'
   centering on a transcription tool of the Huygens Institute in the
   Netherlands. It is argued that similar effects also come into play at a
   larger scale within the field of textual scholarship, inhibiting the
   exploration of the affordances of new models that do not adhere to the
   pervasive digital metaphor of the codex. An example of such an
   innovative model, the knowledge graph model, is briefly introduced to
   illustrate the point.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of open innovation and peer production, powered by 3D
   printing technology, is transforming traditional manufacturing methods
   towards a ``third industrial revolution{''}. The purpose of this
   research is to provide empirical evidence for an integrated approach,
   based on collaborative product development and peer production, combined
   with 3D printing, to deliver more sustainable, yet competitive,
   marketable products. In particular, this experimental study is conducted
   in the context of mobile forensics, an emerging market where limited
   expensive products exist and alternative solutions are needed. The
   technical viability and economic feasibility of the prototype developed
   in this research validate the proposed integrated approach, which could
   be a game-changer in the field of mobile forensics, as well as in other
   sectors. The sustainability improvements with this approach are a
   reduction of the total cost, thereby making it affordable for lower
   income users, and a decrease in energy consumption and pollutant
   emissions. The validated integrated approach offers start-up
   opportunities to develop and deliver more sustainable, marketable
   products, towards the paradigm of Open Sustainable Innovation. While the
   device developed and tested in this research has similar features to
   existing products, the methodology, implementation, and motivation are
   original.}},

Abstract = {{This article will consider the roles played by the new digital
   technologies in the processes of visual repatriation,
   refunctionalization, interpretation and production, and how these have
   influenced the designing and making of an anthropological photographic
   project in Central India that was developed in dialogue with an extant
   ethnographic archive. The question of the extent to which our
   representations of the Other are framed within, and contribute to
   re-producing, differences in power between the representer and those
   represented will be addressed, along with that of what our
   representations of the Other can tell us about how `legitimate
   knowledges' are produced. These discussions draw me into a consideration
   of the ethical and pragmatic issues emerging from using and distributing
   vintage and contemporary images in field locations - and to present some
   innovative approaches to this matter through what I will call a `talking
   archive'.}},

   Romanian Seventh-Day Adventist pastors in their ministry. What is the
   acceptance of Web 2.0 services for neo-Protestant pastors of the
   Seventh-Day Adventist Church (SDAC), what uses of these technologies
   they make in their work, what is their mobilization for the
   appropriation of an innovative culture in the daily pastoral work, how
   these uses allow them to manage their religious activity, these are the
   main questions of a survey we conducted in 2016 to shed light on uses of
   digital technologies by Romanian Seventh-Day Adventist pastors.}},

Abstract = {{A major aim of evolutionary biology is to explain the respective roles
   of adaptive versus non-adaptive changes in the evolution of complexity.
   While selection is certainly responsible for the spread and maintenance
   of complex phenotypes, this does not automatically imply that strong
   selection enhances the chance for the emergence of novel traits, that
   is, the origination of complexity. Population size is one parameter that
   alters the relative importance of adaptive and non-adaptive processes:
   as population size decreases, selection weakens and genetic drift grows
   in importance. Because of this relationship, many theories invoke a role
   for population size in the evolution of complexity. Such theories are
   difficult to test empirically because of the time required for the
   evolution of complexity in biological populations. Here, we used digital
   experimental evolution to test whether large or small asexual
   populations tend to evolve greater complexity. We find that both small
   and large D but not intermediate-sized D populations are favored to
   evolve larger genomes, which provides the opportunity for subsequent
   increases in phenotypic complexity. However, small and large populations
   followed different evolutionary paths towards these novel traits. Small
   populations evolved larger genomes by fixing slightly deleterious
   insertions, while large populations fixed rare beneficial insertions
   that increased genome size. These results demonstrate that genetic drift
   can lead to the evolution of complexity in small populations and that
   purifying selection is not powerful enough to prevent the evolution of
   complexity in large populations.}},

Abstract = {{Context-aware mobile learning (CAML) possesses the characteristics of
   digitalization and mobility, which enables it to further break up the
   restriction of the environment and make us conduct learning activities
   on the go and apply it to research in many areas. However, few
   researchers discussed the application of mobile learning to Chinese
   writing rhetoric. Therefore, this study developed a CAML that provides
   teachers with an education tool to motivate students enrolled in Chinese
   writing rhetoric courses. A quasi-experimental research design was used
   to evaluate the overall effectiveness of CAML. Mobile learning activity
   is identified as the experimental group while traditional teaching as
   the control group. The results of the experiment suggested that the
   experimental group had significant improvement for the use of the five
   rhetorical skills. Therefore, it was found that elementary school
   students had better performance in the rhetorical skill of imitation
   when conducting mobile learning essay writing under realistic
   situations. Finally, it provides an innovative opportunity for teachers
   to integrate a novel teaching methodology that challenges traditional
   educational norms.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses how the advent of trade in computer software, and
   now digital products, has challenged the application of sales law and
   consumer law. It addresses the law of three jurisdictions: the United
   Kingdom ('UK'), Australia and New Zealand. Often, applying the `goods'
   criterion in these regimes will be uncontroversial. Nevertheless, modern
   market conditions have created a need to move beyond the existing
   question of whether software constitutes `goods', and instead to ask how
   a range of different types of digital products fit into sales law and
   consumer law regimes. Many legal systems have settled the
   software-as-goods question. However, software is only one kind of
   commonly traded digital product. This article argues that other types of
   digital products - including apps, firmware, digital music and
   electronic books should be treated the same way as software by sales law
   and consumer law regimes. Recent developments in UK consumer law are
   also analysed as an innovative model for reform regarding party rights
   and obligations in the supply of digital products.}},

Abstract = {{Using advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and 3D
   technologies, scholars of the ancient world are digitally reconstructing
   entire historic landscapes. For multi-phased sites, the ability to
   isolate and interrogate complex layers of occupation offers exciting
   potential for the study of now-altered built and natural environments.
   While quantitative studies based on GIS data are common in the field of
   archaeology, this article argues that humanities-based approaches have
   equal importance. It is specifically the combination of spatial and
   temporal data that creates new access points from which to address the
   changing cultural meaning of place. Chronological reconstruction models
   allow scholars to resituate the human viewpoint into potential past
   environments, exploring aspects of experience that changed through time
   and space. Utilizing a visualization of the ancient Egyptian site of
   Saqqara, this work demonstrates how digital reconstructions of past
   landscapes address qualitative questions in innovative ways and are
   changing scholarship in archaeology.}},

Abstract = {{Digital narratives become a useful pedagogical resource for teachers
   because these narratives catch students attention and fit their
   interests, and allow the acquisition and development of diverse skills
   and competences. In language and literature pedagogy, digital narratives
   imply a methodological proposal which renews traditional approaches
   focused on the memorization of authors' biographies, masterworks,
   literary movements, and paper as the only possible medium for reading.
   For this reason, our work is focused on the study of the possibilities
   of book-trailers for literary and reading education in Kindergarten and
   K12 education, through the experience of research and innovation
   conducted with future teachers at the University of Valencia.}},

Abstract = {{Educational paradigms existing are currently being shaken by new skills,
   connected devices and digital tools, forcing education to consider the
   opportunities that technology offers and the digital competences that it
   implies. The study presented shows empirical evidences on how students
   are developing these skills in informal scenarios, spending much time on
   the Internet, while, these competences, even being recognized by
   legislation with equal importance than others, are not being developed
   by educational system in Spain. The research is applied on a sample of
   678 Primary School students and the main scope is analysing the use and
   frequency of use of ICT and its degree of integration into everyday
   activities in informal scenarios. Ex-post-facto methodologies are used
   through quantitative techniques, an ad hoc questionnaire has being
   designed as a tool for data collection. Results point to a generation of
   students who have acquired digital skills before having fully acquired
   the reading-writing skills. Data collected evidence, as well, that
   students use all kind of devices, surf the Internet, take pictures, edit
   them, download applications and search for tutorials in You Tube. Taking
   into account the results obtained the curricular inclusion of digital
   competence beyond its legal descriptive recognition is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop and test the prototype of a serious digital game
   for improving community-dwelling older adults' heart failure (HF)
   knowledge and self-management behaviors. The serious game innovatively
   incorporates evidence-based HF guidelines with contemporary game
   technology. Materials and Methods: The study included three phases:
   development of the game prototype, its usability assessment, and
   evaluation of the game's functionality. Usability testing included
   researchers' usability assessment, followed by research personnel's
   observations of participants playing the game, and participants'
   completion of a usability survey. Next, in a pretest-post-test design,
   validated instrumentsthe Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test and the
   Self Care for Heart Failure Indexwere used to measure improvement in HF
   self-management knowledge and behaviors related to HF self-maintenance,
   self-management, and self-efficacy, respectively. A postgame survey
   assessed participants' perceptions of the game. Results: During
   usability testing, with seven participants, 100\%, 100\%, and 86\% found
   the game easy to play, enjoyable, and helpful for learning about HF,
   respectively. In the subsequent functionality testing, with 19
   participants, 89\% found the game interesting, enjoyable, and easy to
   play. Playing the game resulted in a significant improvement in HF
   self-management knowledge, a nonsignificant improvement in self-reported
   behaviors related to HF self-maintenance, and no difference in HF
   self-efficacy scores. Participants with lower education level and age
   preferred games to any other medium for receiving information.
   Conclusion: It is feasible to develop a serious digital game that
   community-dwelling older adults with HF find both satisfying and
   acceptable and that can improve their self-management knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Online communities frequently create significant economic and relational
   value for community participants and beyond. It is widely accepted that
   the underlying source of such value is the collective flow of knowledge
   among community participants. We distinguish the conditions for flows of
   tacit and explicit knowledge in online communities and advance an
   unconventional theoretical conjecture: Online communities give rise to
   tacit knowledge flows between participants. The crucial condition for
   these flows is not the advent of novel, digital technology as often
   portrayed in the literature, but instead the technology's domestication
   by humanity and the sociality it affords. This conjecture holds profound
   implications for theory and research in the study of management and
   organization, as well as their relation to information technology.}},

Abstract = {{How is value created in an online community (OC) over time? We explored
   this question through a longitudinal field study of an OC in the
   healthcare arena. We found that multiple kinds of value were produced
   and changed over time as different participants engaged with the OC and
   its evolving technology in various ways. To explain our findings, we
   theorize OC value as performed through the ongoing sociomaterial
   configuring of strategies, digital platforms, and stakeholder
   engagement. We develop a process perspective to explain these dynamics
   and identify multiple different kinds of value being created by an OC
   over time: financial, epistemic, ethical, service, reputational, and
   platform. Our research points to the importance of expanding the notion
   of OC users to encompass a broader understanding of stakeholders. It
   further suggests that creating OC value increasingly requires going
   beyond a dyadic relationship between the OC and the firm to encompassing
   a more complex relationship involving a wider ecosystem of stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{Open source communities rely on the espoused premise of complete
   openness and transparency of source code and development process. Yet,
   openness and transparency at times need to be balanced out with moments
   of less open and transparent work. Through our detailed study of Linux
   Kernel development, we build a theory that explains that transparency
   and openness are nuanced and changing qualities that certain developers
   manage as they use multiple digital technologies and create, in moments
   of needs, more opaque and closed digital spaces of work. We refer to
   these spaces as digital folds. Our paper contributes to the extant
   literature by providing a process theory of how transparency and
   openness are balanced with opacity and closure in open source
   communities according to the needs of the development work; by
   conceptualizing the nature of digital folds and their role in providing
   quiet spaces of work; and, by articulating how the process of digital
   folding and unfolding is made far more possible by select elite actors'
   navigating the line between the pragmatics of coding and the accepted
   ideology of openness and transparency.}},
